johnny carson returned to television 
wednesday despite a writers strike giving a monologue of his own 
making in which he wisecracked that astrology in the white house 
finally explains the loony tunes things that have been coming out 
of washington 
the tonight show had been in reruns since shortly after the 
writers guild of america struck the film and tv industry march 7 
carson announced last week that reruns of the show would end and 
he would return to the air writing his own monologues carson who 
is not a member of the guild said at that time possibilities of 
reaching an agreement with striking writers had been exhausted 
on wednesday he said the real reason for coming back stemmed 
from the brouhaha over revelations about the influence of astrology 
in the white house 
i just could not stay away any longer from all things that are 
going on in the country i was compelled to come back carson 
said im a scorpio on the cusp you know we finally have a 
clue now as to what the hell are the loony tunes things that have 
been coming out of washington 
carson referred to revelations by former white house chief of 
staff donald regan that first lady nancy reagan regularly consulted 
an astrologer to determine the timing of president reagans 
movements 
carson said he had not been aware there was a new cabinet 
position secretary of health education and soothsaying 
he also made brief mention of the strike in both a sincere and 
joking tone 
were glad to be back as far as the writers strike were not 
going to discuss it he said i have a lot of friends who are 
writers we hope they join us soon it is not fun to come to work 
when you see your friends who youve known for many years standing 
out on a picket line 
then he quipped and its a weird picket line the writers are 
out there holding up these signs and theres nothing on them 
carson explained to outoftowners that there had been 
excitement in los angeles because of persistent rumors that 
nostradamus a 16th century astrologer forecast an earthquake for 
a city widely believed to be los angeles 
he was a flimflam man of the 16th century carson observed 
if nostradamus were alive today he would be geraldo rivera he 
said referring to the tv personality who opened al capones vault 
to great hype but found next to nothing 
carsons production company carson tonight inc was rebuffed 
in efforts to get either a waiver from the guild or reach an 
independent agreeement that would permit the writers to return to 
work

the reagan administration intends to sell 
advanced f18 fighterbombers to kuwait a deal that would make the 
tiny persian gulf state the first arab country to have them the 
washington post reported thursday 
citing unidentified sources in the defense and state 
departments the post said kuwait wants to buy 40 of the aircraft 
and the administration will notify congress soon of its intention 
to proceed with the sale 
the deal could be worth 680 million to the manufacturer 
mcdonnell douglas co said company spokesman robert j obrien 
several state department officials contacted by the associated 
press on wednesday night said they were unaware that any decision 
had been made 
one noted that assistant secretary of state richard w murphy 
had told a congessional panel tuesday that there was a request 
from kuwait to look at the possibility of selling f18s 
another source who also spoke on condition that he not be 
named said im not aware that any decision is imminent 
theres no more than the possibility of a sale he said 
adding that he was skeptical that such a decision would have been 
made so quickly 
i would doubt it very seriously he said theres 
interest but a lot of discussion needs to go on before any 
decision like that would be considered i think its awful early i 
would be very surprised if its true 
the source noted that kuwait has talked to several countries 
including france about the possibility of buying advanced aircraft 
murphy had told the congressional panel tuesday that the 
administration had alerted congress that kuwait was interested in 
the f18s and might prefer them to the less sophisticated f16s 
congress could block the sale 
the united states is selling f16s to bahrain but it hasnt 
sold f18s to any arab nation the post said 
the united states and kuwait have created an increasingly close 
security relationship since last year when the united states 
committed naval forces to protect usflagged ships traveling 
through the wartorn persian gulf 
initially 11 kuwaiti ships were reflagged under this policy 
and were given protection by the navy the united states recently 
revised its policy in the gulf announcing that it would offer help 
to other ships that were attacked by combatants in the 7yearold 
iraniraq war

here in a milehigh valley called 
paradise a religious group is building its home a retreat for 
thousands that some local people say threatens the pristine 
environment bordering yellowstone national park 
the group is the church universal and triumphant a new age 
sect that moved its headquarters in late 1986 from california to a 
12000acre ranch it had bought five years earlier in southwest 
montanas paradise valley 
with that move came 200 followers doubling the number already 
there construction plans for a selfsufficient community and the 
promise of more church members moving into a valley with a 
population of about 1000 
next door is yellowstone whose wildlife herds often migrate 
into the valley during the winter 
this is a place of international significance says hank 
rate a local resident if they do what they say they want to do 
that value is going to be diminished not only for our time but 
for all time 
rate and others fear the groups building plans and its summer 
conclaves that attract thousands will cause environmental damage in 
the valley 
some critics say theyre uncomfortable with the groups beliefs 
the church was founded 30 years ago in washington dc by mark 
prophet who said he received messages from spiritual figures of 
the past including christ buddha and pope john xxiii upon his 
death in 1973 his widow elizabeth clare prophet became the 
leader 
church members believe a human soul is continuously reincarnated 
until people realize the god within themselves they use praying or 
chanting to attempt to influence world conditions or personal 
concerns tobacco alcohol and drugs are forbidden 
ms prophet 47 says her visions suggest a war between the 
united states and the soviet union before the end of this century 
the church supports president reagans strategic defense initiative 
and a nationwide civil defense system 
we have a lot of downhome nice type of folks on this ranch 
who are just like the people that are our neighbors ms prophet 
says i dont think that all the hullaballoo thats been made in 
the press is the reality here 
critics draw comparisons between paradise valley and the tiny 
town of antelope ore taken over in the early 1980s and then 
abandoned by followers of the baghwan shree rajneesh 
church universal and triumphant bought some modular housing from 
the defunct rajneeshee community but church leaders say the 
similarities end there 
since the church bought the ranch in 1981 its leaders have hit 
the local rotary and kiwanis club circuit to calm fears that it is 
a farout religious cult bent on political control 
church vice president ed francis married to ms prophet says 
church members political persuasion generally resembles that of 
the area conservative and republican 
not everyone is reassured 
im concerned about the numbers says leonard sargent whose 
2000acre property borders the churchs royal teton ranch no 
matter what they happen to believe its still an awful lot of 
people to bring into a fragile area 
church officials counter that they chose the valley because of 
its natural beauty which they want to preserve 
the church bought the royal teton ranch in 1981 from magazine 
publisher malcolm forbes for a reported 7 million 
since then the church has purchased an additional 21500 acres 
in the paradise valley including 5200 acres of hilly prairie near 
emigrant intended for settlement by church members about 25 miles 
north of the royal teton ranch it also owns a printing shop in 
livingston that employs 100 people 
the church wont reveal its income but says it comes from 
members donations and various business ventures largely the sale 
of religious books and videotapes it also leases land to members 
the church has advertised the ranch to its members as a 
spiritual retreat offering protection from economic collapse civil 
disorder or war thousands of followers gather each summer for an 
annual conclave in a spectacular mountain valley called the heart 
of the inner retreat 
ms prophet and francis say the royal teton ranch will become a 
monastic selfsufficient community for 500 or so church members 
with the help of ranch staff church members who receive 
room board and small monthly salaries the church has installed 
an extensive irrigation system grows a wide variety of vegetables 
and grains operates a dairy and raises 2500 head of cattle and 
sheep 
members also began work in 1986 on the developments central 
complex located near the west bank of the yellowstone river 
several miles north of yellowstone park it would include housing 
for 260 a church school kitchen dining hall and recreation 
facilities 
but that work halted in november 1986 when the state prodded by 
local residents launched an environmental review 
a draft of the review completed in march said the project 
should be able to proceed without damaging wildlife water quality 
or aesthetics as long as the church takes several steps to cushion 
impact of the development the state found no threat to the 
environment that would justify denying sewage and water permits if 
the conditions were met 
following a public comment period we were overwhelmed with 
comment both for and against said steve pilcher chief of 
montanas water quality bureau the state is completing a final 
report 
the draft said the church should build a bearproof fence around 
a tree farm and vegetable fields monitor groundwater maintain 
minimum flows in three creeks crossing ranch property and postpone 
any use of a geothermal spring near the yellowstone river 
the church wants to pump water from laduke hot springs for use 
at its central complex park officials are concerned the pumping 
might affect mammoth hot springs nine miles to the south 
francis says the church is willing to accept the 
recommendations but a number of groups have suggested the state 
review is inadequate 
since the 1970s the church has occupied and later abandoned 
land in colorado idaho and california a series of steps to get 
here francis says adding that the church has no intention of 
moving again 
but critics say the church has not been forthcoming about its 
plans in the past 
basically ed francis credibility with me is zero says 
richard parks owner of an outdoor equipment shop in nearby 
gardiner and a member of the bear creek council a local 
environmental group if he told me it was thursday id check the 
calendar 
when church universal and triumphant bought the ranch francis 
said its rural nature would not be changed 
francis maintains he has been largely consistent i feel that 
a 1 percent use of property in this area for anything other than 
open space and wildlife is appropriate and not something that 
should cause a lot of alarm 
parks says the church changes the ambience of the whole 
area bringing the impact of a development but no direct economic 
benefits 
francis contends that whats really bothering the critics is 
simpler they just dont want others to have a piece of their 
paradise

habib bourguibas statue still dominates a 
square in central tunis but the man who towered over tunisia for 
32 years has slipped into oblivion six months after his ouster 
his successor as president zine el abidine ben ali has 
proclaimed a new era for the north african nation appealing to 
the nations islamic and arabic heritage a stand that has won him 
immediate widespread support 
bourguiba who had set the nation on a western course after he 
won independence from france in 1956 now is 84 years old and 
confined to a chateau outside tunis he was declared no longer 
capable of governing when he was removed from office nov 7 
ben ali took power during a tense crackdown on islamic 
fundamentalists and is universally credited even by political 
opponents with sparing the nation from a more serious upheaval 
he has sought to make peace with the islamic fundamentalists and 
others in the bourguiba opposition 
newspapers once banned by bourguiba are back on newsstands many 
people say they no longer fear the police tunis university 
disrupted three days a week last year by demonstrations is quiet 
about 5000 prisoners many of them members of an outlawed 
islamic fundamentalist group have been pardoned 
the national legislature dominated by bourguibas ruling party 
since tunisias independence in 1956 has moved toward pluralism 
with a new law on political parties 
in his most risky move however ben ali has extended a hand to 
the growing islamic fundamentalist movement bourguibas chief 
target in his waning years 
television and radio now broadcast the five daily calls to 
islamic prayer 
islam has alway been the official state religion but bourguiba 
maintained a secular character in government and daily life 
ben ali a military man once in charge of the crackdown on 
fundamentalists invokes allah god at the start of his speeches 
its life thats changed not just politics said chakib 
douss a brassware merchant in the tunis bazaar now everyone is 
free we feel it every day every minute its not something you 
read about in the newspaper its something you touch 
many in the opposition approved of the new climate if only for 
now 
incontestably nov 7 was a comfort to everyone said a 
leading member of the socialist democrat movement the largest 
opposition party speaking on condition of anonymity 
its still the honeymoon so everyone feels obliged to 
publicly approve him commented mhamed jaibi editorinchief of 
the weekly maghreb reopened in september after being shut down 
four years ago 
i hope this is a temporary situation he said of ben alis 
popularity otherwise well be back in the old system with a 
president who thinks he is infallible 
that was an allusion as well to bourguiba who had become so 
dominant that he was declared presidentforlife a benign dictator 
in charge of a nominal democracy his destourian socialist party 
controlled all seats in the national assembly none of the three 
legal opposition parties had a meaningful voice 
but ben ali has promised that his new era would open the 
horizons to a truly democratic and evolved political life 
since taking office he has moved to abolish the lifelong 
presidency change the electoral code and press laws dismantle the 
feared state security court and given amnesty international the 
londonbased human rights group a permit to operate here its 
first in the arab world 
ben ali has also restored diplomatic relations with neighboring 
libya and stresses closer ties with the arab world 
while citizens appear won over by the changes some opposition 
politicians remain cautious and fundamentalists are reserving full 
judgment 
the final year of bourguibas leadership was marked by a battle 
against the fundamentalist islamic tendency movement culminating 
in a trial in september of 90 fundamentalists on charges of 
plotting against the state 
the islamic dossier remains the hottest one on ben alis 
desk said hassen ghodhbani an islamic lawyer who defended some 
of the 90 in the trial 
he contended the measures taken by ben ali remain insufficient 
islam isnt just prayer and pilgrimage its an entire life 
system he said 
in late april the legislature quashed any hopes that the 
islamic tendency movement might become a legal opposition party 
one of its demands a new law allowed new political parties but 
forbade those based on religion language race or region 
the government has adopted a double attitude toward islam 
said the opposition politician who spoke anonymously 
it is a position both clever and dangerous

south koreas shipbuilding orders 
decreased more than 40 percent so far this year from the same 
period in 1987 because of a rapid appreciation in the countrys 
currency industry officials said today 
orders received so far consist of 626300 gross tons of export 
ships and 800 gross tons of domestic ships the officials said 
but they added that despite the sluggish orders local 
shipmakers still have a combined outstanding order of 6 million 
tons enough to keep them busy until the first half of next year 
the value of the south korean won has risen 743 percent against 
the us dollar so far this year a higher won makes south korean 
exports more expensive abroad while lowering the prices of foreign 
imports

argentina will take part in naval 
exercises with the united states for the first time since the 1982 
falklands war 
raul alconada sempe secretary of foreign affairs said on

with united states and several of the latin countries that once 
took part in operation unitas 
argentina quit the unitas war games after the falklands conflict 
to protest what it said was us assistance to britain the 74day 
war over the islands argentina calls the malvinas killed 712 
argentine and 256 british soldiers

the informer a new ballet choreographed by 
agnes de mille for american ballet theater is a gripping antiwar 
work certain to become a favorite of audiences for years to come 
its a strong ballet crisp clear and deeply felt with light 
moments and ominous ones danced against sets with glowering gray 
skies based on the 1935 movie about strife in ireland between 1916 
and 1921 it is set to celtic songs and every wave of the hand 
flip or sweep of a scarf and every jiglike jump is identifiably 
irish 
the new york premiere tuesday at the metropolitan opera house 
was danced with muscular eloquence victor barbee danced the 
wounded veteran johan renvall the young fighter and redhaired 
kathleen moore the girl a corps de ballet of 20 as dubliners 
danced superbly 
miss de mille had mary beth griffith as irish stepdancing 
consultant the choreographer used the timing of quick irish dance 
steps as well as the way feet turn and legs cross each other 
the story is crystal clear almost all of it in dance with very 
little relying on mime the young fighter whose steps are 
carefree likes the girl and other girls she likes him but when 
he leaves with somebody else she flirts with the veteran who holds 
one gloved hand presumably artificial close to his waist the 
veteran is selfconscious has intense feeling for the girl he 
lifts her with one hand and is jealous so he points out the 
young fighter to unseen english soldiers 
women mourn the young fighter heads thrown back then down 
mouths silently screaming in one enormously effective scene the 
veteran is alone as dawn comes revealing silhouettes of men hanged 
by the english the veteran tries to strut but is stiff unable to 
free his body from his realization of what he did 
in the next scene the girl finds consolation dancing with the 
veteran but he confesses to her and she runs in horror to her 
friends they shun her at first but take her into their measured 
line dancing when the veteran arrives there is a long silence 
before two men walk him into the wings 
at the end of the halfhour dance tuesday miss de mille who 
suffered a stroke in 1975 walked on stage arm in arm with company 
artistic director mikhail baryshnikov the audience which had 
watched the ballet in rapt silence stood to applaud and bravos 
rang out 
the informer was premiered in los angeles in march

a japanese monkey on the loose for 10 
months in southern indiana is feasting on bananas peanut butter 
and cat food this week while authorities try to figure out how to 
capture the wily fugitive 
hes been here twice today so far said janice rodgers who 
spotted the japanese macaque last week and began feeding it 
he ate peanut butter sandwiches yesterday because i was out of 
bananas she said tuesday he liked them real well except he 
got real disgusted when he got peanut butter between his i guess 
you would call them his fingers 
the japanese macaque dubbed jack the macaque by mrs 
rodgers stands about 3 feet tall weighs about 30 pounds and has 
a silky tan coat 
macaques are generally found in southern asia and the east 
indies jack a resourceful little primate survived the winter 
apparently by foraging 
conservation officers say he runs away as soon as someone in 
uniform appears hes a pretty smart monkey said gary ault 
conservation officer at paynetown hes kind of allergic to 
uniforms 
he escaped about 10 months ago from the reptile kingdom in brown 
county about 35 miles from mrs rodgers home here near the 
hoosier national forest 
attempts to recapture the monkey have failed on friday jack 
turned up his nose at three tranquilized bananas in favor of a dish 
of cat food behind the rodgers house 
he hadnt done that before said mrs rodgers then he 
went out and sat down by the bananas and took a couple of bites and 
spit them out jack was a little woozy but made it back to the 
woods 
when mrs rodgers first saw the monkey last wednesday she called 
her husband sam who was at work while he phoned the sheriffs 
department she offered jack some apples carrots and bread 
he just kind of looked at me like oh please i didnt 
really know what to do she said i didnt want to scare him 
away so i did what i thought ape researcher jane goodall would 
do i squatted down low so that i was about his size 
when the police car pulled up the monkey grabbed an apple and 
carrot and ran for the woods 
the animal isnt considered especially dangerous though mrs 
rodgers said owner thomas tilton told her the monkey might attack 
if he felt threatened 
hes just as cute as he can be said mrs rodgers adding 
that she wont be too disappointed if future attempts to recapture 
the monkey also fail 
i know the owner wants him back she said but i just 
couldnt stand for them to drug him

five mississippi ninthgraders who beat 
200 other teams playing a stock market simulation say they used the 
strategies and tactics of real investors to reap a 110723 paper 
profit 
and just like real investors they had a fearful day when the 
market crashed on oct 19 as the stock market plummeted 508 
points they were left holding a handful of cheap stocks that no 
one wanted to buy 
we lost 34000 said auburn wessman of bailey alternative 
school we wanted to buy some penny stocks because they go up a 
higher percentage but the crash came along and they just went 
down down down 
the 15yearold is one of five bailey ninthgraders who played 
the stock market in a 10week game sponsored by mclarty amp co and 
the clarionledgerjackson daily news 
more than 200 mississippi teams competed with others across the 
nation in the game developed by the securities industries 
association and coordinated by the american enterprise center 
each team started with an imaginary 100000 and a 100000 line 
of credit they bought and sold stocks according to daily closing 
prices and even paid imaginary broker fees 
the bailey group led by government teacher johnny gilbert 
followed stocks in usa today and watched business reports daily 
they met for two hours every week to make plans to buy and sell 
their strategy was to shortsell an engineering stock get rid 
of two others at a profit and hold onto the earnings with stable 
ibm 
gilbert wanted his six teams to learn how to take risks and how 
to recover from mistakes he offered advice but didnt force the 
teams to follow it 
i just told them to ask what companies might make some 
money gilbert said its hard to teach the risk but i told 
them its like a big crap game

a man accused of killing 16 people including 
14 family members grinned as he squeezed off shots during a 
45minute rampage at four businesses according to people he 
allegedly shot or tried to shoot 
r gene simmons a 47yearold retired air force master 
sergeant is being tried in the fatal shootings of former coworker 
kathy c kendrick 24 and james d chaffin 33 dec 28 in 
russellville four people were wounded 
simmons is scheduled to face a separate trial july 18 in the 
slayings of 14 relatives 
prosecutor john bynum who told the jury he would ask for the 
death penalty said in his opening statement that miss kendrick a 
legal secretary was shot at least four times in the head as she 
sat at her desk 
officials have said she had spurned simmons advances a year 
earlier 
police have said chaffin was a chance victim of shooting several 
minutes later at taylor oil co several blocks from the law 
office simmons had once worked at the oil company and had been the 
boss of russell taylor whom he allegedly wounded there 
david salyer shot in the forehead at a small market he owned 
and where simmons had once worked said that when simmons 
squeezed the first shot he was grinning 
a witness in the convenience store shooting tony carta said he 
saw simmons lean over a counter of the market and shoot cashier 
roberta woolery in the face the bullet went in her mouth and out 
her jaw 
both salyer and taylor who showed their scars to the jury 
identified simmons as the man who shot them 
simmons surrendered after another shooting at a motor freight 
company where he allegedly wounded a woman who once had been his 
boss 
earlier juli money who worked with chaffin at the oil company 
testified that she saw chaffin shot on what was her first day at 
work she said she heard shots then saw a door fly open as chaffin 
reached for it 
i saw an arm raise up through a window in the door it shot 
and jim went down she testified 
ms money said she was trying to see what was going on and 
wondering whether it was a practical joke when simmons 
stepped over his body took a stance and pointed the gun at me i 
screamed no and dived behind some boxes 
he was grinning he had a horrid grin it looked like he had 
false teeth and his eyes were wide open 
she said she grabbed her head because i thought i had been 
shot because i felt the heat from the bullet as it whizzed past 
she was uninjured 
after simmons surrendered the bodies of his wife and 13 other 
relatives were found on his property in dover 47 miles east of 
ozark 
if convicted of murder simmons could be sentenced to death or 
life in prison without parole 
bynum asked for the maximum penalty on all charges while 
simmons attorney robert e doc irwin urged that the jurors 
not be bullied by public opinion by what the press may say or by 
what the public may say 
irwin asked jurors to consider conflicting statements given by 
witnesses in describing the gunman 
brenda jones of atkins testified tuesday that she was in the law 
office on business when simmons came in and stood in front of miss 
kendricks desk 
the man had his hands in his pockets but jerked his right arm up 
and started firing a pistol she testified he missed her at 
first she said she just stood there he kept shooting 
finally he hit her 
mrs jones said she was afraid to move and put her head down 
when she looked up simmons glanced at her and walked out she said 
asked by irwin why she had not identified simmons when she saw 
him at the police department on dec 28 mrs jones said simmons 
had kept his head down she identified simmons on jan 13 from 
photographs 
about 60 spectators were in the courtoom including relatives of 
some of simmons family members 
pat mcnulty 36 of bryant whose brother was among the dead 
family members said weve got our grief to deal with and gene 
simmons has got god to deal with 
viola oshields 51 sister of simmons late wife becky and 
roger oshields 53 both of fort payne ala said they sat in the 
front row because they wanted to make certain that simmons saw them 
its hard for us not to have some hate he said

the senate has decided to create a buffer 
against the political consequences of deciding which of the 
nations 3600 military installationver the proposal that was tacked onto 
a pentagon budget bill 
studies by the pentagon and the senate armed services committee 
have estimated that between 1 billion and 5 billion a year can be 
saved if unneeded bases can be closed 
sen strom thurmond rsc summed up the political dilemma 
tuesday when he told colleagues the real issue is one that 
concerns each of us and that is the potential loss of jobs in our 
states and resulting economic dislocations these are very real 
concerns 
sen john mccain rariz said there is a perception in the 
country and i think its accurate that congress cannot act to 
close a single base because of the political ramifications 
the pentagon has not closed any major us installations since 
1977 when congress erected a series of stiff legal barriers to the 
periodic attempts to pare down the nations military infrastructure 
the pentagon last proposed closing bases in 1985 when it said 
22 facilities could be shut down but that idea ran into a storm of 
opposition on capitol hill and was later dropped 
as it works through the bill the senate is also trying to 
answer another politically tricky question of whether to have the 
military more deeply involved in the antidrug fight 
defense secretary frank c carlucci said tuesday he opposes such 
moves i do not believe law enforcement making arrests is 
appropriate for the military he told a senate subcommittee i 
think it is unwise to get the military into the law enforcement 
question do we shoot people do we shoot down planes 
the house voted 38523 last week to order president reagan to 
have the military seal us borders against drug traffickers and a 
similar plan is expected to be offered to the senate 
senate leaders are searching for a compromise on some type of 
antidrug plan much as the baseclosing commission proposal was 
hammered out among congressional and pentagon officials in recent 
months 
legislators agreed that base closings should be considered in 
the effort to stretch increasingly scarce dollars in the federal 
budget but wanted to be sure they had a say in the process 
the original commission plan proposed a ninemember panel but 
sen alan dixon dill opposed that saying it would give 
absolute power to the department of defense 
sen carl levin dmich agreed noting that the publics in 
our communities rely on these bases when these bases are 
closed it better not look political 
senate minority leader bob dole of kansas admitted that closing 
bases and the resulting loss of jobs is politically sensitive 
but he added that i hope we can close some i know there are 
some that are unneeded 
the 15member commission would include the nine members already 
announced by carlucci and six more carlucci will appoint with the 
approval of key legislators 
the commission is supposed to finish its work by dec 31 and if 
it proposes a list of installations to be closed carlucci will 
have to accept or reject the entire list his decision can be 
blocked only by a vote of both the house and senate 
sen william roth rdel said in light of our current 
budgetary deficit the need to save 2 billion a year is clear and 
obvious 
the commission proposal is not in the house version of the 
pentagon budget measure but that chamber is expected to consider a 
separate bill which includes the commission 
the competing bills that will be approved in the house and 
senate eventually will go to a conference committee to reconcile 
differences including the baseclosing plan both bills authorize 
2995 billion in defense spending for the fiscal year beginning 
oct 1

the reagan administration is adopting a 
what me worry attitude on whether senate inaction on the 
intermediaterange nuclear forces treaty will cloud the moscow 
summit due to start may 29 
and according to several private experts the stance may be 
justified 
not more than two weeks ago summit planners were confident that 
president reagan and soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev would be 
able to crown three years of summitry by exchanging the final 
fully ratified documents of the inf treaty the superpowers had been 
negotiating off and on since 1981 
after all the pact had run the gantlet of hearings past 
senators eager to hack away at the treaty and it emerged with only 
a few dents head counters expected that only a dozen or so 
senators would vote no on final ratification and that the vote 
could occcur before the summit 
to complete the inf process in time for the moscow meetings 
seemed doubly important because it had become clear that reagan and 
gorbachev were still far from reaching their goal of a 30 percent 
to 50 percent cut in longrange missiles and bombers the 
socalled start agreement 
the leaders would be saying in essence well weve stumbled 
a bit on start but lets not dwell on it signing this final 
ratified inf pact will give us a chance to remind the world we can 
make progress on arms control 
in the past two weeks however glitches have emerged in the inf 
treaty mostly over the meaning of verification provisions and the 
senate has decided to postpone ratification work indefinitely the 
administration is optimistic it will clear away the differences in 
time for the summit but that is unlikely to leave the senate time 
to act 
is the administration worried the failure will hurt the summit 
of course not state department spokesman charles e redman 
said on tuesday 
like other us officials who spoke on condition of anonymity 
redman said the differences between the united states and the 
soviets are merely technical and will be resolved if the senate 
fails to act in time for the summit it can do the work afterward 
and the ratification documents can be exchanged later in the year 
the treaty will eliminate groundlaunched missiles with ranges 
between 315 miles and 3125 miles 
secretary of state george p shultz was in geneva today to meet 
soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze to try to resolve 
the inf differences and the administration officials predicted that 
if shultz and his negotiators are willing to shake hands on a 
settlement the senate will go along 
janusz bugajski an expert on eastern europe who works at the 
center for strategic and international studies believes that with 
the failure of the superpowers to reach agreement on longrange 
systems the spotlight at the summit will be on human rights and 
regional issues rather than on arms control 
theoretically gorbachev could try to win propaganda points by 
raising the senates ratification delay as an alleged example of 
us hesitancy to end the arms race bugajski said 
but thats not likely because gorbachev wants the summit to 
be a success for domestic and international reasons bugajski 
said 
we dont need an inf treaty ratified in time for the summit 
we just need it not to be scuttled and thats not going to 
happen said andrew c goldberg a rand corp consultant and 
expert on soviet military affairs 
remember the vast majority of people in the senate want to 
ratify the inf treaty eventually goldberg said 
james t hackett a foreign policy analyst at the conservative 
heritage foundation asserted that the senates inaction on the inf 
treaty reflected members unease with the treaty despite 
overwhelming constituent support for approval the lastminute 
disagreements over verification give them a chance to keep 
nitpicking so they dont have to ratify it 
hackett added gorbachev wants the summit to show his nation 
he is a commanding figure on the world stage reagan wants to put 
on a show to keep his approval rating high for as long as he can 
if they cant sign an inf treaty theyll find something else 
to do with some pizazz

legislation to ban undetectable plastic 
firearms could clear the senate judiciary committee this thursday 
just two days after the house approved a similar bill with a calm 
that rarely accompanies gun control measures 
a smooth ride for the legislation was virtually assured two 
weeks ago after attorney general edwin meese iii and law 
enforcement groups agreed to a compromise version and the 
national rifle association went along 
the nra agreed to avoid a bruising gun control battle in 
congress when it became clear that no existing handguns would be 
prohibited under the agreement 
plastic guns are not yet a reality but chief house sponsor 
william j hughes said tuesday the firearms could be a weapon of 
choice for terrorists in the future his colleagues agreed passing 
the bill 4134 
the senate judiciary subcommittee on the constitution meanwhile 
cleared a similar bill by sen howard m metzenbaum for action by 
the full committee the full panel meets again on thursday and the 
gun bill is on the agenda 
the hughes bill would make it illegal to manufacture import 
sell transfer or possess a plastic firearm defined as a weapon 
with less than 37 ounces of metal 
maximum penalties would be five years in prison and fines of 
250000 for individuals and 1 million for organizations 
the bill contains a sunset provision that would repeal the 
criminal provisions after five years enabling the law to keep pace 
with any advances that may occur in firearms detection technology 
voting against the house measure were republican reps dick 
cheney of wyoming philip crane of illinois norman shumway of 
california and barbara vucanovich of nevada 
hughes bill was introduced before the administrationpolice 
compromise but embodies the same concept 
the more precise language is in the senate version which would 
establish a detectability standard that would permit detection of 
the same weapons as the hughes bill however it does not provide 
for a minimum content of metal in the gun 
both measures would detect all existing hanguns thus keeping 
them legal for lawabiding owners but plastic weapons that failed 
to meet the same metallic standard would be prohibited 
metzenbaum dohio called the house vote a major step in the 
right direction i look forward to working with congressman hughes 
to make sure the congress sends the president the strongest bill 
possible he said tuesday 
hughes said he saw no problem in working out a compromise 
between the house and senate language 
a winter park fla company that claims to be the leader in 
plastic firearms technology says it has no plans to produce plastic 
handguns 
dwight c brunoehler vice president of red eye arms inc said 
the company was working on a plastic machine gun grenade launcher 
that it hopes to sell to the marines 
we see the military business as where we want to be he 
said adding the company will be working on that project for at 
least the next two years he said the company also has pledged 
never to make an undetectable plastic weapon

the 1988 winter wheat harvest could be around 
162 billion bushels if the agriculture departments initial 
forecast is borne out up 4 percent from last years production 
based on surveys may 1 the average yield of this years harvest 
is expected to be 407 bushels per acre compared with 398 bushels 
per acre in 1987 when winter wheat output was 156 billion bushels 
farmers are expected to have about 398 million acres for 
harvest this year up 1 percent from 393 million in 1987 
as of may 1 over 60 percent of the winter wheat in the major 
producing states rated in good or better condition said the 
departments report tuesday another 28 percent is rated in fair 
condition 
winter wheat is planted in the fall and harvested the following 
summer it makes up about threefourths of total us wheat 
production 
the outlook for wheat prices at the farm also has brightened 
reflecting brisk export demand and a reduction in onceawesome us 
wheat stockpiles 
in a related supplyanddemand report the usda projected total 
wheat production this year based on historical trends at 217 
billion bushels up slighly from 21 billion bushels in 1987 that 
would include winter wheat and other kinds planted this spring for 
harvest later in the year 
the report also projected the us wheat stockpile is expected 
to decline further to around 796 million bushels by the end of the 
coming marketing year on may 31 1989 compared with more than 123 
billion bushels of oldcrop wheat expected to be carried over this 
june 1 
carl schwensen executive vice president of the national 
asssociation of wheat growers said the expected reduction in us 
wheat inventories will mean tighter supplies in the year ahead 
does that mean the united states is running low on wheat after 
the recent years of huge surpluses 
thats relatively correct schwensen said and if were 
going to stay in the world market were going to have to have 
adequate supplies for our customers thats why we feel the acreage 
reserve level can be relaxed and farmers can have the opportunity 
to market more bushels in the 1989 season 
schwensen referred to a farm law provision that limits usda to 
no more than a 20 percent landidling requirement when the wheat 
stockpile is projected to drop below a billion bushels at a 
projected 796 million bushels on may 31 1989 that would be well 
below the mark 
for the last two years the usda has required wheat farmers to 
idle 275 percent of their base acreage in order to qualify for 
supports and other federal benefits schwensen said the association 
wants to see the 1989 requirement reduced to between 10 percent and 
20 percent 
wheat market prices were projected for 198889 at an average 
range of 280 to 320 per bushel compared with 255 estimated 
for 198788 
the indicated production of winter wheat based on may 1 
prospects are listed here the first numbers show the total 
production in thousands of bushels the second numbers are the 
average yields per acre for the major states

the soviet union may be headed for another 
bumper grain harvest which the agriculture department says could 
dampen import requirements if wheat quality improves from the last 
couple of years 
in its first forecast of this years soviet grain production 
the usda said tuesday that 1988 production could be 215 million 
metric tons of grain up 2 percent from last years bumper output 
of 2114 million tons 
the department said the harvests could include 92 million tons 
of wheat 109 million tons of coarse grains such as rye barley 
oats and corn and 14 million tons of miscellaneous grains and 
pulses which include peas and beans 
officials said the harvest outlook could mean a cutback in grain 
imports particularly wheat the united states has been selling the 
soviets huge quantities of wheat lately all of it at subsidized 
prices under the departments export enhancement program or eep 
if the 1988 harvest turns out as forecast it would be the third 
year in a row that soviet grain production has exceeded 200 million 
tons an unprecedented feat for that country 
it also would be the third largest soviet grain output exceeded 
by the record crop of 2374 million tons in 1978 and the 1976 
harvest of 2238 million tons 
however officials said the 1988 forecast is highly 
tentative and that it will be modified as the season progresses 
by both positive and negative factors including weather 
developments

by the end of the century there will be a need 
for a new civilian transport plane capable of carrying 247 
passengers on 5000mile trips at two to three times the speed of 
sound says a new study 
that will open a 200 billionplus market for the country which 
first manufactures the new generation of supersonic planes for 
civilian use in the years 2000 to 2010 said the national 
aeronautics and space administration 
the agency however recommended against building a production 
transport faster than three times the speed of sound saying that 
would involve too great a price and with too great a delay in 
reaching operational service at mach 27 an airplane could fly 
from los angeles to tokyo in under four hours 
a body traveling at mach 1 would be traveling at the speed of 
sound and mach 2 would equal twice the speed of sound 
the study said growth in travel across the pacific will justify 
designing and building a supersonic transport the united states 
had such an effort under way in the 1960s but abandoned it because 
of noisepollution problems and the high cost of fuel 
many technologies are much more advanced today the nasa 
study said weight reduction and aircraft shaping are the best 
methods of reducing the sonic boom heard at ground level new 
design methods for shaping are just now becoming avialable 
the aircraft eventually would fly twice as far as the european 
concorde which has a range of 3350 miles 
the new generation of airplanes would not be the orient 
express that president reagan envisioned in his state of the 
union message two years ago when he announced research for a plane 
capable of flying 25 times the speed of sound and thus able to go 
into orbit 
nasa and the defense department jointly are now carrying out 
research for such a hypersonic plane and a decision will be made in 
1990 on whether to build it at a cost of 33 billion 
nasa program managers believe research for the longrange 
commercial market should now focus on getting the highest speed 
possible out of a conventionally fueled highspeed transport 
the agency said 
two studies were performed for nasas langley research center in 
virginia by boeing and mcdonnell douglas the only us firms 
building large transports 
the boeing studies indicate that by the year 2000 a fleet of 
1200 large subsonic aircraft would be needed to carry the 
estimated worldwide longrange traffic of 315000 passengers per 
day nasa said by comparison less than 800 supersonic 
transports each carrying 247 passengers as far as 5000 nautical 
miles could serve the same markets 
timeliness in providing a viable and competitive vehicle is 
important if the united states is to capture a major portion of the 
highspeed transport market estimated to be over 200 billion 
nasa said 
it added this market could be an important factor in the us 
sustaining a positive balance of trade in the aerospace market 
the federal government would not be a financial partner in 
building an sst but nasa said it has a clear charter to pursue the 
technologies and reduce the financial risk to aircraft builders 
it then would be up to industry to build and sell the 
highspeed civil transport on their own the agency said

environmental organizations and a segment of 
the us fishing industry say they will ask congress to allow the 
incidental killing of marine mammals by fishermen to continue into 
the 1990s 
spokesmen for the two normally combative groups announced 
tuesday they had reached a threeyear truce in their longstanding 
tussle over the killing of sea mammals off the us coast 
theyre going to give us a threeyear lease on life said 
dayton alverson of natural resources consultants who said he was 
speaking for commercial fishing interests in alaska 
alverson and bo bricklemyer a greenpeace lawyer speaking for a 
coalition of environmental organizations said the pact is designed 
to end the threat that recent court decisions could put many us 
fishermen out of business in 1989 
the court rulings said that the commerce department could not 
issue new 1989 permits to fishermen to kill mammals unless it could 
demonstrate that this would not deplete the population of a 
specific mammal 
the national oceanic and atmospheric administration and the 
marine mammal commission say they lack adequate information to make 
such declarations on a number of airbreathing sea creatures 
the agreement if it is accepted by congress would allow 
continued issuance of permits for the incidental killing of many 
mammals through 1991 in return for commercial fishery cooperation 
in obtaining data on their populations 
the plan also calls for limits on the numbers of northern fur 
seals and northern sea lions that can be taken by fishermen who 
often find portions of their catch snatched away by sea mammals 
before they can be landed 
the agreement which deals with coastal fishing does not 
address the problem of dolphins killed by tuna fishermen in the 
eastern pacific 
part of the agreement calls for outside observers to be on 
fishing boats alverson said he wants the federal government to pay 
the 2 million to 2 million needed each year to hire 35 observers 
bricklemyer said environmentalists agreed to the threeyear 
hiatus in return for the fishing industry educating its members 
about mammal protection and collecting data that can be used to 
make decisions about whether a particular mammal is facing 
depletion 
we had two choices shut down the industry which nobody 
wanted to do or find out whats going on said bricklemyer 
adding that alversons group and the environmentalists would work 
together to get congress to overturn the court rulings 
alverson said there is a growing recognition in the fishing 
community that we have to live with the interests of the 
environmental community you cant keep going on flailing at 
each other 
the agreement was announced shortly before the start of a 
hearing on marine mammal protection by the house merchant marine 
and fisheries subcommittee on fisheries and wildlife conservation 
and the environment 
asked his opinion of the agreement subcommittee chairman gerry 
studds dmass said i dont know i havent looked at it yet 
a wildlife lobbyist speaking on condition of anonymity said 
that environmental groups made the deal in order to try to salvage 
something from expected action by congress this year to overturn 
the court rulings

the national panel created to solve the 
national budget problem is quickly learning that balancing the 
governments checkbook first means decoding some artful accounting 
if we did this in business theyd lock us up said 
commission member lee iacocca the chrysler chairman after the 
national economic commission on tuesday held its first public 
hearing on federal budget practices 
experts told the commission the history of the convoluted budget 
process and the scope of the deficit problem which has already 
saddled taxpayers with paying back principal and interest on more 
than 25 trillion in debt 
the tone among the commission members was often jocular in 
reaction to testimony about federal budgeting oddities 
timothy muris a george mason university professor who until 
last year worked at the office of management and budget described 
how a cut can really be an increase in spending 
thats because budget writers work from projections of inflated 
program costs instead of current spending levels 
i thought i was pretty good when i was in government but i 
was a rank amateur said washington lawyer robert strauss a 
democrat who is cochairman of the commission 
think of it as a 20 percent cut from a 50 percent markup 
quipped lane kirkland president of the aflcio 
but former defense secretary caspar w weinberger made clear he 
didnt think the concept was funny when it applied to pentagon 
spending cutting the military short of inflationary increases is 
a very real reduction he said 
there is nothing in the world situation which justifies that 
kind of cutback he said referring to recent budget restraints 
that is a reality and it is a very unhappy reality for the united 
states 
weinberger said the first task of the commission should be to 
streamline the budget process but the witnesses did not agree 
commission cochairman drew lewis president reagans former 
transportation secretary and currently the head of the union 
pacific railroad announced that the group intended to produce its 
recommendation by dec 21 more than two months ahead of its 
statutory deadline 
the revised schedule would give the 12member commission a great 
chance of influencing policies of the next president who will get 
to appoint two more commission members after novembers election 
we are not looking at this as a partisan mission said lewis 
carol cox executive director of the committee for a responsible 
federal budget told the commission that reducing the deficit will 
be a difficult task and efforts so far have had mixed results 
it seems like were on a treadmill were running to stay in 
place she said 
but sen daniel p moynihan dny was optimistic were 
talking about a situation thats within our capacity to solve 
cox said the budget mechanisms have worked well when theres a 
consensus to be carried out presidents carter and reagan both used 
it to achieve their initial legislative successes when they took 
office she said 
stanley collender director of federal budget policy for the 
firm of touche ross amp co said procedures could be improved but 
the budget process is not the problem 
it will always be subservient to politics he said

legislation setting new ground rules for 
filing damage suits against manufacturers of hazardous products 
survived its initial test in a house committee but its chances of 
passing congress this year are still considered minimal 
consumer activists suffered a setback tuesday when the house 
energy and commerce committee rejected two proposals by rep henry 
a waxman dcalif that would have expanded the product liability 
bills narrow list of legal grounds available to victims seeking to 
recover damages 
then after four hours of bickering the committee postponed 
until thursday any further action on what rep james j florio 
dnj called a complex and extremely controversial measure 
the bill would establish a uniform federal standard of product 
liability that would preempt conflicting state laws consumer 
activists vigorously oppose the measure on the ground that it would 
weaken the legal rights of victims of unsafe consumer products 
it was the first time that the house bill first introduced in 
1979 had advanced to the full committee even if it reaches the 
house floor which is uncertain the bill is virtually assured of a 
hostile reception in the senate where it was filibustered to death 
in late 1986 
two consumer groups called it a radical bill that would 
immunize the manufacturers of defective goods deprive victims of 
compensation for their injuries and expose american consumers to 
more hazardous products 
business support for the bill has become increasingly lukewarm 
with each revision aimed at meeting consumer demands this is a 
watereddown bill said rep norman lent rny but it is 
better than none 
other committee republicans said the bill represented an 
important step toward discouraging frivolous damage suits 
reversing the escalating cost of liability insurance premiums and 
bolstering the competitiveness of us products on world markets 
the committees first day of debate focused on a compromise 
plan drafted by rep mike synar dokla at the request of rep 
john dingell dmich the panels chairman which was aimed at 
making the bill more acceptable to consumer groups and moderate 
committee democrats 
charging that we are about to emasculate the product liability 
system waxman tried unsuccessfully to restore some of the legal 
grounds for damage suits in the states that would be preempted by 
a uniform federal standard 
dingell voted with opponents in defeating waxmans pair of 
consumerbacked amendments by roll call votes of 2912 and 3012 
under the bill approved by florios commerce subcommittee last 
december a manufacturer could escape liability for damages if he 
did not know or could not know of a design defect with 
knowledge reasonably available to him or if there were no 
feasible alternative design 
this restriction would not apply if the consumer could establish 
that the product was egregiously unsafe that an ordinary consumer 
would not know of the products risks and if the product had little 
or no usefulness 
the synar plan would require only that the plaintiff prove that 
the product was so unsafe compared with its usefulness that it 
should not have been marketed synar also would put the burden of 
proof on the manufacturer to show that a design defect could not be 
discovered and that an alternative design was not feasible 
leaders of four consumer organizations complained to dingell on 
april 27 that synars plan still falls far short of protecting 
the legal rights of individuals injured by unreasonably dangerous 
and defective products 
underscoring the bills poor prospects rep jim bates 
dcalif drew laughter at one point in the debate by referring to 
synars plan as a killer amendment to a bill thats already 
dead

education secretary william j bennett says 
his department is now much less likely to be eliminated and that 
he deserves the credit 
bennetts boast came tuesday during a typically contentious 
appearance before a congressional committee replete with the 
taunts and tantrums that have marked almost every capitol hill 
exchange between lawmakers and the education secretary 
one day after bennett announced plans to step down in 
midseptember sen lowell weicker accused him of having shirked 
his responsibilities to poor and handicapped students aided by 
federal programs 
in the course of your tenure you have chosen to go ahead and 
ravage these programs said weicker rconn referring to budget 
cuts sought on a nearly annual basis by the department 
why didnt you concentrate on what was your responsibility 
weicker asked i have difficulty understanding your preoccupation 
with everybody elses business i find it incredible that 
nothing has been achieved in your specific charges 
bennett defended his interest in state and local education 
efforts during what he termed probably his final appearance before 
the senate appropriations subcommittee on education and other 
agencies the best federal program is the program thats deployed 
well at the local level he sid 
president reagan came into office pledging to dissolve the 
education department and bennett conceded under questioning that he 
still does not see a real need for it other than to spark debate 
what asked an irritated weicker would you think of teachers 
who see no real need for their jobs 
they shouldnt be in a classroom bennett replied 
well you shouldnt be in the department of education 
weicker snapped what kind of commitment does that show 
i made a hell of a commitment you just didnt like the 
direction bennett retorted i was damn successful youre mad 
at me because we were a lot more successful than you thought wed 
be 
in fact bennett said he has done such a good job that the 
question of the departments future is probably moot 
its much less likely youll see abolition of the department 
of education in the future largely because of me he said a 
lot of people think the departments been transformed 
bennett contended he had as much responsibility to lead an 
intense national conversation about education as to oversee 
federal programs 
sen lawton chiles dfla the subcommittee chairman has been 
highly critical of bennett but defended the secretarys conception 
of his job when he voted in favor of creating the department 
chiles said i hoped there would be a national spokesman i 
quite agree with you that that is your role 
the administration has sought deep cuts in education spending 
for every fiscal year except 1985 and 1989 the years for which 
proposals were submitted during presidential election campaigns 
bennett repeatedly has lectured lawmakers about the need to 
restrain spending and told them more money does not necessarily 
produce better education for their part lawmakers have blasted 
bennett for consistently agreeing to cuts far deeper than those 
proposed for any other department 
the result has been a continuing series of stormy sarcastic 
sessions with various congressional panels including the one 
tuesday 
mr secretary i know youre going to miss these lovefests 
said chiles 
bennett indicated later that lawmakers may not have seen the 
last of him he said he wouldnt rule out returning to a cabinet 
post even possibly education secretary in a future republican 
administration

a unanimously passed house bill would raise 
penalties against contractors convicted of defrauding the federal 
government and its chief sponsor predicts the measure will stop a 
flood of such cases 
procurement fraud is robbing the government of hundreds of 
millions of dollars a year and in some instances costing peoples 
lives chief sponsor william j hughes dnj said following 
tuesdays 4190 vote 
the measure which now goes to the senate would apply to any 
procurement contract of 1 million or more in which the government 
was bilked out of at least 250000 procurement contracts are 
those providing a product rather than a service 
hughes said the bill would apply to some 10000 existing 
contracts 
the legislation would establish a maximum prison sentence of 10 
years and a minimum twoyear sentence for cases involving a 
foreseeable and substantial risk of personal injury 
hughes said the risk could result from substitution of inferior 
products by contractors especially in military parts 
current law permits fines based on the monetary gain to the 
defendant or the loss to the federal government 
the house bill would add a new fine of up to 10 million in 
cases in which the risk of injury is involved 
a reward system would permit payments of up to 250000 from the 
criminal fines for information leading to a conviction 
the measure also contains protection for government 
whistleblowers who provide information leading to convictions 
fraud in procurement contracts has involved overcharges 
malfunctioning equipment and product substitution hughes said 
the general accounting office reported in january that based on 
known cases the estimated loss to the government in procurement 
fraud was 3874 million in a oneyear period ending march 31 1986

post office window service and collections 
could be back to normal by the end of summer but that wont mean 
the end of the agencys financial struggles according to 
postmaster general anthony frank 
frank said tuesday that he is committed to restoring service 
that was cut earlier this year in the face of congressionally 
imposed budget restrictions 
but reopening counters and restoring sunday sorting and 
collection means finding 9 million a month in savings somewhere 
else he said 
with luck he said that can be accomplished by late summer but 
he added that services will be restored only when he is sure that 
they can be kept open 
hundreds of construction projects for new postal facilities also 
were canceled or delayed to save money 
long after people forget about the windows being closed 
building projects will still be delayed land will have been sold 
to someone else and construction costs will be even higher frank 
said 
frank who took over as postmaster on march 1 said that 
explaining the need for service cuts at the same time rates are 
rising has been difficult 
the rate increases imposed on april 3 dont help he said 
because the accounting system mandated by congress results in the 
increased income being counted as a reduction in the national debt 
not as extra money for the agency 
on other topics frank said 
a system may be considered in which notices would automatically 
be sent out for people filing change or address forms 
the agency should help serve as a gobetween for other federal 
agencies and the public such as by making catalogs of government 
printing office booklets available in lobbies the current program 
to deliver an aids booklet to every home is a good example he said 
it is amazing how many suggestions for new stamps he 
receives he said he doesnt see anything wrong with issuing a 
stamp to honor singer elvis presley although so far the 
independent committee that makes the final choices has turned down 
that idea 
the budget problems may be eased by a house bill that would 
remove the postal service from the federal budget the agency had 
not been part of the budget until 1985 
you really cant include us in the budget process when we 
dont use taxes frank said direct subsidies to the agency were 
ended several years ago 
in addition to restoring the services that were cut earlier 
frank said he wants to find ways to add other services 
for example automated postal tellers now under development 
could be placed in shopping malls more markets and other stores 
encouraged to sell stamps at their checkouts and automation 
improved to speed post office lobby service 
frank said battling for renewed public confidence means both 
improved service and improving perception of that service 
he described a program in which postal carriers placed specific 
items in home mailboxes and later asked the residents to fill out 
forms indicating whether those items had been received 
when the item was a large white envelope only 03 percent 
reported that it had not been delivered he said but when it was a 
commercial catalog 11 percent of the people who received it 
reported that it had not arrived 
we know the items were delivered but the perceived value of 
the item makes a difference he said

a representative of democratic presidential 
frontrunner michael dukakis says the party must avoid simply 
listing the hopes of every group in america in its 1988 platform 
the document then becomes meaningless said michael barnes 
after his appearance tuesday before the democratic platform 
committee 
but while the dukakis camp was advising caution a leader of the 
jesse jackson campaign said the platform should call for tax 
increases on the rich 
the 30member platform committee chaired by michigan gov james 
j blanchard received its marching orders last month from party 
chairman paul g kirk jr who wants a streamlined platform that 
every democratic candidate is going to be proud to stand upon 
not one that provides ammunition for the gop 
blanchard said the platform must be hardhitting progressive 
futureoriented idealistic readable and inspiring if our 
platform is going to be taken seriously it must not hide in the 
mush of verbosity buzz words or the easy promise 
walter fauntroy representing the jackson campaign exhorted the 
platformwriters not to make the mistake of a generalized 
againstsin and formotherhood platform 
there comes a time when the rubbers got to hit the road 
said fauntroy the district of columbias nonvoting representative 
in congress 
we need to call for tax increases on the wealthy for 
freezing military spending and for using pension funds to help 
rebuild america fauntroy said 
barnes a former congressman from maryland who played a role in 
drafting the last three platforms said the new one should help 
to unite all democrats and bring us a resounding victory in 
november 
rep mary rose oakar dohio a cochair of the committee asked 
fauntroy the jackson representative to provide the bottomline 
principles that jackson feels must be in the platform 
fauntroy promised to provide such a list 
lawmakers lobbyists mayors labor and civil rights leaders 
urged the party not to gloss over specific commitments to womens 
issues education spending a tough stance on narcotics and other 
causes 
kristina kiehl chair of a proabortion rights political action 
committee called voters for choice said that with the republican 
party opposed to abortion it is imperative for democrats again to 
include a plank supporting reproductive freedom including 
abortion funding for the poor 
it has been suggested that our platform be a succinct 
compelling statement of principles she said let us be clear 
it isnt the length of the document that will move people it 
is the degree of commitment to those principles 
house speaker jim wright of texas the leadoff witness said 
weve had a challenge from our chairman to keep it short and 
ever since that time people have been running from the word 
short so we use other words brief concise compact terse 
round and firm and fully packed and all those kinds of things 
wright said the democrats must articulate a vision for the 
future repudiating reagan administration policies that he said have 
brought downward mobility to families struggling to own homes 
or send children to college 
the platform committee will hold a hearing friday in norfolk 
va on defense and foreign policy other forums will be held on 
families in columbus ohio on may 19 young americans on may 26 
in austin texas jobs on june 2 in both los angeles and detroit 
and new leaders at a time and place to be determined 
a 15member drafting committee will huddle on mackinac island 
mich june 913 to produce a draft the full committee will take 
up the final document later in june several weeks before the party 
convention opens in atlanta on july 18 
the convention delegates will pass judgment on the platform on

president reagans former aides may be raising a 
ruckus with their literary disclosures these days but pierre 
salinger has nothing but praise for his former boss john f 
kennedy 
salinger who was kennedys press secretary says the slain 
president was a special man who surrounded himself with 
advisers who believed in each other and in a common mission and 
didnt need permission from a chief of staff to gain access 
kennedy was not a perfect man salinger wrote in junes 
mccalls magazine for all his loftiness of purpose he did not 
take himself that seriously he had no great vision of himself as a 
political or intellectual giant 
but salinger now with abc news says kennedy learned from his 
mistakes 
one measure of kennedys growth in office will be revealed in 
november when private correspondence between kennedy and soviet 
leader nikita krushchev is scheduled to be released salinger says

the life sentences and possibility of parole 
given a oncecondemned killer for his role in killing six members 
of the alday family have left a lot of broken hearts in 
southwest georgia said one family member 
wayne carl coleman was sentenced tuesday to six life prison 
terms after the jury that convicted him deliberated almost a week 
without voting the death sentence prosecutors won in his trial 14 
years ago 
by law the life sentences were automatic because the jury could 
not agree the 11 members of the alday family present when the 
sentence was announced broke into tears 
we do know we had some friends on the jury and we certainly 
appreciate them said bud alday brother of two victims who 
discovered their bodies we had some enemies too and theyre 
going to have to live with it 
everybody down here is just as sick as they can be there are 
a lot of broken hearts in seminole county bobby alday nephew of 
victims ned and aubrey alday said in a telephone interview tuesday 
ned and his brother aubrey along with neds sons jimmy jerry 
and chester were shot to death in jerry aldays mobile home on may 
14 1973 after they walked in on a burglary 
jerrys wife mary alday was repeatedly raped then driven to a 
wooded area where she was again raped sodomized shot and left to 
die on an ant hill 
coleman carl isaacs and george dungee who had escaped from a 
maryland prison camp were convicted in seminole county of the 
murders and sentenced to death the convictions were overturned in 
1985 by a federal appeals panel that said pretrial publicity 
influenced the original trial jury 
its been awful hard weve been waiting for 15 years to see 
justice said ernestine alday widow of ned and mother of jimmy 
jerry and chester she said faith in god has sustained the family 
hes going to be the judge 
coleman was retried during the past several weeks in dekalb 
superior court isaacs was convicted in perry in january and again 
sentenced to die dungee faces a retrial later this year in 
columbus 
coleman is immediately eligible for parole review under a 1964 
law requiring a review after seven years in prison and will go 
before the state board of pardons and paroles next month said 
board spokesman silas moore 
but state attorney general michael bowers disagreed saying 
coleman is covered by a 1983 law that would require him to serve 30 
years before a parole hearing 
colemans attorney tom west said the life sentences were 
justified we can only assume that if wayne had had a fair trial 
15 years ago he would have gotten a life sentence he said 
wayne is satisfied that his life has been spared west said 
faded remember the aldays bumper stickers still can be found 
on a few cars in seminole county a sparsely populated area where 
most people are farmers they dont like that their tax dollars 
have financed such a long judicial process said bobby alday who 
was not in court tuesday 
i think seminole county is tired of getting these people tvs 
and tennis rackets he said without a doubt these people 
they dont deserve a second chance theyve not shown a bit of 
remorse 
alday said the numerous appeals and lengthy debate in the case 
since the murders took place have placed a strain on the closeknit 
family whose big family reunions and such have now gone by 
the wayside 
most people down here would like to move on and put this 
behind them yet itll be years to come before everybody down here 
can move on with their lives alday said 
when your familys been wiped out its not easy to put it 
aside he continued its been a long hard road for everybody 
down here

rep leon e panetta says a surge in produce 
imports intensifies concerns that foreign fruit and vegetables are 
arriving on us dinner tables with a pesticide residue 
panetta says hes also concerned that burgeoning imports may 
hurt domestic producers who asked the california democrat for 
protective trade legislation at a hearing tuesday 
panetta chairs the house agriculture subcommittee on domestic 
marketing consumer relations and nutrition 
panetta released a general accounting office study showing fruit 
imports more than tripled 482 million to 16 billion while 
vegetable imports more than doubled from 783 million to 16 
billion between 1980 and 1986 
panetta said those increases heighten concerns about consumer 
safety because the food and drug administrations enforcement 
efforts are already weak 
he cited a gao study that found the fda tests less than 1 
percent of all food shipments and uses laboratory methods that can 
detect only half the pesticides available on world markets 
ronald bown executive director of the chilean exporters 
association testified that the chilean fruit and vegetable export 
industry is in conscientious compliance with pesticide 
regulations in force in all countries 
each exporter maintains strict control over the use and 
management of pesticides by each of his producers bown said 
and antonio berentsen of covemex sa of celaya mexico a 
broccoli and cauliflower exporter said mexican growers use the 
same pesticides and herbicides as their us counterparts and 
apply them in the same manner 
domestic growers saw it otherwise 
we need to enforce pesticide regulations on imports because 
right now they have an open door to anything they want to use and 
there is a lot of abuse going on said david gill president of 
norcalcrosetti foods inc of watsonville calif 
other witnesses representing growers testified the wave of 
imports could end up sqeezing them out of business and called for 
trade protection legislation 
the gao study found that the import shares for major fresh and 
frozen fruits rose from about 26 percent in 1980 to about 33 
percent in 1986 and for major fresh vegetables from about 5 
percent to about 7 percent 
the study said consumers benefited from the increase in greater 
supplies and variety and in some instances lower prices some 
producers and domestic processors have been hurt while 
distributors and some processors benefited 
but jeffrey garguilo president of the florida fruit and 
vegetable association testified if nothing changes we see more 
domestic production lost to foreign production this will result in 
lost jobs lost agricultural land and injury to the economy of 
rural america

activists abbie hoffman and dennis banks whove run afoul of 
the law in bucking the system say theyve also learned how to make 
a buck during their years as political gadflies 
hoffman the antic activist who once offered a pig as a 
presidential candidate says hes been cutting it up long enough to 
know how to work an audience as a comedian rather than just as an 
advocate who uses humor 
banks the former indian activist noted that something good has 
come of all his economic development work in south dakota he and 
his wife have decided to open a limousine service there 
hoffman speaks at more than 50 university campuses a year at 
3000 an appearance but the 51yearold former yippie was in san 
juan capistrano calif on tuesday for a comedy gig at the coach 
house 
this isnt new this comedy stuff because i was a bit of a 
standup comedian during the 60s said hoffman who gained 
notoriety as one of the chicago seven defendants charged with 
inciting riots at the 1968 democratic national convention 
the difference is that in the 60s they shot and threw bags 
of garbage at me so this seems pretty tame by comparison he 
said 
banks said recently he plans to open a limousine stall at the 
rapid city regional airport terminal and operate a shuttle between 
there and rapid city and pine ridge he also wants to add one or 
two 15passenger vans to the business 
banks limousine servicespecializing in your taste for the 
finer things in life will offer free roses or a bottle of 
nonalcoholic champagne to customers 
his market will include airport travelers tourists who want a 
private ride through the black hills and indian and government 
officials who travel regularly between pine ridge and washington 
dc banks said 
i thought there was a market there because i had been 
experimenting with economic development in the past two or three 
years since i got out said banks referring to his release from 
prison in south dakota 
banks 56 became famous during the tumultuous days of american 
indian movement activism which peaked in 1973 during the 
occupation of wounded knee he served about one year in prison in 
connection with the 1973 riot at the custer county courthouse

irans growing influence in southern 
lebanon has made it a target for attack by rival shiite moslem 
militiamen and israels army 
over the past year iran has mounted an ambitious program to 
finance religious centers medical clinics and antiisraeli 
guerrillas israeli officials estimate iran is spending up to 100 
million a year on such projects 
the vehicle for planting the seeds of irans revolution has been 
the proiranian hezbollah or party of god which until recent 
weeks had been operating openly in southern lebanon 
officials of the rival militia amal which means hope claim 
hezbollahs influence has been eliminated in the south after a 
series of clashes but analysts say hezbollah guerrillas have not 
been neutralized only driven underground where they are harder to 
find 
the iranians remain in the south despite the recent destruction 
of their office in the port city of tyre by amal guerrillas 
an official with the united nations observer force who demanded 
anonymity said about 30 iranian revolutionary guards are stationed 
in the south providing military planning and intelligence for 
villagebased hezbollah militiamen 
hezbollah which israeli and foreign diplomats estimate can 
field 400 to 500 guerrillas carried out more than half the 75 
attacks on israeli forces in southern lebanon in april three 
israelibacked lebanese militiamen and six hezbollah fighters were 
killed in april 
the iranians who also have about 800 revolutionary guards based 
in the syriancontrolled bekaa valley stay in the background in 
the south but are closely involved in the planning and tactics of 
fighting officials say 
they never participate directly but they do plan and control 
the attacks providing the reconnaisance and drawing up the attack 
plans the un official said 
uri lubrani the israeli governments coordinator of lebanon 
policy said israel knew the iranians had been tactically 
involved in the clashes in south lebanon 
lubrani a former israeli ambassador to teheran said in an 
interview that iran was spending up to 100 million annually in 
lebanon much of it in the south where more than 70 percent of the 
300000 residents are shiite moslems 
most of irans 44 million people are shiites a minority sect 
within the moslem world where most faithful are sunni moslems 
lubrani said iran was investing in schools mosques and training 
centers in a calculated policy of establishing longterm influence 
they want to buy the souls of the new generation lubrani 
said in his defense ministry office it is amazing that iran 
would have the gumption to do all these things and fight a war 
against iraq in the persian gulf 
israel has targeted hezbollah because the group has fired 
rockets into northern israel and ambushed troops and allied 
militiamen in israels selfdeclared security zone in lebanon 
the zone is a sixto10milewide strip north of the israeli border 
israel also accuses hezbollah of helping palestinian guerrillas 
who infiltrate from the bekaa valley two israeli soldiers were 
killed and six wounded in four such raids in april ten guerrillas 
also died 
such attacks made hezbollahs base at maidoun the target of a 
twoday israeli incursion last week in which 1500 israeli troops 
and allied militiamen drove out the gunmen the battle claimed the 
lives of three israelis and 40 guerrillas hezbollah reported four 
of its men missing and presumed captured by israel 
a foreign diplomat who spoke on condition of anonymity said 
there were unconfirmed reports of iranian advisers being present in 
maidoun a village in southeastern lebanon 
the united nations observer said the attack along with recent 
clashes with amal had reduced hezbollahs strength 
hezbollahs power is much less the situation is looking a lot 
better said the observer who is based at the headquarters of 
the 5800member un peacekeeping force in the town of naqoura on 
the lebaneseisraeli border 
the diplomat said irans influence was apparent in the tactics 
of the hezbollah fighters 
orders to carry out attacks are delivered by couriers to small 
groups of militiamen in a halfdozen villages the diplomat said 
the fighters rendezvous at a staging area where weapons are 
stockpiled and are not aware of their targets until just before 
the operation begins 
when its over they go back to their villages dressed in 
civilian clothes without arms the diplomat said it makes 
them a very elusive enemy for anyone trying to find them 
starting in early april hezbollah guerrillas also were targeted 
by amal which has the support of the vast majority of villages in 
the south 
in recent clashes amal drove hezbollah fighters out of villages 
where they had established control israeli officials and foreign 
diplomats say 
lebanese journalists in south lebanon said that in the past few 
days 175 hezbollah supporters had been rounded up and three 
proiranian religious leaders had been expelled from the area 
hezbollah which is directed by iranian advisers and religious 
sheiks seeks to create an iranianinspired islamic republic in 
lebanon in which shiites dominate other religious sects 
amal takes a more moderate line supporting the traditional 
multicommunity system amals policy also is to limit carefully 
attacks against israeli forces to the buffer zone and not to attack 
israel proper to avoid severe reprisals

the senate foreign relations committee will 
consider granting oliver l north limited immunity to get him to 
turn over 2848 pages of notes he took while a key white house 
operative in the irancontra affair 
sen john kerry dmass said such immunity is among the 
options the panel will consider as it seeks to wrap up its probe of 
connections between us aid to nicaraguas contra rebels and latin 
american drug trafficking 
other possibilities include subpoenaing norths washington 
lawyer brendan v sullivan jr and enlisting the help of 
executive branch agencies that should rightfully have the 
documents say kerry and his aides 
at a hearing tuesday sullivan appeared on norths behalf and 
invoked his clients fifth amendment right against 
selfincrimination in refusing to turn over the dozens of 
spiralbound notebooks north compiled while running president 
reagans covert contra aid program 
north who retired this month as a marine lieutenant colonel 
did not appear 
north is one of several targets in a broad conspiracy case that 
charges he illegally diverted profits from the sale of arms to iran 
to aid the contras 
at the white house president reagan responded with an emphatic 
no when asked whether he had ruled out granting pardons to 
north and to his former national security adviser john m 
poindexter 
reagan did not elaborate but his answer came a day after he 
told columnist carl rowan it would be wrong to grant pardons before 
the trial is over and suggested he would be out of office when 
that happens 
previously the president has hinted he is leaning toward a 
pardon for north and poindexter saying he did not think they were 
guilty of any crime and that he doubted any jury would convict them 
portions of norths notebooks previously given to congressional 
investigators are sprinkled throughout with references to drugs 
drug traffickers the drug enforcement administration and the cia 
but large segments committee aides said about half the contents 
have been blacked out by sullivan or by white house censors 
its the first time i ever heard of in history that an 
attorney who is not codecleared classifiedcleared or even any 
security clearance whatsoever sits as the custodian of documents 
that have been walked out of the workplace of the most highly 
sensitive government agency that we have said kerry chairman of 
the panels narcotics subcommittee 
its unheard of and i think its inappropriate he said 
kerry said sullivan in a closeddoor meeting of the committee 
presented an affidavit from north acknowledging the subpoena for 
his notebooks but citing his constitutional right not to 
incriminate himself as justification for withholding them 
kerry said the committee will meet again soon to decide what to 
do next 
it took 10 days for us capitol police to deliver the subpoena 
to north the washington post reported wednesday police who were 
outmanuevered by north at his virginia home and elsewhere finally 
threw the papers into his car last saturday while the former marine 
was stopped at a traffic light near his house the post said 
citing unnamed capitol hill sources 
kerry said he does not know what the notes might reveal of 
importance to his investigation but believes his subcommittee must 
have the documents in order to be sure it has done a thorough job 
he promised that if turned over the documents would be kept secret 
why does the name of someone involved in narcotics appear in 
ollie norths notebook he asked these are unanswered 
questions that still tell me there is a lot that has not yet come 
to light 
north a former national security council staff member directed 
much of the operation that sent arms to iran and raised money to 
supply the contras at a time when congress barred such aid 
he and sullivan also have declined to provide the notebooks to 
lawrence e walsh the independent counsel who is prosecuting north 
and others on charges stemming from the iran affair 
kerry said he has spoken to members of walshs staff about the 
matter and its clear they dont know as much as we do about 
the case

the astrologer who advises first lady nancy 
reagan said tuesday that southern californians anxious about a 
fourcenturiesold prophecy of a huge earthquake this month should 
stop worrying 
joan quigley said the french seer nostradamus had incomplete 
data when he made his prediction in the 1500s 
centuries ago the positions of uranus and neptune and pluto 
and all those planets werent known she said he nostradamus 
knew about saturn being where saturn was but he didnt know that 
uranus was right there with it 
she said she had predicted a big quake may 5 and had returned 
home saturday from a month in europe after it did not materialize 
and said she was confident any danger was past 
southern californians have swamped earthquake information 
hotlines left the region or taken other earthquake precautions in 
reaction to a vague prediction by nostradamus and a 1981 movie 
the man who saw tomorrow now sold on videotape 
the film narrated by war of the worlds prankster orson 
welles claimed nostradamus said the area would be wrecked by a 
huge quake this month some astrologers have said a big quake is 
most likely this week 
a slight quake did materialize in northern california near 
salinas early tuesday but there were no reports of damage 
the earthquake hit at 532 am with an estimated magnitude of 
30 on the richter scale according to willis jacobs a 
geophysicist at the national earthquake center in golden colo he 
said the epicenter was between salinas and watsonville any quake 
under 35 on the scale is considered slight 
mrs reagans interest in astrology was disclosed in a book by 
former white house chief of staff donald regan who said the first 
lady used astrological predictions to influence the presidents

house and senate conferees are getting down to 
the final rounds in their effort to resolve differences over a 
measure to protect the 31 million medicare recipients against 
financial devastation from serious illness 
after months of behindthescenes negotiations the full 
conference met for the first time publicly on tuesday to discuss 
the first major expansion of the program in its 23year history 
the house and senate both passed legislation on catastrophic 
health insurance by overwhelming margins last year although more 
encompassing and expensive the legislation is built on a basic 
framework devised by health and human services secretary otis r 
bowen and embraced by president reagan 
while no formal timetable was set the conference committee is 
expected to shape a final bill for presentation to the two houses 
later this month with an eye toward having the legislation ready 
for president reagans signature next month 
on tuesday both sides agreed on only two points that major 
disagreements still separate them and that the time has come to 
resolve them 
sen george j mitchell dmaine head of the senate finance 
subcommittee that did preliminary work on the senate bill 
cautioned against adopting a final version too expensive for the 
elderly to bear he expressed particular concern about including 
the more expansive house version of a new prescription drug benefit 
we can always expand these programs but it is very hard to 
contract them said mitchell 
but rep henry waxman dcalif suggested a prescription drug 
program probably would be to the only additional benefit realized 
by millions of americans who will not face a lengthy hospital stay 
theyve got to see something out of this legislation he said 
the differences concern the level of additional protection the 
legislation will provide and how the costs are to be spread among 
the 31 million medicare recipients who will have to pay for the 
although the measures are substantially more expansive and 
expensive than proposed by the administration 
the legislation does not provide longterm nursing home care 
under medicare a complicated and even more expensive issue put 
off until next year but would shield medicare beneficiaries 
against annual outofpocket doctor and hospital bills 
the cap would be 1043 in the latest house suggested compromise 
and 1370 in the senate compromise offer now on the bargaining 
table 
medicare now covers only the first 60 days of a hospital stay in 
a given year and pays only 80 percent of doctor bills no matter 
how high they range 
the major disagreement on the benefit side is over prescription 
drugs how much to pay and how soon to start paying 
on the cost side the major disagreement is how to distribute 
the additional premium medicare enrollees will have to pay 
particularly the socalled supplemental premium that is tantamount 
to an income tax increase for the estimated 50 percent of retirees 
who would be subject to it 
the only other additional cost for the estimated 50 percent of 
the elderly not now subject to income tax would be a flat monthly 
premium of about 8 to 10 per month depending on the shape of the 
final legislation

massachusetts gov michael dukakis found broad 
ideological backing along with support from onetime reagan 
democrats in the west virginia and nebraska primaries both of 
which could provide important boosts in a general election campaign 
ideologically dukakis is a rorschach test said abc news 
poll analyst doug muzzio voters of different ideologies look at 
dukakis and are seeing what they want to see in a sense hes all 
ideologies to all voters 
abcs exit polls of voters tuesday found that a majority of 
liberals a majority of moderates and a plurality of conservatives 
said dukakis views were just right as opposed to too liberal 
or too conservative 
certainly he has not been painted among these two electorates 
as a liberal a likely republican tactic muzzio said instead 
dukakis seemed acceptable to voters across the spectrum of 
ideologies in his party 
one reason for pause in the dukakis camp muzzio suggested was 
that about 30 percent of the voters said they were not sure of 
dukakis ideology but while that could suggest a lack of 
selfdefinition it also could be turned into an advantage in a 
general election campaign he said 
another good sign for november was dukakis support from 
democrats who voted for president reagan in 1984 twentythree 
percent of the democratic voters in west virginia and 22 percent in 
nebraska were reagan democrats 73 percent of them in west virginia 
and 78 percent in nebraska said they would vote for dukakis over 
george bush abc found 
dukakis could bring home the reagan democrats said muzzio 
the finding has been consistent he noted since abc started asking 
the question in its connecticut primary exit poll march 29 
abcs poll said jackson in nebraska on tuesday scored one of his 
best showings of the primary season with white voters winning 24 
percent he has done better only in vermont where he abc had him 
winning 32 percent 
jackson who appealed to distressed farmers in nebraska for 
their votes won majorities there in two issue groups voters who 
cited the poor and elderly as a key issue and those who cited the 
ability to bring changes 
still dukakis won all white subgroups in nebraska and won 
overwhelming majorities of voters of all groups other than blacks 
in west virginia the key issue to the most voters in both states 
was job protection and dukakis won a majority of that group 
dukakis made some inroads into the small bloc of black votes 
winning 32 percent of the black vote in west virginia and 11 
percent in nebraska blacks made up 4 percent of the total in west 
virginia and 5 percent in nebraska and the margin of sampling 
error is high for such a small group in a poll 
among all voters the error margin was 5 percentage points in 
the surveys

a boy scout who crafted a california condor 
puppet to feed the dying species first captivebred chick says he 
wont mind if the project doesnt help him earn scoutings highest 
rank eagle scout 
jason schmuckle 17 of vista worked about 20 hours to make the 
2footlong puppet which has a fiberglass beak and skull covered 
by deerskin and painted to match the condors distinctive red and 
black markings 
condor keepers at the san diego wild animal park are using 
schmuckles puppet to feed molloko the 2weekold chick that was 
the product of the first captive mating in the history of the 
critically endangered species 
schmuckle a nature enthusiast who has ambitions of becoming a 
wood craftsman said he began his puppet making in december when he 
was looking for a project to earn the eagle scout rank 
i was going to do it whether they accept it as my eagle scout 
project or not i like the condor he said i really enjoyed 
doing it it makes me happy i could help the condor baby survive 
the latest addition to the captive condor flock at the park was 
introduced last week to the hand puppet which also is used to 
preen the chick as its parents would in the wild 
the chick has increased its weight to just over 12 ounces up 
from the april 29 birth weight of 6 ounces a tiny bandage 
successfully corrected a leg development problem and has been 
removed officials said tuesday 
condor keepers say the puppet is crucial to the success of a 
breeding program to return the species to the wild only 28 birds 
are known to exist all in captivity 15 at the wild animal park 
and 13 at the los angeles zoo 
the chick will be fed with the hand puppet until it is about 5 
months old when it will be released into the company of other 
juvenile birds said condor keeper don sterner 
its very important sterner said of the puppet the whole 
idea is we dont want the birds to relate human beings to food 
that would bring an identity crisis the condor will think its 
a human or think humans are condors 
because of the breeding program it is important that he she 
or it be able to socialize with other birds and not with humans 
more importantly when the birds are released out in the wild we 
dont want them to be used to humans and fly in and be shot by 
hunters 
hand puppets were used in raising 13 condor chicks hatched from 
eggs taken from nests in the wild he said 
in the previous puppets the skulls and beaks were made of 
fiberglass molded from castings of a real condor skull and beak at 
the natural history museum in san diego 
deerskin was cut glued and painted to simulate featherless skin 
on the neck and head bands of black and white fake fur stand in 
for feathers at the bottom of the birds neck eyes donated by a 
taxidermy shop were set in the skull 
sterner said schmuckle improved on the former design using a 
tougher deer hide and devising a better jaw hinge for the lower 
beak that made the puppet easier to manipulate 
sterner also praised the detailed painting of the deer skin to 
resemble a true condors coloring its the closest thing to the 
real thing it should do the job sterner said 
schmuckle completed a second puppet this week and is working on 
a third 
to earn the eagle scout rank he must log more than 150 hours on 
the project supervise someone else during its execution and use 
only donated materials the project also must benefit a nonprofit 
organization 
he has yet to submit documents of his project which officially 
benefits the nonprofit california captivecondor breeding program 
to a local eagle scout board for consideration

a former justice department employee with aids 
says he was fired despite a new federal policy touted as 
enlightened and compassionate that prohibits discrimination 
against government workers with the disease according to a 
published report 
the washington post reported today that mark gregory was fired 
from the departments community relations service on april 25 
several weeks after the office of personnel management announced 
employees with acquired immune deficiency syndrome would be treated 
the same as those with other serious illnesses 
the only reason they fired me is because im sick and because 
i have aids said gregory 30 who is undergoing experimental 
treatment at the national institutes of health 
gregory who lost his health insurance when he was fired is 
appealing the dismissal 
federal guidelines on workers with aids were issued in march 
when opm director constance horner said the federal government 
as an enlightened and compassionate employer concerned with the 
health and welfare of its employees has an obligation to show the 
way in addressing the realities of the aids epidemic 
the justice department says gregory was fired not because of his 
illness but because of the 30 days work he has missed since he was 
hired as a clerktypist last july gregory says most of the missed 
days were spent participating in the experimental nih program 
hes not being singled out said department spokesman brad 
marman he was discharged because he could not perform the job on 
a fulltime basis adequately 
marman told the post that gregory was considered a probationary 
employee when he was hired although both he and gregorys 
supervisor would not talk in detail about his case 
diagnosed as having aidsrelated complex in october 1987

exotic livestock breeds including soviet 
sheep that reproduce much more quickly than american breeds could 
lower us meat prices if they were available here an agriculture 
department official says 
the american public should therefore demand that the government 
establish a program to gather and evaluate different breeds of 
livestock from abroad said the official keith gregory of the us 
meat animal research service part of the departments agricultural 
research service 
it is in the public interest to have such a program gregory 
said tuesday 
the agriculture department is spending 26 million this year in 
an ongoing effort to gather store and evaluate cultivated and wild 
plants so that breeders will have a kind of library of genetic 
traits to choose from in developing improved food crops gregory 
said 
such a program has never been developed to provide what can be 
thought of as gene banks for livestock breeders gregory said 
the federal government should step in because commercial 
breeders have neither the capital nor the expertise to collect and 
evaluate exotic livestock species gregory said he spoke at a 
press conference held in conjunction with the agricultural research 
services annual scientific symposium in beltsville 
the departments efforts to conserve plant germplasm 
genetic material that can be used to regenerate plants has been 
criticized as inadequate 
department scientists agree that the plant germplasm collection 
and storage system should be expanded but they say it is difficult 
to convince other government officials and the public of the need 
for additional funds 
the office of management and budget recently acted to hold next 
years budget equal to the current 26 million said henry shands 
coordinator of the national plant germplasm system officials had 
hoped for an increase 
usda has not developed the clientele to insure that these 
programs get the support they require said lawrence busch a 
sociologist at the university of kentucky who specializes in 
agricultural issues 
of the various animals raised for meat in the united states the 
turkey is the only one native to this country and it was bred in 
europe before becoming established here gregory said 
he noted for example that romanov sheep from the soviet union 
and finn sheep from finland reproduce much more quickly than 
traditional us breeds 
those are two sources of genes that might enable us to 
increase the breeding rate gregory said a higher breeding rate 
means lower production costs and ultimately lower costs for the 
consumer 
the two breeds have their drawbacks they produce less wool and 
it is of lower quality he said nevertheless their genes could be 
useful in the development of improved breeds he said 
bringing such animals into the country involves expensive 
quarantining procedures that can last years gregory said 
in the case of sheep for example the animals must be kept in 
complete isolation for five years to be certain they dont carry 
the scrapie virus a potentially devastating disease only then can 
breeding experiments begin 
recent advances in biotechnology now allow sperm and embryos to 
be frozen providing new means of storing genetic resources 
research also suggests that it might be possible to wash frozen 
embryos so that they are free of viruses thus eliminating costly 
quarantines gregory said

an interior department report says there has 
been environmental damage from oil drilling in alaska but 
apparently nothing to scuttle an administration request to open the 
arctic national wildlife refuge to petroleum development a 
congressional aide says 
the report has been withheld from congress however and the 
copies of the report have been made available only through 
unofficial channels say aides to rep george miller dcalif 
miller is chairman of the house interior water and power 
resources subcommittee considering the administration request to 
allow oil rigs in the nations largest wildlife refuge 
in april 1987 miller had requested a report from the fish and 
wildlife service on the environmental impact of drilling in 
alaskas north slope 
millers aides said tuesday the report prepared by the services 
fairbanks office was completed and sent to the interior department 
last december but never sent to miller 
philip million a spokesman for the fish and wildlife service 
said tuesday night he had not seen the report but said he had been 
told that it was a regional report prepared in alaska and there 
were disagreements within the regional office on the conclusions 
reached in that report 
million said the report either has been or is being modified 
but that he didnt know what conclusions the final version will 
draw 
the report deals with existing drilling activities at prudhoe 
bay about 70 miles west of the refuge and the transalaska 
pipeline 
the information from the report did not represent any smoking 
gun that could by itself torpedo the administrations request 
for permission to drill in the refuge the aide said 
what makes this such a big deal is they sat on it said the 
aide who spoke only on condition of anonymity 
another aide commented the real issue is whether congress is 
being told the whole story theyre not 
the new report by the fairbanks office supports some testimony 
given to congress that populations of predators like bears and 
wolves have diminished since prudhoe opened the decline has been 
blamed on the arrival of an industrial complex and illegal hunting 
but the document also said the caribou herd in the area has 
grown during development of prudhoe and that no major oil spills 
had occurred 
the report said air pollution has been a problem at prudhoe but 
said that dust has been more of a problem than chemical pollutants 
the miller aides said 
they added that the report cited pollution of fresh water 
because of drilling operations and alterations in natural fresh 
water flows because of construction 
in testimony before congressional committees considering the 
future of the refuge interior department witnesses have 
acknowledged problems at prudhoe with environmental protection and 
enforcement but they said prudhoe has improved in recent years and 
those lessons would be applied to any drilling in the refuge 
millers aides related that another section of the report said 
22500 birds were lost or displaced from prudhoe 
the aides noted however that the report did not tell another 
side of the prudhoe story it has produced 5 billion barrels of oil 
and brought about 100 billion worth of economic benefits to the 
nation 
millers subcommittee has tentatively scheduled another round of 
hearings on the refuge question for early next month bills to open 
the refuge have been approved by the house merchant marine and 
fisheries committee and the senate energy and natural resources 
committee 
the reagan administration and the oil industry have been pushing 
congress since the start of 1987 to allow development on the 
refuge which they say may hold oil deposits to rival prudhoe bays 
and which could help alleviate the nations growing dependence on 
imported oil

to canadian finance minister michael wilson the 
oct 19 stock market crash was a bracing tap on the shoulder 
but there is no cause for alarm about the world economy 
the economic summit of the group of seven major industrialized 
countries to be held in toronto on june 1921 is therefore likely 
to reaffirm current policies rather than adopt sweeping new 
initiatives wilson told a group of foreign correspondents tuesday 
i wouldnt look for major new statements major new 
decisions he said 
but in another presummit briefing the governmentfunded 
economic council of canada took a much gloomier view of economic 
realities 
the councils deputy chairman harvey lazar said failure to 
correct the fundamental disequilibrium in the world economy 
evidenced by continued huge us deficits points toward another 
economic shock he feared a hard landing in which interest 
rates will soar along with unemployment 
weve gotten off relatively easy so far lazar said of the 
surprising resilience of major economies following the market 
crash the question is whether between now and the election of a 
new us government the world can somehow muddle through there 
remains a serious risk we may not 
he said the united states must either raise taxes or slash 
spending to attack its deficits but either course is unlikely in 
the final months of ronald reagans presidency 
with that major problem untackled lazar said the summits 
scope is pretty limited 
wilson maintained that since the october crash the group of 
seven countries the united states japan west germany france 
britain italy and canada have patched up differences and 
cooperated to stabilize markets 
he also pointed to a clear shift in the us economy from 
consumption to exports while japan and west germany have moved to 
increase imports to shave their trade surpluses 
inflationary pressures on a worldwide basis arent there he 
said adding that the recent upward creep of interest rates 
should not derail group of seven policies 
but senior forecaster ross preston of the independentlyrun 
economic council said were still lacking a true consensus about 
how to manage international economic policy 
he said that since the mid1970s people have been resistant 
to face up to the fact that real growth has declined 
with macroeconomic fiscal and monetary policies fixed 
canadian officials said the summit will likely focus on 
microeconomic structural factors such as tax reform 
deregulation and privatization 
reform of land prices and the goods distribution system in 
japan the extension of shopping hours in west germany and tax 
incentives to boost the level of bank savings in the united states 
are examples of micro initiatives that could have a major 
impact sylvia ostry canadas ambassador for multilateral trade 
negotiations told reporters 
she said summit leaders may discuss a proposal for the general 
agreement on tariffs and trade which governs world trade to 
monitor microeconomic factors in the same way the international 
monetary fund surveys macroeconomic policies 
wilson said he saw no need for changes in canadas interest rate 
or other economic policies despite the latest figures showing 
domestic growth stalled in january and february after 39 percent 
real growth in the gross domestic product last year 
were still nicely on track and i see no reason to change

gen manuel antonio noriega met with 
his american lawyers to discuss fighting us drug trafficking 
indictments against him one said the general was encouraged at how 
the case is going 
two florida attorneys met on tuesday with the general who has 
survived us economic and other pressures aimed at forcing him to 
resign as head of the nations 15000strong defense forces and 
leave panama 
the lawyers are raymond takiff and frank rubino who were 
contracted by noriega after he was indicted in florida in february 
after the meeting rubino described noriega the power behind 
the civilian government as very encouraged by developments in 
the case and very confident about having weathered us 
pressure to oust him 
according to noriega the reagan administration wants him out 
because of his opposition to what he calls efforts in the united 
states to retain control of the panama canal under the 1977 canal 
treaties the united states must relinquish control of the canal by 
midnight dec 31 1999 
noriega won his first legal battle last month when us district 
judge william hooveler ruled he did not have to appear in court in 
florida for hearings on his challenge of the indictments 
the us government has imposed economic sanctions on panama and 
encouraged domestic dissent in an effort to force the ouster of 
noriega 
washington still recognizes the presidency of eric arturo 
delvalle who has been in hiding since his ouster feb 26 a day 
after he tried to fire the general who has led the defense forces 
since 1983

nicaraguan indian rebel leaders their 
support from the united states shrinking resumed peace talks with 
sandinista government officials aimed at restoring some of their 
native rights 
we have sought dialogue with the sandinista government because 
our people are in a very difficult situation and because aid 
approved by the american congress has diminished said brooklyn 
rivera a leader of the yatama organization of nicaraguas 
caribbean coast indians 
in honduras the government has closed our rearguard and has 
adopted a hostile attitude against our organization while the 
americans say we are acting against our own interests and have cut 
aid rivera told the associated press on tuesday when talks 
resumed 
rivera began negotiating in february with interior minister 
tomas borge who heads a national commission on autonomy for the 
caribbean coast they failed to reach concrete agreements in a 
meeting in march but we delved deeper into the proposals made 
by both sides rivera said 
yatama which claims to have 2000 guerrillas has fought the 
sandinistas for regional autonomy along the coast the indians also 
resisted any exercise of authority over them by the rightist 
proamerican somoza dynasty which ruled nicaragua for 42 years 
until the sandinistas came to power in 1979 
the indian organization does not belong to the nicaraguan 
resistance the umbrella group of the contras as the largest rebel 
group is known the resistance is engaged in separate peace talks 
with the leftist government 
wicliffe diego one of five yatama directors was suspended for 
forming an alliance with the resistance said stedman fagoth 
muller another yamata leader 
yatama arose from the disintegration of misurasata an 
organization of miskito sumo and rama indians factionalism has 
marked the indian struggle against the sandinistas since fighting 
began in 1981 when the government tried to impose authority on the 
isolated traditionally independent coastal region 
rivera noted that the sandinistas formerly viewed autonomy talks 
as counterrevolutionary but said their attitude had changed 
still the two sides differ over the definition of indian selfrule 
what the sandinistas propose is decentralization of power but 
through its representatives in the region rivera said 
we want to elect our own authorities and organize the indian 
nation according to our customs and tradition he added we 
want our community borders to be as our grandfathers made them and 
not in a mechanical form 
yatama presented borge with an autonomy proposal on monday 
that is basic to talks for a permanent ceasefire rivera said 
the talks are due to end thursday 
rivera said a truce signed a week ago by a few yatama leaders 
was not significant and was not authorized

a telephone caller said 200 
dissident nicaraguan rebels have declared they will no longer take 
orders from the insurgents military commander enrique bermudez 
the call to the associated press on tuesday reflected divisions 
among the usbacked insurgents during stalemated negotiations 
between the rebels known as contras and the leftist sandinista 
government 
it could not be determined if the caller who did not identify 
himself represented a substantial number of guerrillas opposed to 
bermudez 
he said the dissidents also demanded the removal of eight other 
military leaders of the nicaraguan resistance the main 
8000strong rebel force that fought the nicaraguan government 
before a recent truce 
before he left miami for honduras on tuesday bermudez 
acknowledged to reporters that there had been a rebellion and 
hinted forceful action might be needed to end the mutiny the miami 
herald reported in todays editions 
a contra official in san jose speaking on condition of 
anonymity told the ap on tuesday it was believed bermudez would 
come to meet with the dissidents 
the caller did not say where the dissidents were located but 
the washington post reported on tuesday that up to 3000 dissident 
rebels have been holed up at a honduran base camp since saturday 
it said the camp is in yamales a tiny honduran village three miles 
from the nicaraguan border 
there has been constant friction among contras who served in the 
national guard of the late rightwing president anastasio somoza 
and groups who had fought to overthrow somoza 
the sandinistas gained power after defeating somozas national 
guard in a civil war that ended in july 1979 many somoza 
supporters fled into neighboring honduras where they established 
military camps and were later joined by nicaraguans who said the 
sandinistas had betrayed the revolution 
members of both groups formed the nicaragua resistance about 
eight years ago and began guerrilla operations inside nicaragua 
the telephone caller said the dissidents were demanding the 
resignations of bermudez and eight other rebel military commanders 
because we disavow them as corrupt and assure the nicaraguan 
people that we the workers campesinos and students who form the 
army of the resistance will not allow corrupt and dishonest people 
in our ranks who want to return to the past 
the caller said the dissidents recognized the authority of rebel 
military leaders diogenes hernandez membreno walter calderon 
lopez encarnacion valdivia and tirzo roman moreno 
calderon lopez valdivia and roman moreno were among seven 
contra leaders expelled from honduras on friday after demanding 
that bermudez resign 
bosco matamoros a nicaraguan resistance spokesman in honduras 
declined comment on the telephone call 
earlier he denied the post report that up to 3000 contras 
taking orders from hernandez membreno had been holed up in a 
honduran base camp since saturday and were refusing to take orders 
from the resistance leadership 
matamoros said on monday that contra political and military 
representatives met on sunday at a camp ner the hondurannicaraguan 
border to try to resolve the disputes among the contras 
bermudez reportedly opposes the 60day ceasefire agreement 
signed march 23 by contra and government representatives 
the pact calls for additional negotiations to make the truce 
permanent the last peace talks ended april 30 in managua and no 
date or location has been set for another round

iowa democratic chairwoman bonnie 
campbell abandoning months of neutrality in the partys 
presidential nomination race planned to endorse massachusetts gov 
michael dukakis today an associate said 
the move is a signal that the partys establishment considers 
dukakis an almost certain bet to win the nomination and is closing 
ranks behind him 
the endorsement comes on the eve of the partys congressional 
district conventions saturday at which 34 delegates will be picked 
to attend the democratic national convention in atlanta 
it gives a boost to the dukakis forces who have been quietly 
trying to build support in the state since their candidate finished 
third in the feb 8 precinct caucuses 
missouri rep richard gephardt who won the caucuses has 
dropped from the race and secondplace finisher sen paul simon of 
illinois has suspended his campaign 
ms campbell scheduled a statehouse news conference to make the 
announcement she will be joined by at least two other party 
officials who are also to endorse dukakis 
ms campbells associate who spoke on condition of anonymity 
said her endorsement is aimed at unifying the state party behind

democratic frontrunner michael dukakis is using 
secret service protection beginning today after relying for more 
than a year on local police on the presidential campaign trail 
campaign aides said the timing was the result of several 
considerations including dukakis increasing prominence near the 
end of what has become a twoman democratic race with jesse jackson 
the massachusetts governor said there have been no incidents or 
threats that prompted the change however he said there comes a 
point in all of this when secret service protection is necessary 
and in my judgment ive arrived at that point 
in addition aides said there was some concern inside the 
campaign about the potential for violence in california 
particularly in light of recent publicity marking 20 years since 
the assassination of robert f kennedy after his victory in the

from ohios congressional delegation to a meeting today to push for 
support for sen john glenn as a vice presidential candidate 
jim hart applegates administrative assistant said the meeting 
would take place would take place in washington 
at this point its time we probably turn our heads as to who 
will be the vice presidential nominee mr michael dukakis 
appears to have the nomination in the back pocket now one of mr 
applegates main themes has been that we need someone in white 
house who will be a friend to us to look out for our benefit hes 
always been a big supporter of john glenn said hart 
asked if applegate has told glenn about the meeting hart said 
not to my knowledge 
glenn who failed in a bid for the democratic presidential 
nomination in 1984 has not discouraged speculation about the no 2 
spot on the ticket 
dukakis has refused to be talk about who he might choose as his 
running mate if nominated for president

that a testfiring of a fullsize booster rocket has been 
successfully completed 
royce mitchell project manager of the booster program at the 
marshall space flight center in huntsville ala said on tuesday 
the april 20 test showed nothing that would stand in the way of the 
flight scheduled for august 
the redesigned rockets must pass two more fullduration firings 
one in june and one in july before they receive final 
certification the boosters built by morton thiokol inc are 
tested at that companys plant in utah 
a faulty morton thiokol booster rocket was blamed for the 
january 1986 disaster in which the challenger was destroyed and its 
crew of seven killed

a union official says an appeals court ruling 
that local officials must inspect school buildings for 
cancercausing asbestos is a tremendous victory for the health of 
children and school employees 
gerald w mcentee president of the american council of 
federation of state county and municipal employees said the 
government regulations upheld by a federal court here tuesday 
should be applied in all public and commercial buildings 
the us circuit court of appeals dismissed a challenge to the 
environmental protection agency regulations by a trade group that 
complained the rules failed to set a safe level of exposure to 
airborne particles of asbestos 
this argument is meritless a threejudge panel said 
congress explicitly recognized that experts presently disagree 
over what levels of exposure are safe 
epas regulations require schools to conduct visual inspections 
of asbestoscontaining building materials to determine if they are 
damaged undamaged asbestos is not believed to pose a health risk

the worlds first two reported successful 
attempts to transplant parts of the same liver into different 
patients are big steps toward overcoming the chronic donor organ 
shortage say transplant surgeons 
dr henri bismuth a liver transplant surgeon at paul brousse 
hospital in paris reported here tuesday that he had no choice but 
to divide the liver of a 40yearold braindead man for two women 
both unconscious and near death 
the procedure performed may 1 is believed to be the second in 
the world according to dr christoph e broelsch professor of 
surgery at the university of chicago the previous one was 
performed in february in west germany 
this is one way to increase the donors if you have patients 
who are terribly ill and in equal need its one way out said 
the university of pittsburghs dr thomas e starzl who performed 
the worlds first successful liver transplant in 1967 
i can see this happening at our institution anytime soon if we 
have the appropriate setting broelsch said in a telephone 
interview 
about 450 people are awaiting liver transplants in the united 
states according to arthur harrell of the american council on 
transplantation about half are children 
in this months transplant the donor had been rushed to france 
from switzerland and was a suitable match for either the 40 or 
54yearold woman 
unable to choose between the women bismuth transplanted half 
the liver into each patient because the liver is the only organ in 
the body that can regenerate itself it grows naturally along with 
the body after being reduced in size 
bismuth told about 100 physicians from around the world gathered 
in pittsburgh for a conference on liver disease that both of his 
patients transplanted livers are functioning well 
one of the women however is still critically ill because of 
kidney and lung complications she suffered before surgery 
on feb 2 dr rudolf pichlmayr of the university of hannovers 
medical school in west germany performed a similar splitliver 
transplant 
pichlmayr said he like bismuth was desperate to save two 
patients lives even though just one liver was available as a 
result he split the liver of a 23yearold man and transplanted 
half into a 2yearold boy and the other half into a 63yearold 
woman 
both recipients are back home and doing well pichlmayr said in 
a telephone interview from west germany early today 
i guess the risk for both recipients will be a little bit 
higher so i think its a step forward but its only a step 
forward if one cannot manage the donor problem pichlmayr said 
its an enormous need for livers in our country he said 
we have too few donors so we have to take all the maneuvers to 
get more livers particularly of course for the small children 
in recent years pichlmayr and other doctors in europe and the 
united states have trimmed livers so the organs can fit into 
transplant patients particularly children for whom donor organs 
are most scarce 
its of course a pity to throw away the other half of the 
liver pichlmayr said 
split liver transplants are more complicated than simply paring 
down the organ because doctors need to divide a common artery and 
bile duct pichlmayr said as a result half the split organ is 
often weaker than the other 
broelsch said the oneyear success rate is about 50 percent to 
60 percent for children who receive reducedsize livers compared 
with 80 percent to 90 percent for those who receive an entire organ 
the risk for splitliver transplants will likely be even greater 
and until more is known will remain a method of last resort 
doctors said 
nevertheless its a big step starzl said

charges against china of genocide and 
repression of tibetans were aired by congressmen even as a chinese 
vice premier was meeting president reagan and other us government 
officials 
the congressional human rights caucus heard the accusations of 
abuses in chineseruled tibet during a hearing that in an apparent 
coincidence began at the same hour tuesday that chinese vice 
premier tian jiyun was at the white house talking with reagan 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said the reagantiang 
meeting centered on trade but fitzwater did not say whether human 
rights issues were raised the state department said also said a 
meeting tuesday between tiang and secretary george shultz centered 
largely with economic matters 
reps ben gilman rny and frank mccloskey dind told the 
human rights panel they are introducing legislation for economic 
sanctions against china linked to human rights abuses in the 
himalayan region of tibet 
gilman said his bill would ban us support of credit for china 
from international lending agencies and would provide for voice of 
america broadcasts in the tibetan language and for us aid for 
tibetan refugees and for preserving tibetan culture 
the us recognizes tibet only as a part of china and the state 
department does not require its officials in the region to have a 
knowledge of the tibetan language mccloskey said that leaves the 
us indirectly aiding and abetting in the extinction of tibetan 
culture mccloskey said 
actor richard gere president of new yorks tibet house told 
the panel china has an ugly solution for the tibetan problem 
providing for total annihilation of the tibetan people as a race 
as a culture probably within one generation 
the 35 years since the entrance of chinese forces into the 
himalayan territory have brought one of the most devastating 
genocides we have had in history on the order of cambodia 
under the khmer rouge in the 1970s said gere 
rep tom lantos dcalif cochairman of the caucus said he 
hopes the reagan administration raises human rights with chinese 
leaders because the issue will not disappear 
the cost of human rights violations to the chinese will be 
increased year after year after year until they realize it will be 
not only in the interest of the tibetan people but of the chinese 
themselves to put an end to those barbaric practices he said 
after the hearing and while tian was having lunch with us 
trade representative clayton yeutter members of the caucus and 
thubten jigme norbu brother of the dalai lama the tibetan 
spiritual leader in exile inaugurated a tibetan art antiques and 
photographic exhibit at a congressional office building norbu is a 
professor at the university of indiana

glasnost and an afternoon tea with raisa 
gorbachev have led sothebys to arrange the first modern 
international art auction in the soviet union 
when sothebys gavel falls at the july 7 auction in moscow 
soviet artists whose works werent officially recognized three 
years ago will find themselves in the distinctly capitalist 
position of selling their work to the highest bidder 
they all saw this as an opportunity to get international 
exposure and were quite titillated to have their work auctioned by 
sothebys said simon de pury sothebys managing director in 
europe who will serve as auctioneer 
in addition to 100 works by 29 living artists 18 paintings by 
five artists from the russian avant garde period of 19101940 will 
be on the block 
with price estimates ranging from 3500 to 35000 sothebys 
expects the sale of contemporary art alone to total about 1 
million 
many of the artists until a year or two ago were 
unofficial artists who had difficulty exhibiting and exporting 
their work said de pury who proposed the sale this has all 
changed with glasnost 
ronald feldman a manhattan art dealer said that with mikhail 
gorbachevs policy of openness you can now step in and buy 
paintings before everyone was in the smuggling business 
in many ways this is a revolution going on here 
the distinction between official and unofficial artists 
has faded and the auction virtually erases it he said 
sothebys was well positioned to be the first auction house to 
be allowed to set up at least for one auction in the soviet union 
de pury had worked with soviet cultural officials in his former 
capacity as curator of the thyssenbornemisza collection in 
switzerland arranging exchanges with the soviets 
in august at tea with mrs gorbachev he broached the subject 
of an auction when i mentioned the possibility the first time 
to my amazement they were intrigued and said it was worth 
exploring there was a definite interest de pury recalled 
de pury said he had a free hand in selecting the contemporary 
works for the auction and he roamed moscow and other cities 
visiting studios and picking paintings 
its a very lively vital group of artists whose works have 
been fought over by museums and collectors in the west he said 
for the artists feldman said the prices they may get are 
secondary to their desire to have their work seen in the west to 
be known in the west 
soviet officials presented a list of avantgarde works that 
could be sold and sothebys selected from that 
highlights of the collection will be shown for five days in new 
york starting saturday then in london may 2224 paris may 
2627 cologne may 31june 3 and zurich june 915 
customers planning to attend the auction in moscow can sign up 
for a special program of visits to the artists studios as well as 
lectures museum tours and evening entertainment 
among the more established contemporary artists whose work will 
be sold are ilya kabakov ivan chuikov vladimir yankilevsky and 
edward steinberg 
the avantgarde section includes seven works by alexander 
rodchenko and four by varvara stepanova the most valuable on sale 
are rodchenkos line estimated to sell for about 200000 and 
a gouache composition of his from 1916 which sothebys thinks will 
fetch about 130000 
we will have to see how the sale goes de pury said it 
could possibly lead to other auctions this could be an annual 
event or biannual 
nearly all of the contemporary artists represented in the 
auction live in moscow though artists from leningrad and soviet 
georgia also have their works up for sale

a california companys claim to have isolated 
an elusive virus responsible for a type of blood transfusion 
disease called nona nonb hepatitis received a mixed greeting 
from a pair of government scientists 
a number of researchers over the years have claimed to have 
found it the virus but it has never been confirmed said dr 
palmer mccurdy assistant director of blood disease research at the 
national heart lung and blood institute a part of the national 
institutes of health 
robert purcell a hepatitis specialist at the nih told the 
washington post the companys announcement is very important if 
it holds up and the data looks like it will 
both scientists were responding to the announcement tuesday from 
chiron corp of emeryville calif the biotechnology firm also 
announced its scientists are developing a test for the virus that 
can be used at blood banks 
if the test proves successful it could allow blood contaminated 
with the virus to be detected and thus prevent transmission of the 
disease through blood transfusions 
the company said the finding eventually could lead to a vaccine 
to combat the disease 
nona nonb hepatitis is known as transfusion hepatitis 
because it causes about 95 percent of the hepatitis that is 
associated with blood transfusions 
about 3 million people a year are infected with the disease but 
it often goes undiagnosed said mccurdy because unlike hepatitis 
a or b it often does not cause jaundice 
he said up to 2 percent of those who develop chronic cases of 
transfusion hepatitis develop serious and often fatal liver 
damage 
mccurdy said he had not seen the chiron findings published in 
any scientific journal and was not aware of the companys 
discovery he said most such discoveries are not considered valid 
until they are confirmed in other labs or examined by other 
experts prior to publication in a process called peer review 
a chiron announcement said the research results would be 
published in the near future the company also said it had not 
yet filed application with the us food and drug administration 
for investigative research of its blood test kit but plans to do 
so later this year 
i think they have got it this time purcell was quoted as 
saying this is a firstrate group at a good company and they 
have been working on it for six years with very sophisticated 
molecular techniques 
chiron announced that the nona nonb virus was isolated by 
removing all of the genetic material from a chimpanzee blood sample 
that had a high level of the virus the genetic material was then 
inserted into laboratory bacteria which following instructions 
from the transplanted genes produced proteins 
antibodies from the blood of hepatitis patients was then placed 
in the protein broth these antibodies attached themselves to the 
proteins that originated from the nona nonb virus genes the 
researchers then detected this attachment indicating that the 
virus had been isolated

former gov richard b ogilvie who won a battle 
for illinois first income tax only to lose the states highest 
office after one term has died at age 65 
ogilvie a lawyer and the states gop governor from 1969 to 
1973 died at northwestern memorial hospital on tuesday a day 
after he underwent emergency surgery for a massive heart attack 
he always spoke his mind and had the strength of character to 
stand behind issues he believed in such as the states first 
income tax said gov james r thompson 
oglivies wife dorothy daughter elizabeth and her husband 
were at the hospital when he died 
funeral plans were not announced 
ogilvies 1972 reelection loss to dan walker was attributed in 
part to the 1969 enactment of the states first income tax which 
established a 25 percent tax rate for individuals and a 4 percent 
rate for corporations 
he made very tough decisions he didnt measure the political 
effect of them many times and some of them hurt him former sen 
charles percy rill said late tuesday 
walker who edged ogilvie with 51 percent of the vote is 
serving a sevenyear federal prison sentence for bank fraud that 
occurred after he left office 
ogilvie took office a year after the 1968 riots at the 
democratic national convention in chicago 
in his final state of the state address to the general assembly 
in 1973 ogilvie listed among his accomplishments the enactment of 
the tax reorganization of the government and the curtailment of 
civil disorders 
among his failures he said were the inability to secure the 
enactment of merit selection of judges and a lag in enforcement of 
antipollution rules for lake michigan 
in recent years ogilvie had become much soughtafter in 
untangling complicated legal matters including the milwaukee road 
bankruptcy proceedings considered one of the most successful rail 
bankruptcy reorganizations 
he was named trustee of the chicago missouri amp western railway 
co which has been under federal bankruptcy reorganization since 
april 
mayor eugene sawyer had been preparing to name ogilvie chairman 
of the chicago housing authority the citys troubled public 
housing agency

the 133foot ark royal was released tuesday afternoon after 
michael rogerson president of the california company that owns the 
vessel paid 1600 in fines and fees and agreed not to hold the 
government responsible 
the ms mindy a 600000 52foot sportfishing boat owned by 
the cigarette racing team of north miami was seized monday as it 
returned from the bahamas and docked in port salerno the coast 
guard announced tuesday 
us customs service agents turned up cocaine residue on a 
dollar bill and traces of marijuana in a plastic bag according to 
the coast guard 
neither person aboard the ms mindy ships captain lewis 
shaver and an unidentified first mate was charged with drug 
possession 
also seized under the policy last week was a 68foot shrimper 
officials have not decided whether to pursue civil forfeiture of 
the boat or allow a fine to paid as in the case of the ark royal 
said leon guinn assistant regional customs supervisor 
rogerson president of the tomima corp and chairman of the 
rogerson aircraft corp criticized the policy in a statement 
tuesday by his office in irvine calif 
this type of action presents an unreasonable danger to all 
boat owners for the isolated actions of passengers and crew he 
said the seizure of this vessel for the apparent individual 
actions of a crewmember against the stated policy of the 
corporation and the vessel for minute traces makes no sense 
under the policy which went into effect april 15 vessels with 
drugs on board are seized by the coast guard and turned over to the 
customs service no matter how petty the drug offense how 
valuable the boat or if a shrimpers family depends on the living 
he makes from the boat 
civil libertarians say the policy puts punishment before the 
trial 
whats wrong with it is the same thing thats wrong with 
shooting someone or hanging someone and then saying were going 
to give you a trial to see if youre guilty said james powell 
national legal director for the american civil liberties union 
michael sheehan a spokesman for the miami customs office said 
it was obvious that the program is strict stringent and tough 
however zero tolerance is also fair reasonable and 
judicious sheehan said that has been pointed out by the 
release of the ark royal 
fewer than 10 percent of vessels seized by the government are 
ever returned to owners the ark royal was in that minority because 
its owner moved swiftly and filed a convincing petition customs 
officials said 
the yachts crew had undergone drug testing before being hired 
said rogerson who was not aboard the vessel when it was seized in 
international waters and the government was unable to charge any 
of the six crew members with possession of the 10 marijuana seeds 
or two stems discovered by the coast guard when it boarded the boat 
saturday 
david phelps and his two crewmen were arrested and charged with 
misdemeanor possession of marijuana when phelps 68foot shrimper 
returned a week ago tuesday from an eightday trip 
the miss lorraine carried 1750 pounds of shrimp and a few 
marijuana seeds the coast guard discovered during a routine safety 
check authorities said phelps and his two crewmen said the 
marijuana was from a previous crew 
what is a captain supposed to do frisk the crew and strip the 
passengers asked capt thom antoszewski one of the bitter 
fishermen who say their livelihoods and human rights are 
jeopardized by the policy 
several key west boat captains have drafted forms for their crew 
to sign in which they swear they wont bring drugs aboard

two men extradited from hong kong to face drug 
smuggling charges here said laotian officials supervise heroin 
production there and take a cut of the proceeds according to court 
documents 
the allegations which name no specific officials but referred 
to a big official who was in charge of the upcountry 
province were contained in affidavits requesting the extradition 
of cheng ahkai 60 of hong kong and wichai chaiwisan 55 of 
thailand 
the defendants are charged with shipping 70 pounds of heroin to 
an undercover agent in new york they were arrested in hong kong in 
march and waived extradition 
they arrived here tuesday night and were to be arraigned today 
us attorney andrew j maloney said tuesday the two claimed 
they needed permission from the communist ruled laotian government 
to manufacture heroin and that officials received payments of 
approximately 2000 for every 700 grams of heroin produced 
in a secretly recorded conversation with an informant the two 
said that laotian officials also supervised the production to 
ensure they were not cheated according to the affidavits 
this is the first prosecutable case in the united states which 
actively discusses the possible involvement of laotian government 
officials in drug trade said robert stutman head of the drug 
enforcement administrations new york office 
an official with the permanent united nations mission for the 
laos peoples democratic republic disputed the allegations 
the government does not encourage the laos people to grow or 
to produce or to trade in opium or heroin said s sisouvong a 
third secretary at the laos un mission 
he said the southeast asian government fully supported the 
elimination of illicit drug trafficking and was trying to encourage 
laotians to grow crops like rice and vegetables 
dea intelligence sources have reported that the production of 
opium the base for heroin had increased in laos to more than 250 
metric tons in 1987 from 50 metric tons in 1984 according to 
stutman 
this type of growth cant go on without someone in the 
government knowing about it and approving it maloney said 
stutman said us officials would have problems pursuing the 
matter because there was not much contact between the united states 
and laos 
cheng and wichai were believed to have been involved in the 
importation of heroin to the united states for more than 20 years 
according to maloney he said they received much of their supply in 
laos 
the case began in january 1987 when the dea learned that cheng 
was seeking a new route to smuggle heroin into the united states 
maloney said 
through a confidential informant in hong kong the dea set up a 
series of negotiations with an undercover agent who posed as an 
organized crime figure with connections at kennedy international 
airport here 
these negotiations resulted in the shipment from bangkok of 70 
pounds of heroin valued at 50 million which arrived at kennedy 
on jan 16 concealed in a shipment of brass animal figures 
authorities said 
cheng and wichai were charged in a threecount indictment 
handed up feb 9 alleging conspiracy to import heroin and 
importation of heroin they face up to life in prison if convicted 
stutman said the investigation abroad was continuing

companies with 20 or more computer 
terminals would be required to provide employees with work breaks 
eye care special lighting and detachable keyboards under a bill 
approved by the county legislature 
if suffolk county executive patrick halpin signs the bill which 
passed 132 tuesday it would be the first law in the country to 
regulate the terminals in private businesses workplace design 
experts said 
business leaders have sharply criticized the measure charging 
it would be costly to implement and put placing them at a 
competitive disadvantage in the marketplace they contend the bill 
will drive companies out of the county 
mitchell pally a spokesman for the long island association the 
regions largest business organization said the bill threatens 
the continued economic vitality of the community 
were obviously very disappointed and will urge mr halpin to 
veto the bill he said 
the bill is intended to protect the health and safety of 
employees who use video display terminals vdts according to 
legislator john foley sponsor of the bill 
foley calling many offices hightech sweatshops said he 
believed there was a need for regulation 
halpin who must act on the bill within 60 days of its passage 
said he would hold a public hearing before deciding whether to sign 
it 
lawmakers in the long island county approved a similar bill last 
summer but it was vetoed by the acting county executive at the 
time michael a lo grande 
labor unions business leaders and workplace experts from around 
the country said the suffolk bill would serve as a model for other 
municipalities or states 
whether this bill will result in legislation elsewhere is 
unclear but itll rejuvenate a lot of campaigns for vdt standards 
around the country said laura stock associate director of the 
labor occupational health program an advocacy group in berkeley 
calif 
legislator joseph rizzo who abstained from voting said this 
legislation is doing what a union should be doing 
some companies hinted that they may consider areas outside of 
suffolk for future expansion 
we view the law as a potential deterrent to doing business in 
suffolk said bruce reisman a spokesman for new york telephone 
undoubtedly the law would have to be taken into consideration as 
a factor in planning expansions 
new york telephone has 1500 employees in suffolk operators 
and office personnel who use vdts routinely 
optometrist joseph hallick testified at the hearing that many of 
his patients complain that they never needed glasses until they 
started working at vdts 
suffolk companies however argued that there is no evidence 
that the prolonged use of a vdt is harmful to the employee 
it mandates that companies pay 80 percent of the cost of annual 
eye exams and eyewear required for an operator and provide 
15minute work breaks every three hours for employees who work at 
the terminals 
businesses would be given six months from the bills passage 
date to comply if the employer does not comply with the 
regulations the bill provides a basis for an employee to seek 
damages in court

the airline pilots union disputes the national 
transportation safety boards finding that pilot error caused the 
northwest airlines crash in detroit that killed 156 people last 
august 
the ntsb in a report on the accident tuesday faulted the captain 
and copilot of northwest flight 255 for failing to follow the 
proper checklist before takeoff and forgetting to extend the 
planes flaps and slats devices that help provide lift 
the mcdonnell douglas md80 crashed shortly after taking off 
from the detroit airport aug 16 1987 killing 154 people on board 
and two on the ground the only survivor was a 4yearold 
passenger cecelia cichan 
the two pilots that were killed were members of the air line 
pilots association which represents 40000 commercial pilots the 
union said it will continue its own investigation into the accident 
and hinted it may petition the ntsb to reconsider the government 
findings 
the facts will eventually show that theres a gremlin running 
around in the md80 said steven cramer the alpa representative 
at northwest 
cramer was alluding to the contention by the pilots union all 
along that a mechanical failure could have prevented the flaps from 
being set properly even if the pilots forgot to set the flaps a 
warning device was the real culprit because it didnt warn the 
pilots of their error as it was designed to the union says 
the ntsb said the overwhelming evidence was that the two 
pilots capt john r maus 57 of las vegas and copilot david j 
dodds 35 of galena ill forgot to set the flaps and slats 
because they did not properly follow a checklist of preflight 
duties while taxiing before takeoff 
while acknowledging that the accident might have been averted if 
a warning alert had sounded the safety board said the failure of 
the alarm because of an interruption in electrical power was only a 
contributing factor to the accident 
the reason for the absence of electrical power could not be 
determined the safety board said 
mcdonnell douglas has denied any problems with the circuit 
breaker and suggested the pilots may have pulled the breaker to 
keep the alarm from sounding needlessly the ntsb said it could 
establish no evidence that the pilots interfered with the alarm 
system nor find evidence of a mechanical malfunction 
nevertheless the safety board called on the federal aviation 
administration to begin an investigation to determine the 
reliability of such breakers and determine if failures within the 
system can cause such a power shortage 
the thrust of the nstbs findings however was aimed at the 
performance of the two pilots 
as the plane was taxiing the captain failed to maintain 
discipline in the cockpit and did not go through the preflight 
checklists a formal proceeding that requires the copilot to 
verbally acknowledge that each task is performed the board said 
there was no evidence on the cockpit voice recording that the flaps 
had been set nor that several other preflight tasks had been 
performed the board said 
it said that dodd and maus had last undergone formal training in 
cockpit resource management in 1983 when they attended a 3hour 
training session 
the safety board called on the faa to speed up its development 
of guidance to airlines on instituting better training techniques 
on cockpit procedures and flight crew coordination while some 
airlines have such training programs others do not said ntsb 
chairman jim burnett 
among those who sat quietly in the audience at the ntsb 
proceeding was allison maus the widow of the captain who died in 
the crash mrs maus said she felt very badly about the ntsb 
findings because my husband was a good pilot and he knew it 
im very proud of his ability and i feel that hes listening 
and i have to defend him she said

a cabinet minister whose claim that japan was not 
the aggressor in world war ii provoked strong protests from china 
and other asian nations told parliament today the 193745 
sinojapanese war began accidentally 
the minister seisuke okuno told japanese reporters on tuesday 
that he doesnt like to use the word invasion when discussing 
the sinojapanese war because both countries lost millions of 
people in the conflict 
japanese troops overran much of eastern china in the war 
opposition parties have demanded the dismissal of the okuno 
director of the national land agency and called on the 
administration of prime minister noboru takeshita to take 
responsibility for his remarks 
okuno has angered china and other asian nations over the past 
month by saying most recently on monday that japan had no 
aggressive intent during world war ii and had fought to protect 
itself at a time when the white race had turned asia into a 
colony 
chinas foreign ministry said okunos views had caused alarm 
worldwide 
the repeated occurrence of such expressions in japan 
shows there are indeed some people in japan even some people who 
are cabinet ministers who have no intention at all for 
introspection of the past war of aggression ministry spokesman 
li zhaoxing said at a weekly briefing in beijing this cannot but 
alarm all the peaceloving peoples and countries in the world 
asked in parliament today about okunos comments takeshita 
said our country feels deep responsibility for the grave damage 
japan inflicted on the chinese people during the past war we 
believe the government should fully recognize that our countrys 
actions during the war have been criticized severely as 
aggression but he stopped short of saying he agreed that japans 
actions had been aggressive 
during a diet parliament session today okuno said he thought 
the 1937 marco polo bridge incident generally believed to have 
caused the sinojapanese war had occurred by accident 
in comments last month that he reiterated monday okuno also 
said japan should not let the views of asian neighbors stop cabinet 
members from visiting a controversial shinto shrine that honors 
japans war dead 
last month chinas foreign ministry called okunos statements 
astonishing and very regrettable during a visit to china last 
week japanese foreign minister sosuke uno reportedly sought to 
smooth chinese irritations over the remarks 
meanwhile the japan socialist party and komeito clean 
government party began preparing a resolution calling for okunos 
dismissal another opposition party the japan communist party 
decided on tuesday it would demand okunos dismissal news reports 
said 
in the 1937 incident at marco polo bridge 12 miles west of 
beijing japanese troops in the area under a 1901 protocol said 
they heard shots while on routine maneuvers nearby 
after reportedly finding one soldier missing in a roll call 
they began fighting chinese troops who were guarding a nearby town 
several days later japan poured more troops into china and 
hostilities increased 
in recent years asian countries have frequently criticized 
japanese views of its military past 
in 1986 education minister masayuki fujio a member of former 
prime minister yasuhiro nakasones cabinet was dismissed after 
saying korea was partly responsible for its annexation by japan in 
1910 and that japans actions against china in world war ii were 
justifiable 
the remarks brought strong protests from other asian nations 
japans asian neighbors also have complained about the 
governments approval of a school history textbook in 1986 that 
they said whitewashed japans role during the war and its 
censorship of other textbooks that portrayed japans military role 
in a negative light 
an official visit in 1985 by nakasone to yasukuni shrine where 
japans war dead are enshrined also drew sharp criticism from 
countries such as china which said it offended those who suffered 
in the war

clear said robyn hearn a spokesman for the alabama emergency 
management agency no funnel clouds were sighted despite tornado 
warnings

a woman in a house trailer and injured at least 15 people in 
middlesboro a town of 11000 just north of the tennessee border

joe iovine who watched bulldozers clearing debris tuesday from 
a furniture store owned by his family since 1910 said it was 
wiped out in 30 seconds i get to talking about it and it chokes me 
up ive had it 
wilkinson said a preliminary survey showed that 38 businesses 
and 26 homes suffered major damage but that damage was not severe 
enough to warrant a federal disaster area designation 
welch estimating damage in the millions declared an emergency 
shortly after midnight and wilkinson activated 30 national 
guardsmen to help clean up keep the peace and enforce an 8 pm 
curfew in the damaged business district

the champagne flowed as family and friends 
celebrated the murder acquittals of reputed mob boss nicodemo 
little nicky scarfo and eight associates accused of killing a 
gangster rival 
it was a very very brave jury said las vegas lawyer oscar 
goodman at the party in a posh center city hotel hours after 
tuesdays verdicts clearing scarfo and his associates of killing 
salvatore testa on sept 14 l984 
scarfo and his associates were also found innocent of conspiracy 
and possession of an instrument of crime charges brought against 
them by two exmobsters turned informants who said they were part 
of the murder plot 
the revelers sipped 50ashot louis xii cognac and downed 
glasses of 100abottle taittinger champagne to celebrate the 
stunning acquittal 
the acquitted men however did not attend 
they remained in jail without bail under federal indictment 
with nine other scrafo associates on charges of operating a 
criminal enterprise that includes murder extortion drug dealing 
loan sharking and gambling 
no jury in the world is going to accept that kind of perjured 
evidence without some kind of corroborating evidence and in this 
case there was none goodman said on the testimony of informants 
nicholas nicky crow caramandi and thomas tommy del 
delgiorno 
that trial is expected to be held later this year and first 
assistant us attorney thomas lee said the acquittals shouldnt 
affect his case which uses the same charges the federal government 
has brought against organized crime families in boston new york 
and kansas city 
scarfo and other mob associates including a few acquitted with 
him this time are charged in two other murder cases still ahead 
one in philadelphia for the 1985 slaying of frank frankie 
flowers dalfonso and the other the 1978 killing in new jersey 
of former judge edwin helfant 
last december scarfo was found innocent of federal drug 
racketeering charges and the chief evidence against him and six 
associates came from caramandi and delgiorno 
others acquitted with scarfo included his nephew and alleged mob 
underboss philip crazy phil leonetti joseph grande salvatore 
grande francis iannarella salvatore merlino joseph pungitore 
salvatore scafidi and charles iannece 
prosecutor barbara christie fled the city hall courtroom 
avoiding reporters but the office of district attorney ronald 
castille in a brief statement said we are obviously 
disappointed 
i love the american judicial system said scarfos son 
nicodemo jr after the eight women and four men gave their 
verdict in the eighth week of the trial 
he had been in court every day with other relatives giving 
visible support to his 59yearold father a cement contractor in 
atlanic city nj whom federal and state organized crime 
investigators claim heads the philadelphiasouthern jersey mob 
decimated in the past decade by bloody internal warfare arrests 
and convictions 
scarfo has been in prison since his arrest in january 1987 for 
conspiring to extort 1 million from a philadelphia developer he 
is serving a 15year sentence for that federal crime

a meeting between mikhail s gorbachev and 
prominent editors has made clear that a major gathering of 
communist party members next month is expected to fall solidly in 
line behind his reform campaign 
gorbachev told the media and ideology leaders at a meeting at 
the party central committee that old methods of choosing delegates 
to party conferences would be scrapped for the meeting planned june 
28 the first such gathering since 1941 the 5000 people to take 
part should be chosen solely on the basis of their support for the 
reforms gorbachev said 
there must be no more quotas as were the case in the past 
specifying how many factory workers and farmers and how many women 
are to be elected among others gorbachev said the principal 
political directive is to elect active supporters of perestroika to 
go to the conference 
others who spoke at the meeting appeared to endorse that 
approach and declared perestroika gorbachevs effort to 
rebuild soviet society a path from which no one should stray 
the 57yearold party chief met with the media and ideology 
leaders on saturday but full reports on the exchange were released 
by the official tass news agency only tuesday night and early today 
gorbachev complained that conservatism continues to pose the 
biggest threat to his reforms and that the doubters have raised 
questions about whether the nation is turning away from socialism 
some people have indeed lost their bearings amid all these 
processes under way gorbachev said 
some people have failed to keep their heads and panicked and 
the panic and this is very serious has taken the form of asking 
isnt perestroika coming to mean the wrecking and rejection of the 
values of socialism isnt it giving rise to alien phenomena isnt 
it destabilizing society 
yet the 57yearold leader said not everyone who fears his 
reforms or has resisted them should be branded an opponent of 
perestroika 
we found veritable confusion in the minds of many people 
workers intellectuals and administrators alike gorbachev said 
and let us be blunt not only on the ground level but also on 
the top 
he did not make clear whether misunderstandings about his plans 
to bring about a more democratic society and stronger economy 
reached as high as the 13man politburo over which he presides 
the kremlins no 2 man ideologist yegor k ligachev is 
reputed to advocate a more conservative approach to resolving the 
nations problems than gorbachev although the extent of their 
differences is known to few outside the ruling politburo 
the june 28 party conference is expected to change the face of 
the party leadership and replace conservatives with more active 
supporters of perestroika 
it is necessary to rid socialism of everythintg 
pseudosocialist distorted and deformed in the period of the 
personality cult gorbachev said referring to the influences of 
late dictator josef v stalin who ruled the country for 29 years 
before his death in 1953 
gorbachevs call for electing reformists to the party conference 
drew support from the editors and cultural leaders according to 
the tass report 
i would very much wish that the people who with their life and 
deeds have proved their commitment to perestroika by all means 
would get to the party conference and on the contrary that people 
who oppose it who hamper its progress would not be present at the 
conference said kirill lavrov head of the soviet theatrical 
union 
prominent editors such as sergei zalygin of the journal novy mir 
new world and ivan laptiev of the government newspaper izvestia 
said the reforms themselves have introduced new problems and a lot 
of uncertainty 
we should not think that those whom we describe as the mass of 
the people the intellectuals the working class and the peasantry 
that all of them are delighted with perestroika zalygin said 
but he criticized the party and media for at times being poor 
listeners and failing to heed public opinion 
laptiev also blamed the staterun press for some of the problems 
encountered in the reform effort and as an example pointed to the 
media silence and distortion of events in nagornokarabakh a 
region of azerbaijan that ethnic armenians want annexed to their 
republic

prime minister poul schlueter 
resigned today in a bid to form a new centerright coalition after 
an inconclusive parliamentary election called over denmarks 
nucleararms policy and its allegiance to nato 
danish radio said schlueter submitted his resignation to queen 
margrethe ii at amalienborg palace and told her negotiations would 
begin this afternoon 
tuesdays balloting ended in a stalemate in which neither major 
bloc could form a majority government 
schlueters outgoing minority fourparty coalition retained its 
70 seats in the folketing the 179member parliament the socialist 
opposition dropped two seats for a total of 79 
the opposition social democrats denmarks largest party 
touched off the election by pushing through parliament a new 
antinuclear resolution the government refused to implement because 
of strong objections from the north atlantic treaty organization 
the resolution designed to bolster denmarks 1957 peacetime ban 
on nuclear arms calls for notifying visiting warships that such 
weapons were not allowed in port unless the resolution is 
overturned by the new parliament the government will have to carry 
it out after the wording has been determined 
despite the vote the government and the opposition both claimed 
the outcome vindicated their position on the nato issue 
schlueter speaking during a televised postelection roundtable 
discussion with other party leaders tuesday claimed that the four 
coalition parties opposing the april 14 resolution came out best 
the parties that voted for the social democratic resolution on 
nato policy were weakened he said 
schlueter who had called the election just eight months after 
the last one claimed the outcome would ease denmarks crisis in 
nato he had wanted voters to endorse the countrys full 
membership in the western military alliance 
but social democratic leader svend auken insisted there was 
still a majority backing the resolution and said his party would 
work for its implementation in the new parliament 
in reply schlueter invited auken to negotiate with government 
parties a sensible solution to the issue 
until the opposition resolution was passed last month 
successive governments assumed that nato allies abided by denmarks 
nonnuclear policy 
the united states and britain said the new measure if 
implemented would jeopardize their plans to land troops in times 
of crisis to reinforce denmark which controls the narrow access to 
the baltic sea 
they also said the measure threatened the solidarity of nato and 
was against their own policies which forbid disclosure of which 
ships carry nuclear arms 
final results showed 3913318 ballots cast for a turnout of 
858 percent 
schlueters conservatives lost three seats retaining 35 
foreign minister uffe ellemannjensens liberals the senior 
coalition partner won 22 seats three more than it had before 
the coalitions nineseat center democrats and fourseat 
christian peoples party were unchanged 
capturing seven additional seats to total 16 farright progress 
party was the biggest winner shunned by the mainstream parties for 
its antiimmigration campaign it is not expected to join a new 
nonsocialist coalition 
the social democrats stopped their slide from the past two 
elections by capturing 55 seats a gain of one 
the opposition socialist peoples party dropped from 27 to 24 
seats while the farleft common course failed to poll the 2 
percent necessary for representation 
the swing party socialliberals held 10 a loss of one 
two semiindependent territories the faeroe islands and 
greenland each elect two representatives 
a diplomat from a nato country who spoke on condition of 
anonymity said the nuclear issue couldnt come at a worse time 
the election came the day before us secretary of state george 
p shultz was to meet soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze 
in geneva to prepare for a moscow summit in two weeks a perception 
that denmark is wavering in its support of nato could strenghthen 
the soviets hand

theater director yuri lyubimov has returned to the 
soviet union after five years of exile that stemmed from his daring 
presentations at the taganka playhouse he founded 
alexander m yefimovich deputy director of the theater 
confirmed that lyubimov had returned to moscow on sunday as the 
guest of taganka director nikolai gubenko 
yefimovich said on tuesday he had no information about 
lyubimovs plans gubenko and other theater officials did not 
return repeated telephone calls 
lyubimov 70 became an israeli citizen this year he lives in 
jerusalem with his wife katalin and son peter but spends much 
of his time traveling 
in july 1983 lyubimov went to london to stage his avantgarde 
version of fyodor dostoyevskys crime and punishment 
his family was given rare permission to accompany him and 
cultural figures speculated that lyubimov who had spent much of 
his career battling with soviet censors would not be allowed to 
return 
the director extended his stay in london demanding assurances 
that he would have artistic freedom if he returned to the soviet 
union in march 1984 he was dismissed from both the taganka and the 
communist party 
when he left moscow lyubimovs theater was working on a 
production of boris godunov about the troubled eightyear 
reign of the czar who died in 1605 
yefimovich said early in april that lyubimov intended to help 
the taganka company put the finishing touches on boris godunov 
and to take part in opening night in midmay 
on tuesday yefimovich said the premiere now has been scheduled 
for june and lyubimovs visit is purely social 
soviet media hinted last month that lyubimov wanted to visit his 
homeland but took no note of his arrival 
izvestia the government newspaper reported in march that 
lyubimov wished to return to the soviet union to work it quoted 
him as praising soviet leader mikhail s gorbachevs policies of 
allowing freer artistic expression 
in march 1987 lyubimov and other exiled scientists and artists 
wrote an open letter expressing doubts about gorbachevs reform 
program and calling the soviet union a gravely sick country 
it was printed by the weekly moscow news and the writers were 
criticized severely in other official media which accused them of 
wishing evil on their native land

sen sam nunn chairman of the senate armed 
services committee said today the senate could ratify the 
ussoviet nuclear arms agreement in time for the upcoming moscow 
summit if secretary of state george shultz works out disputes in 
talks this week with the soviets 
i think theres still time to get the consent of the senate to 
ratification prior to the summit but these matters have to be 
dealt with the georgia democrat said on abctvs good morning 
america 
senate leaders said this week consideration of the 
intermediaterange nuclear forces treaty would be delayed 
indefinitely because of a dispute between the superpowers over 
verification of settlement accords 
the dispute has almost dashed hopes the inf treaty would be 
ratified by the time president reagan travels to moscow for the may 
29june 2 summit meeting with soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev 
shultz was in geneva today for a longplanned meeting with 
soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze that has taken on 
greater importance because of the verification issue 
nunn said if the impasse is not resolved the treaty could 
languish in the senate well after the summit 
even though i cant visualize these matters not being worked 
out it is possible said nunn unless they are worked out i 
think well have a long delay and no ratification of the treaty 
anytime soon 
nunn said that although the verification provisions under 
dispute are technical issues enough democrats and republicans in 
the senate are concerned to keep the treaty on hold 
it is a serious problem because onsite verification goes to 
the heart not just of this treaty in terms of verifying but also 
future treaties he said 
frankly the military significance of this treaty is marginal 
at best nunn said but the symbolic and precedent kind of 
example here is very important so weve got to clear these matters 
up 
nunn also raised the possibility that the dispute over 
provisions signed by negotiators in december could reflect 
disagreements among soviet officials 
it may be that this is not the top leadership at all but 
rather people who lost their points in the negotiation and now are 
trying to restore those points through obstruction in 
implementation he said

the mayor of durban said today 
that the governing national party suspended him because he opposes 
whitesonly beaches 
henry klotz who was elected mayor of south africas third 
largest city last september said he would rather be ousted from 
the party than retract his support for integration of the entire 
durban beachfront 
the policy of opening facilities must be pursued and i shall 
support it absolutely klotz said in a statement if this means 
my explusion from the national party then so be it 
durban along with cape town is one of south africas two 
largest tourist destinations and its indian ocean beachfront is 
lined with resort hotels 
klotz received a letter from the natal province branch of the 
party on tuesday saying he was being suspended for disloyalty 
because he refused to endorse president pw bothas policy on 
segregated beaches 
botha has supported the integration of some beaches but says 
other beaches should remain exclusively for whites durbans 
beaches reflect this policy most areas have been opened to all 
races but one prime section called south beach remains whitesonly 
klotz said he formerly opposed integration of beaches but now 
felt this step was essential if we are to succeed in becoming a 
truly 21st century cosmopolitan city 
all beaches are the property of all people of durban in 
partnership with visitors from south africa and other countries 
he said i am dutybound to act in the interests of all the 
citizens of this fair city and i shall do so for as long as i am 
able 
the farright conservative party the largest white opposition 
party won three parliamentary byelections in march with a 
campaign platform opposing integrated beaches klotz said he did 
not believe the issue was a key factor in the byelections which 
were held in districts far from the coast 
last week a court in port elizabeth ruled that the city council 
had acted without proper authority in 1966 when it proclaimed the 
local beaches segregated the government promptly appealed the 
ruling and said the beaches would remain segregated until the 
appeal process was completed

the widow of pulitzer prizewinning author john 
cheever is suing a small chicago publishing house to halt 
publication of a new book of short stories due out in september 
her attorney said 
the uncollected short stories of john cheever is set to be 
published by academy chicago which is primarily known for 
importing british mystery novels 
mrs cheever objects to the very cavalier treatment she has 
been given by this publishing company and the cavalier treatment to 
mr cheevers work her attorney martin garbus said tuesday 
the suit will seek to have the contract with academy declared 
invalid because the publisher failed to consult mrs cheever about 
the books content as promised garbus said he said the suit would 
likely be filed by weeks end in either federal or state court in 
manhattan 
mrs cheever particularly objected to a forward by scott 
donaldson professor of literature at the college of william amp mary 
and author of a cheever biography to be published in june by random 
house 
mrs cheever said donaldson was wrong to say that her husbands 
early works were left out because he repudiated his 
apprenticeship and formative years 
she said cheever did not want them used in a 1978 collection and 
would not want them used now because they were embarrassingly 
immature 
mrs cheever also objects to donaldsons interpretation that 
cheevers works were a personal history 
the 550page academy book collects 68 cheever stories written 
for magazines between 1931 and 1981 
academy has already brought the matter before the circuit court 
of cook county in chicago to have the contract declared valid the 
company wants the court to enjoin mrs cheevers from interfering 
with publication 
the author who published his first short story when he was 17 
died in july 1982 at age 70 he won the 1979 pulitzer prize for 
the stories of john cheever a collection of short fiction 
works 
other cheever works include the wapshot chronicle and 
falconer

premier michel rocard appointed a longtime aide as 
his chief of staff today and consulted with senior socialists on 
choosing cabinet ministers in his new government 
president francois mitterrand reelected on sunday appointed 
rocard on tuesday to succeed conservative jacques chirac 
rocard long a rival to mitterrand within the socialist party 
said he would not delay naming his cabinet ministers but it was 
not clear how soon the appointments would come 
the first move by the 57yearold premier was to name jean paul 
huchon his chief of staff huchon was chief of staff to rocard when 
he was planning minister then agriculture minister in socialist 
governments from 198185 
he is first deputy mayor of conflans st honorine the 
workingclass town in the paris suburbs where rocard has been mayor 
since 1977 
it is common in france for senior national officials to keep 
their mayoral posts chirac who was premier for two years has 
been mayor of paris for more than a decade 
mitterrand 71 was reelected to a sevenyear term in a 
landslide victory over chirac on sunday but the success of a new 
government will depend largely on whether the socialists gain the 
confidence of a broad spectrum of voters and backing from 
centrist politicans 
chiracs centerright coalition still controls the 577seat 
national assembly marking the first time in the 30 years of the 
french fifth republic that a government must face a hostile 
parliament 
commentary on rocards appointment was largely favorable in 
french newspapers even those that traditionally support rightist 
policies 
the conservative daily le figaro noted that rocard favored a 
freemarket economy and said he had shown his independent 
spirit by bucking official socialist positions in the past 
former president valery giscard destaing a prominent centrist 
member of the assembly said on tuesday that he was waiting for a 
gesture toward a united france in the composition of rocards 
cabinet 
rocard 57 told reporters tuesday that he would keep in mind 
french peoples concerns for their future for their jobs for 
their education for their security 
he must assemble a government which reflects the socialists 
swing to the center and which can try to work with the conservative 
parliamentary majority 
mitterrand says he will not automatically dissolve the assembly 
to try to gain a leftist majority choosing to try for success with 
the present system he also says the new government will include 
nonsocialists 
the new government is expected to profit from an increasingly 
divided right wing ranging from centrists to ultraright 
presenting himself as frances unifier mitterrand wooed 
over some centrist politicians upset with chiracs attempt to 
accommodate the growing farright movement 
rocard a selfdescribed free enterprise leftist was 
prepared to run for the presidency this year until mitterrand 
declared his candidacy 
polls usually rate him as one of frances most popular 
politicans a nondoctrinaire socialist he symbolizes the 
presidents effort for a policy of enlargement beyond the 
socialist ranks 
the debonair 5foot7 rocard is known for his independent and 
outspoken views he resigned as agriculture minister in 1985 
because he objected to a new system of proportional voting 
instituted by the socialists 
the president bucked pressure in affirming that he will not 
immediately dissolve the national assembly in which the socialists 
hold 211 seats 
mitterrand is being urged to take advantage of the victory 
momentum and move quickly with changes 
the president stressing the new political configuration has 
made few concrete proposals for change 
one of the few significant programs mitterrand says he intends 
to pursue is reestablishing the socialist wealth tax abolished by 
chirac in 1986 he wants the proceeds to fund a minimum guaranteed 
income 
mitterrand also says he will not continue the chirac 
governments privatization of stateowned companies

a new study of heart transplant recipients has 
found that half suffered mood disturbances after the operation and 
many faced family problems related to the surgery and recovery 
the results indicate psychiatrists must work to help recipients 
get the most out of life after transplants researchers said 
tuesday 
side effects of posttransplant medications cause some of the 
psychological problems said peter shapiro assistant clinical 
professor of psychiatry at the columbia university college of 
physicians and surgeons in new york 
he and colleague donald kornfeld did the work which shapiro 
presented tuesday at the annual meeting of the american psychiatric 
association 
this is a very important paper its really pacesetting and 
pacemaking said norman b levy of the new york medical college 
at valhalla an authority on psychiatric aspects of transplants 
the research was done with two groups of recipients one group 
of 30 was interviewed at up to a year after surgery while another 
43 were studied up to six years after the transplant 
overall 37 of the 73 recipients had experienced some kind of 
mood disturbances following the surgery problems ranged from 
demoralization and difficulty adjusting to posttransplant life to 
four cases of major depression 
fifteen of the 37 patients reported a period of mood swings 
irritability and argumentativeness often with some mild mania 
symptoms began in the first few weeks after transplantation and 
gradually receded as dosages of drugs to prevent organ rejection 
were tapered off 
twentytwo patients reported sexual problems as a side effect of 
antirejection drugs 
twelve patients said they had experienced family or marital 
troubles such as children running away from home or picking fights 
with their parents 
the second problem was especially common with teenage sons who 
resented the fathers trying to reassert a role of disciplinarian 
now that the disabling heart condition was over shapiro said 
some problems result from the use of the antirejection drug 
cyclosporine which is inconvenient to administer and accompanied 
by such side effects as headache burning pains and interference 
with sexual performance researchers said in a written version of 
the report 
impotence and fearful avoidance of sexual intercourse lead 
many patients to feel guilt and disappointment which is expressed 
in fighting or creating psychological distance from the partner 
they said 
these problems tend to work out over the course of 12 to 18 
months 
sixteen patients also complained of decreased memory

burmese soldiers have killed raped and 
tortured members of ethnic minorities in the governments fight to 
crush rebel movements the human rights group amnesty international 
said today 
the londonbased organization said evidence shows a consistent 
pattern of gross violations of human rights by the burmese army 
in a 71page report it described the fates of nearly 200 alleged 
victims 
among cases listed were those of an 11yearold girl and her 
mother raped by soldiers a 22yearold student who may have been 
shot because he looked different and an illiterate rice farmer 
whose flesh was peeled from the bone during interrogation 
an appendix gave details of apparent extrajudicial 
executions of 60 members of the karen minority only one was said 
to have been an active rebel 
the amnesty report said insurgents also have killed civilians 
but said the government was not justified in doing the same 
amnesty international investigates human rights violations 
around the world it said the information on burma came from 
civilians of the karen mon and kachin ethnic groups who fled the 
country and were interviewed in thailand last november 
its report noted that human rights investigators have not been 
allowed into burma and that burma sent a letter to the united 
nations in february denying similar allegations 
officials in rangoon the burmese capital said they had no 
knowledge of the allegations burmese officials almost never make 
statements to journalists on sensitive questions 
gen ne wins military government has ruled the country for 26 
years espousing a mix of socialism and buddhism 
in the last several years his army has expanded its campaign 
against insurgents of the karen mon kachin and other minorities 
who control large areas along the frontiers especially in the 
north and west 
amnestys report said insurgents had bombed schools markets and 
other civilian targets but it gave no details rebel groups have 
denied involvement in some of those attacks 
killings or other crimes by opposition groups can never be 
used to justify unlawful killings or torture by members of the 
security forces amnesty said the security forces are 
entrusted with protecting citizens and upholding and defending the 
legal system 
torture described by those interviewed included burning with 
cigars slashing with knives nearstrangulation and shin 
rolling rolling large bamboo poles over the shins until the 
skin peels off and bones are exposed 
villagers forced to work as porters or guides for the army have 
been beaten to death or forced to walk through minefields ahead of 
soldiers the report said 
burmese law provides normal channels for the arrest and 
prosecution of those suspected of rebellion as well as human 
rights safeguards yet virtually none of the refugees interviewed 
knew of any instance in which this legislation had been invoked 
it said 
a 22yearold victims brother told amnesty investigators 
they could easily have taken him away for questioning but 
instead they simply killed him 
my brother had been to school for eight years he was tidy and 
welldressed he had a fancy haircut i think that maybe they shot 
him because he looked different 
the us state department said in a recent report that the 
serious human rights problems which persist in burma are the result 
of an authoritarian government and ruling party which do not 
guarantee basic rights or the application of an impartial rule of 
law

officials will seek an immediate review of drug 
and alcohol testing practices on local railways following the 
discovery that five employees involved in a fatal commuter train 
crash last month had used drugs 
the federal railroad administration released test results 
tuesday showing that an engineer killed in the april 6 metronorth 
train crash had marijuana in his system and that a dispatchers 
urine contained morphine and codeine 
this insanity has got to stop john riley head of the fra 
said 
discovery of the drug traces also prompted riley to reissue his 
call for random testing of rail workers 
in the last 16 months riley noted there has been a rail 
accident every 10 days somewhere in the nation in which at least

engineer raymond hunter was killed when his empty train slammed 
into the rear of another empty commuter train he tested positive 
for marijuana in his urine and his blood the fra said

collision they also said the train appeared to be traveling well 
over the 15 mph speed limit 
three other railroad employees who controlled train movements 
also had controlled substances in their systems the fra said

a jury took only seven hours to weigh 500 
pieces of evidence and testimony from 91 witnesses then found a 
man guilty of killing five hikers in a series of trailside 
slayings that terrorized northern california parks 
the superior court jury that convicted david j carpenter on 
tuesday will return next week to begin for the penalty phase to 
determine whether the he should be executed or spend the rest of 
his life in prison 
carpenter 58 of san francisco was convicted of firstdegree 
murder with special circumstances in the 1980 killings of five 
hikers in two marin county parks part of a series of crimes dubbed 
the trailside slayings eight years ago 
after four months of hearing evidence the jury returned the 
verdict against carpenter at the end of its second day of 
deliberations attorneys on both sides were surprised by the quick 
decision 
it certainly seems to suggest they didnt buy anything the 
defense presented said marin county deputy district attorney 
john posey who portrayed carpenter in closing arguments as a 
coldblooded killer whose ultimate goal was to commit murder 
and rape and get away with it 
we were much more hopeful than this said defense attorney 
frank cox it came as a surprise to have an unfavorable verdict 
as fast as this 
defense attorneys argued carpenter deserved acquittal because of 
serious doubts created by what they termed questionable police 
procedures and inconsistencies in the testimony of witnesses 
carpenter who already has been sentenced to the gas chamber for 
two related killings in santa cruz parks sat expressionless as 
judge herbert b hoffman read the verdict 
carpenter spent eight days on the stand testifying in his own 
defense alleging he was miles away from the murder sites on the 
days of the killings at point reyes national seashore and mount 
tamalpais state park 
he was convicted of murdering richard stowers 19 of petaluma 
cynthia moreland 18 of cotati anne alderson 26 of san rafael 
diane oconnell 22 of san jose and shauna may 23 of san 
francisco 
carpenter was also convicted of raping two of his marin victims 
and trying to rape a third 
defense attorneys said they would spend the rest of the week 
developing a strategy for the penalty hearing scheduled to begin 
tuesday 
carpenters automatic appeal in the santa cruz case is pending 
before the state supreme court

italys highest court upheld the convictions and 
prison sentences of seven palestinians who conceived and carried 
out the 1985 hijacking of the achille lauro cruise ship 
after a threehour hearing the court of cassation on tuesday 
rejected appeals by defendants including fugitive palestinian 
leader mohammed abbas the court thus let stand the may 23 1987 
convictions and sentences decided by an appeals court in genoa the 
port city where the illfated mediterranean cruise began 
an elderly wheelchairbound new yorker leon klinghoffer was 
shot to death and his body was thrown into the sea during the 
ordeal 
tuesdays ruling cleared the way for a separate civil action by 
relatives of klinghoffer to seek damages earlier rulings said the 
two daughters of klinghoffer were entitled to compensation 
in addition to abbas head of the palestine liberation front 
the court of cassation upheld life sentences for two other fugitive 
group leaders ozzuddin badrakkam described as military chief and 
ziad el omar another organization official the 7year term of 
abdulrahim khaled a colonel in the front was also upheld 
they were accused of helping to organize the hijacking 
three hijackers covered by the cassation ruling are in italian 
custody they include magied molqi leader of the hijackers and 
described as the man who shot klinghoffer sentenced to 30 years 
and two other hijackers ibrahim fatayer abdelatif and ahmad 
marrouf assadi sentenced to nearly 25 years and nearly 16 years 
assadi had cooperated with investigators 
a fourth hijacker bassam asker was convicted in separate 
trials in juvenile court because he was a minor at the time of the 
crime 
the commandeered achille lauro eventually docked at an egyptian 
port where passengers and hijackers got off after officials 
negotiated with the pirates 
italian police took custody of the four hijackers after us 
warplanes intercepted the egyptian plane that was taking them to 
tunisia and forced the aircraft to land in sicily 
also aboard the plane were abbas and badrakkam but italian 
officials later released them despite us protests saying there 
was no evidence to hold them prosecutors later indicted them for 
trial

a new study suggests that eating beef may not be 
as bad for the heart as experts had once assumed because one of its 
major forms of saturated fat lowers cholesterol 
despite their findings however the studys authors recommended 
that people stick to widely accepted dietary guidelines and keep 
their fat intake as low as possible 
the study conducted by drs scott m grundy and andrea 
bonanome found that stearic acid one of the main components of 
saturated fat in the diet appears to lower the bodys cholesterol 
levels 
until now many experts assumed that all kinds of saturated fat 
including those containing stearic acid were bad for the heart 
because they promote clogging deposits of cholesterol 
grundy said that if people eat moderate portions of lean beef 
it should not be feared as a cholesterolraising food 
the research conducted at the university of texas southwestern 
medical center at dallas was scheduled to be published in 
thursdays issue of the new england journal of medicine 
in an accompanying editorial drs irwin h rosenberg and ernst 
j schaefer of the usda human nutrition research center on aging at 
tufts university in boston praised the work they said it 
demonstrates convincingly that a diet high in stearic acid does 
not raise blood cholesterol 
but they were also cautious in interpreting the findings 
concluding this study should not change our chief dietary 
message to the american people 
beef contains two major forms of saturated fat stearic acid 
and palmitic acid and while stearic acid lowers cholesterol 
palmitic acid raises it significantly 
stearic acid is found in varying amounts in many other foods 
too including chicken and vegetables 
saturated fats are hard at room temperature while 
polyunsaturated and monosaturated fats which come largely from 
vegetables are liquid 
the researchers said the food industry may be able to use 
stearic acid to make margarine that is more like butter as well as 
a cholesterollowering form of shortening for cooking 
the study was based on 11 men who consumed three liquid diets 
that were high in either stearic acid palmitic acid or oleic acid 
a monosaturated fat that also lowers cholesterol

in his canadian extradition hearing 
on tuesday a judge in the alberta court of queens bench 
granted the delay until oct 17 at the request of defense lawyer 
donald macleod

sextorture killings at a rural cabin in calaveras county east of 
san francisco the other concerns the 1984 slaying of san francisco 
disc jockey donald guiletti 
us authorities applied for ngs extradition in february 1987 
his lawyers have said they will fight his return to the united 
states unless they are convinced he wont face the death penalty in 
california if convicted 
when the canadian parliament banned capital punishment in 1976 
the government signed an extradition treaty which allows it to 
refuse to extradite fugitives who may face the death penalty in the 
united states however the federal justice minister can waive that 
right 
ng is serving a 4year sentence at the federal penitentiary in 
prince albert saskatchewan for armed robbery aggravated assault

former white house chief of staff donald t 
regan today urged likely republican nominee george bush to use 
president reagans economic record as his platform in the race for 
the presidency 
i certainly make the case for reaganomics and the reagan 
record in my book regan said on cbstvs this morning show 
referring to his recentlyreleased memoir for the record 
and if george bush chooses to run on the reagan record i think 
hell be running on a very strong platform 
the vice president has a mathematical lock on the nomination and 
is expected to pick up reagans endorsement later today 
regan whose behindthescenes book has angered the reagans for 
its descriptions of a disengaged president influenced by a first 
lady motivated by astrology said he often failed to get reagan to 
focus on critical economic issues 
as treasury secretary regan said he was flying by the seat of 
my pants 
the president never told me what he believed or what he wanted 
to accomplish in the field of economics i had to figure these 
things out like any other american by studying his speeches and 
reading the newspapers regan writes 
while crediting reagan with creating an atmosphere of 
confidence that helped in the recovery from 198182 recession 
regan said the president himself had very little to do with the 
invention and the implementation of the policies that came to be 
called reaganomics 
nevertheless regan said today that reaganomics deserves high 
marks 
i think reaganomics has proven successful weve had 5 years 
of expansion and the possibility of more months to come in 
that he said 
weve had a change in morale in the american people over the 
last few years remember that the malaise and all that sort of 
thing thats what reagan inherited and yet as he leaves office we 
feel a lot better about ourselves internationally i think were 
better off too he said

a judge ignoring a plea for mercy 
by the victims widow sentenced two members of the billionaire 
boys club to life in prison without parole for murdering one 
defendants father 
sentenced tuesday were arben dosti and reza eslaminia the 
26yearold son of hedayat eslaminia who was kidnapped and 
suffocated in a steamer trunk in july 1984 
san mateo county superior court judge robert d miller sentenced 
eslaminia and dosti 26 despite eslaminias mothers plea for 
leniency 
i believe reza is innocent mina hakimi widow of the 
victim told the judge in broken english the elder eslaminia had 
at one time been an adviser to the shah of iran 
your crime involved a great deal of thought planning and 
execution the judge said for that reason im sentencing you 
to life without possibility of parole 
eslaminias attorney gary merritt said his client was not 
present during the kidnapping or death of his father and was only 
involved in conspiracy to kidnap 
assistant state attorney general john vance noted that the jury 
had found eslaminia guilty of murder after a trial of about 50 days 
the two were convicted in january of murder kidnapping for 
extortion and conspiracy in the plot to kidnap the elder eslaminia 
for ransom then kill him the victim suffocated apparently 
accidentally inside the steamer trunk hours after being kidnapped 
from his condominium in july 1984 
authorities had originally suspected that the elder eslaminia a 
former iranian parliament member and cabinet member under the shah 
had been killed by a hit squad sent by the iranian revolutionary 
government that deposed the shah in 1979 
eslaminia was active in the movement against irans leader 
ayatollah ruhollah khomeini 
dosti and eslaminia were members of the bbc which was founded 
by joe hunt in 1983 as a business fraternity of bright young men 
from some of southern californias wealthiest families 
hunt 27 was sentenced last july 6 to life in prison without 
parole in the slaying of ronald levin who vanished in the summer 
of 1984 and whose body was never found

share prices were sharply lower at midday today 
with the market unnerved after chancellor of the exchequer nigel 
lawson said a rise in interest rates of the major world economies 
was possible 
the financial timesstock exchange 100share index fell 302 
points or 17 percent to 17624 by 1215 pm its lowest level 
so far in the session 
volume was a relatively strong 3557 million shares compared 
with 2335 million shares at the same time on tuesday 
lawsons comment published in european editions of the wall 
street journal that a worldwide rise in interest rates could be in 
the cards sent share prices plunging dealers said 
lawson said a coordinated effort by west germany japan and 
other leading nations to hike interest rates is certainly 
possible following the federal reserves increase in shortterm 
rates to curb us inflation 
the equity market was shaken by the idea that the leading 
economic nations could join in a bid to choke off inflationary 
pressures by pushing up the cost of borrowing 
the lawson comment was acting as a dark cloud over the entire 
market one equity salesman said 
some favorable earnings results by major uk companies were 
ignored by the market dealers said as players chose to focus on

fewer defective condoms are showing up 
on the us market although more than 33 million condoms were 
recalled or rejected in the last year a federal study says 
only about four in every 1000 domestic condoms were deemed 
defective an improvement from a 48 defective rate last year said 
dr doyle c smith of the food and drug administration which 
tested 115000 condoms for such problems as pinholes and tears 
imported condoms proved more risky with a defective rate of 65 
per 1000 which was still a drop from last years rate of 73 he 
said 
the fda testing that ended last month resulted in more than 30 
million imported condoms being kept from distribution and 3 million 
domestic condoms taken off the shelves in 19 recalls according to 
the study 
although the level of defects in condoms has dropped there is 
a need to continually improve the defective rate smith said 
adding that the fda will continue to make random tests 
the fda issued its report tuesday at the american society for 
microbiology annual meeting where hundreds from academia 
government and industry exchanged ideas on topics ranging from the 
spread of disease to how microorganisms can help control acid rain 
surgeon general c everett koop and other health professionals

hispanic workers at a nursing home have 
been told they can no longer speak their native tongue on the job 
an order some of the workers have challenged as discriminatory 
i continue to speak spanish said doris leal a nurses aide 
at nutmeg pavilion healthcare maybe im going to be fired but 
im going to fight for my rights 
i dont feel comfortable in my job anymore said maria 
rivera another aide at nutmeg i dont feel free when im 
working so its very difficult to do the job 
officials outlined the policy to employees at a staff meeting 
last week according to staff members quoted in todays editions of 
the day newspaper of new london the policy requires that employees 
speak english in all areas except the coffee lounge during working 
hours 
james okane administrator of the facility defended the policy 
and said the workers have not filed any formal protest 
on the floor were to communicate with patients and other 
staff to the utmost okane said if i dont know what youre 
talking about its difficult to be a team 
okane said it makes englishspeaking patients uncomfortable 
when they cannot understand the healthcare workers whether its 
spanish or german or greek or gaelic is beside the point okane 
said 
louis j halpryn director of the connecticut nursing home 
association said he has not heard of any similar policies at other 
nursing homes

for nonenglish speaking patients and he often hears employees 
speaking in another language in the patient care areas which he 
has no objections to 
mrs leal said the policy affects seven nurses that she knows of 
there is no law i know of in the united states that says you

its discrimination

lech walesa said today that an eightday 
sitdown strike at the lenin shipyard showed solidaritys strength 
but that lack of widespread support hurt the strikers 
we were paralyzed because there were so few of us walesa 
told reporters at st brygidas church near the shipyard in this 
baltic port where the electrician led workers to form the soviet 
blocs first independent union federation eight years ago 
he said this months action showed our strength as well as our 
helplessness and that the workers would try again if necessary 
walesa and about 1000 haggard strikers who had occupied the 
plant and refused to work abandoned their strike tuesday evening 
strike leaders said they wanted to avoid a police raid but 
communist authorities said the action failed for lack of support 
still the government said the two weeks of strikes that ended 
tuesday will compel it to speed up efforts to revive polands 
crippled economy 
government spokesman jerzy urban told the associated press by 
telephone that the decision to end the strike was judicious and 
so eloquent that it requires no comment whatsoever 
the official pap news agency reported some shipyard supervisors 
were back at work today and normal work would resume thursday 
walesa said he got a phone call at home in the morning asking him 
why he was not there 
if there are people who think we lost it is because we still 
lack solidarity among workers nationwide he said 
but walesa said that if necessary we will try again nothing 
ended nothing is finished he added that the 15member strike 
committee that engaged in five rounds of negotiations with 
management will not be dissolved 
there was no immediate word on whether the strikers would face 
legal charges or disciplinary action during negotiations the 
strikers had been offered amnesty but only if they left the 
shipyard sunday night 
heads held high the shipyard workers filed out of the yard 
without a settlement tuesday but also without having backed down 
from demands whose centerpiece was reinstatement of the yards 
solidarity chapter 
through the intervention of the catholic church workers and 
management met five times from saturday until monday 
police had surrounded the shipyard since thursday and the 
strikers had rejected government offers of wage increases so 
quitting was the best solution possible said strike committee 
chairman alojzy szablewski 
the strike evoked memories of 1980 when a younger leaner 
walesa cosigned an accord at the same shipyard during a nationwide 
wave of strikes over price increases that toppled a government a 
time of unmatched freedom followed 
the rest of the country did not follow suit this time leaving 
the shipyard workers in the baltic port city largely isolated 
urban said on tuesday that the strikes and protests have not 
won the support of the working class and society but had taught 
the government important lessons 
the may events will compel the government to more consistently 
develop reform which should be more strongly felt by society he 
said 
the government planned today to introduce a bill that would 
allow it to take over moneylosing enterprises and fire managers 
who resist economic change its reform program has increased prices 
by 42 percent this year 
and a pap statement on tuesdays meeting of the ruling politburo 
spoke of the indispensible need to quicken democratization a 
process it has so far only vaguely described 
five major strikes since april 25 added up to polands worst 
wave of labor unrest since the 1981 military crackdown on 
solidarity the labor federation was banned in 1982 
during negotiations the mostly young strikers often appeared 
more militant than their elders on monday the young strikers 
refused to accept a compromise largely agreed to by the strike 
committee 
solidarity chaplain the rev henryk jankowski said the strike 
committee had voted 132 to end the stoppage 
i wanted to avoid the police taking them out he said 
there were many wonderful young men there and i could not allow 
them to be beaten 
besides recognition of solidarity the strikers had demanded 
monthly raises of at least 38 based on their current average of 
about 105 reinstatement of fired solidarity activists freedom 
for political prisoners and amnesty for strikers 
similar demands had been made by workers at the lenin steelworks 
in nowa huta in southern poland whose 10day stoppage was crushed 
thursday by a violent predawn raid 
the other strikes were settled peacefully at a defenserelated 
heavy machinery plant in stalowa wola and among transit workers in 
bydgoszcz and szczecin

us secretary of state george shultz today 
reopened talks on a troubled arms control treaty and said he was 
sure the soviet union wants to resolve differences that led the 
senate to shelve the pact indefinitely 
shultz before meeting with soviet foreign minister eduard 
shevardnadze refused to blame the soviets for differences over how 
to monitor the destruction of us and soviet intermediaterange 
nuclear missiles 
i am not trying to characterize the disagreements he told 
reporters on his flight from washington problems have arisen 
and since no one has ever done anything like this before there are 
problems we approach this in a problemsolving way 
soviet foreign ministry spokesman gennady gerasimov in a 
telephone interview today with the british broadcasting corp said 
we think that we can iron out our differences 
they are not very big he said so we still hope and we 
think that the senate is going to ratify the treaty before the 
moscow summit the summit between reagan and soviet leader 
mikhail s gorbachev is scheduled for may 29june 2 
shevardnadze arriving in geneva on tuesday had said he was not 
sure what the problems over the treaty were he said the soviets 
had answered questions posed by the united states 
basically the verification problems regarding the inf 
intermediaterange nuclear forces treaty have been resolved i 
think he said 
in washington sen sam nunn dga chairman of the senate 
armed services committee said today the senate could ratify the 
ussoviet nuclear arms agreement in time for the moscow summit if 
shultz works out disputes in this weeks talks 
i think theres still time to get the consent of the senate to 
ratification prior to the summit but these matters have to be 
dealt with he said on abctvs good morning america 
the treaty signed by reagan and gorbachev at the washington 
summit meeting in december is the first to scrap an entire 
category of nuclear arms it also provides for unprecedented 
onsite inspection of missile factories and bases to guard against 
cheating 
in the last few weeks the soviets had raised objections to 
various procedures proposed by the us side these include the 
scope of inspection within designated areas and use of cameras 
asked if he thought the soviets were backsliding or causing 
trouble shultz did not criticize moscow in fact he said of 
shevardnadze he wants to see the inf treaty completed and into 
operation as much as i do as problems arise i am sure he will 
want to look at them 
shultz said he hoped the treaty will be ratified before reagan 
begins the summit with gorbachev but he said i cant tell what 
the senate will do 
shultz and shevardnadze planned to meet twice today and twice 
thursday on the problems and on the wide range of summit topics 
including human rights 
the differences over verification have prompted the senate to 
postpone indefinitely ratification of the treaty to scrap 683 
soviet missiles and 364 us rockets 
with the moscow summit less than three weeks away the trouble 
over the treaty is a severe setback to the arms control process 
already there is virtually no hope of completing a second 
accord to sharply reduce longrange us and soviet nuclear weapons 
before the summit 
the united states says the soviets are trying to restrict the 
access of us monitors to soviet missile plants and sites this 
would leave the united states unable to guarantee that the soviets 
are not cheating on the agreement which bans medium and 
shorterrange missiles 
after shultz winds up his talks with shevardnadze on thursday 
he flies to brussels on friday to brief nato officials before going 
home

maria desillers responded angrily to a 
courtappointed officials report that she spent some 200000 
donated for her late sons liver transplants on herself relatives 
and friends 
i am not a thief i did not do anything wrong ms desillers 
said tuesday after an unrelated hearing over a 1000 state fine 
levied against her in the wake of charges that she violated 
floridas charity laws 
i resent the way im being treated the way its been 
handled she said 
ms desillers 7yearold son ronnie died at childrens hospital 
in pittsburgh last year while awaiting a fourth liver transplant 
his plight resulted in a highly publicized fundraising drive that 
included a 1000 donation from president reagan 
karen geivers appointed at the request of the dade state 
attorneys office to review ms desillers spending on monday 
filed court documents listing questionable expenses paid from the 
donations 
among the payments were 10850 to a jewelry store 23700 to 
ms desillers exboyfriend and 96527 in cash withdrawals for 
personal expenses 
ms desillers has said the expenditures were reasonable and that 
she needed the clothing and jewelry to look professional when 
she tried to raise money for organ donor awareness after her sons 
death she is president of the ronnie desillers national foundation 
ms gievers in her report accused ms desillers of having 
ignored the laws when it suited her purposes to do so 
ms desillers denied the charges im not saying im perfect 
but how could she say on there that i know the law and i 
disregarded it its crazy 
among the questionable expenditures found by ms gievers were 
5798 to the cache clothing store 3163 for furniture 6134 
for ms desillers brother osvaldo marchante 13500 for a used 
bmw 23700 to her attorneys and 44359 to other sick children 
ms desillers said the money to dimas jewelry was to buy back 
items she had pawned in early 1987 to pay her sons medical 
expenses the payments to her brother and to her boyfriend jose 
castillo were for loans they had made to her she said 
ms desillers is appealing the charity law fine and at the 
tuesday hearing timothy jansen of the florida secretary of states 
office accused ms desillers of misleading the public 
i dont think that the people who donated money intended that 
the money for ronnie should go for cars the rent jewelry and 
certain other expenditures jansen said 
hearing examiner donald alexander will make a decision on the 
fine within 30 days said harry robbins ms desillers attorney 
according to court documents almost 300000 of the 527000

soldiers and police arrested at least six 
palestinian journalists today and leaders of the palestinian 
uprising issued a new leaflet calling on arabs to store enough food 
for a month of civil disobedience 
the army command today said it was pleased with the response of 
palestinians in the occupied gaza strip to a potentially explosive 
campaign to issue new identity cards to the areas 400000 adults 
palestinians in the west bank and gaza strip which israel has 
occupied since 1967 began demonstrating against the occupation 
last dec 8 according to un figures 185 palestinians have died 
in the five months of violence an israeli soldier and a jewish 
teenage settler also have been killed 
the uprising has made the palestinian problem a central issue 
in the world said the leaflet distributed in the occupied lands 
and in arab east jerusalem which was annexed by israel the 
uprising is becoming a ghost which scares the enemy 
it urged a complete boycott of the zionists and asks the 
people to ready themselves for civil disobedience by storing food 
in houses enough for at least a month 
in jerusalem and its suburbs police and soldiers began rounding 
up journalists and community leaders at about 1 am 6 pm edt 
tuesday according to arab reports 
at least 11 people were seized including two editors of the 
propalestine liberation organization newspaper al fajr which has 
become a voice of the uprising four other journalists were 
arrested along with a union leader head of a youth council and 
several other palestinians the reports said 
the army refused to comment on the reports 
israel radio reported that 47 people have been charged with 
manslaughter in the death of man who allegedly collaborated with 
israeli authorities the victim mohammed id sakanda was lynched 
by a mob in the village of qabatiye in the west bank in february 
today soldiers with loudspeakers ordered west bank merchants to 
close their shops in the morning but said they could open any time 
after noon 
the move is part of a continued effort to force storekeepers to 
operate at times dictated by the army not by uprising leaders who 
have ordered repeated general strikes 
the new leaflet the 16th issued by the united leaders of the 
uprising called for demonstrations on the moslem holy day friday 
and a general strike and day of anger next sunday 
it also urged protests on id el fitr the end of the moslem 
fasting month of ramadan which is expected to be monday or tuesday 
when the new moon is sighted it also urged a general strike on may 
21 
the leaflet called on palestinians to keep refusing to pay taxes 
to israel and to refuse to obtain new government identity cards 
the army began a campaign on tuesday to force 400000 residents 
of the gaza strip to get new cards a move that protest leaders say 
is aimed at catching tax evaders and breaking the fivemonth 
uprising 
the first day of the program to issue new identification cards 
passed very well an army spokesman told the associated press on 
condition of anonymity there were no incidents and 2000 people 
received new cards 
the army has outlined a monthlong first phase encompassing 
200000 adults between the ages of 16 to 60 in gaza city 
the government also has been pushing to collect back taxes and 
other lapsed fees 
underground leaders of the palestinian uprising issued leaflets 
and had broadcast warnings from mosque loudspeakers urging 
residents not to cooperate with the army they charge the id 
program is a plot to break the palestinian uprising a main tactic 
of which is nonpayment of taxes 
the leftwing daily al hamishmar today issued a scathing 
editorial of the army plan saying the army might be trying to put 
pressure on the families of young palestinian protesters by denying 
their parents the new card 
it could create a layer of cardless residents who will be 
illegal residents in an area where they live and even were born 
jewish settlers meanwhile reacted angrily to charges by the 
chief of staff lt gen dan shomron that they were aggravating 
tensions in the occupied territories 
shomron angered jewish settlers on tuesday when he told a 
parliamentary committee the settlers were raising tensions in the 
occupied lands 
its as if he would say the residents of israels northern 
border were responsible for the katyusha rockets fired at them 
from lebanon said benny katzover a leader of gush emunim a 
religious settlement movement the arabs want to throw us out of 
all of the land of israel

shiite moslem militias with tanks 
howitzers rockets and mortars fought each other today for control 
of the slums of south beirut police said 26 people were killed and 
61 wounded 
a ceasefire called by syrian and iranian mediators went into 
effect eight hours after fighting began at 230 am police said 
earlier today syria repeated a warning that it might use its 
troops to halt the battle between the prosyrian amal militia and 
the proiranian hezbollah which had shattered an earlier 24hour 
truce 
the battle occurred near where many of the 18 foreign hostages 
in lebanon are believed held there was no word on the hostages 
since fighting broke out friday 180 people have been killed and 
433 wounded 
we hold the militia leaders responsible for all the crimes 
committed against humanity in south beirut and urge them to order a 
ceasefire before it is too late acting prime minister salim 
hoss said in a statement broadcast by all radio stations before the 
truce was announced 
beirut residents were shaken awake by the thuds of exploding 
shells that echoed across the lebanese capital as amal arabic for 
hope mounted a fivepronged attack against hezbollah or party of 
god 
a police spokesman said tankled amal forces advancing behind a 
fierce barrage of howitzer rocket and mortar fire dislodged 
hezbollah fundamentalists from several areas they had conquered in 
the past five days on the western edge of south beirut abutting the 
airport highway 
he said flight schedules were unaffected and that passengers 
reached the airport through side streets 
hezbollah stormed amal positions deep in south beirut and 
occupied the militias main base in the district of bourj 
elbarajneh east of the airport highway he said 
the spokesman who spoke on condition of anonymity according to 
regulations said hezbollah occupied a police station in bourj 
elbarajneh 
the sahel hospital closest to the contested area advised 
rescuers through the moslemrun voice of nation radio to take the 
wounded to other hospitals because we cant cope with the flood 
of casualties 
the police spokesman said syrian officers and irans deputy 
foreign minister hussein sheikholeslam ordered the ceasefire the 
fourth since friday after contacting amal and hezbollah leaders 
fighting eased into sporadic exchanges of automatic fire the 
spokesman said 
before the ceasefire was announced syrias military 
intelligence chief in lebanon brig gen ghazi kenaan repeated a 
warning that his troops may intervene to stop the fighting 
if the bloodletting continues we will have no other option 
but to respond to the pleas of the population and end their 
ordeal kenaan said in a statement broadcast by all beirut radio 
stations 
syria sent 7500 troops to west beirut in february 1987 to curb 
militia lawlessness in the moslem sector of the lebanese capital 
the slums however were outside the syrian contingents 
jurisdiction 
thirtysix syrian officers and six joint ceasefire committees 
moved into the slums on tuesday to enforce the truce but amal and 
hezbollah used the calm to fortify their positions for another 
round of violence 
police said amal brought about 2500 fighters from its 
strongholds in south lebanon during the 24hour lull to help its 
4000strong force in south beirut stage todays attack 
hezbollah had gained control of much of the slums before friday 
its fighting strength is estimated at 3000 
syria is irans main arab backer in its persian gulf war with 
iraq but there have been growing signs of a strain in the alliance 
amid pressures on damascus from other arab nations to distance 
itself from persian iran 
syria which considers lebanon its exclusive sphere of 
influence also has been angry over irans drive using hezbollah 
as its instrument to dominate the 12 million shiites in lebanon 
the countrys largest single sect

after saying nancy reagan had not talked with 
her astrolger in a couple of months white house officials were 
caught off guard today when the stargazer said she had been in 
touch with the first lady this week 
i just dont know anything about it said elaine crispen 
the press secretary to mrs reagan i wasnt aware they had 
talked i had no idea 
the astrolger joan quigley of san francisco said she had 
spoken with mrs reagan this week but would not reveal her reaction 
to the flap over the use of stargazing in planning the schedule of 
president reagan 
quigleys statement contradicted what white house officials were 
saying 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater and mrs crispen both 
said on tuesday that it had been a couple of months since mrs 
reagan had been in touch with the astrologer 
in his new book former white house chief of staff donald t 
regan says the first lady regularly consulted a san francisco 
astrologer about scheduling for the president policy matters and 
decisions 
the white house has adopted a nocomment policy on specifics 
in the book trying to dampen the stargazing controversy 
fitzwater at his regular news briefing was asked whether mrs 
reagan had used a secure telephone line to speak with quigley 
and if not had there been a breach of security 
i have no idea fitzwater replied 
asked to assess the role of astrology in preparation of the 
presidents schedule fitzwater said we have not commented on 
that in the past and i would say only that the presidents 
scheduling is a process involving many people and many different 
considerations and concerns 
mrs crispen said quigley had been to the white house only once 
at a state dinner other than that the first lady had communicated 
with her only by telephone mrs crispen said 
she said she did not know how often they talked

it wasnt a white christmas but dozens of fans 
who usually sing christmas carols to composer irving berlin 
serenaded him at his mansion today at the very start of his 100th 
birthday 
the reclusive composer who hates to get up in the morning and 
wrote a song to that effect didnt put in an appearance 
if hes 100 hes probably sleeping said roberta kaufman 
who had been walking her dog and stopped to see what the crowd of 
75 people was doing in front of the fivestory brick mansion in 
beekman place an exclusive east side enclave 
john wallowitch who organized the midnight tuesday serenade and 
has organized the christmas carol singing outside berlins door for 
at least 20 years was sure berlin was awake 
hes a night owl ive seen him walking his dog at 3 am 
wallowitch said 
berlins secretary confirmed that 
when they were there singing of course he heard them he was 
very thrilled by that hilda schneider said at midmorning she 
added that the composer was spending the day quietly at home 
hes never made a big thing about his birthdays 
during a singing a somewhat intoxicated reveler yelled 
haaapppy birthday irving at the drawn shades of 17 beekman 
place we love you where are youuuuu 
many of those gathered seemed to be neighbors hoping to catch a 
rare glimpse of berlin just before the singing began a shade went 
up in the house and the crowd gasped 
but it was a teenage girl and a matron both waved and the 
crowd waved back 
even if he didnt write a thing to reach 100 is to be part of 
american history said 21yearold john wiessman a junior at new 
york university but this guy wrote a lot i love god bless 
america every american has got to love it 
the music and lyrics among the more than 1500 songs berlin 
created for the stage screen and popular music are inextricably 
woven into the american culture 
they include white christmas easter parade 
alexanders ragtime band theres no business like show 
business puttin on the ritz blue skies cheek to 
cheek and oh how i hate to get up in the morning 
in london the british parliament honored the composer today 
with a motion wishing him many more white christmases and easter 
parades 
todays informal serenade will be followed tonight by a carnegie 
hall tribute to the composer with stars like frank sinatra isaac 
stern and ray charles scheduled to appear 
wallowitch got the crowd ready by reading through a song he 
composed for the occasion 
just think 100 years ago this little russian lady was very 
pregnant he said referring to berlins birth on may 11 1888 
in russia then he told the crowd to sing softly with great 
love 
the crowd sang happy birthday berlins always and 
wallowitchs the songs of irving berlin which included the 
broad hint knock on my door and ill welcome you in 
nearly five years ago wallowitch was invited into the berlin 
home on christmas eve after a chorus of white christmas on an 
impulse he rang the doorbell a maid answered and took him and his 
fellow singers into the kitchen 
there they were greeted by berlin himself in bathrobe and 
slippers the composer hugged the men kissed the women and told 
them thats the nicest christmas present ive ever had 
still no berlin so the crowd ran through well be loving you 
always again another shade went up but again it was the teenage 
girl 
hey the drunk said we would love to see irving please 
bring him to the window 
the dispersing neighbors said they did not really expect to see

republican primary voters gave west virginia gov arch moore a 
shot at a record fourth term and nebraska sen david karnes a 
hardfought victory in the first election of his brief political 
career 
but karnes who survived an aggressive challenge by rep hal 
daub may have a tougher time defeating the democratic primary 
winner former gov bob kerrey 
other results from tuesdays primaries in the two states showed 
senate majority leader robert c byrd easily winning west 
virginias democratic nomination for a sixth term he will face 
state sen jay wolfe who won the republican primary in the 
democratic primary for governor insurance executive gaston 
caperton won a sevenway race for the chance to face moore who 
edged millionaire businessman john raese 
nebraska voters approved a measure raising salaries of lawmakers 
in the nations only onechamber legislature from 4800 to 
12000 its their first raise in 20 years 
and in nebraskas 2nd district where daub gave up his seat 
democrats denied a congressional nomination to cece zorinsky widow 
of us sen edward zorinsky instead former state sen pete 
hoagland will be the democratic nominee and will face jerry 
schenken winner of a fourway republican race 
we did it an elated karnes told supporters as he claimed 
victory late tuesday and the thing that i am so proud about is 
that we did it the oldfashioned way we earned every single 
vote 
nebraskas gop senate race had been rated a tossup in 
preelection polls but karnes who was appointed 14 months ago 
and is the nations youngest senator at age 38 won by a wide 
margin with 99 percent of the vote counted karnes had 114101 
votes or 55 percent and daub had 93236 votes or 45 percent 
daub was quick to congratulate karnes on his very sound and 
impressive victory and promised to help him in november 
karnes was a supporter of gov kay orrs election and she 
appointed him to fill zorinskys seat after he died in march 1987 
daub 47 was one of several gop regulars who sought the job 
for the democrats kerrey had 152363 votes or 916 percent and 
ken michaelis a disbarred lawyer had 13889 votes or 84 percent 
i know the task over the next five months is going to be 
difficult kerrey said shrugging off polls that have showed him 
the clear favorite 
the 44yearold kerrey who lost part of a leg in vietnam and 
won a medal of honor has been a popular figure in nebraska and 
lent some glamour to the farm state when he dated movie star debra 
winger 
in west virginia with 95 percent of the vote in early today 
moore led with 73503 votes or 53 percent to raeses 64897 or 
47 percent 
raese who accused moore of failing to deal with the states 
fiscal crisis also lost his previous bid for office a 1984 senate 
race against democrat jay rockefeller 
moore 65 won his first two terms as governor in 1968 and 1972 
but was barred by law from seeking a third straight term after 
rockefeller served two terms moore was elected again in 1984 
capertons victory in the democratic primary followed a campaign 
so bitter it threatened to leave his party divided 
he bought this election fair and square said clyde see the 
former house of delegates speaker ho finished second and was 
outspent 18 million to 500000 
this is a victory for change said caperton a newcomer to 
politics a victory for those who believe we can create jobs and 
prosperity in west virginia a victory for education 
with 96 percent of the vote in caperton had 122276 votes or 38 
percent see had 87753 votes or 27 percent five others divided 
the rest 
in the democratic senate race the 70yearold byrd had 237037 
votes or 80 percent while moving company owner bob myers had 
57330 votes or 20 percent 
i am delighted by the overwhelming vote of confidence that i 
have received said byrd who has pledged to step down as 
majority leader to become senate appropriations committee chairman 
if reelected in order to help steer tax dollars to west virginia 
in the gop primary with 97 percent of the vote counted wolfe 
had 75736 or 70 percent welfare recipient bernie lumbert had

forbidding members of congress from accepting anything of value in 
exchange for an official act the justice department probe also 
focused on possible congressional reporting requirement violations 
in connection with the alleged free meals and entertainment 
st germains attorney raymond banoun has said he was confident 
st germain would not be charged with any wrongdoing because weve 
shown to them that theres a degree of inaccuracy in the league 
records 
banoun said last year that one reimbursement submitted to the 
league by its lobbyist shows that he was having dinner with st 
germain when st germain was on television debating his opponent 
live in rhode island 
the fact of the matter is there are dozens upon dozens of 
instances where he was out of town banoun said 
league spokesman mark clark has said however that the league 
keeps accurate expense records and has internal controls and audits 
a justice department source speaking on condition of anonymity 
said one reason prosecution was declined was because freemans 
recordkeeping was inaccurate house rules require reporting gifts 
such as meals worth more than 250 in a single calendar year but 
dont count toward the limit meals worth less than 35 
the washington post today quoted unidentified sources familiar 
with the investigation as saying that it would be difficult to 
prove beyond a reasonable doubt that each meal eaten by st germain 
totaled more than the 35 limit 
the justice department investigation followed a 14month probe 
by the house ethics committee into allegations that st germain used 
his chairmanship for personal gain 
the committee found that the 14term congressman violated house 
rules by underreporting his assets by more than 1 million and by 
accepting a free plane ride from a florida savings and loan 
association but no disciplinary action was recommended

a bill authorizing a statue of an army nurse 
at the vietnam veterans memorial was approved by the senate energy 
and commerce committee today over objections that it might 
encourage other groups to demand similar sculptures 
the committee passed the measure which has 63 sponsors on a 
voice vote and sent it to the senate floor after the lone 
dissenter sen daniel evans rwash protested what he called a 
threat to the artistic integrity of the memorial 
the bill however contained an amendment by sen dale bumpers 
dark that strengthens a declaration that congress would not 
allow any other statues to be placed at the memorial if the bronze 
sculpture of an army womens sculpture is approved 
this will be the last one said sen bennett johnston 
dla the committe chairman but the last for how long 
retorted evans who took pains to stress that his opposition had 
nothing to do with his respect for american women 
the proposal for a new statue honoring the 10000 women who 
served in the vietnam conflict was introduced by senate majority 
whip alan cranston dcalif and sen david durenberger rminn 
at a committee hearing last february the proposal was applauded 
by veterans groups but criticized by robert w doubek former 
executive director of the vietnam veterans memorial fund who said 
the womans statue would destroy the symbolism and aesthetics of 
the memorial 
doubek said the national park service already had received 
demands for statues honoring others who had served in vietnam 
including native americans and even scout dogs 
the memorial situated on the mall near the lincoln memorial 
features a long black granite slab bearing the names of 58156 
vietnam war dead including eight uniformed nurses 
two years after the memorial was dedicated in 1982 a 
controversial statue of three battleweary infantrymen and a 
60foot flagpole were erected on the 22acre site 
the proposed addition to the vietnam memorial the most popular 
tourist attraction among national monuments in the capital has 
been endorsed by the interior department but rejected by the 
commission of fine arts and the national capital planning 
commission 
the approval of all three agencies in required before any new 
memorial is built on federal parkland in washington

authorities launched a surprise 
inspection at an unlicensed home for boys today taking away one 
youth and issuing citations to 19 men who locked arms to hinder 
officials from entering 
authorities snapped a padlocked gate and broke through the human 
chain shortly after 6 am to begin inspecting birth certificates 
of children at the facility run by the rev wn otwell 
the inspection involved the state attorney generals office the 
department of human services department of public safety and the 
texas rangers 
otwell and state attorney general jim mattox have disagreed for 
two years about whether the facility should be licensed by the 
state and otwell at one time agreed to close the facility 
the facility is a combination home for troubled boys a 
churchrun school and preschool it has about 25 boys and 10 
toddlers and preschoolers said church secretary deborah anderson 
a state district judge ruled april 12 that state officials could 
inspect the facility in the community baptist church compound at 
any time and remove children found there without a relative or 
guardian 
they played it lowkey they said they didnt want a 
confrontation said rocky otwell the reverends son of todays 
multiagency inspection 
ron dusek a spokesman for the attorney general said a 
17yearold youth lacking guardianship papers was removed from the 
facility and taken to a department of human services emergency 
shelter and that 19 men were cited for preventing execution of 
civil process 
in march 1986 a state district judge in austin ordered otwell 
to close the home but in november 1987 suspended 97000 in fines 
after the minister promised he would keep the home closed unless 
the state passed a law exempting church homes from licensing the 
state has never done so 
otwell reopened the facility this spring in mobile homes vowing 
to renew his fight over licensing 
if they come to shut us down well just pick her up and sail 
her on down the road said otwell who has previously contended 
that the requirement that he seek a state license violated the 
constitutional separation of church and state 
parents of several of the 25 students attending the school have 
been staying at the compound in past weeks anticipating an 
inspection said ms anderson 
authorities herded everyone into the school auditorium asked to 
see childrens birth certificates and released them when parents 
showed documents she said 
rocky otwell interviewed by telephone said his father was too 
busy to comment on the incident 
hes upset but theres not visibly any angry words 
exchanged said ms anderson

pope john paul ii today promised tens 
of thousands of jobless miners and dirtpoor peasants the church 
would help them pursue a society of love solidarity and justice 
in a onehour morning visit to the hardhit mining city of 
oruro the pontiff said he was aware of the crisis in bolivias tin 
mining industry 
in asuncion paraguay meanwhile the government of president 
gen alfredo stroessner canceled a scheduled meeting between john 
paul and a group of paraguayans that included opposition leaders 
authorities cited security reasons 
the pontiff arrived in uruguay on friday for a 13day tour of 
four south american nations he is to leave bolivia saturday for 
peru and is scheduled to arrive in paraguay on monday 
the deep mines that years ago were the great source of 
national wealth are now only mute witnesses to the so many 
lives consumed silently there the pope told the miners 
i come with a message of hope which does not mean passivity 
in the face of misery that each day becomes more evident but 
instead is an obligation to construct a new society founded in 
love solidarity and justice 
the pope spoke from a tall platform that gave him a clear view 
of the entrance to oruros staterun san jose mine from which most 
workers have been laid off in a government austerity program 
an umbrella held by an aide sheltered the pontiff from the 
intense sun of bolivias windswept altiplano or high plain oruro 
is 12160 feet above sea level 
local mining union leader victor lopez told the pope today 
you have not heard the call of our work sirens because the mines 
are empty and in our mining camps you hear only the wail of 
children because they cannot lift bread to their mouths 
a rural farmer also spoke to john paul we peasants suffer a 
lot treated very badly we suffer for our produce prices are not 
good we are cheated 
unemployment in oruro a city of 132000 is running at easily 
twice the national average of 22 percent it is considered the 
center of misery in bolivia itself south americas poorest country 
the collapse of world tin prices prompted bolivias conservative 
government to shut down 14 of 21 staterun mines leaving 21500 of 
27000 miners out of work 
the pope was to return from oruro to cochabamba where he spent 
tuesday night in a monastery he had several events planned for 
this afternoon in cochabamba including a mass and an encounter 
with the countrys youth 
cochabamba is the gateway to the countrys principal 
cocagrowing region and a center for cocaine trafficking it also 
is plagued by a growing problem with local drug consumption 
especially among the young and poor 
in la paz the pope reaffirmed the importance the roman catholic 
church places on traditional values and criticized a bolivian 
indian custom of concubinage 
the meeting in asuncion was scheduled to bring together diverse 
members of the paraguayan civilian sector including leaders of 
opposition parties that are not recognized by the government 
the government had criticized the invitation of opposition 
politicians to the meeting

security forces exchanged gunfire today 
with sikh extremists holed up inside the golden temple and police 
said witnesses had seen the bodies of five radicals inside the 
complex 
electricity and water were cut off to the temple sikhisms 
holiest shrine on tuesday after more than 800 pilgrims were 
evacuated according to security sources who spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
heavy firing was reported early today between an estimated 100 
extremists and about 2500 police and paramilitary forces 
surrounding the walled complex which covers about five city blocks 
aa siddiqui deputy inspector general of police said at least 
10 people have been killed and 10 injured since the violence began 
monday 
he said there were reports that five bodies of sikh radicals 
were inside the temple but there was no way for police to verify 
them 
police earlier reported that three bodies believed to be sikh 
militants were seen at daybreak on the ground outside the temple 
complex 
a hakeem a paramilitary police commander said it could not be 
determined if the men had fallen from the temple rooftop or killed 
while attempting to sneak in or out of the shrine 
siddiqui said his men had orders to fire on anyone moving inside 
the shrine he said that his troops could see entrances to food 
stores and an ammunitions dump inside the shrine and were 
preventing militants from getting to them 
we will keep this up for a least a few more days siddiqui 
said either the militants will be forced to surrender or will be 
eliminated 
he added we have no plans to enter the temple at this time 
the temples head priest jasbir singh rode was out of the 
temple for a speaking engagement on monday and has not been allowed 
to return he told reporters he asked authorities tuesday for 
permission to return but was denied 
he was conferring with indian officials today on ways to resolve 
the confrontation said amritsar police supterindent baldev singh 
said 
meanwhile a curfew imposed three days ago remained in place in 
most parts of amritsars old walled sector 
elsewhere in punjab state two men were killed by sikh gunmen 
early today in the central jalandhar district the united news of 
india reported the latest slaying raised to more than 940 the 
number of deaths blamed on the extremists this year 
since 1982 militant sikhs have been waging a guerrilla war for 
an independent homeland for their minority sect in the northern 
state their attacks have increased in recent months despite the 
federal governments decision a year ago to take direct control of 
security in the state 
although a majority in punjab sikhs comprise just 2 percent of 
indias 800 million people the sikhs claim they are discriminated 
against by hindus who make up 82 percent of the nationwide 
population 
the temple siege began after at least five people were killed 
and 10 hurt in a gunbattle monday between sikhs inside the complex 
and security forces 
the golden temple has become the main stronghold of sikh 
separatists and an estimated 100 were believed holed up in and 
around the shrine 
the complex includes offices living quarters hostels for 
pilgrims dining halls and kitchens the temple itself is 
surrounded by a pool and reached by a single walkway 
the security forces beefed up after the initial outbreak of 
fire were given orders on tuesday to shoot anyone attempting to 
leave the shrine 
much of their gunfire on tuesday afternoon was directed at a 
watch tower overlooking the temples main entrance 
in june 1984 the indian army carried out a raid to drive 
militants from the golden temple and more than 1200 people were 
killed five months later prime minister indira gandhi was 
assassinated by two sikh bodguards in revenge 
in new delhi p chidambaram minister of state for home 
affairs told parliament today that other forces were being 
moved to amritsar to deal with the situation the united news of 
india reported he did not elaborate

the national academy of sciences has come down 
on the side of those who advocate that nasa establish a robot 
research and manufacturing facility in space to fill the time until 
a space station is in orbit 
we add our voice to the growing chorus of those urging nasas 
development of a mixed fleet of craft for access to space using 
elvs expendable launch vehicles for launching unmanned experiment 
packages and the shuttle for those that require human presence 
the academy said in a report tuesday 
it urged the national aeronautics and space administration to 
develop methods for keeping the shuttle in orbit for longer periods 
of time than has been the case and to develop freeflier 
platforms 
the reagan administration wants the space agency to encourage 
private development of space by agreeing to lease 70 percent of a 
robot factory which would be put into orbit by the space shuttle 
such a scheme would cost 140 million a year and require astronaut 
visits every three months for servicing 
congressional committees have balked at the idea viewing it as 
a move to deprive the space station program of funds thus killing 
it

democrats rallied on capitol hill today and 
vowed to fight president reagan from now until november if he makes 
good on his threat to veto the 1000page trade bill 
if you decide to pull out that pen mr president we will 
have to override that veto and we have the votes to do it rep 
tony coelho dcalif told listeners gathered at the steps of the 
democratic national committee 
it remained unclear however where supporters of the measure 
would find enough support in the senate to override a presidential 
veto the bill fell three votes short of what would be needed 
well consult the stars sen john kerry dmass said 
drawing a laugh from the crowd 
several hundred supporters including congressmen their aides 
and labor officials spilled into the street as party leaders urged 
reagan to relent and sign the measure it was the final show of 
political muscle before sending the measure to reagans desk 
absent from the ceremony however was rep dan rostenkowski 
dill the chairman of the housesenate conference committee that 
fashioned the legislation in reply to a question rep beryl 
anthony dark said rostenkowski may have had a scheduling 
conflict 
there have been recurrent reports however of friction between 
rostenkowski and house speaker jim wright dtexas over provisions 
of the measure at the rally wright introduced majority leader 
thomas foley dwash as the architect of the bill 
the ornate statuary hall next to the house chamber was chosen as 
the site for ceremonies in which wright was signing the bill and 
sending it on to reagan officials of labor unions and religious 
groups are among the invitees 
republicans are expected to be mainly absent from the 
festivities aimed at pressuring reagan to drop his veto threat and 
sign the bill after all 
reagan has been critical of the bills curbs on alaska oil 
exports and its provision requiring companies with 100 employees or 
more to provide 60day notice of plant closings and largescale 
layoffs 
meanwhile labor secretary ann mclaughlin told a manufacturers 
association the reagan administration recognized the popularity of 
the plant notification provision 
weve gotten together you and us and everyone whose been 
trying to fight the notification provision a real political 
problem she told the national association of manufacturers 
the polls have indicated that from the people ive talked to 
62 percent of the people think that plant notification is the right 
way to go another 13 percent think it should be much more 
stringent she said 
the major provisions of the bill have hardly figured in the 
debate in recent weeks they would streamline the system under 
which the united states imposes import restrictions and takes other 
steps to aid endangered us industries and retaliate against 
international trade violations 
but there are numerous other provisions ranging from 
agricultural subsidies to repeal of the windfall profits tax on oil 
companies 
reagan has been saying the alaska provisions violate the 
constitution by discriminating against that states ports while the 
plantclosings feature would dull rather than sharpen the nations 
edge in global markets 
supporters of the plantclosings provision call it a humane and 
decent way to treat employees and their families but there are 
only a handful of supporters for the alaska provisions which 
democratic leaders have been trying in vain to erase from the 
legislation 
i had hoped that if these offending provisions had been 
eliminated the president would have had one less reason for vetoing 
this bill senate majority leader robert c byrd dwva said 
tuesday 
the remark appeared to mark the end of efforts to erase the 
provisions 
the bill won final passage on april 27 but has been becalmed on 
capitol hill while leaders sought to do some afterthefact custom 
tailoring 
the house last week approved a resolution that would have 
instructed a congressional employee to call the enrolling clerk to 
smooth out any minor wrinkles in the bill and erase the alaska 
provisions while he was at it 
to bring up the resolution in the senate however byrd needed 
unanimous consent and was unable to obtain it tuesday when he

here are excerpts from recent editorials in newspapers 
throughout the nation 
may 9 
the baltimore sun on defense spending 
presidential candidates talk little about it but the military 
budget working its way through congress is a clear signal of 
painful decisions awaiting the next administration 
president reagan came to office trumpeting a defense buildup 
that in seven years raised military spending 2 trillion 
his successor will have to trim the current pentagon fiveyear 
plan by at least 300 billion and perhaps more than 500 billion 
half a trillion 
quite obviously a defense builddown on this scale will 
require drastic cuts in manpower in new weapons procurement in 
the number of bases scattered around congressional districts and in 
overseas bases and commitments 
but george bush and michael dukakis have hardly addressed this 
monumental prospect 
defense should be a major issue for the candidates because the 
intellectuals who advise them are already engaged in debate on the 
nations future world role 
clearly this is a period of marking time as the reagan era 
limps to a close soon enough a new president will have to take 
hold of a defense budget that will determine the countrys 
militarydiplomatic posture until the end of the century

appears to have accomplished its purpose to protect israels 
northern border 
that israel found it necessary to reenter lebanon foraying out 
of the security zone it has imposed on that unhappy country is 
without doubt regrettable 
the action will not make secretary of state george shultzs 
peace initiative any easier 
but lets not focus on israel as to blame it belongs if 
anywhere with the palestinian radicals backed by syria iran and 
the kremlin who refuse to negotiate with israel and who use the 
palestinian refugees as pawns in the bloody cynical game of 
mideast power politics

carlsbad nm currentargus on alcohol 
anyone watching tv is likely to get the impression that you can 
guzzle down alcohol like soda pop and still shoot straight beat up 
the bad guys and rescue the heroine from a fate worse than death 
over the years this constant portrayal of continuous drinking 
as part of the american lifestyle has made it part of the lifestyle 
in the process alcoholism has become the biggest drugrelated 
killer of americans during the past two generations 
perhaps it is time to address the problem of alcohol the same 
way the us surgeon general handled tobacco addiction he did not 
treat cigarette smoking as a moral problem but as a menace to the 
health and welfare of the whole people 
a similar campaign to educate and depopularize the use of 
alcohol might be equally effective

los angeles times on the treatment given undocumented aliens 
the importance of a federal court ruling last month on refugees 
from el salvador is all the more important and appropriate in the 
light of the confusion surrounding the closing of applications for 
amnesty under the new immigration law 
us district judge david v kenyon has made permanent an 
injunction requiring the immigration and naturalization service to 
inform salvadorans of their rights when they come into custody 
there has been kenyon said a pattern and practice of 
pressuring salvadorans to accept voluntary departure from the 
united states 
kenyon ordered the ins once again to inform the salvadorans of 
their right to apply for political asylum their right to counsel 
and their right to access to a public telephone 
the providing of information concerning these basic rights 
should be standard operating procedure for processing all 
undocumented aliens

sioux falls sd argus leader on the reagans interest in 
astrology 
president reagan is as resilient a politician as there is 
but with only about eight months left in his second fouryear 
term as president there may not be enough time for him to live 
down his latest embarrassment 
there has been some straightfaced disappointment expressed but 
many of reagans critics have been chuckling since last weeks 
disclosure that nancy reagan reportedly used astrology to determine 
the timing of the presidents speeches and travel 
we find it odd that reagan a supporter of creationism and 
prayer in public schools is linked with a practice denounced by 
some religious denominations

fort worth texas startelegram on attorney general edwin meese 
one of the saddest commentaries on the state of affairs in the 
last year of the reagan administration is that fbi director william 
sessions would be asked and would respond at length about the 
ethical conduct of public officials 
while sessions remarks were labeled as pure speculation as 
they specifically concerned the many investigations into attorney 
general edwin meeses private and public conduct what the fbi 
chief said was worth noting 
sessions clearly grasps the imperative of public officials 
particularly those related to the enforcement of the law to be 
generally perceived by the american public as being people who 
abide by the law 
call it sleaze call it greed call it situation ethics some 
behavior simply cannot be tolerated in public officials 
the perception of sleaze erodes the respect that is fundamental 
in a system of laws choosing which laws we will obey sessions 
said is contrary to the fabric of american society generally we 
are a country of law 
that is something every citizen must remember from the 
stockbroker or laborer who snorts cocaine to an ollie north who 
employs drug traffickers or an edwin meese who peddles influence

the oshkosh wis northwestern on the message of prison 
sentences 
if sentences have messages it is hard to tell what the message 
is when a man gets a sixyear sentence on first degree sexual 
assault under circumstances that can only be described as extreme 
the man was accused and pleaded no contest to the first 
degree charge in march and was sentenced last week 
the victim was a 6yearold girl she was tied up at the time of 
the rape and was totally at the disposal of the criminal there is 
even some evidence that it was not a onetime crime 
this was an extreme case yet the sentence handed down is less 
than one third of the maximum sentence true the maximum is 
perhaps to be reserved for such crimes done under threat of a 
weapon 
but to a 6yearold theres little difference whether there was 
a weapon present or not 
knowing the man may be out in four years does not tell society 
that first degree rape is being treated with the full vigor of the 
law

the daily news journal murfreesboro tenn on atomic 
veterans 
president reagans advisers are asking him to veto a bill which 
would grant some new benefits to the nations atomic veterans 
those exposed to radiation in the 1945 occupation of japan or 
during postwar testing of atomic weapons 
we urge reagan to ignore this advice and give americas veterans 
the care to which they are entitled 
the measure would cover some 250000 us military personnel 
many of those were at hiroshima or nagasaki in the weeks 
immediately following the atomic bombing of those japanese cities 
in august 1945 
every military man puts his life on the line for his country 
but those who entered the two bombed cities exposed themselves 
unknowingly to radiation which can cause sickness and death years 
afterward 
others affected by the bill reagan wants to veto were in the 
armed forces after the wars end when aboveground atomic blasts 
were done to test nuclear weapons 
americas veterans of all ages deserve the best the country can 
provide for them and that is especially true for those who were 
exposed to deadly radiation in the performance of their duties 
we urge president reagan to put these veterans ahead of the 
governments worries about legal liabilities

were we dreaming did the wealthiest nation on the planet just 
open its doors to about 2 million people who have lived illegally 
within its borders for the past six years 
and is it prepared to say all is forgiven and soon you can 
achieve full citizenship 
we had every right to gather up illegals and give them the boot 
a remedy that may well have been preferred by those americans 
prejudiced against the immigrants many of whom are dark skinned 
 
we are a nation of immigrants with the sad exception of slaves 
our kin arrived here seeking what the best nation in the world had 
to offer 
we have not slammed the door this unprecedented amnesty program 
gives us additional reason to be proud

the worthington minn daily globe on vice president george 
bush 
vice president george bush was telling reporters last 
wednesday he sometimes doesnt speak up at presidential cabinet 
meetings because he fears one day he may be mentioned in a kiss 
and tell book 
other times bush said he doesnt speak up because i dont 
want the president to have to be choosing between his vice 
president and the other members of the cabinet 
bush offered several reasons for not having expressed opinions 
through the past eight years 
but what kind of president would george bush make if he is loath 
to speak up even as vice president because someone someday might 
quote something he said 
anyone who aspires to the white house must be willing to speak 
out and to express himself must be willing even to risk 
embarrassment 
we must wonder what kind of president george bush would be when 
he is afraid even now to state his views at cabinet meetings 
because his words might sometime be included in someones book

the augusta ga chronicle augusta herald on pete roses 
suspension 
a powerful message was sent to professional baseball managers 
and players in the 30day suspension of cincinnatti reds manager 
pete rose for shoving umpire dave pallone in a game with the new 
york mets 
although pallone showed poor judgment in delaying his call some 
four seconds thus infuriating rose national league president bart 
giamatti is warning the league that pushing an umpire will not be 
tolerated for any reason 
but the chief reason rose was rapped so harshly is because 
reds fans became unruly throwing objects at met players and 
pallone 
holding rose or any other manager responsbile for the actions 
of those in attendance doesnt make sense 
the most feasible solution would be to make a team forfeit a 
game if crowd control becomes a problem and forfeit another if the 
crowd still wont calm down 
two or three forfeits in a row should bring the rowdies to their 
senses

a car packed with explosives blew up 
today on a bridge minutes after police had chased it away from the 
israeli embassy authorities said three people were killed and 15 
wounded 
the semiofficial cyprus news agency said an arab man who owned 
the car was arrested while trying to run away from the scene 
a caller claiming to represent terrorist abu nidals group told 
nbc news this morning at a bureau in the middle east that abu 
nidals organization was responsible for the bombing bill 
mcandrew nbcs manager of news information quoted the caller as 
saying it was the first of future attacks against israeli targets 
abu nidal whose real name is sabry albanna has been accused 
by israeli arab and western intelligence agencies of directing 
scores of terrorist attacks they include simultaneous assaults at 
rome and vienna airports dec 27 1985 that killed 20 people 
his group fatahrevolutionary council broke in 1976 with 
fatah the mainstream guerrilla faction led by palestine liberation 
organization chief yasser arafat 
israeli ambassador aharon lopez said the israeli embassy was a 
possible target of todays bombing authorities said windows were 
shattered in the building but no one there was injured 
the mitsubishi pajero exploded and disintegrated in the middle 
of the bridge on a main highway less than 200 yards from the 
embassy the explosion set four other vehicles on the bridge ablaze 
a police statement said a briefcase containing a remotecontrol 
detonating device was found about 200 yards from the site of the 
blast no further details were available 
a police statement said the cars driver and a greek cypriot 
woman who was in a car immediately behind were killed another 
greek cypriot andreas frangos a retired diplomat was in another 
nearby car and died of his wounds in a hospital a few hours later 
fifteen other people were taken to nicosia general hospital with 
various wounds hospital officials said 
the news agency said the arrested arab whom it did not name 
had arrived on the island on march 21 
later today scores of policemen converged on a nicosia 
apartment building where the man lived and searched it 
police said the car with the bomb had a foreign visitors 
temporary cyprus registration plates and twice tried to park 
outside the fourstory embassy in a narrow side street 
cypriot police guards told the driver parking was forbidden and 
the car sped off toward the grivas avenue bridge the explosion 
came a minute later the statement said 
there must have been a lot of explosives packed in that car 
nicosia police chief andreas trifyllis told newsmen at the scene 
lopez told israel army radio we do not know yet who is 
responsible but it is certainly possible that the embassy was the 
terrorists target and that the car bomb exploded prematurely for 
some reason 
meanwhile in jerusalem the foreign ministry condemned the 
attempted bomb attack 
the explosion in the wake of which innocent cypriots were 
hurt was another attempt to exploit the soil of cyprus for 
terrorist attacks against israel the ministry said 
defense minister yitzhak rabin called it another terror 
attempt against israel israelis israeli representation outside 
the region terror has become part of our life 
however rabin said he would not describe the attack as an 
escalation in the war between arab guerrillas and israel 
on monday police arrested a lebanese at larnaca airport who was 
carrying a silencerequipped pistol and two full ammunition 
magazines hidden in a radiocasette player 
the arrested man hassan moussa 22 had just arrived on a 
middle east airlines flight from beirut and the pistol was 
discovered during an xray check 
moussa was ordered in custody for eight days by a larnaca court 
on tuesday pending the completion of police investigations 
police prosecutor andreas charalambous told the court moussa 
admitted he had arrived in cyprus to commit a crime but did 
not give more details 
the bridge on grivas avenue is crossed by the main road from the 
capital of this mediterranean island to western and northwestern 
cyprus 
in october 1984 a car bomb explosion damaged the multistory 
building housing the israeli embassy which was then in a different 
part of town no one was injured 
responsibility for that attack was claimed by the mainstream 
fatah faction of the plo 
the plo has accused israel of killing khalil wazir a top plo 
leader in tunis last month as well as killing three plo officials 
in a cyprus car bombing last february

pat robertson says his decision to leave the 
ministry to run for president was right but he may return soon to 
his ailing christian broadcasting network according to a newspaper 
report today 
robertson left cbn and resigned his ordination as a southern 
baptist minister in september 1987 to campaign full time for the 
1988 republican presidential nomination 
at the white house today robertson endorsed vice president 
george bush and told reporters that he will officially withdraw 
from the race on monday 
asked if he would run again in 1992 if bush loses this fall 
robertson replied its conceivable its not a certainty 
in his interview with the virginianpilot and the ledgerstar 
robertson said of the television network he formerly led i cant 
abandon cbn its too important to me ive got to do everything i 
can to make sure that its healthy 
robertson told the newspaper he likely would return to cbn as 
chief executive officer the title his eldest son timothy now 
holds the senior robertson also said he would appear on the air 
probably as a news commentator 
asked when he might return robertson said very shortly its 
not too long 
robertson has lost badly to bush and former candidate bob dole 
in gop contests nationwide meanwhile cbn has lost viewers and 
donors laying off hundreds of workers 
i assumed that i had built a very competent staff and that 
they would be able to run cbn in my absence robertson told the 
newspaper i did not realize that my personal presence on the 
700 club was as important as it is to the audience 
i was able to do news analysis and at the same talk about 
spiritual things and weve had a hard time getting a replacement 
for that so the audience has dropped dramatically in the last 
year that has of course impacted contributions 
robertson said his return to the airwaves would not necessarily 
spell a return to the 700 club cbns flagship show and 
mainstay of the past two decades 
it may be time to look for other vehicles to talk to the 
american public and the world public robertson said the 700 
club has been around since 1967 and thats 21 years thats a long 
time for any television program

said the spokeswoman sue cardillo 
its very bad ms cardillo said shes beginning to show 
signs of multiple organ failure and her heart is being

surgeons changed drainage tubes inserted last month to relieve a 
buildup of bile in her transplanted liver ms cardillo said 
tabatha was connected to a breathing machine and was unconscious 
and under sedation ms cardillo said 
the medication that subdues the bodys tendency to reject 
transplanted organs left tabatha susceptible to infection ms

infection which has entered her bloodstream to flare

president reagan hinted anew today at the 
worst kept secret of the republican primary season his support of 
george bushs presidential campaign 
in a sort of political tease for the formal endorsement reagan 
will make tonight at a republican party dinner here the president 
accompanied by bush walked into the cabinet room to waiting gop 
congressional leaders 
as they emerged the lawmakers applauded 
i just have very brief announcement to make and that is that 
ill have something to say about the campaign tonight reagan 
said 
the president then walked over to the table sat down next to 
vanquished republican presidential hopeful bob dole and grinned 
widely as reporters tried to question him saying at one point he 
had other business that needed more immediate attention 
bush smiled walked to the other side of the table and took his 
seat across from reagan 
a short time later pat robertson told reporters at the white 
house he gave bush his endorsement in a private meeting and said he 
would withdraw from the gop race on monday 
i will be making that official on monday because the race 
is pretty much over said robertson who has won only 46 
delegates in the republican primary and caucus competition 
i didnt ask anything for myself in the meeting with bush 
he said i spoke about education and the need to bring the 1984 
platform into line with the realities of 1988 he said 
as robertson was speaking to reporters just outside the white 
house bush appeared with several aides on the second floor balcony 
of the vice presidents office in the old executive office 
building across the street and waved 
robertson said he told bush he would work to get his supporters 
to back the vice president he said that bush made no assurances 
about specific issues 
we definitely had a meeting of the minds on the platform 
robertson said my feelings and his feelings were totally in 
harmony that the 1984 document of the republican party platform is 
something we can all unify behind 
reagans blessing later in the day will be anticlimatic since 
it comes two weeks after the pennsylvania primary in which bush won 
sufficient republican convention delegates to lock up the party 
nomination 
the president chose a cabinet room meeting with gop 
congressional leaders to say he would complete the public 
endorsement of bush tonight at a republican party dinner here 
the timing of reagans endorsement had been the subject of 
highlevel jockeying between bush campaign and white house 
officials in recent days although there never was any serious 
question that reagan supported bush 
two weeks ago when reagan was asked on the day after the 
pennsylvania primnary whether he was endorsing bush the president 
replied that he thought the time had come for that but that he 
wasnt quite ready to do it let us see he told reporters 
reagan had steadfastly maintained from the outset of the 
republican competition early last year that he would remain 
neutral until a nominee emerged 
the president had said that as titular leader of his party it 
would be inappropriate to do otherwise

and us district judge charles haight did not set a sentencing 
date 
the bank robbery and racketeering convictions carry maximum 
20year sentences

legislation authorizing a bronze statue of a 
female army nurse at the vietnam veterans memorial was approved by 
a senate committee wednesday over a dissenters protest that the 
memorial might become a sculpture garden for special interest 
groups 
before the bill was passed by the senate energy and natural 
resources committee by voice vote and sent to the senate floor it 
was amended to stress that congress would not approve any further 
additions to the memorial once a womans statue is built 
but sen daniel j evans rwash was not satisfied he noted 
that a statue of three vietnam infantrymen and a 60foot flagpole 
already have been erected on the 22acre memorial site near the 
lincoln memorial and he predicted there would be further demands 
to recognize others who served in vietnam 
sen bennett johnston dla the committee chairman said the 
bill specifies that this will be the last 
but the last for how long evans retorted 
evans alone among 17 committee members in opposing the bill 
said that adding bits and pieces to this stark and dramatic 
memorial would destroy its artistic integrity he made clear that 
his dissenting vote had nothing to do with his respect for american 
women 
the politically popular measure introduced by sens alan 
cranston dcalif and david durenberger rminn with 63 
sponsors has been endorsed by the interior department 
but it is opposed by the commission of fine arts and the 
national capital planning commission whose approval also is 
required before any new monuments can be built on federal parkland 
in the capital 
at a committee hearing last february the bill was applauded by 
veterans organizations but criticized by maya lin the architect 
who designed the vietnam veterans memorial 
i cannot see where it will all end she said what is to 
stop someone from trying to add a female statue to the iwo jima 
memorial 
she and j carter brown chairman of the fine arts commission 
said it might be more appropriate to build a separate monument to 
all american women who have served in the armed forces since world 
war ii congress authorized such a monument in 1986 
robert w doubek former executive director of the vietnam 
veterans memorial fund warned that to add a womans statue would 
open a pandoras box of competing and proliferating statuary to 
the ephemeral goal of literally depicting every possible 
subcategory that served in vietnam 
doubek said the national park service already had received 
requests for statues honoring native americans and scout dogs at 
the vietnam memorial 
the memorials black granite slab bears the names of more than 
58000 vietnam war dead including eight uniformed nurses 
built with 11 million in private funds the memorial has become 
the most popular tourist attraction of any national monument in 
washington the memorial which was dedicated in 1982 has 
attracted an estimated 20 million visitors

students from a california junior high got a 
lesson from the school of hard knocks when the agency that arranged 
their east coast tour ran out of money midway through the trip 
leaving them without cash for food lodging or airplane tickets 
home 
the 185 youth from emerald junior high school in el cajon were 
able to continue their planned itinerary today heading for 
philadelphia in buses only after their school board agreed to pick 
up costs for the trip and american airlines donated plane tickets 
home 
the youths 38 teachers and parent chaperones pooled their cash 
tuesday to stay the night at a lowercost washington hotel after 
the travel agency that arranged the prepaid tour just ran out of 
money said principal marge dean trying to oversee the situation 
from california 
i dont know what the travel agency did with the money but 
its gone she said today 
she said the school board voted tuesday night to pick up 
remaining costs for the trip estimated at 47000 and would ask 
the parents to have some kind of fundraising activity theyll 
probably have to have car washes to help defray the costs 
the kids have been wonderful a little bit tearyeyed and 
concerned but now that they know that they can continue the trip 
theyre wonderful she said 
ms dean said no one at eastwest travel and tours of san diego 
had been available to comment since the agency announced tuesday 
the trip was being cancelled due to a lack of money telephones at 
the agency went unanswered early today 
tour director steve ewalt an employee of the travel agency who 
said he was sticking with the students even though he wasnt 
getting paid said hed directed hundreds of tours for the company 
but this time we could sense that it was a little different 
we just found that the money was drying up he said when 
it stops right in the middle theres really nothing we can do 
about it 
he said he didnt know what had happened back at the travel 
agency but that continuing the tour for the students was the top 
priority for now 
the kids i dont think have experienced any of the real 
heartache that some of us have he said 
ewalt said the students boarded buses for philadelphia early 
today and would spend the end of the week in new york before 
heading home on saturday 
im just making calls letting everyone know were still 
coming ewalt said this morning prior to leaving washington 
the students began their east coast tour friday in williamsburg 
va then toured thomas jeffersons home monticello and arrived 
in washington over the weekend

the united states and its nato allies 
should revise their joint defense compact to shift more of the 
financial and military burden onto the europeans a new study has 
concluded 
the report by a panel of legislators and defense experts from 
the united states canada and eight european nato member countries 
is a summary of conclusions from a yearlong study on the future of 
the western alliance 
the report titled nato in the 1990s is to be presented 
publicly in washington on may 18 details were disclosed this week 
by sources associated with the study 
the report says a new political mandate for the north atlantic 
treaty organization is needed to reflect a fundamental change in 
the relationship between western europe and america 
the european members must take on more responsibilities in line 
with the regions increased economic strength and greater political 
cohesion the report said 
the united states it said is undergoing a major reexamination 
of its global role in light of massive budget and trade deficits 
that jeopardize not only its own economy but also the world 
economic system 
as a result of growing european and diminishing american clout 
leaders from both sides of the atlantic should strike a new defense 
bargain the report said 
its time for a better equilibrium within the 39yearold 
alliance said peter corterier secretarygeneral of the north 
atlantic assembly a nato advisory group of parliamentarians that 
sponsored the study 
we feel it cannot be denied that the relative weight of the 
united states and western europe has changed corterier said in 
an interview tuesday 
pressure in the us congress has been mounting in recent years 
for the europeans to bear a bigger share of the cost of defending 
nato territory a congressional budget office study published 
tuesday said the united states spends 67 percent of its annual 
economic output on defense compared with 33 percent for nonus 
nato members 
the united states has been predominant in nato since it was 
formed in 1949 this is because of americas role as the nuclear 
guarantor of western europes security as well as its traditional 
economic power 
the reports conclusions do not call into question natos 
official doctrine of relying on a mixture of conventional and 
nuclear arms to deter attack 
it says a substantial us troop presence in europe as well as 
a us nuclear guarantee for the alliance remains vital to western 
security 
nonetheless a new mandate for the alliance should be drawn up 
soon preferably within a year after president reagan leaves office 
next january it said 
the mandate should reaffirm the standard nato aims of pursuing 
arms control agreements with the soviet bloc while maintaining a 
strong defense but it should include the following additional 
elements 
the european members should promise to intensify cooperation 
among themselves as a way of economizing in an era in which 
government defense spending is expected to be severely constrained 
the united states should welcome a move toward greater european 
cooperation on defense matters 
all the allies must agree that future nato policy matters 
reflect a progressively larger european influence 
the report also recommended 
creating separately from nato a consultative body to 
coordinate policies on security matters outside the nato treaty 
area membership would be open to japan and other nonnato 
democratic nations 
lessening natos reliance on shortrange nuclear weapons and 
by the 1990s further reducing the number of nuclear arms in 
europe the report rejected the soviet aim of scrapping all nuclear 
weapons 
establishing a natowarsaw pact crisis avoidance center which 
would bring together military experts and diplomats from both blocs 
to exchange information on military activities and seek to resolve 
lowlevel incidents involving nato and warsaw pact military 
personnel

a federal judge today ruled that the 
us department of agriculture did nothing wrong when it lifted a 
ban on shipments of florida citrus to other citrusproducing areas 
us district judge filemon velas ruling was in response to a 
suit filed by the state of texas in an effort to keep florida fruit 
out of the state 
the usda on feb 11 lifted a 3year ban on shipments of fresh 
florida citrus into texas and other citrusproducing areas the 
florida fruit was quarantined after an outbreak of citrus canker in 
parts of florida in the fall of 1984 
officials of the texas attorney generals office and state 
agriculture department filed suit on march 9 contending that the 
usda violated its own rules in lifting the ban 
with all the information put before me i am satisfied that 
the usda followed the law in promulgating the rule vela said today 
texas officials sought to have the quarantine reinstated and 
claimed the usda did not allow adequate time for comment when it 
lifted the ban 
but vela said the new protocol is so similar to one the usda 
proposed last fall that there had been plenty of time for comment

twentyseven us and soviet scientists 
studying the greenhouse effect warming of the earth inaugurated 
a yearlong electronic seminar using personal computer terminals 
wednesday 
researchers will use their terminals to send messages at any 
hour to electronic mailboxes the messages can be retrieved at 
any time by other members of the seminar sponsored by the institute 
of space sciences in moscow part of the soviet academy of 
sciences and the university corporation for atmospheric research 
in boulder colo 
the opening ceremonial exchange between washington and moscow 
was timed to coincide with a twoday facetoface conference on 
global warming in moscow sponsored by the institute the 
corporation the us natural resources defense council and the 
institute for resource management an environmental research 
organization headed by actor robert redford 
the computer exchanges will be a lot more collegial than your 
typical international conference permitting the informal sharing 
of tentative ideas trying out of approaches and asking what 
if questions said irving mintzner of the world resources 
institute one of the researchers taking part 
the world resources institute was host to the washington 
ceremonies 
the electronic setup is a workshop i like to say 
commented elena loshchenkova senior staff scientist of the moscow 
institute 
one of the organizers of the electronic seminar former 
astronaut russell schweickart said a real conference would take 
weeks to organize and would cost at least 10 times more for the 
same productivity 
last year schweickart walter orr roberts retired president of 
the university corporation for atmospheric research and roald z 
sagdeev director of the institute in moscow were blocked from 
using apple corps macintosh computers in the soviet union because 
the pentagon considered that machines graphics programs too 
sensitive to provide to a potential adversary 
climate scientists are big users of computer graphics because 
their results frequently take the form of global maps 
the organizers decided to go ahead using machines compatible 
with ibm corp personal computers which have less advanced 
graphics capability than the apple machines 
but recently the export ban on macintosh was lifted and four 
or five have been taken to the soviet union for use in the 
program schweickart said 
the electronic seminar is being supported by a grant from the 
rockefeller brothers fund the seminar also has free use of 
1050word per minute satellite and land circuits of the european 
space agency linking the united states europe and the soviet union 
asked if the exchanges would be monitored by the two 
governments schweickart said who knows and in part who 
cares 
the greenhouse effect refers to the buildup of gases in the 
atmosphere that trap heat normally radiated out to space the most 
important of these gases is carbon dioxide resulting from the 
burning of fossil fuels 
us scientists generally agree that sometime in the next 
century the average temperature of the earth will be three to eight 
degrees fahrenheit warmer than it is now

an azerbaijan metalworker went on trial for murder 
wednesday in connection with ethnic riots that killed at least 32 
people in february pravda reported he was the first of more than 
80 people charged to stand trial 
the communist party newspaper said the defendant identified as 
t ismailov was accused of participating in the riots in the 
azerbaijan city of sumgait and intentionally killing someone for 
hooligan motives ismailov is an employee of a pipe and tube 
plant 
ethnic violence broke out feb 28 in sumgait during a 
territorial dispute between azerbaijan and the neighboring republic 
of armenia armenians had demanded that nagornokarabakh an 
armeniandominated region of azerbaijan be annexed to armenia 
armenian activists said armenians living in sumgait an 
industrial city on the caspian sea about 20 miles of baku were 
hunted down by bands of azerbaijanis 
soviet media have said 26 ethnic armenians and 6 azeris were 
killed officials said 200 people were injured 
all those charged will be tried in sumgait by a tribunal led by 
albert k klokov a member of the azerbaijan supreme court pravda 
said if convicted of murder ismailov could be sentenced to death 
and shot by a firing squad 
pravda quoted zulfi s gadzhiev head of the sumgait communist 
party as saying even petty crime has declined since the riots but 
effects of the violence remain 
many families that left the city during those bitter february 
days have still not returned home he said we will be exact 
more than 1200 jobs at factories and institutions are still 
empty 
gadzhiev said the jobs were being kept open because officials 
expect the people who held them to return 
the unrest caused a bleeding wound that made a rift between 
armenians and azeris pravda said 
it also declared that the trials will show who needed to sow 
hostility between the two peoples a possible reference to 
official allegations of foreign involvement in the riots 
soviet media customarily accuse such western media as the voice 
of america and radio liberty of trying to foment trouble among the 
many soviet ethnic groups

conservationists picked the national zoo to 
launch a campaign wednesday to discourage americans from buying 
carved ivory in an attempt to save the lives of african elephants 
most people dont realize that ivory comes from elephants 
said diana e mcmeekin vice president of the african wildlife 
foundation they think its like jade 
ivory is so precious that the foundation suspects that traders 
somewhere are hoarding it in the hope of a new price rise cynthia 
moss author of the recent book elephant memories told 
reporters that todays price for raw ivory is 68 a pound up from 
240 in the 1960s 
the us fish and wildlife service says us imports of carved 
ivory are worth 20 million to 30 million a year the foundation 
estimates that 95 percent of it comes from hong kong usually 
smuggled from africa through the middle east japan is an even 
bigger customer 
the foundation estimates that the 800 tons of ivory sold in the 
world every year costs the lives of 80000 elephants americans 
could save about 27000 of those elephants by refusing to buy ivory 
rings and other trinkets it says 
the foundation calculates that the elephant population in 
africa which may once have been as high as 3 million was down to 
13 million in 1979 and about 750000 today though it does not see 
a threat to the survival of elephants it predicts that the entire 
environment of africa will change because of the reduction in 
elephant numbers 
mrs mcmeekin acknowledged that african governments of which 
about 30 have elephants on their territory oppose the campaign 
i had a fourhour fight with the zimbabweans the other day 
she said they dont approve at all 
she said african governments work hard to protect wildlife and 
understand that they lose money from tourists as it disappears but 
they resent action from other countries 
paul t schindler president of the foundation said that is why 
the foundation opposes a bill now before congress to ban imports of 
ivory it also disapproves another which mrs mcmeekin said is 
being drafted that would put a tax on imports of ivory with the 
proceeds to be used to promote conservation 
schindler said that could mislead purchasers into thinking they 
were helping protect elephants instead of promoting their 
destruction 
mrs mcmeekin said she avoids using words such as boycott 
but she urged amnericans dont buy ivory 
she estimated that about 80 percent of the ivory in this country 
is imported legally though sometimes with the help of forged 
documents but was originally taken in violation of the law in an 
african country

the government introduced legislation 
in parliament on wednesday to make islam the state religion of 
bangladesh the move sparked street protests and was denounced by 
opposition parties and womens groups 
like the water lily is the state flower islam shall be the 
state religion information minister mahbubur rahman told 
reporters before prime minister maudud ahmed introduced the bill in 
the house 
the bill was expected to pass easily because the ruling jatiya 
party of president hussain muhammad ershad holds 251 of the 300 
seats 
the government is trying to divide the nation in the name of 
islam opposition member shahjehan siraj said government seems 
to have some bad motives behind it 
witnesses and opposition leaders said at least 50 people were 
injured when more than 1000 opposition supporters stoned six 
governmentowned buses in downtown dhaka 
bangladeshs 105 million people are 85 percent moslem with 
christian hindu and buddhist minorities the country has had a 
secular constitution since it won independence from pakistan in 
1971 
ershad told a religious gathering in march that the daytoday 
life of the nation must be guided by the tenets of islam and the 
ideals of prophet mohammed 
this law will curtail the activities of the fundamentalists 
who are gaining ground because of islamic slogans said a senior 
leader in ershads jatiya party who spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
the constitutional amendment is the first major bill to come 
before the parliament which was elected last march 3 most 
opposition parties boycotted that election and only about half of 
the nations 48 million eligible voters cast ballots 
twentyone opposition groups which have been agitating since 
last november for the ouster of ershad pledged to oppose any 
attempts by the parliament to change the constitution these 
parties which have no seats in the house contend parliament does 
not represent the people 
but ahmed promised that the bill would not be rushed to passage 
there shall be enough time for the opposition to speak on it 
he said 
the government will seek public opinion on the legislation 
he added 
several womens rights groups have already held demonstrations 
against the idea of making islam the state religion

pat robertson acknowledging the obvious endorsed george bush 
today and said he would drop his own candidacy for the republican 
presidential nomination on monday president reagan prepared to 
make his own formal endorsement of bush as democratic frontrunner 
michael dukakis celebrated two more big primary victories over 
jesse jackson 
robertson the former television evangelist conceded weeks ago 
that he had no chance to catch bush he said today after meeting 
with bush at the white house that he wanted to give his supporters 
a chance to win national convention seats during gop caucuses this 
weekend in arizona and virginia then would pull out 
asked if he would run again in 1992 if bush loses this fall 
robertson replied its conceivable its not a certainty 
reagan in a teasing mood told reporters today at the white 
house with bush nearby i just have a very brief announcement 
to make and that is that ill have something to say about the 
campaign tonight grinning he declined to answer questions on 
the subject 
the president is to announce what everyone already knows at a 
republican dinner tonight 
vice president bush cruised to barely contested wins in 
tuesdays contests in nebraska and west virginia he already has a 
mathematical lock on the republican nomination 
but bushs showing in nebraska pointed to possible weakness in 
the fight to come this fall sen bob dole of neighboring kansas 
who dropped out of the republican race almost two months ago still 
siphoned off nearly a fourth of the vote 
even though he has mowed down all his rivals bush has made weak 
showings in some farm states 
with two more wins in his column dukakis moved within striking 
distance of the 2081 delegates needed to nail the democratic 
nomination according to the latest ap delegate count dukakis had 
1581 to jacksons 942 
in west virginia dukakis captured 254206 votes or 79 percent 
to jacksons 45111 or 14 percent with 99 percent of the precincts 
reporting in nebraska dukakis received 105542 votes or 63 
percent to jacksons 43134 or 26 percent with 100 percent of the 
precincts in 
dukakis won all 37 of the delegates in west virginia and 18 of 
the 25 in nebraska 
exit polls suggested dukakis was beginning to make some inroads 
into jacksons black support which has been all but monolithic in 
contests to date only about 4 percent of west virginias voters 
are black but about a third of them voted for the massachusetts 
governor abc voter polls on tuesday indicated 
but jackson won 24 percent of the white vote in nebraska one of 
his best showings of the primary season among white voters 
according to abc dukakis for his part did well among democrats 
in both states who voted for reagan in 1984 which would bode well 
for him in a fall confrontation with bush and he was winning 
support across the ideological spectrum 
voters of different ideologies look at dukakis and are seeing 
what they want to see said abc news poll analyst doug muzzio 
in a sense hes all ideologies to all voters 
bush won 108421 votes or 89 percent in west virginia with 99 
percent of the precincts reporting in nebraska he had 137229 or 
71 percent to doles 45376 or 24 percent robertson had 10273 or 
5 percent with 100 percent of the precincts in 
bush who is spending most of this week in the capital was 
heading off thursday on a campaign swing to new mexico california 
oregon and washington state 
as the votes were counted in west virginia and nebraska jackson 
had already moved on to oregon which holds its primary on tuesday 
with 45 democratic delegates at stake dukakis was heading to the 
state on thursday after a series of meetings with congressional 
leaders in washington 
but both dukakis and jackson were turning their attention toward 
california whose huge primary with its 314delegate prize is less 
than a month away 
californias june 7 contest the same day as primaries in new 
jersey montana and new mexico finishes off the democratic 
primary season and provides jackson with his last real chance to 
show some strength before the democratic national convention 
beginning july 18 
i hope by the 8th of june we are at or closing in on the 
nomination dukakis told reporters in new york city where he was 
attended a fundraiser tuesday night im working hard vigorously 
and i hope successfully to see if we can wrap it up 
even so he was not discounting jacksons strength as a rival 
were taking none of these primaries for granted dukakis 
said theyre all very very important 
jacksons aides have indicated he will invest as much money and 
time in california as he can 
the race is on and the race is live jackson said at a news 
conference in portland even as he congratulated dukakis on two 
more wins we will take it all the way to the end i want the 
nomination

a prominent business group and the nations 
two major teachers unions on wednesday endorsed a senate bill aimed 
at making highquality nursery schooling available to all 
4yearolds 
the socalled smart start program proposed by sen edward 
kennedy dmass would provide money to supplement and strengthen 
existing early childhood education programs run by schools 
community groups and others states and communities would share the 
cost 
the bill reserves at least half the spaces in the program for 
poor children betteroff families would be charged on a sliding 
scale the kennedy bill authorizes 500 million for the program in 
its first year 750 million in the second year and 1 billion in 
its third year 
we believe the time for this legislation has arrived albert 
shanker president of the american federation of teachers said in 
testimony to the senate labor and human resources committee chaired 
by kennedy 
both shanker and mary hatwood futrell president of the national 
education association said preschool programs receiving money 
under the bill should not emulate kindergarten or grade school but 
should help young children develop and learn as individuals 
they also said the federal government should set high training 
standards for preschool teachers in federally supported programs 
owen butler vice chairman of the committee for economic 
development said the group of 250 academic and corporate trustees 
views the kennedy bill with considerable enthusiasm 
butler retired chairman of proctor amp gamble co recommended 
merging smart start with the existing 1 billion head start program 
at the department of health and human services it makes little 
sense to have two programs he said 
butler also said he was concerned about the federal governments 
reliability in paying for the preschool programs under the bill 
states would have to put up 30 percent the first year 40 percent 
the second and 50 percent thereafter 
butler said states should have to pay 50 percent right from the 
start history has shown that where the federal government takes 
on too big a role and the federal funding is later reduced many 
programs die he said in his testimony 
the committee for economic development was formed to study ways 
to address pressing economic and social problems last fall the 
group released a study saying the nation should concentrate on 
helping poor children in their earliest months and years of life 
including prenatal care and enriched preschool education

police have arrested a former 
congressional candidate on charges that he tried to hire a hit man 
to kill mayor henry cisneros for 5000 officials said today 
officials arrested parker e abell on tuesday and charged him 
with solicitation of capital murder said district attorney fred 
rodriguez 
he was doing it to make a statement he wanted to get 
publicity rodriguez said 
rodriguez said abell had mentioned other possible targets 
including state comptroller bob bullock but decided on cisneros 
bullocks name was mentioned but for whatever reasons 
whether it was that bullock was out of town or not a big enough 
name he settled on mayor henry cisneros he wanted someone at the 
local level but with a national reputation rodriguez said 
rodriguez said he informed the mayors office of the alleged 
plot but did not recommend more protection for the mayor 
abell sought the 23rd congressional district seat in 1982 as a 
liberterian and told detectives he was now leader of a political 
extremists group the american patriots 
gary johnson texas secretary of libertarian party said today 
that abell is no longer a duespaying member and is not on the 
party mailing list 
rodriguez said the states investigation began about a month ago 
after internal revenue service officials contacted his office 
because an irs undercover agent had talked to a man who wanted to 
assassinate a public official 
the irs agent gave the man the name of an undercover officer who 
worked for prosecutors the two talked on the telephone then in 
person for the first time on tuesday rodriguez said 
he wanted a patriot to carry out the execution rodriguez 
said he was firm in his convictions and he wanted a hitman with 
the same resolve and same philosophy 
all conversations with abell were taped rodriguez said he was 
arrested at a supermarket pay phone tuesday afternoon 
rodriguez said that in abells car officers found a 22caliber 
rifle with 12 live rounds and execution warrants with blanks to 
fill in names of public officials 
the abovenamed traitor or traitors are to be executed on 
sight read the warrants each accused has given public proof 
of guilt beyond reasonable doubt that he or she is a traitor to the 
people of the united states and the united states constitution 
abell allegedly solicited this undercover officer as a 
shooter for himself and unknown associates wrote john veltkamp 
the undercover investigator for the bexar county district 
attorneys office who posed as the hit man 
the mayor said tuesday that he never met abell and does not 
recall receiving threatening letters from him 
we get threats on a regular basis not always with a price 
thats what makes this a little more serious said cisneros 
rodriguez said the investigation is continuing and that he would 
oppose the suspects being relased from jail 
we got a dangerous man here if he seeks out two hitmen he is 
determining his resolve to do something rodriguez said 
natalia abells home is 18 miles southwest of san antonio

a defense attorney in the cocaine 
smuggling trial of reputed colombian drug kingpin carlos lehder 
rivas told jurors in closing arguments today that lehders chief 
prosecutor must have attended a different trial 
he was in a trial in which all the witnesses told the truth 
edward r shohat said of us attorney robert merkle who wrapped 
up the governments final arguments minutes earlier he was in a 
trial in which there was no crossexamination of the witneses 
that wasnt the trial that occurred in this courtroom 
lehder 38 whom prosecutors said was a key member of colombias 
medellin cartel is charged with bringing 33 tons of cocaine into 
the united states from 1978 to 1980 paying bribes and making 
threats to use normans cay in the bahamas as a private relay 
station 
codefendant jack carlton reed 57 of san pedro calif is 
charged with smuggling conspiracy 
shohat said a big inconsistency in the governments case was 
that the indictment claimed that all the cocaine was delivered to 
colombians in southern florida but the governments key witness 
an american testified that some of the cocaine was delivered to 
him 
in his closing arguments merkle referred to trial testimony 
that lehder used bribes charm and threats to run a smuggling 
empire and that for once lehder was without such advantages 
he cannot buy his way out of a just verdict he cannot charm 
his way out of a just verdict and he cannot force his way out of a 
just verdict merkle said 
a day earlier merkle said lehder was waging a violent war 
against the united states and viewed cocaine as a weapon 
hes still at war merkle told the jury that has heard 22 
weeks of testimony 
merkle said tuesday that lehder viewed cocaine as a weapon 
against the united states the prosecutor also said the colombian 
was responsible for smuggling 19 tons into the united states and 
had earned 20 million 
that is an example of mr lehders children you saw in this 
courtroom said merkle several witnesses have testified that 
lehder referred to cocaine loads as children 
merkle blasted defense arguments that lehder had been used by 
convicted smuggler and key prosecution witness ed ward as well as 
contentions that lehder was a legitimate businessman who wanted to 
develop normans cay as a resort 
there is simply no way the defense is plausible credible or 
believable the prosecutor said a legitimate businessman 
doesnt attract tourists with machine guns 
the prosecutor said that to equate lehders drug organization to 
wards group of american smugglers was like comparing the boston 
red sox to the little league 
the evidence in this case shows a trail of bribery 
corruption violence and personal debasement that has been created 
and fostered by mr lehder he said 
the jury likely will get the case friday and begin deliberations 
on the 11count indictment charging lehder with conspiracy 
possession of cocaine with intent to distribute importation of 
cocaine and racketeering 
a separate miami indictment accuses lehder of being one of the 
leaders of the medellin cartel believed to be responsible for 80 
percent of the cocaine smuggled into united states

after reading about the suicide of a financially 
strapped farmer a security guard began spending his evenings at 
home writing a play to dramatize the plight of farm families 
bradford rileys foreclosure opens next week for a limited 
run at an offoff broadway theater in new york riley said he hopes 
the drama will be presented across the country 
no one is a spokesman for the farmer because farmers dont 
speak much riley said tuesday in a telephone interview maybe 
the play could do that its suited to play in a field in 
gymnasiums 
rileys play is based on the experiences of the hill family of 
waynesboro in east georgia lenard hill whose farm had been in his 
family for five generations killed himself 20 minutes before the 
land was to be auctioned in february 1986 to pay a 300000 debt 
hill reportedly hoped proceeds from his life insurance policy 
and a private land sale would settle the debt but it was not 
enough when the plight of his widow annabell hill was 
publicized atlanta businessman frank argenbright jr led a 
fundraising drive to help the family 
that drew the attention of among others new york developer 
donald trump who contributed 39000 two days before christmas 
1986 the mortgage on the 705acre farm was retired 
i kept getting news clippings and cutting them out of the 
paper about farmers committing suicide said riley 38 
but it was mrs hills story that inspired him to write 
i tried to show what its like what makes a farmer commit 
suicide he said 
foreclosure doesnt follow the hill story exactly in the 
play for example both husband and wife commit suicide riley 
said mrs hill now lives in augusta her son runs the farm 
riley who has dabbled in theater before but never tried a major 
production said he worked on the play for 1 years it will debut 
may 19 at the lamama theater and run for three weeks 
riley who farms parttime in blairsville in north georgia said 
he planned to present mrs hill with a signed copy of his play 
mrs hills story personifies for me the american farmers 
condition riley said my hopes are that foreclosure will 
bring the urgency of the farmers situation to the american 
conscience

an appeals court has ruled that the us 
drug enforcement administration does not have the authority to 
temporarily outlaw designer drugs as they hit the market 
the 9th us circuit court of appeals on tuesday threw out the 
convictions of three men found guilty of distributing and 
conspiring to distribute mdma or methylenedioxymethamphetamine in 
1985 and 1986 the drugs street name was ecstasy 
the court said the us attorney general had not delegated his 
authority to the administrator of the dea to designate the drug as 
a controlled substance 
the opinion issued by judge robert boochever said that federal 
law governing permanent scheduling of controlled substances was 
altered in 1984 with an amendment that fundamentally changed the 
process for temporary scheduling 
judge charles b wiggins dissented saying i believe the 
majority demands too much of the governments crimefighting 
efforts in the face of an unambiguous delegation of responsibility 
by congress 
i believe the plain intent of congress was to establish an 
expedited system of review in order to criminalize the possession 
manufacturing and distribution of newlydeveloped designer drugs 
before they become public health hazards he wrote 
in july 1985 the dea administrator added mdma to a federal 
list of temporarily controlled substances 
temporary scheduling designed to take effect within 30 days of 
announcement to avoid lengthy public comment that could jeopardize 
public safety expires after a year it can be extended six months 
if the attorney general has begun efforts to make it permanently 
illegal 
the court did not make a finding that the attorney general 
couldnt delegate authority to place ecstasy on the emergency 
list

students from a california junior high school 
got to continue their weeklong tour of the east coast on wednesday 
after school officials and an airline came to the rescue when their 
prepaid tour went bust 
the 185 youngsters from emerald junior high school in el cajon 
had been midway through their trip tuesday when the travel agency 
that arranged the tour left them without cash for food lodging or 
airfare home 
i dont know what the travel agency did with the money but 
its gone said school principal marge dean who was in 
california helping arrange a longdistance bailout 
the youths 38 teacher and parent chaperones pooled their cash 
tuesday to finance one night at a lowercost washington hotel after 
eastwest travel and tours of san diego said the trip was being 
canceled due to a lack of money ms dean said telephones at the 
agency went unanswered wednesday morning 
the youngsters continued their planned itinerary heading for 
philadelphia in buses wednesday after their school board agreed to 
pick up remaining costs for the trip and american airlines donated 
plane tickets home 
the kids have been wonderful a little bit tearyeyed and 
concerned but now that they know that they can continue the trip 
theyre wonderful ms dean said 
there was a little bit of time when they were worried said 
tour director steve ewalt an employee of the travel agency who 
added that he would see the youth through even though he wasnt 
getting paid the kids i dont think have experienced any of the 
real heartache that some of us have 
ewalt said hed directed hundreds of tours for the company but 
this time we could sense that it was a little different 
we just found that the money was drying up he said when 
it stops right in the middle theres really nothing we can do 
about it 
ms dean said the cajon valley school board voted tuesday night 
to pick up remaining costs for the trip estimated at 47000 and 
would ask the parents to have some kind of fundraising activity 
theyll probably have to have car washes to help defray the 
costs 
ewalt said the students would wind up the week in new york 
before heading home on saturday the students began their east 
coast tour last friday visiting williamsburg va and touring 
thomas jeffersons home monticello before sightseeing in 
washington

george bush has a foreign policy resume that 
stretches from central america to the great wall of china but as 
he moves toward a fall presidential showdown his experience is 
proving more of a political handicap than michael dukakis 
inexperience 
the republican vice president relishes describing the democratic 
governor of massachusestts as one who doesnt know much about 
foreign affairs bush clearly expects to overwhelm dukakis 
whenever foreign policy is an issue in the fall campaign 
granted that dukakis has seemed ill at ease on foreign policy 
questions including the continued validity of the monroe doctrine 
against foreign intervention in the western hemisphere us 
retaliation against iran in the persian gulf and the use of nuclear 
weapons in europe 
but those seemed brief mostly forgotten incidents compared to 
the incessant questioning bush receives about his role in the 
irancontra affair and his knowledge of panamanian strongman manuel 
antonio noriegas involvement in drug trafficking 
and it is bush who will be haunted throughout the campaign by 
the words of his rivals for the gop presidential nomination 
particularly former secretary of state alexander m haig jr who 
once questioned whether in administration councils the vice 
president had been in the cockpit or on an economy ride in 
the back of the plane 
bush may yet prove correct as he anticipates that dukakis lack 
of foreign policy experience will lead him into a damaging gaffe 
when they debate in the fall 
i cant wait for the debates said the vice president 
i cant wait for mr dukakis to discuss the noriega matter 
he replied a week later when an ohio high school student asked if 
it was true as dukakis was charging that the panamanian general 
had been on the us payroll 
bush said he would ask dukakis what would you do about it 
you can make a lot of unfounded criticism but whats his 
suggestion whats he going to do and do it in a way that handles 
the delicate central american relationships that were building 
maybe as bush said he cant wait to confront dukakis on 
questions like noriega and irancontra 
but it is equally clear that dukakis is just as eager to raise 
those issues 
what better way to defend his lack of foreign policy experience 
than by going on the offense against the bush resume 
hardly a day goes by that the massachusetts governor doesnt 
raise the noriega matter who was dealing with him and why 
dukakis said monday were we paying him and if so why i can tell 
you one thing if im the president we wont be doing business with 
drugrunning panamanian dictators 
dealing with dictators is a fact of life in international 
relations one accepted by most voters 
but the involvement in drugtrafficking makes the noriega matter 
a far more serious political issue 
a pledge to wage a war on drugs was a theme common to the 
rhetoric of all presidential candidates republican and democratic 
that alone was recognition of the fact that voters were demanding 
to know what the politicians intend to do about a serious national 
problem 
in 1984 republicans were able to play back sen john glenns 
jibes at walter f mondale when they were battling for the 
democratic presidential nomination it will be the democrats turn 
this time 
they are sure to recall haigs comment on the bushnoriega 
matter the day the former reagan cabinet official ended his race 
for the gop presidential nomination 
i do think theres been less than forthright discussion of 
this issue by the vice president said haig he refused to 
elaborate but the fact that he was secretary of state during the 
first two years of the reagan presidency made his comment 
particularly tantalizing 
equally useful to the democrats would be the collected jibes of 
bob dole the acerbic senator from kansas who thrashed bush in the 
iowa republican presidential caucuses and then saw his hopes of 
being the nominee buried on super tuesday 
it was dole who predicted irancontra would be an issue for the 
democrats in the fall campaign and in case the opposition needed 
some help trying to describe the scandal dole referred to white 
house advisers peddling arms to the ayatollah while others hear 
no evil see no evil dole left it clear that one of the 
others was bush

a fuel leak was found in the engine of a horizon 
air comuter aircraft that caught fire and crashlanded april 15 at 
seattletacoma international airport injuring 19 people 
investigators said 
the leak occurred because an o ring was out of place in a 
fuel filter assembly and the filter wasnt seated properly ted 
lopatkiewicz of the national transportation safety board said 
tuesday the findings confirmed passenger reports of liquid 
streaming out of the engine he said 
an xray revealed that the o ring was damaged and out of 
place and a manual test also confirmed the leak lopatkiewicz 
said 
john kelly president of horizon air said investigators found 
exactly what we said the cause was and that it was not 
something horizon had fixed touched or been involved in 
after landing the twinengine de havilland dash 8 with 40 
people aboard careened out of control and crashed into three

nebraska republicans said wednesday their bruising primary had 
given sen david karnes the strength to win against democrat 
bob kerrey but west virginia democrats remained divided by their 
fight to choose an opponent for gop gov arch moore 
karnes who was running in his first election after being 
appointed 14 months ago defeated rep hal daub by a 
biggerthanexpected margin tuesday for the right to face kerrey 
the exgovernor who swamped one democratic rival 
moore edged millionaire industrialist john raese to grab the gop 
nomination for an unprecedented fourth term and will face another 
millionaire insurance executive gaston caperton who had never 
before run for office 
also in west virginia senate majority leader robert c byrd 
easily won the democratic nomination to a sixth term and will be 
heavily favored over his republican opponent state sen jay wolfe 
daub appeared with karnes at a unity gathering in omaha on 
wednesday drawing cheers from party leaders as he placed a 
karnes for senate sticker on his lapel 
i learned a great deal from him said karnes who at 39 is 
the nations youngest senator maybe he taught me too well 
the fourterm congressman who had attacked karnes aggressively 
during the campaign praised his rival and said that without the 
hardfought primary neither one of us would likely have had the 
strength to win in november 
that sentiment was echoed by tom mason director of 
communications and research for the republican senatorial committee 
in washington 
everybody would rather avoid a primary but he got his 
political act together mason said of karnes had hal daub 
won a lot of karnes people would have sat it out 
but anita dunn communications director for the democratic 
senatorial campaign committee noted that kerrey has been running 
ahead in polls pitting him against either republican in a state 
where 51 percent of registered voters prefer the gop 
the race will tighten up she said but bob kerrey remains 
a popular figure and against that you have an appointed senator 
who just came through one of the most bitter primaries that anyone 
is going to see 
in west virginia caperton said wednesday his top priority was 
to bring our party together because we share the common goals of 
better jobs improved schools and a balanced budget for our state 
but talk of party unity held little appeal for clyde see who 
finished second in a sevenman field 
he bought this election fair and square was the assessment 
from see the former house of delegates speaker who was outspent by 
caperton 18 million to 500000 see had been the democratic 
nominee in 1984 
here are the returns from the major races with 100 percent of 
the vote counted in nebraska and 99 percent in west virginia 
nebraska gop senate karnes had 114783 votes or 55 percent 
daub had 93932 votes or 45 percent 
nebraska democratic senate kerrey had 153611 votes or 92 
percent ken michaelis a disbarred lawyer had 13996 votes or 8 
percent 
west virginia gop governor moore had 77626 votes or 53 
percent raese had 67986 votes or 47 percent 
west virginia democratic governor caperton had 128593 votes 
or 37 percent see had 93435 votes or 27 percent state sen mario 
palumbo had 50955 votes or 15 percent agriculture commissioner

a major form of saturated fat in beef appears to 
lower cholesterol rather than raise it so meat may not be as bad 
for the heart as many experts had believed new research concludes 
dr scott m grundy said his work suggests that people should be 
able to eat moderate amounts of lean beef without worry although 
he believes they should stick with widely endorsed guidelines for 
cutting fat consumption 
beef is ok for most people in moderate amounts he said in 
an interview 
other experts cautioned that his study based on liquid diets 
given to 11 men is too small and preliminary to be the basis for 
saying how people should eat all 11 were healthy volunteers aged 
late 50s to early 70s the researchers cautioned that only men were 
enrolled in the study and that the findings might not apply to 
women 
grundy found that contrary to widely held beliefs not all 
saturated fat raises the bodys supply of cholesterol instead one 
type found in beef and many other foods seems to lower it just as 
monosaturated and polyunsaturated fat does while another kind 
found in beef raises it 
if confirmed by other research the finding means that food 
makers may be able to use the cholesterollowering saturated fat to 
create margarine thats more like real butter as well as healthy 
shortening for cooking 
grundy said his work doesnt imply that people can gorge on 
prime ribs or other fatty beef with abandon but he says it appears 
that threeounce portions of selectgrade beef are reasonable and 
people need not give up beef entirely to protect their hearts 
the research was conducted by grundy and dr andrea bonanome at 
the university of texas southwestern medical center at dallas it 
was published in thursdays new england journal of medicine 
cholesterol clogs the arteries and leads to heart attacks and 
strokes 
in an interview grundy noted that americans are already eating 
leaner beef than in the recent past 
by removing the fat from beef we can still maintain its 
quality and yet have very little fat he said furthermore the 
fat that remains if we eat lean beef does not raise cholesterol 
as much as we thought so i think we can say that if beef is 
obtained in the proper way it really should not be feared as a 
cholesterolraising food 
grundy is a past chairman of the american heart associations 
nutrition committee and contributed to the associations dietary 
guidelines suggesting that people limit their total fat intake to 
30 percent of total calories saturated fat should be less than 10 
percent of the days calories 
in an accompanying editorial in the journal drs irwin h 
rosenberg and ernst j schaefer of the usda human nutrition 
research center on aging at tufts university said the latest 
research demonstrates convincingly that one form of saturated 
fat lowers cholesterol 
however they said people should still hold down fat consumption 
this study should not change our chief dietary message to the 
american public they wrote 
dr john c larosa of george washington university chairman of 
the heart associations nutrition committee agreed its a nice 
little piece of work he said but its not the basis for 
dietary recommendations 
fats from plants and animals differ in their proportions of 
various fatty acids safflower oil for instance is high in oleic 
acid which lowers the bodys cholesterol levels while palm oil 
contains high levels of palmitic acid which raises cholesterol 
beef fat is high in both palmitic acid and stearic acid both 
are saturated fatty acids unlike polyunsaturates such as corn oil 
saturated fats are solid when cool 
in the study men drank three liquid formula diets for three 
weeks each they were high in palmitic acid stearic acid or oleic 
acid 
the researchers found that compared with using the highpalmitic 
acid diet the mens blood cholesterol levels dropped 14 percent 
while they consumed stearic acid and 10 percent while on oleic acid 
grundy said that 3 percent to 4 percent of the calories in the 
typical american diet are from stearic acid

a gangster was sentenced today to a 
maximum term of 27 yearstolife in prison for killing a 
chineseamerican journalist in 1984 an act he testified was 
ordered by the taiwanese government 
tung kueisen a member of the international united bamboo gang 
was ordered to serve the prison sentence for the murder of henry 
liu after he completes a 20year sentence for heroin smuggling 
san mateo county superior judge margaret j kemp rejected 
defense arguments for concurrent sentencing that a prosecutor said 
could have set tung free in six years lius widow also had asked 
the court for mercy saying she was touched by tungs public 
repentance 
kemp called the slaying an act of political terrorism 
tung 36 received 25 years to life for murder and two years for 
use of a firearm prosecutor bob bishop said tung will not be 
eligible for parole for 17 years and eight months 
tung was convicted by a jury in march after admitting he gunned 
down liu in the garage of the dissident writers home in daly city 
on oct 15 1984 he claimed he carried out the act for patriotic 
reasons believing he was killing a traitor on order from taiwans 
government 
wearing a red prison jumpsuit and manacles on his wrists and 
ankles the short stocky member of the infamous taiwan gang smiled 
wryly as the sentence was explained to him by an interpreter in the 
packed courtroom 
the 52yearold liu was a columnist for chineselanguage 
newspapers in san francisco and was killed just after publishing an 
unflattering biography of taiwan president chiang chungkuo who 
died four months ago 
helen liu had testified at tungs trial that before her 
husbands slaying the taiwan government had started sending over 
former friends of her husbands to try to convince him to quit 
criticizing the government 
tung who is serving his heroin smuggling sentence at lewisburg 
federal penitentiary in pennsylvania is one of two suspected 
gunmen to be brought to trial in the united states 
he pleaded innocent last june despite having admitted to the 
slaying at his 1986 federal drug trial saying he was unable to get 
a plea bargain and wanted to tell his story for the record 
tung testified that liu was killed on orders from his gang boss 
and members of the taiwanese government he said he believed he was 
duped by his government into killing a man who was not a traitor 
and also sent a written apology to mrs liu 
in a letter to the court mrs liu said she hoped others 
involved in her husbands bloody murder would be prosecuted 
bishop an assistant district attorney said during the trial 
that taiwanese admiral wang hsiling hired tung to assassinate liu 
the prosecution said wu tun 35 was the second gunman and is 
serving a life term for the killing in a taiwanese prison chen 
chili 43 the reputed head of united bamboo is also serving a 
life term in a taiwanese prison for lius killing

a wage and price freeze that was 
scheduled to be lifted may 15 has been extended because the 
government failed to secure enough international financial support 
a senior official said wednesday 
vice premier milos milosavljevic told the communist partys 
central committee that international support was crucial to ending 
the wage and price freeze imposed in november in an attempt to curb 
170 percent inflation 
the basel bank for international settlements has approved only 
half of an expected 500 million loan for debtridden yugoslavia 
milosavljevic said 
the money is intended as an interim loan to tide yugoslavia over 
while it works out repayment schedules on other debts 
he said the basel banks action makes it impossible to 
implement what the government bills as a new package of 
marketoriented economic reforms beginning with the lifting of the 
freeze may 15 
the deputy premier said he expected the rest of the loan to be 
raised in about 10 days during negotiations with some unidentified 
european governments and with the united states an indication the 
freeze could be lifted then 
yugoslavia was hoping for fresh loans of about 14 billion and 
a rescheduling of 2 billion that matured for repayment this year 
on its 20 billion foreign debt 
it hopes to sign an agreement this month with the international 
monetary fund on new credits and debt rescheduling the imf worked 
with the yugoslav government on its undisclosed new package of 
economic measures which are aimed at tighter wage control 
milanko renovica a member of the communist partys ruling 
presidium said the government wage and price freezes have yielded 
only partial results 
renovica a former communist party chief noted that exports had 
increased creating a surplus trade balance but inflation has 
not been curbed wages continue to decline along with the standard 
of living he said 
living standards have fallen by onethird since 1980 while 
unemployment has risen to about 16 percent or more than 1 million 
people last year yugoslavia was hit by move than 1500 strikes 
about 4000 construction workers were on strike wednesday in 
southern yugoslavia demanding higher and more regular wages the 
tanjug news agency reported 
the conclusion is that the crisis continues and deepens 
renovica said 
renovica stopped short of demanding that communist premier 
branko mikulic step down 
on tuesday the parliament of the yugoslav republic of croatia 
joined the parliament of slovenia in calling for a vote of 
noconfidence in the mikulic government because of its failure to 
deal with the economic crisis 
the attempt to unseat the government in belgrade will be made 
during a may 1415 debate in the federal parliament on its first 
two years in office 
the croatian move opened up a chance that the government could 
become the first in postwar yugoslavia and the first in communist 
eastern europe to be forced to resign 
according to parliamentary procedure a simple majority of votes 
in both chambers is required to force resignation

government had filed civil rights suits against his company and 
many others saying they discriminated against blacks in some 
housing developments 
trump said he had been advised to settle but goes on to write 
the idea of settling drove me crazy what we didnt do was rent 
to welfare cases white or black id watched what happened when 
the government came after samuel lefrak another builder and he 
caved in and started taking welfare cases they virtually ruined 
his buildings 
the new printing of the book written by trump and tony schwartz 
eliminates the last two sentences of that paragraph 
sam called me and very politely said he was distressed and 
his lawyers wrote a letter to random house his publisher trump 
told the new york times tuesday theres nothing legally wrong 
with what i wrote but i happen to like sam and didnt want him 
to be distressed 
gerald hollingsworth general counsel to random house said

a new study of suicidal teens clashes with the 
popular notion that teens often brood for weeks and give indirect 
clues before killing themselves a psychiatrist reported wednesday 
that was very very rare in the teenagers studied said 
david shaffer a teen suicide expert at the new york state 
psychiatric institute which is affiliated with columbia university 
instead the teenagers most commonly had a long history of 
aggressive and impulsive behavior oversensitivity and suspicion 
he said 
they were aggressive to others for years and finally they 
were aggressive to themselves shaffer said 
their most common trigger for suicide was getting in trouble at 
school or with the police or the family but not knowing what the 
consequences would be shaffer said 
he spoke at a session of the american psychiatric associations 
annual meeting results of the research are still being analyzed 
he said 
the study focused on suicides of people age 11 to 19 in the new 
york metropolitan area over two years of the 181 suicides 142 or 
78 percent were committed by males shaffer said 
whites accounted for 71 percent of the suicides though they 
make up only 62 percent of the areas population shaffer said 
blacks were underrepresented with 12 percent of suicides and 20 
percent of population shaffer said 
sixtytwo percent of the suicidal young people were ages 15 to 
18 with 14 percent ages 11 to 14 and the rest age 19 
to perform psychological autopsies researchers interviewed 
142 families of suicidal teens 
shaffer said half the male cases had shown antisocial or 
aggressive behavior while only about 14 percent could have been 
diagnosed with major depression 
about half the female cases showed depression alone or with 
antisocial behavior he said 
less common than the teens who showed the long history of 
aggressiveness and impulsivity were perfectionists who worked hard 
at school and showed rigid personalities shaffer said 
next came girls with untreated depression and finally a small 
group of psychotic teens who had been treated he said 
the triggering factor of waiting for the consequences of getting 
into trouble suggests such teens were probably highly anxious 
bordering on terror when they killed themselves he said 
he told of one teen who had broken into a neighbors home and 
been discovered by the neighbor the homeowner threatened to tell 
the boys father that night the youth went home and shot himself 
another teenager a perfectionist who worried about entering a 
new school as his family planned a move to hawaii killed himself 
the night before they were to leave shaffer said 
the study also found that about half the teens who killed 
themselves had a close relative or grandparent who had attempted or 
succeeded at suicide that was much higher than the rate for a 
comparable group of youths who had not killed themselves shaffer 
said 
that hints at a possible genetic influence on suicides he said 
but it might simply be that the young people were imitating their 
suicidal relatives other studies have shown that people who killed 
themselves show biochemical abnormalities 
the longstanding characteristics of impulsivity and 
aggressiveness in suicidal teens mean those are signals to get a 
teen into treatment said richard jed wyatt of the national 
institute of mental health

arrested the defense minister said 
gen hector alejandro gramajo morales told a news conferece 
there were some signs of indiscipline at the two army bases 
but they were immediately neutralized and the officers involved 
immediately changed their attitude 
earlier a statement from the defense ministry said a coup 
attempt had taken place throughout the country the media 
interpreted the events as an attempted coup against president 
vinicio cerezos civilian government 
but in reading from a prepared statement at the news conference 
gramajo morales refused to admit that a coup attempt or a mutiny 
was involved he also tried to minimize the incidents that occurred 
at dawn today saying they were short lived and the rest of the 
armys 74 bases and installations were not involved 
the general claimed the officers involved in the acts of 
indiscipline were fooled and disoriented by speculation and 
disinformation propagated by unnamed civilians 
gramajo morales said two officers at the bases involved 
jutiapa 74 miles west of the capital and retalhuleu 115 miles 
southeast of the capital have been arrested and are being 
investigated by military authorites

with postelection maneuvering under way 
wednesday in denmark the reagan administration declined to 
speculate publicly about how the balloting will affect continued 
danish participation in the north atlantic treaty organization 
the results are somewhat inconclusive state department 
spokeswoman phyllis oakley said the united states and denmark 
have a long and close friendship and the united states government 
will continue to work closely with the government that is formed 
after the danes have evaluated their election 
the reagan administration had been hoping danish voters would 
elect parliamentarians opposed to a recently passed resolution that 
would make it impossible for us ships carrying nuclear weapons to 
visit denmark the resolution has raised questions about denmarks 
continued membership in nato because nuclear deterrence is one of 
the bedrocks of alliance doctrine 
tuesdays vote for 179 parliament seats resulted in a modest 
shift to the right and strengthened the parties that give 
unqualified support to nato analysts there said 
the future of the danish nuclear resolution depends on whether 
prime minister poul schlueter who doesnt want to implement the 
policy is able to form another minority government 
white house spokesman roman popadiuk said we have an interest 
in the substance of the nuclear ship issue and expect to discuss 
it with the new government once it is formed 
as the delicate coalitionbargaining unfolds in denmark the 
united states is remaining noncommital about the situation the 
us officials said 
secretary of state george p shultz made clear however during 
a trip to europe late last month that he is disturbed by the 
possibility that denmark might institute a ban on nucleararmed 
ships 
a similar ban enacted by new zealand led to the demise of a 
threedecade alliance in the south pacific and shultz asserted that 
danish action to limit nuclear missions would hurt nato as well 
shultz who has said his hand in dealing with the soviets is 
strengthened by nato solidarity said if you like the benefits 
if you like peace if you like the fact that progress is being made 
in negotiations then you ought to like the responsibilities that 
go with making that possible

a moderate democratic group proposed on 
wednesday a voluntary program that would link federal education 
housing and job training aid to participation in civilian or 
military service to the nation 
we believe that there is something relating to civic 
obligation that still should be a part of our national life said 
sen sam nunn dga chairman of the democratic leadership 
council we seem to have lost that sense of involvement for 
something more than the individual in recent years 
as outlined in the 66page proposal the citizens corps 
would consist of young volunteers working one or two years at 
subsistence wages in civilian or military service to earn vouchers 
that could be used for college vocational or job training expenses 
or to make a down payment on a home 
nunn said the vouchers would amount to 10000 for each year of 
service and eventually would replace existing federal grant and 
loan programs as the primary source of federal aid to students 
this would be a shift to saying that if youre going to get 
assistance from society for your education then youre going to 
serve society he told reporters 
the proposal also calls for the enlistment of volunteers over 
age 65 who would be paid a modest hourly wage instead of vouchers 
they would be used primarily to fill administrative and supervisory 
tasks within the corps 
under the plan the corps would be administered by a small 
federal agency that would set broad policy and make matching grants 
to states and local governments and nonprofit agencies which 
would handle daytoday operations federal grants would cover 75 
percent of the costs 
the total annual cost of the program based on the enlistment of 
800000 volunteers would about 15 billion of the total 5 
billion would come from new federal expenditures 2 billion from 
local and state governments and nonprofit agencies and 7 billion 
to 8 billion from existing federal grant and loan programs for 
education 
former virginia gov charles robb past chairman of the 
leadership council said the national service proposal is an 
attempt to move away from the politics of pure entitlement to 
some sort of system that involves mutual civic obligation 
there are too many people focusing on purely tangible rewards 
and immediate rewards rather than a longterm sense of 
citizenship he said 
nunn said the program would focus the energies and enthusiasm of 
young people on the nations social needs such as fighting 
illiteracy improving health care and drug and alcohol abuse 
treatment and providing child care for working parents 
at the same time he said it would strengthen military 
recruitment by providing a new manpower pool that would also be 
less expensive than the current allvolunteer force 
nunn said the dlc composed of elected democrats at the 
national state and local level is planning a series of forums 
around the country this year to discuss the national service idea 
and obtain reaction from young people legislation would be offered 
next year 
nunn said he has no plans to push for a national service plank 
in this years democratic presidential platform but he said aides 
to massachusetts gov michael dukakis the frontrunner for the 
white house nomination have discussed the proposal with council 
staff members

the west german doctor who performed the first 
known successful use of one liver split in two and transplanted 
into two patients said wednesday that the procedure still is a 
method of last resort 
i guess the risk for both recipients will be a little bit 
higher so i think its a step forward but its only a step 
forward if one cannot manage the donor problem rudolph pichlmayr 
of the university of hannovers medical school said by telephone 
from west germany 
exasperated by the shortage of donor organs european surgeons 
have begun dividing livers and grafting the parts into different 
patients a development hailed by other transplant surgeons when it 
was reported at a conference here tuesday 
it could double the donors said the university of 
pittsburghs thomas e starzl who performed the worlds first 
successful liver transplant in 1967 if you have patients who are 
terribly ill and in equal need its one way out 
its an important step forward agreed christoph e 
broelsch professor of surgery at the university of chicago 
henri bismuth of paul brousse hospital in paris reported at the 
conference here on liver disease that he had no choice may 1 but to 
divide the liver of a 40yearold man for two women both near 
death 
both parts of the organ have since functioned well although one 
woman is critically ill from kidney and lung complications she 
suffered before surgery according to bismuth 
the liver is the only human organ that can regenerate itself in 
splitting a liver surgeons divide it by its two main groups of 
blood vessels but a common artery and bile duct must be carefully 
divided and one half can be weaker than the other pichlmayr 
explained 
pichlmayr performed such an operation feb 2 believed to be the 
first successful attempt at splitliver transplantation in the 
world 
in the united states about 450 people are awaiting liver 
transplants according to arthur harrell of the american council on 
transplantation about half of them are children 
pichlmayr said he like bismuth was desperate to save two 
patients lives but had just one liver as a result he 
transplanted the halves of a 23yearold mans liver into a 
2yearold boy and a 63yearold woman 
both recipients are home and doing well said pichlmayr 
i can see this happening at our institution anytime soon if we 
have the appropriate setting broelsch said 
we have to take all the maneuvers to get more livers 
particularly of course for the smaller children pichlmayr said 
i have many patients waiting and many children waiting and too 
few donor organs 
doctors have been trimming livers for several years to make them 
fit properly particularly for children 
its of course a pity to throw away the other half of the 
liver pichlmayr said 
broelsch said the oneyear success rate is about 50 percent to 
60 percent for children who receive reducedsize livers compared 
to 80 percent to 90 percent for those who receive an entire organ

thirtysix blearyeyed cubans arrived before dawn 
wednesday to tears and hugs from relatives but they and 20000 
other cubans coming to miami this year face a more uncertain 
reception from the rest of the city 
for some residents concerns stem from memories of escalated 
street crime after the 1980 mariel boatlift others particularly 
american blacks who feel their economic and political opportunities 
will shrink with the rising cuban population also are concerned 
and government officials fret about the financial costs of the new 
immigrants 
its a shame people tend to remember only the bad parts of 
cuban immigration but the truth is that most cubans have gone on 
to be some of our most thriving citizens said city manager cesar 
odio a cubanamerican 
officials are quick to note that the new carefully screened 
cuban immigrants who began arriving by the hundreds this month 
have little in common with the 125000 who came ashore when cuban 
president fidel castro opened the port of mariel and his prisons 
for six months and ignored carter administration pleas for 
controlled immigration 
not only have they been through a rigorous procedure by 
federal immigration officials to ensure their financial stability 
but most will initially be living with relatives here thats a 
support system the bulk of the mariels never had said bobby 
bernal refugee affairs coordinator for dade county 
unlike most other immigrant groups cubans have chosen one city 
as their own more than 80 percent of the cubans coming here since 
castros 1959 revolution stayed in south florida they have 
overtaken nonlatin whites called anglos and make up 42 
percent of dade countys 186 million people as the largest group 
cubans dominate miami politics economy and society and 
transformed a tourismbased southern city into a modern 
latinoriented financial center 
still simmering resentment flared in the years immediately 
following castros uncontrolled freedom flotilla 
a minority of hardcore criminals helped push miami atop violent 
crime statistics and that lawless image was spread with a hollywood 
remake of scarface starring al pacino as a mariel cocaine 
kingpin 
thousands were placed on the public dole and state and local 
governments still are seeking federal reimbursement for 150 
million in services spent on the refugees 
in 1980 dade county residents expressed a backlash by passing 
an antibilingualism ordinance and continued resentment by the 
remaining nonlatins often surfaces on radio talk shows and other 
forums 
cubans already here would like to allow any cuban to come over 
here and live in liberty but you have to draw the line 
somewhere said wnws radio talk show host al rantel who roused 
attention with his proposed referendum to put a cap on public 
spending for refugees 
black leaders have protested every new influx fearing cubans 
will further dilute black political and economic power 
from day one theyre competing for the same jobs as blacks 
said garth reeves jr publisher of the blackoriented newspaper 
the miami times we need more cubans like we need the plague 
the basis for the new immigration is an agreement signed by the 
united states and cuba in late 1984 only to be suspended by castro 
five months later after the start of us radio marti broadcasts 
into cuba 
that pact was revived seven months ago when cuba agreed to take 
back about 2500 mariel cubans a move that sparked riots and 
hostage sieges at federal detention centers in oakdale la and 
atlanta 
the united states then opened its doors to 3000 political 
prisoners and the annual flow of 20000 immediate relatives of us 
citizens the 36 former political prisoners and their families who 
arrived in a regular chartered flight at miami international 
airport from havana wednesday were part of another group of some 
400 political prisoners and relatives whose release was secured 
from the cuban government by the us catholic conference 
cubans are being issued 40 to 45 visas a day and the immigrants 
are allowed to travel by any means they desire anytime within four 
months of the visa said donna sherman a spokeswoman for the us 
bureau of consular affairs in washington 
at that rate about 250 arrivals per week are expected this 
month and as many as 350 a week are expected by summers end she 
said

a defense attorney found nothing funny about a 
group of sequestered jurors taking in a show at a comedy club the 
night before they convicted his client of murder 
the night out in apparent violation of the judges order could 
lead to a new trial the third for tommy wayne dunn who was 
convicted of paying a man 800 to kill his father in 1981 
attorney mike degeurin appealed the case to the 1st court of 
appeals 
after a hearing tuesday on the appeal state district judge 
jimmy james said he will urge the appellate court to deny a new 
trial 
bailiff don r mccray said he basically didnt realize i was 
doing anything wrong when he took eight jurors to the laff stop 
nightclub last aug 19 
degeurin noted a transcript that quotes james saying mr 
bailiff dont let the jury separate other than for purposes of 
going to the hotel and their rooms they are not to separate at 
any other time 
five jurors testified that mccray told them they could stay at 
the hotel with another bailiff or go to the club 
the eight who went with mccray watched two comedians and a 
hypnotist and ran up a 3915 bar tab 
while the hearing mostly concerned the violation of james order 
and whether the night at the club may have affected deliberations 
mccray said the liquor bill launched the fuss 
this has escalated and been blown all out of proportion he 
said its always been my understanding that on a sequestered 
deal jurors can have drinks or wine with their meal 
this is highly unique but nothing happened that affected the 
defendant getting a fair trial said prosecutor carol davies 
she and degeurin said they know of no other sequestered jury 
being taken to a club for drinks 
its not a laughing matter degeurin said wednesday can 
you imagine the defendant sitting in his cell with his head hanging 
wondering what the jurors will decide on this case and on the other 
side the jurors are out boozing it up at a club being hypnotized 
and laughing it up 
dunns father alfred 53 was shot twice in the back oct 12 
1981 as he walked across a parking lot with robin buchanan 
summers she testified last year she had affairs with both the 
father and son 
the man believed to have fired the shots committed suicide in 
jail while awaiting trial dunn 40 is serving a life sentence on 
his second conviction of murder 
his first conviction was reversed because his lawyer stan 
schneider was excluded from being present while detectives were 
taking dunns confession

at least seven of the nations biggest banks 
boosted their prime lending rate a half percentage point to 9 
percent wednesday the first increase since just before the stock 
market crash in october 
chase manhattan bank was the first to announce the increase and 
was quickly followed by citibank chemical bank manufacturers 
hanover continental illinois bank mellon bank and marine midland 
bank 
other big banks also were expected to increase the key rate 
which is watched closely because bankers use it as a base rate on 
loans to many businesses and for consumer loans including 
homeequity loans 
the impact was felt on wall street where the the dow jones 
average of 30 industrial stocks was down about 44 points to the 
1959 level by midafternoon 
many economists had predicted an increase in the prime rate 
which often lags behind rising interest rates elsewhere because 
the cost of borrowing for banks themselves has been rising in 
recent weeks 
the higher borrowing costs reflect a fear of higher inflation 
which has been fed by evidence that the economy is growing faster 
especially figures reported by the government last week that showed 
unemployment had hit a 14year low 
these inflation worries have led the federal reserve board the 
nations central bank to nudge shortterm interest rates higher 
for example the federal funds rate the overnight interest on loans 
among banks has risen above 7 percent compared with around 66 
percent less than two months ago 
the last time banks raised the prime rate was in september when 
it went from 875 percent to 925 percent the rate dropped back to 
9 percent on oct 22 two days after the black monday stock 
collapse it fell to 875 percent nov 5 and fell to 85 percent

democratic frontrunner michael dukakis rode 
highspeed trains being tested for use between boston and new york 
on wednesday and accused the reagan administration of failing to 
promote such service and spending the last eight years without a 
national transportation policy 
dukakis one day after widening his delegate lead with primary 
victories in nebraska and west virginia was flying to new jersey 
for a fundraiser wednesday night 
he was to meet with congressional leaders and attend a luncheon 
with latin american ambassadors thursday in washington and also 
scheduled a meeting with anglican bishop desmond tutu of south 
africa before heading west to campaign in california and oregon 
the massachusetts governor rode to providence ri aboard a 
canadian train and back to boston on a spanishmade train 
dukakis during the 32minute ride from downtown boston 50 miles 
south to downtown providence said a lack of white house support 
for amtrak and highspeed service had caused the nations skies to 
become dangerously overcrowded 
he said air shuttle traffic between boston and new york could be 
reduced by using highspeed trains that could travel between the 
cities in about three hours 
dukakis who has pushed for the service as a member of the 
coalition of northeast governors which arranged the test runs 
said the equipment needed for hourly service between new york and 
boston would cost about 200 million and could be financed through 
a 10year leasepurchase plan 
that is a very very modest investment for what could be and 
should be a profitable service dukakis said one of the 
reasons our airports are so overburdened is that we have been 
spending the last eight years without a national transportation 
policy 
accompanying dukakis on the trip were dozens of reporters from 
national and international news organizations covering his 
presidential campaign he was to pick up secret service protection 
for the first time wednesday but agents were not with him during 
the train rides 
the reporters also took a brief subway ride with the governor 
from park street station a downtown boston subway hub to south 
station a subway stop that also houses the citys amtrak depot and 
served as the departure point for the highspeed test 
dukakis said there had been a 20 percent increase in ridership 
since 1982 on the states major public transit system he 
occasionally uses the system to travel to the statehouse from his 
home in suburban brookline 
the highspeed trains tested wednesday use tiltcar technology 
allowing them to take curves at speeds up to 25 purcent faster than 
conventional trains a threehour trip time to new york would be 90 
minutes faster than current amtrak service the trip to providence 
was 14 minutes faster than amtrak

a travel group predicted wednesday that 
americans will set new records in travel this summer with the 
majority taking a car truck or camper to a vacation spot less than 
250 miles from home 
the us travel data center in its annual projection of summer 
vacations said the southeast will remain the most popular 
destination while the midwest and great lakes regions which are 
in the midst of an economic recovery will generate the biggest 
increase in vacation travelers 
cities the data center said will edge out oceans and beaches 
this year as the preferred destination 
the economy this spring is much better than we expected after 
the stock market crash said suzanne cook director of the data 
center and were finding that summer vacation intentions are 
stronger than last spring 
cook said the traditional summer vacation where the parents 
take the kids on a threeweek summer vacation is no longer the 
model for many american households where more women work and have 
less time to take long trips 
were finding that people are taking more shorter trips 
throughout the year and not just one long summer vacation cook 
said 
it estimated that americans will take 136 million vacation trips 
during june july and august up 3 percent from the 132 million 
trips last summer cook said the 1987 travel rate was a record 
the average trip will last six nights and an estimated 83 
percent of travelers will use a car truck or camper to get to 
their destination the center said another 13 percent will go by 
plane while the rest will take a bus or train or hadnt decided 
how they will travel 
the travel center projects that 51 percent of the summer 
vacation trips will total 500 miles or less roundtrip 23 percent 
500 to 1000 miles and 26 percent more than 1000 miles the 
average roundtrip distance the center said is expected to be 870 
miles cook said the figures do not take into account international 
travel 
the travel data center a private nonprofit group that 
promotes travel developed its forecast from the results of monthly 
telephone interviews of 1500 adults cook said the margin of error 
in the survey is plus or minus 2 percentage points the center 
which is affiliated with the travel industry association of 
america has been conducting summer vacation surveys for seven 
years 
the survey showed about 40 percent of the summer travelers will 
stay with friends and relatives and another 40 percent in hotels or 
motels the rest will stay in a camper or vacation homes 
the center found that nearly a third of those responding to its 
survey 31 percent said they planned to visit a city while 26 
percent said they would go to an ocean or beach that is exactly 
the opposite of the results for the 1987 survey 
cook said one explanation for the popularity of cities this year 
is that people from the midwest tended to favor cities over beaches 
as vacation spots and that region is projected to take nearly 9 
percent more vacation trips this year than last 
the center expects residents of the great lake region 
illinois indiana michigan ohio and wisconsin to show an even 
bigger increase in vacation trips this year 13 percent it 
attributed the expected rise to economic improvement and pentup 
demand for travel in the region 
as for other regions the center projects a 38 percent decrease 
in vacation trips by northeast residents a 3 percent decline by 
southeast residents and a 37 percent increase in trips by 
residents of western states the expected declines in vacation 
trips by northeast and southeast residents this year follows a big 
increase last year the center said 
richard hebert of the american automobile association said the 
most popular cities to visit in the united states are washington 
new york city san francisco and new orleans the single most 
popular destination is the state of florida he said

government efforts to make sure medicare 
patients receive good health care are hampered by poor 
coordination questionable information and a lack of treatment 
standards a congressional investigative agency said wednesday 
the general accounting office said it found reasons for 
concern about current systems for monitoring the quality of care 
given the medicare programs 31 million enrollees the government 
spent 70 billion on such care last year 
in a report the gao said review methods of uncertain 
validity are being used and problems identified by one set of 
reviewers are not coordinated for action by others 
further it said the accuracy of key information generated 
by reviews is questionable and the federal health care financing 
administration or hcfa does not have an adequate longterm 
strategy to improve its overall medicare monitoring system 
any future strategy should include setting minimum standards of 
clinical practice and testing incentives to get doctors to follow 
them the gao said 
it recommended that the house ways and means health 
subcommittee chaired by rep pete stark dcalif consider 
proposals to assign qualityassurance responsibilities to a new or 
existing federal entity 
stark who requested and released the report said he would use 
it to look at whether we need to develop legislation to make sure 
we get good quality care for the nations retirees 
right now we dont know if were getting quality in the 
medical care medicare is paying for stark said in a statement 
the gao report makes clear that hcfa doesnt have a strategy for 
finding out how to know quality care when we see it or if we did 
to make sure medicare is receiving it 
the department of health and human services of which hcfa is a 
part was quoted in the report as agreeing with all or most of the 
gaos recommendations 
the report said the agency opposes creation of a new federal 
entity to develop quality assurance methods but would consider 
improvements in internal coordination

the official tass news agency on wednesday called 
the founders of a new soviet political party liars and 
scandalmongers whose actions hamper soviet leader mikhail s 
gorbachevs reform drive 
it the first attack by the staterun media on the new democratic 
union tass accused members of slanderous antisocial 
activity the toughly worded dispatch indicated that officials 
would not tolerate any challenge the new party might mount to the 
ruling communists 
past attempts to challenge the communist party have been crushed 
about 70 people met monday outside moscow to create the new 
party which seeks multiparty elections independent trade unions 
a new constitution and the withdrawal of soviet troops from eastern 
europe and areas seized by the soviet union in world war ii 
members of the democratic union expressed the hope that if 
gorbachev is serious in his campaign for a more open society he 
will allow the party to seek supporters and take part in elections 
which are tightly controlled by the communist party 
tass said the democratic unions platform was a provocation 
with a political flavor that was so anticonstitutional it 
touched off arguments among group members and exposed its authors 
to criticism from the group itself 
the group is nothing more than a bunch of scandalmongers 
deliberately smearing honest people and hampering perestroika and 
efforts to foster good relations between people the soviet news 
agency said 
perestroika which means reconstruction in russian is 
the name given to gorbachevs ambitious reform program for economic 
and social restructuring 
tass did not say why the democratic unions declaration of 
principles was unconstitutional but the 1977 soviet constitution

republican george bush and democrat michael dukakis turned their 
campaigns west on wednesday toward final primaries in oregon and 
california both firmly in command and focusing on the fall 
president reagan in a move that surprised no one was bestowing 
his official blessing on bush 
the lone remaining republican opponent television evangelist 
pat robertson bowed to the obvious at last and offered bush his 
endorsement 
robertson said he would drop his own candidacy for the 
republican presidential nomination on monday weeks after he had 
ceased active campaigning against the vice president 
reagan whose support of bush was never in doubt planned the 
formal endorsement of his vice president at a republican party 
fundraising dinner in washington 
he delivered a political tease of sorts when he and bush walked 
into the cabinet room to meet with gop congressional leaders 
i just have a very brief announcement to make reagan said 
and that is that ill have something to say about the campaign 
tonight 
with two fresh primary wins in his column dukakis took a 
highspeed train ride and denounced the reagan administration for 
not supporting rail service 
one of the reasons our airports are so overburdened is that we 
have been spending the last eight years without a national 
transportation policy dukakis said 
bush with a mathematical lock on the gop convention and 
dukakis with a seemingly insurmountable delegate lead for the 
democratic nomination were both flying to the west coast on 
thursday to begin campaign swings 
both planned visits to oregon ahead of tuesdays primary there 
and california which ends the primary season june 7 along with new 
jersey new mexico and montana 
democrat jesse jackson campaigned in portland ore and shook 
off resounding primary losses to dukakis in west virginia and 
nebraska 
robertson appeared before reporters at the white house and said 
he had given bush his endorsement in a private meeting and would 
get out of the race 
i will be making that official on monday because the race 
is pretty much over said robertson who won only 46 delegates in 
a campaign that spent more than 20 million 
he said i didnt ask anything for myself and promised to 
work to have his supporters back bush 
asked if he would run again in 1992 if bush loses this fall 
robertson said its conceivable its not a certainty 
robertson said he soon may return to the christian broadcasting 
network that he founded and which he left last fall to run for the 
presidency he said contributions and viewers have dropped 
dramatically in the last year 
i assumed that i had built a very competent staff and that 
they would be able to run cbn in my absence robertson said in an 
interview with the norfolk va virginianpilot and ledgerstar 
i did not realize that my personal presence on the 700 club was 
as important as it is to the audience 
dukakis the massachusetts governor rode two highspeed trains 
being tested for use between boston and new york and denounced the 
reagan administration for what he said was no national 
transportation policy and a failure to support amtrak 
he rode the trains from boston to providence ri and back a 
50mile oneway trip that the train covered in 32 minutes he said 
equipment needed for hourly service between new york and boston 
would cost about 200 million 
this is a very very modest investment for what could be and 
should be a profitable service dukakis said 
jackson spoke to about 1800 students at the predominantly black 
jefferson high school in portland he exhorted them to reject drugs 
and violence and afterward led a 15block antidrug march from the 
school through one of the citys most crimeridden areas 
you get those guns out of your pockets and the drugs out of 
your life and you can make a difference he said 
jackson insisted he was in the race until the end despite two 
more landslide wins by dukakis tuesday night including a delegate 
shutout of jackson in west virginia 
dukakis has moved within striking distance of the 2081 
delegates needed to nail down the democratic nomination according 
to the latest associated press delegate count dukakis had 1589 to 
jacksons 944

texas officials attempt to keep fresh florida citrus out of the 
lone star state 
us district judge filemon vela ruled that the us department 
of agriculture followed the law in february when it lifted a 
3year ban on shipments of fresh florida citrus to other 
citrusproducing areas 
texas officials had sought to have the quarantine reinstated 
they claimed the usda did not allow adequate time for comment when 
it lifted the ban velas ruling was in response to a suit filed by 
the state of texas in an effort to stop shipments of the florida 
fruit into the state 
with all the information put before me i am satisfied that 
the usda followed the law in promulgating the rule vela said 
wednesday 
the usda on feb 11 lifted the ban on shipments of fresh florida 
citrus into texas and other citrusproducing areas the florida 
fruit was quarantined after an outbreak of citrus canker there in 
august 1984

make it drop prematurely 
after the usda lifted the ban texas issued a 30day emergency 
quarantine 
then on march 9 officials of the texas attorney generals 
office and state agriculture department sued contending the usda 
violated its own rules in lifting the ban without allowing a period 
for comment 
texas citrus producers contend that an outbreak of canker would 
devastate the states 65 million citrus industry florida 
officials have maintained that the canker is under control and the 
threat to texas is minimal

more than 26 million defective or mislabeled 
fireworks have been seized in a federal crackdown that reportedly 
has led china to suspend export production of firecrackers 
more than 100000 cartons of chinese fireworks awaiting shipment 
were recalled and production of fireworks intended for export to 
the united states was halted in april until quality control can be 
improved sources familiar with the chinese fireworks industry said 
wednesday 
the sources spoke on condition they not be identified 
zheng wanchen of the chinese embassy in washington said he had 
no information on the report wilson w mao head of the importing 
company hop kee pyrotechnics ltd in monterey park calif was out 
of town and not available for comment his office said 
but officials of the consumer product safety commission 
comfirmed that more than 2 million worth of imported fireworks has 
been seized in recent weeks in a joint operation with the us 
customs service 
that operation concentrated on imported products arriving at 
customs offices in san francisco cleveland chicago philadelphia 
baltimore and charleston sc the safety commission reported 
mislabeling and overloaded fireworks were the most common 
problems cited by the agency which seized more than 15 million 
thunder bomb firecrackers containing between 72 milligrams and 
84 milligrams of powder federal law limits firecrackers to 50 
milligrams 
the crackdown doesnt mean there will be no fourth of july 
fireworks agency officials added in san francisco for example 
some twothirds of the imported products passed inspection and were 
allowed into the country 
the effort does represent a shift in emphasis from inspecting 
retail dealers to trying to stop problems before they are widely 
distribued according to safety commission chairman terrence m 
scanlon 
we have taken enforcement of us government safety standards 
from the roadside to the dockside in an effort to be more 
effective scanlon said tuesday in a statement in cleveland where 
he announced midwest thunder the joint customscpsc operation 
in that area 
the effort combining the work of the two federal agencies will 
give taxpayers more bang for the dollar said john mackey an 
aide to scanlon 
officials predicted the effort would lead to the availability 
this year of safer firecrackers 
in 1987 more than 9000 americans were injured by fireworks 
seriously enough to require hospital treatment the safty agency 
said 
seized fireworks can be returned to commerce and sold if the 
problem is repaired such as improving the labeling and warnings 
according to officials products that cannot be fixed are 
destroyed they said

a man arrested for allegedly running a 
multimilliondollar cocaine operation adopted the lifestyle of a 
cocaine kingpin played by al pacino in the movie scarface 
authorities said 
thomas mickens 24 was taken into custody tuesday at his 
760000 house on long island by police and fbi agents police 
commissioner benjamin ward said 
a silver rollsroyce worth 121000 was parked in the garage at 
the dix hills house ward said mickens bought as many as 19 luxury 
cars with drug profits police said 
mickens apparently also used neighborhood businesses he owned to 
launder money from his cocaine operations in the city and in 
atlantic city nj authorities said 
mickens used the name tony montana pacinos character in the 
1983 movie authorities said 
his favorite movie was scarface said capt charles mattes 
of the queens narcotics squad he tried to model his existence 
after that character 
mickens allegedly employed nearly 100 streetlevel dealers and 
pushers in a 2yearold heroin and cocaine network based in the 
borough of queens but also flourished in harlem and in atlantic 
city according to a criminal complaint obtained by us attorney 
andrew j maloney 
two locations in queens and homes in miami and atlantic city 
were searched authorities also seized a bar a grocery store and a 
sporting goods store all named tony montana and owned by 
mickens 
only a small amount of drugs was found during tuesdays arrests 
mattes said authorities he added were mostly looking for records 
and documents that would describe mickens organization and perhaps 
lead to more arrests 
we believe taking this organization down dismantles a major 
flow of narcotics into this area ward said mattes described 
mickens operation as a multimilliondollar organization but he 
refused to say exactly how much money it made 
mickens was not linked to the drugrelated violence that led to 
the death of police officer edward byrne who was gunned down feb 
26 while protecting the home of a witness ward said 
mickens faces federal charges of conspiracy and possession and 
distribution of narcotics he is being held at the metropolitan 
correctional center pending a bail hearing thursday said charles 
rose an assistant us attorney in the eastern district 
six other men believed to be lieutenants in mickens 
organization were also picked up tuesday all were charged with 
conspiracy and possession and distribution of narcotics

a former hostage said wednesday that he and two 
other frenchmen were freed by captors in lebanon because the public 
pressured france to negotiate with iran and he urged americans and 
britons to do the same 
i dont understand the americans and the british said 
journalist jeanpaul kauffmann 
i have the impression that they have abandoned their hostages 
but these men are suffering and what is to be done has to be done 
very quickly it is urgent he said 
outgoing premier jacques chirac thanked iran for its help in 
freeing the french hostages he said the islamic republic had 
intervened to get them out of lebanon and announced that diplomatic 
relations between france and iran broken last july may be 
reestablished 
nine americans and three britons are among the 18 foreigners 
still held captive by proiranian shiite extremists in lebanon the 
us and british governments have said they will not negotiate with 
terrorists 
kauffmann spoke to 250 reporters a former american hostage and 
relatives of hostages at a packed news conference in a left bank 
theater 
there was a consensus among the french that they wanted to 
free their hostages and they supported what their government did 
to get us out he said 
kauffmann 44 and diplomats marcel carton 64 and marcel 
fontaine 45 were freed may 4 in beirut they had been held by the 
proiranian shiite moslem group islamic jihad for three years 
interior minister charles pasqua oversaw negotiations that led 
to their release a fourth french hostage michel seurat died in 
captivity 
kauffmann said he believed all nine of the american hostages and 
the three british hostages were still alive 
he was flanked by his wife joelle and the head of the 
committee of journalists who pressured the government for his 
release kauffmann writes for the weekly news magazine levenement 
du jeudi 
kauffman refused to discuss the status of the foreign hostages 
he said that doing so could put them in danger or cause them to 
lose the small privileges that make life bearable the few books 
and cigarettes they are sometimes allowed 
former american hostage david jacobsen sat in the front row 
beside jill morrell fiance of british television journalist john 
mccarthy 31 kidnapped april 17 1986 
peggy say sister of american journalist terry anderson the 
longestheld hostage spoke to kauffmann and the other two french 
hostages fontaine shared a cell with anderson for several months 
anderson chief middle east correspondent for the associated 
press was seized in west beirut march 16 1985 
i have never tried to tell my government exactly what to do 
said mrs say but i think that after more than three years they 
could perhaps take some pointers from the french and follow the 
leads and initiatives the french government has provided 
mrs say met earlier in the day with pasqua 
during the two years that pasqua and the government of chirac 
were in office 10 french hostages were freed in lebanon no french 
hostages are believed to remain in the hands of the kidnappers 
asked what the american government was doing to secure her 
brothers release mrs say replied im not exactly sure 
because they dont share that with me 
all they tell me is that there continues to be quiet 
diplomacy although im not sure what that means after all this 
time i have to wonder if quiet diplomay is a code word for no 
diplomacy 
she said that after her meetings with the three former french 
hostages she was reassured about her brothers physical condition 
terrys marine corps training is standing him in good stead he 
is surviving 
but she said it was also clear that he was angry 
he feels betrayed by his own government and by the people he 
was in lebanon to serve im sure that when he gets out and i 
believe he will it will take a long time from him to recover from 
this 
before the news conference joelle kauffmann said her husband 
would be checking back into valdegrace military hospital to 
recover from exhaustion the three hostages spent 48 hours in the 
hospital for physical examinations after they arrived in france 
last thursday 
kauffmann said fellow hostage michel seurat became ill in 
september 1985 with what kauffmann believes was cancer on dec 28 
seurat said goodbye to kauffmann and was taken to another cell 
where he died

harold kim philby longtime soviet spy and 
central figure in espionage scandals that rocked britain 30 years 
ago died in moscow the domestic press association news agency 
reported wednesday night 
the report quoted diplomatic sources in london 
philby 76 a member of a prominent british family was a spy 
for 30 years while he worked for the british secret service he was 
known as the third man who tipped off fellow spies donald 
maclean and guy burgess that they were under investigation by 
british authorities in the late 1950s 
both fled to the soviet union in 1951 and philby followed them 
to moscow in 1963 
at one point philby was reported to be an adviser to soviet 
intelligence agencies in moscow 
the macleanburgessphilby spy scandals virtually wrecked the 
exchange of intelligence information between london and washington 
at one point philby was so highly valued in the british secret 
service that he was being groomed to be its chief 
in april philby granted his first interview to a western 
journalist telling the sunday times that british intelligence let 
him defect rather than face an embarrassing public trial 
he said he found peace and a happy fourth marriage to a russian 
woman and felt at home in the soviet union 
philby had been under suspicion for 12 years and his unmasking 
was a nightmare for british intelligence it began when mclean and 
burgess defected to the soviet union and reverberated into the 
1980s with the disclosure that antony blunt another upperclass 
englishman had been revealed as a traitor and went unpunished 
when philby defected blunt was given immunity from prosecution 
in exchange for information he later became art adviser to queen

blunt died in 1983 burgess and maclean died in moscow 
philby espoused soviet communism as a cambridge university 
student in the 1930s and penetrated the highest levels of british 
intelligence in the kremlins service 
because of his high contacts in washington philby was able to 
betray the whole western alliance he sent many western agents to 
their deaths and was even able to head off the defection of a 
soviet diplomat who threatened to xpose him 
philby was decorated for his services by the soviet kgb 
intelligence service and published his memoirs titled my secret 
war 
asked by his interviewer would you do it all again philby

aging american british and french comrades 
who harbor the often agonizing memories of one of world war iis 
most heroic missions gathered wednesday for probably their last 
full reunion 44 years after they were parachuted behind enemy 
lines 
it took some of them this long to find each other and they 
wont let go said daphne friele who was an 18yearold 
secretary in the british intelligence office that trained 279 
americans britons and frenchmen for a mission codenamed 
jedburgh 
records of the operation remained top secret until 1985 
although many of those taking part have told their dramatic stories 
of sabotaging german forces and supporting the european resistance 
the specially trained soldiers were dropped in teams of three with 
a radio scattered across france belgium and the netherlands in 
advance of the june 6 1944 normandy landings 
their code name mrs friele said comes from the name of a 
scottish town where the term jedburgh justice was the rule for 
dealing with sheep rustlers hang them first and question them 
afterwards 
this week 51 american 26 french and 18 british survivors of 
the jedburgh unit will meet with president reagan receive honors 
at the french and british embassies and visit the cia headquarters 
where one of their members william e colby was director in the 
mid1970s 
the final group of french veterans arrived wednesday to shouts 
of greetings from their fellow british and american soldiers at 
dulles international airport 
french gen roland de mecquenem of st julien le concelles said 
his memories of the resistance are neither sad nor gay we 
experienced the happiness of fulfilling a duty 
mrs friele she later married an american jed who died in 
the korean war and after the jeds first reunion in france four 
years ago married another one said she has been able to track 
down all but two of the original american soldiers in the 
operation for them she has only names and scant detail arthur 
gruen and ian forbes 
i was 18 and very impressionable so these people have always 
been my heroes and they always will be said mrs friele 62 
who has lived in the united states since the war her second 
husband berent e friele jr 65 of redding conn like many of 
the american jeds was also sent into china to aid resistance 
against the japanese 
mrs friele said life after the war has been difficult for some 
of the men because of the intensity of their experiences dodging 
enemy forces 
she said the reunion in france and one in 1985 of american jeds 
have given the men a chance to share experiences often unpleasant 
that they had rarely talked about many had not seen each other 
since they were trained in england she said 
things that angered them just spilled out she said 
some couldnt readjust they became alcoholics and went 
through terrible experiences she said 
but she said many have done very well in the military and 
elsewhere in addition to colby former jeds include retired army 
maj gen john singlaub who has organized a controversial 
worldwide effort to support resistance groups against communism 
and internationally known yachtsman hod fuller a retired marine 
general 
the late columnist stewart alsop was a jed 
paul cyr 66 of centreville va said he only found out after 
the war that the headquarters of british special operations thought 
some of their messages were coming from the german gestapo and so 
did not respond to requests for assistance including arms drops 
cyr who was sent behind enemy lines twice in europe and later 
in china said his biggest problem was communications 
it could take all day to get the radio into the sidepockets of 
a bike and get out into the countryside to send a simple message 
he said in france he said the mostly frenchspeaking americans 
operated in villages and towns with germans all around them 
the jeds tell the story of one american who didnt speak french 
and injured his back during the jump he had to spend time in a 
german hospital speaking very little before a mission was flown 
in to rescue him 
cyr said he has some horrible memories including holing up on a 
farm with 300 resistance fighters and ending up with only 15 
survivors after germans were led to the scene by a frenchman 
retired col frank mills of fairfax va who worked with the 
allied forces in europe and with the americans who went to china 
but was not a jed himself is writing a book about the missions 
since the documents were declassified mills has spent three 
years going through hundreds of boxes stored in the national 
archives 
he said that despite the obvious danger of the missions only a 
handful of the jeds were killed 
they were guerrillas they had to design operations that would 
keep them alive he said

the director of the centers for disease controls 
aids education campaign has resigned just as the cdc prepares to 
mail aids brochures to every us household a spokeswoman said 
wednesday 
paula van ness director of the cdcs national aids information 
and education program said she will leave the agency june 3 to 
become project director of a ford foundation plan to funnel funds 
into community aids prevention and social service programs 
my understanding is she was made an offer too good to 
refuse said cdc spokeswoman gayle lloyd i dont know of any 
dissatisfaction she had about the pamphlet 
ms van ness resigned april 30 three days before the government 
unveiled the brochure it plans to send to 107 million households 
the brochures are to be mailed beginning may 26 
there was no announcement of the resignation but ms lloyd said 
there was no attempt to keep it secret she said the cdc does not 
routinely announce staff resignations 
no replacement for ms van ness has been named ms lloyd said 
ms van ness was out of town and could not be reached wednesday 
for comment she told the atlanta constitution she was leaving the 
aids information program to find some balance in my life 
citing the large amount of travel and 90hour weeks 
ms van ness joined the cdc in april 1987 after serving as 
executive director of aids project los angeles an aids service 
agency 
the cdcs direct mail campaign got off to a rocky start 
secretary of education william bennett and officials on the 
presidents domestic policy council initially opposed spending the 
20 million allocated by congress on brochures that would carry 
explicit information about aids directly to households

scientists who experimented with 
an ancient corpse nicknamed lady x have developed a new type of 
museum case to protect from decay such priceless relics as mummies 
and the dead sea scrolls 
the technique involves construction of hermetically sealed 
display cases filled with inert nitrogen gas 
a smallscale prototype of the case which contains temperature 
and humidity sensors a leak detector and almost no oxygen was 
unveiled tuesday during a seminar attended by 100 scientists 
museum officials and egyptian dignitaries 
lady x a 3000yearold mummy rested nearby in a less 
sophisticated case scientists at the getty conservation institute 
used cotton swabs to collect bacteria and fungi from her surface 
for use in tests that led to development of the new case 
in the past very little research has been done on the 
conservation of organic materials said luis monreal director of 
the institute 
included among organic materials he said are mummies 
parchment manuscripts textiles and embroideries artworks on paper 
and relics made of leather bone or wood 
the institute part of the j paul getty trust plans to build a 
fullsize display case and test lady x in it for one to three 
months said research director frank preusser 
the mummy a brownskinned 4foot10 woman believed to have 
been a commoner was shipped here from cairo last september 
discovered near luxor in the 1960s she was the first mummy sent 
out of egypt since the remains of pharaoh ramses ii were taken to 
paris in 1976 for radiation treatment to halt fungal decay 
once research is completed egypt will build cases so mummies of 
27 pharaohs and queens discovered in 1881 can be placed on display 
for the first time perhaps by may 1989 said zahi hawass director 
general of the egyptian antiquities organization 
plans to display 15 of those mummies last october were canceled 
to await results of the california research he added 
he said egypts government has extended its original sixmonth 
contract with the institute for another six months to allow 
completion of research on lady x who was nicknamed by an egyptian 
official 
im afraid this mummy will stay here and ask for an american 
green card hawass joked referring to a temporary work permit 
monreal said the new case was designed to be built relatively 
inexpensively so any country can use it to preserve organic 
materials 
he said the institute offered its findings to the israel museum 
in jerusalem if the museum wants to build cases to preserve the 
dead sea scrolls the leather and papyrus manuscripts were 
discovered in the 1940s and 1950s and contain all the books of the 
old testament except esther 
lady x probably was about 40 years old when she did she lived 
sometime during egypts new kingdom period from 1500 bc to 1050 
bc egypt has thousands of such mummies most were commoners 
the mummies were perfectly preserved for millenia in tombs but 
after excavation they became threatened by pollution bacteria 
fungi and changes in temperature humidity and light 
getty scientists didnt take tissue samples from lady x 
instead the microbes they collected were grown on strips of 
parchment placed in glass vials 
growth of the microbes was tested under varying conditions of 
light temperature humidity and oxygen levels said researcher

eight soldiers who trained jamaican 
troops after the 1983 grenada invasion have been indicted by a 
federal grand jury for allegedly submitting thousands of dollars in 
false travel vouchers to the army 
the special forces soldiers from fort bragg who were 
temporarily housed in the americana hotel in ochos rios jamaica 
allegedly conspired to receive two sets of receipts one showed the 
amount actually paid for their rooms 2750 the second showed 
that the hotel received 55 
the indictment handed down tuesday said that just before or 
immediately after returning to fort bragg in may 1984 the eight 
destroyed the receipts that reflected what was actually paid 
they then filled out false travel vouchers that showed they paid 
the greater amount and were reimbursed according to the indictment 
each of the eight was indicted on a single count of conspiring 
to defraud the united states along with a second count of 
submitting a false claim for reimbursement of lodging expenses 
a spokesman for the us attorneys office in raleigh said the 
conspiracy charge carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison 
a fine of up to 250000 or both 
the false claim charge carries a maximum of five years in prison 
and a fine of up to twice what was taken or 250000 or both the 
spokesman said 
the indictment alleged that the eight were assigned in december 
1983 to jamaica to provide trained personnel to serve as security 
forces for the government of grenada following the invasion of that 
country two months before the eight returned to fort bragg in may 
1984

the head of an archives on robert f 
kennedys assassination says key material supporting a conspiracy 
theory appears to be missing from recently opened los angeles 
police department files 
professor philip h melanson said wednesday that discrepancies 
existed between earlier accounts of how much testimony was taped 
and the amount of audiotape made available for public perusal last 
month 
our survey of the files has discovered a major gap in the case 
record melanson said there is a large shortfall of tape 
recordings of interviews and the best circumstantial 
evidence indicates that more data did exist but disappeared 
melanson said the records contain no taped interviews of 51 key 
witnesses including 29 whose testimony would have been expected to 
shed light on whether kennedy had been a victim of a conspiracy 
the fact that they do have to do with conspiracy is disturbing 
because it means that the original investigation was either quite 
incompetent or if it wasnt incompetence and it was some 
kind of purging of a record its the most disturbing of all he 
said 
in los angeles the chief police spokesman commander william 
booth said the department would not deal with what somebody else 
calls a discrepancy 
everything that we had in file with regards to that case had 
been turned over to the state archives he said in terms of 
individuals coming up with their own theories and being 
critical as to whether they find what theyre looking for or not 
the records have to speak for themselves 
robert houghton who as chief of detectives headed the police 
investigation into the june 5 1968 assassination rejected 
suggestions of a coverup and characterized conspiracy theories as 
ridiculous 
i dont know anything about destroying any tapes at all 
houghton said from his home in north ridge calif certain things 
i understand have been blocked out but that was to protect a lot 
of people who were interviewed i dont know what was taken out if 
anything 
the robert f kennedy assassination archives are part of 
southeastern massachusetts university librarys private collection 
melanson started the archives in 1984 when the college in 
dartmouth accepted material gathered by the robert f kennedy truth 
committee a group believing more than one person was involved in 
the shooting 
los angeles police concluded in 1969 that sirhan sirhan alone 
was responsible for the assassination 
conspiracy theorists suggested that a second gunman fired at 
kennedy from behind while sirhan stood in front of him 
melanson who teaches political science said that of the 3470 
interviews los angeles police conducted in investigating the 
killing only 301 interviews were available on tape in the recently 
released record 
melanson said he was told in 1985 by theodore taylor coauthor 
with houghton of a 1970 book on the investigation called special 
unit senator that every single interview was taped and 
taylor later said he had access to 3000 hours of audio tape in 
police department files 
after tabulating the approximate length of witness tapes listed 
in police records a generous estimate is that about 400 hours of 
audio tapes were disclosed by the department said melanson 
nobody answered the telephone wednesday at taylors home in 
laguna beach in new york random house which published special 
unit senator said it had no telephone listing for taylor 
melanson an acknowledged expert on the shooting and its 
aftermath said he arrived at his conclusions by crosschecking 
lists of witnesses with records of taped testimony on file with the 
california state archives keeper of the 50000page police dossier 
on the shooting 
several people at or near the ambassador hotel at the time 
kennedy was shot claimed to remember a young woman in a polkadot 
dress with sirhan leading to the polkadot conspiracy theory 
those questioned for whom no tape exists include 12 persons 
with information relating directly to whether sirhan was 
accompanied by a female accomplice the night of the shooting the 
socalled polkadot dress girl said melanson 
among those who told police about the polkadot dress girl was 
sandra serranosewell she recanted her statement about seeing the 
girl two weeks after the slaying but said in april that police 
badgered her into retracting her statement 
the los angeles police department has repeatedly been accused of 
bungling the investigations by conspiracy theorists

us and laotian soldiers digging on 
their hands and knees scoured a remote hillside wednesday where a 
us warplane crashed 22 years ago but officials said they failed 
to find the remains of two missing american fliers 
the soldiers searched the bamboo and brushcovered hillside in 
savannakhet province where the ov1a mohawk reconnaissance aircraft 
was shot down on march 15 1966 
the us government is trying to resolve the fates of 555 
americans listed as missing in action in the indochina war 
there was an exhaustive search of the crash area from may 2 to 
11 but no remains of the two crewmen aboard the aircraft 
were found said ross petzing spokesman for the us embassy in 
bangkok 
there was some danger posed by unexploded ordnance left over 
from the indochina war period petzing said three cluster 
bombs and several live shells were exploded at the excavation site 
by us air force emergency ordnance disposal experts 
maj tim pfister a spokesman for the us pacific command said 
the team returned to bangkok with some pieces of wreckage from the 
mohawk and a very small amount of personal effects 
he said the soldiers toiled in dusty conditions and temperatures 
of more than 100 degrees using simple tools to shovel out clumps 
of earth and fine metal screens to sift for remains the 14 
americans stayed in tents at the crash site about 95 miles east of 
savannakhet city in southern laos 
pfister said the mohawk had taken off from the us air base at 
phu bai in central vietnam on a mission involving interdiction of 
the ho chi minh trail which communist north vietnam used to 
infiltrate men and supplies into usbacked south vietnam 
he said another aircraft on that mission reported that one 
crewman parachuted out and landed near the area where the mohawk 
crashed 
petzing said that as an expression of americas concern with 
laos own humanitarian problems the us team donated six months 
of medicine and equipment worth about 13000 dollars to the sepone 
district hospital for use by inhabitants of the crash area 
it was the third such joint excavation in communistruled laos 
the remains of 11 missing americans were found in the first 
joint excavation in 1985 and eight others were found in the second 
dig in 1986 laos had promised a third dig in 1986 but a long 
period of inactivity followed until washington agreed last august 
to consider vientianes calls for humanitarian aid 
in february the laotians handed over two boxes of remains they 
said were found in their recent excavations 
us officials said they received exceptional cooperation from 
the laotians 
the american team was from the us joint casualty resolution 
center and the army central identification laboratory the two 
honolulubased agencies are entrusted with resolving the fates of a 
total of more than 2400 mias in vietnam laos and cambodia the 
war ended in 1975 with communist victories in all three countries

legislation calling for a new national housing 
policy should be ready this summer in time to be a major focus of 
the presidential and congressional campaigns sen alan cranston 
said wednesday 
the california democrat who is chairman of the senate housing 
subcommittee said he wants all of the presidential and 
congressional candidates to make a commitment to the housing 
program he has been working on with some of the nations leading 
housing experts for the past 10 months 
we want to have an impact during the campaign so that housing 
is discussed not just in general terms with all candidates claiming 
to be friends of housing cranston said in remarks to a meeting 
of the california association of realtors 
he said commitments are necessary so they will be more likely 
to adopt the policy framework that supporters of housing have 
developed 
meanwhile representatives of the poor urged the house housing 
subcommittee to approve legislation to provide for the construction 
of 5 million new public housing units and to modernize 1 million 
public housing units over a 10year period 
rick tinglingclemmons representing the national tenants 
organization urged congress to appropriate emergency money to 
begin the immediate restoration renovation and repair of all 
existing public housing units 
he said the tenants organization also wants congress to pass 
the socalled jesse gray housing act named for the 1969 founder of 
the tenants organization to provide for additional public housing 
cranston the senates secondranking democrat said he hopes to 
have the senate banking committee which oversees housing 
legislation approve his legislation by aug 15 when congress 
recesses for the summer 
we will move it as far as possible through congress this 
year he told the realtors but i suspect we will have to wait 
for a new administration to enact it 
he said major pieces of the bill should be ready to be announced 
in june and should be introduced in the senate and house in july 
we should set clear realistic goals that can be accomplished 
say by the year 2000 cranston said even if the initial steps 
must be smaller than many would like we can show that they are the 
right steps and that they are part of a sustainable strategy

only new and harsher economic pressure on 
south africa will prompt the regime to end its policy of official 
racism anglican archbishop desmond tutu told members of congress 
wednesday in appealing for new sanctions against his country 
in meetings and appearances throughout the day tutu repeated 
his message that the longstanding us policy of diplomatic 
pressure has failed he urged lawmakers to support a new bill that 
would sever virtually all economic ties between the two countries 
it is critically urgent that you make a moral decision tutu 
told a capitol hill audience that included about a dozen house 
members are you on the side of injustice or justice the side of 
oppression or freedom of inhumanity or humanity 
a bill that would require us companies to shed their 
investments in south africa within a year and ban trade in 
everything but strategic minerals and agricultural products is 
pending in the house and a similar bill was to be introduced in 
the senate thursday by sen edward m kennedy dmass and others 
while supporters are optimistic about house passage the bills 
fate is unclear in the senate in part because moderate republicans 
who were key to the passage of limited sanctions in 1986 are 
reluctant to go along with harsher measures 
as tutu sought support for the legislation a congressional 
study was issued showing that south africas exports to 24 
countries which report trading data to the international monetary 
fund decreased by 7 percent and imports plummeted by 31 percent 
from 1982 through the first half of 1987 the declines came while 
overall trade was rising substantially 
the interim report by the general accounting office did not say 
how much of the decline was due to the limited sanctions imposed by 
congress in 1986 over president reagans veto those sanctions 
banned imports of agricultural products coal iron steel and 
textiles and exports of oil arms nuclear materials and 
computers as well as new us loans 
the report also noted that us direct investment in south 
africa declined by about 10 percent since 1982 
about 80 percent of south africas trade remains with six major 
industrial nations the united states great britain west germany 
france italy and japan the united states and great britain 
recently have decreased their share of trade while japan has 
increased its share the gao found 
tutu said the south african government remains intransigent 
exercising what amounts to terrorism over its black majority 
despite the earlier sanctions by the united states and he 
suggested that world attention to the problem has waned 
i want to know what the south african government still has to 
do so the world would be filled with so much revulsion and outrage 
that it would move heaven and earth to rid the world of the scourge 
of apartheid the anglican archbishop said comparing the 
government to that of nazi germany 
it sometimes takes our breath away the things that the south 
african government has been able to get away with he said 
tutu contended that anything that has happened in south africa 
has happened because of pressure 
he specifically cited the continued detention by the government 
of children as young as 7 and 8 years old with some held more than 
a year and kept without contact from the outside 
what must our people still suffer so that the world 
recognizing their anguish would then say we cant allow this to 
continue tutu asked 
rep steve gunderson rwis who supported the limited 
sanctions in 1986 said he was concerned that unilateral action by 
the united states might have little impact without parallel moves 
by other major south african trading partners like west germany and 
japan 
it would be far more effective if we had a global approach 
tutu acknowledged but who is likely to persuade them no country 
is in a better position that the united states the moral stand

the defense attorney for carlos lehder 
rivas charged wednesday that prosecutors used bought witnesses 
who were promised reduced sentences or other favors for testifying 
against the reputed colombian drug lord 
in closing arguments at lehders cocainesmuggling trial 
defense attorney edward r shohat said the chief prosecution 
witness got the break of a lifetime for his testimony against 
lehder 
by agreeing to cooperate with prosecutors convicted smuggler ed 
ward was able to reduce a possible 215year sentence and 59 
million fine to less than six years in prison shohat said 
boy did he put it over on the government said the defense 
attorney 
he charged that ward lied to the grand jury that indicted lehder 
in 1981 and that he again committed perjury in lehders trial many 
other prosecution witnesses also received deals from prosecutors in 
exchange for testimony he said 
lehder 38 and codefendant jack carlton reed 57 are on trial 
in federal court on charges they conspired to smuggle some 33 tons 
of cocaine into the united states from colombia via lehders 
private bahamian island normans cay from 1978 to 1980 
a separate miami indictment accuses lehder of being one of the 
leaders of the socalled medellin cartel a violent smuggling ring 
believed to be responsible a large share of the cocaine entering 
the united states 
lehder was captured in february 1987 at a mansion near the town 
of medellin after a shootout between colombian army troops and his 
bodyguards he was immediately whisked onto a us air force plane 
bound for the united states 
the prosecution called 115 witnesses in the trial which began 
with jury selection last october last week defense attorneys 
surprised the courtroom by announcing that they would be calling no 
witnesses 
closing arguments were expected to continue through thursday and 
the jury may get the case friday 
winding up his prosecution arguments wednesday us attorney 
robert merkle referred to testimony that lehder used bribes charm 
and threats to run a smuggling empire for once merkle said 
lehder couldnt use such tools 
he cannot buy his way out of a just verdict he cannot charm 
his way out of a just verdict and he cannot force his way out of a 
just verdict merkle said 
a day earlier merkle told the jury that lehder was waging a 
violent war against the united states and viewed cocaine as a 
weapon hes still at war merkle said 
in his defense arguments shohat told the jury that the judge 
would instruct them that they should consider the testimony of 
convicted felons with special care 
boy do we have convicted felons here he said 
he argued that many of the government witnesses were given 
immunity from prosecution hoping for reduced sentences or some 
type of deal in return for their testimony 
the government brought in 29 bought witnesses he said 
they paid an incredible price to get mr lehders conviction 
he also argued that much of the testimony did not concern the 
charges contained in the indictment 
the issue is not whether mr lehder was good or bad shohat 
said the issue in this case is the 11 counts in the indictment 
as an example shohat cited the days of testimony concerning 
possible payoffs to officials in the bahamas including allegations 
that prime minister lynden o pindling had taken bribes pindling 
has called the allegations a fantasy 
lynden pindling is not on trial here in this case carlos 
lehder is on trial shohat said the payment of bribes to 
bahamian officials he said is not an issue in this case 
lehder is charged with conspiracy possession of cocaine with 
intent to distribute importation of cocaine and operating a 
continuing criminal enterprise 
codefendant reed of san pedro calif is charged with 
smuggling conspiracy

would withdraw from the republican presidential race next week and 
said in a newspaper interview that he will likely return to his 
financially ailing christian broadcasting network 
barbara gattullo a spokeswoman for americans for robertson 
said the decision to return to cbn is not set in stone but the 
important thing is whether or not he returns to cbn he will 
continue to be involved in politics 
she said robertson would file papers shortly with the federal 
election commission for a new political action committee 
americans for the republic 
robertson himself speaking to reporters outside the white 
house endorsed vice president george bush who already had the gop 
nomination well in hand 
the former television evangelist said he would formally withdraw 
from the race monday 
meanwhile in an interview published in the virginianpilot amp 
the ledgerstar of norfolk robertson said he likely would return 
to the christian broadcasting network which he founded nearly 30 
years ago as chief executive officer a job his son now holds 
i dont have a comment to make said cbn spokesman benton 
miller none of the staff or i have been provided any 
informati robertson who has spent over 22 million on his campaign 
has 
but 46 delegates to the national convention while bush has more 
than 1300 robertson finished third to bush and sen bob dole in 
most of the early primaries 
ms gattullo said the new political action committee will raise 
money and train conservative christians who want to become involved 
in the political process the staff of americans for robertson 
would switch to the new pac keeping the same offices in virginia 
she said 
the new pac has a purpose similar in some ways to robertsons 
nowdefunct freedom council which had taxexempt status before it 
folded in 1986 after americans for robertson was incorporated 
critics challenged the council as being merely a front for 
robertsons thenundeclared campaign and it is being investigated 
along with cbn and americans for robertson by the internal revenue 
service 
unlike the council americans for the republic will actively 
support candidates ms gattullo said

president reagan conferred with experts on the 
soviet union on wednesday and one of them said the flap about the 
use of astrology at the white house will not overshadow the 
superpower summit with mikhail s gorbachev 
over lunch in the roosevelt room reagan spent an hour talking 
with eight scholars who specialize in various aspects of soviet 
life white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said it was the first 
in a series of two or three such meetings 
talking with reporters later in the white house driveway adam 
ulam a harvard university historian and political scientist said 
reagan mostly listened to the group 
ulam was asked how the soviets would react to the disclosure 
that nancy reagan had consulted an astrologer in planning the 
presidents schedule and activities 
i dont think they pay any attention to it he replied 
why should they i think that they deal with facts they dont 
deal with gossip which doesnt really concern them 
i mean theyre really dealing with the united states on the 
basis of factual things and they discount much of rhetoric and much 
of the gossip which goes on as everyday staple of our own political 
commentary ulam said 
reagan will meet with gorbachev in moscow may 29 through june 2

vincent van goghs portrait of his innkeepers 
teenage daughter who wrote a vivid account of the artists death 
decades after his suicide was set to be auctioned wednesday and 
was expected to bring more than 15 million 
portrait of adeline ravoux one of van goghs last 
paintings is included in a slate of impressionist and modern 
paintings scheduled for sale at christies auction house 
the picture of the 13yearold girl was made a month before van 
gogh committed suicide in july 1890 in the village of auvers 
outside paris in an essay written when she in her 70s adeline 
ravoux carrie described the artists final hours as he lay in his 
room at her fathers inn dying of a gunshot wound 
interest in the painting is keen experts say in part because 
it serves as a link to the artists last days christies the 
auction house where the sale will take place estimates the work 
may fetch more than 15 million 
the portrait last changed hands in 1980 when an anonymous buyer 
purchased it at a sothebys auction for 198 million 
over the past 14 months three of paintings by van gogh who 
sold almost nothing during his lifetime have fetched previously 
unheardof multimilliondollar prices that shocked the art world 
in march 1987 van goghs sunflowers sold for 399 million 
at christies in london to a japanese insurance company three 
months later the trinquetaille bridge went for 202 million 
also at christies in london it was bought by an unidentified 
collector in switzerland 
then in november history was made when van goghs irises 
a composition of purple flowers and green leaves set off by a 
single white iris sold at sothebys in new york for 539 million 
to an anonymous buyer the highest price paid at auction for a 
painting 
in the painting auctioned wednesday adeline dressed in blue 
sits in profile on a chair her blond hair is tied with a blue 
ribbon her gaze is serene her posture correct and her hands are 
folded demurely in front of her he observed her very deeply and 
when he came to paint her he painted both the grace and stiff 
awkwardness of an adolescent girl said michael findlay senior 
vice president of christies and an expert on impressionist and 
modern painting 
but mrs carrie who died in 1965 at the age of 88 said in a 
1956 essay that she didnt immediately appreciate the painting 
i admit that i was only moderately satisfied with my portrait 
it was somewhat of a disappointment for i did not find it was true 
to life mrs carrie wrote 
however she was quoted in a 1953 interview as saying 
monsieur vincent divined not the young girl i was but the woman 
i was to become 
mrs carrie described van gogh who lived at her fathers inn 
during the last 2 months of his life as a disciplined artist and 
a soft and calm man who enjoyed playing with her baby sister 
she described how a doctor and police were summoned after he 
returned to the inn after shooting himself and how his brother 
theo who was the artists chief backer came running from the 
train station his face distorted by grief 
among the other artworks set to be auctioned wednesday night are 
works by pierre auguste renoir mary cassatt henri de 
toulouselautrec pablo picasso and georges braque

kerrmcgee corp has resumed production 
of a rocket fuel oxidizer drawing the ire of jittery officials 
still recovering from last weeks blast at a similar plant two 
miles away 
officials in this city of 55000 vowed wednesday to take legal 
action to close the plant until the cause of last weeks explosion 
is determined 
with the shutdown of the plant where the explosion occurred the 
kerrmcgee plant is the only one in the nation producing ammonium 
perchlorate a component in the solid rocket fuel used in space 
shuttle and military rockets 
we feel absolutely satisfied that its safe kerrmcgee 
spokesman paul reed said in oklahoma city 
i think its ridiculous said henderson city manager gary 
bloomquist im totally amazed that they did it 
kerrmcgee ceased production of the rocket fuel component last 
wednesday following the series of explosions at the pacific 
engineering amp production co plant the explosions killed two 
people injured 326 and caused an estimated 73 million in damage 
reed said the production resumed at 4 pm tuesday he announced 
it wednesday from the companys corporate headquarters in oklahoma 
city 
bloomquist said plant officials notified henderson mayor lorna 
kesterson of the resumption after the night shift had reported for 
work at the sprawling industrial complex blocks from the downtown 
last weeks blast at the pacific engineering plant two miles 
out into the desert damaged homes and businesses throughout the 
henderson and las vegas area 
bloomquist said kerrmcgee officials last week promised not to 
reopen until the cause of the explosions was known 
bloomquist said he had been instructed by city council members 
to take legal action to halt the kerrmcgee operations until the 
accidents cause is known 
the city manager said he thought the city could close the plant 
and he wanted to do so 
im very sensitive to the loss of jobs and the loss of 
industry bloomquist said but im more sensitive right now to 
the fact that theres a lot of very nervous people living in this 
city 
i dont think its unreasonable for kerrmcgee to keep the 
commitment it made to the people bloomquist said 
military officials have expressed concern about the loss of the 
pacific plant and its impact on the national defense 
kerrmcgee spokeswoman annita bridges said the company would be 
operating three shifts as it was doing prior to last weeks 
accident 
if there is a need to increase capacity we will do what we 
can to meet that need ms bridges said weve looked since the 
accident as to what kinds of increases we might be able to make

polands worst labor unrest in nearly 
seven years reminded authorities that plans to reform the economy 
and political system are racing against a deadline of mounting 
public impatience 
but the opposition learned that the public is not ready for a 
repeat of the nationwide strikes of 1980 that led to the birth of 
solidarity 
the walkouts that began april 25 among bus and tram drivers in 
the western polish city of bydgoszcz led to the sitin strike by 
hundreds of gdansk shipyard workers that ended tuesday night in the 
baltic port city 
the workers demands for higher pay and union freedoms echoed 
august 1980 when poland was electrified by a sudden national labor 
revolt and the eastern blocs first independent trade union 
federation solidarity 
the organization formally banned after the imposition of 
martial law in 1981 claimed 10 million members nearly one out of 
three poles and was far larger than the ruling polish united 
workers communist party 
the younger poles who are most ready to storm the barricades did 
not experience the disappointment and trauma of martial law in the 
same way as their elders 
when the gdansk shipyard strike committee led behind the 
scenes by solidarity leader lech walesa agreed to discuss a 
compromise in which the strikers would give up a demand for the 
immediate recognition of solidarity it was the younger generation 
that balked 
history does not like to repeat itself and this was exactly 
what the aging veterans of solidarity could not understand said 
a commentary wednesday by the staterun news agency pap 
although there were frequent expressions of concern and sympathy 
for the recent protests the vast majority of society hung back 
from any overt moves to help the strikers 
the poles saw in 1981 that pursuing strikes was a 
culdesac given the geopolitical situation in this part of the 
world said a western diplomat who spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
he said the strikes in 198081 led to sovietsupported 
repression by the polish government and further economic hardships 
for common poles 
government spokesman jerzy urban said the recent unrest was 
instructive for the authorities and would cause them to redouble 
efforts to reform the economic and political systems 
indeed one day after the last strike the polish parliament 
unanimously passed a program to speed up its plans to make the 
economy more efficient by giving it special powers to fire managers 
or take over enterprises that resist economic changes 
but the diplomat said the authorities have already lost the 
hearts and minds of the new generation 
solidarity has not necessarily captured them either he 
added 
he said there was impressive but not overwhelming support from 
the rest of society but that solidarity calls for sympathy 
action were not taken up with alacrity 
official comments were quick to label the strikers decision to 
leave the shipyard even without a settlement the end of solidarity 
the myth of solidaritys might has fallen the pap 
commentary said it turned out to be a small group which could 
not find support in big enterprises including those in gdansk and 
even in the gdansk shipyard 
but another western diplomat said he thought it was too early to 
write solidaritys obituary 
he said the group will continue to exist because it continues 
to be a necessary focus for a whole band of postulates and opinions 
that exist among the polish people 
for solidarity leader lech walesa it was more a matter of 
timing despite official propaganda that portrayed him as the 
manipulator of events he said repeatedly that the strike at the 
lenin shipyard this time caught him by surprise and came too 
early to attract enough support to be effective 
public dissatisfaction is building he said and if authorities 
do not pursue reform more effectively including dialogue with 
solidarity and other independent groups the final result will be 
bloody revolution

discriminatory voter registration procedures 
are disenfranchising the poor minority and disabled citizens 
throughout the country directors of a private study said wednesday 
among the practices are arbitrary registration hours 
inconvenient registration locations mysterious purging of voters 
without notice denial of registration before an election said a 
statement from sen alan cranston dcalif who is the author of 
legislation to correct such practices 
the citizens commission on civil rights in hearings in new york 
atlanta and phoenix in 1984 and 1985 documented numerous examples 
of discrimintory practices the group said 
the commission also reviewed the registration systems in each 
state and the historical voting and registration practices the 
report said in most states local officials have wide 
discretion in setting times places and conditions for people to 
register to vote 
this discretion is often is exercised in ways which establish 
barriers to registration and voting said the report 
the restrictive practices have a disproportionately adverse 
effect on lowincome minority and disabled citizens the report 
said it cited the following examples 
limited registration sites affect poor people who dont own 
cars 
limited hours for registration affect working people who cant 
get away from their jobs 
many registration sites are inaccessible to the disabled 
failure to provide bilingual assistance affects lowincome 
citizens and nonenglish speaking minorities 
the voting rights act of 1965 has eliminated the most blatant 
discrimination practices but remnants of the old systems of 
disenfranchisement persist the report said 
among the specific problems are refusal by local officials to 
designate sites in black commuinities for mobile registration 
units requirement of excessive identification from black 
applicants undue scrutiny of hispanics and asianamericans to 
determine their citizenship sites that require extraordinarily 
long trips and dual registration requirements for tribal and 
state elections for native americans 
the commission recommended legislation to permit registration by 
mail electionday registration and a congressional investigation 
into denial of the right to vote for homeless people 
cranstons bill pending in senate committee and a companion 
house bill by rep john conyers dmich generally parallels those 
recommendations 
the commission is sending a copy of its report to congress the 
white house and the presidential candidates seeking support for 
its proposals

the aflcio on wednesday said a new 13 
million broadcast advertising campaign was designed to show that 
unions like their workers are interested in fairness justice and 
life outside the job 
the ads which all end with a chorus singing america works 
best when we say union yes have begun appearing on the 
television networks and in 13 local markets the 30second spots 
are expected to reach more than nine out of 10 of all american 
homes at least four times 
radio spots will be aired as well including one that urges 
listeners to ask congress to override president reagans expected 
veto of the trade legislation unions have been pushing a provision 
of the bill requiring mandatory notice of plant closings for large 
companies 
at a closedcircuit tv news conference to the 13 cities where 
the tv ads will be shown aflcio president lane kirkland said 
the labor movement has a long welldocumented record of fighting 
for the rights and the standard of living of working americans but 
in spite of that there are still many americans who have serious 
misconceptions about what unions do and about whether or not they 
are necessary in todays work place 
the goal of union yes he said is to talk directly with 
american workers about the value of unions in the work place today 
one of the best ways to do that now is through television 
morton bahr president of the communications workers of america 
told reporters in washington that the ads fill a need to let the 
population at large know what the trade union movement stands for 
he said many americans have a stereotype of unions and union 
members they see a heavyset fellow smoking a cigar and wearing a 
500 suit 
one commercial focuses on women with a woman saying unions have 
ensured fairness in promotions another obviously pregnant woman 
says that because of unions she will be able to take time off to 
have her baby and come back to a job 
the first phase of the ad campaign runs through midjune the 
second phase picks up on labor day in september the campaign 
which is paid for with union dues is expected to last two years 
the ads will star actors jack lemmon tyne daly and howard

communist officials under pressure to 
resolve the countrys rising economic and political turmoil said 
wednesday that a party conference will grapple next week with 
changes in national leadership 
premier karoly grosz has said the meeting could lead to 
departure of party leader janos kadar 
critics of the 75yearold leader who has headed the party 
since 1956 when the kremlin put down an antisoviet revolt blame 
him for hungarys economic problems and for resisting reform 
a communique published wednesday in the staterun media after a 
oneday meeting of the communist partys central committee said it 
is necessary to renew the partys leading bodies it proposed 
that a conference next week elect a new committee its more than 
100 members make key policy decisions for the party 
wednesdays statement said the central committee on tuesday 
approved a draft policy document for debate at the conference 
the original document was written by kadar but the communique 
did not make clear whether changes had been made to incorporate 
complaints from critics inside and outside the party that it did 
not go far enough with reform 
in the version published last month the communist party 
accepted blame for the countrys economic woes and offered some 
political reforms such as multicandidate elections and limited 
terms in party office 
but critics said it stopped far short of allowing genuine 
political pluralism an issue hotly debated among the nations 
880000 communists and in the staterun media for the past year 
austerity measures imposed to curb a gross foreign debt of 17 
billion have resulted in inflation of more than 15 percent this 
year and prompted widespread grumbling from citizens and the 
official trade unions about the government program 
the communique on wednesday said leaders at tuesdays meeting 
also debated personnel changes and formed a special committee to 
deal with such matters at the threeday conference opening may 20 
but it did not reveal who made the report on personnel matters or 
say who will be on the committee 
western diplomats who spoke on condition of anonymity said 
they expected some changes in membership of the central committee 
at next weeks conference they described tuesdays decisions as a 
modest step forward in dealing with the mounting political and 
economic crisis 
communist party leaders including kadar and grosz have said in 
recent months they would like the party to retreat from daytoday 
adminstrative duties and concentrate on ideological and political 
leadership of the country 
grosz has also declared readiness for dialogue with any 
hungarian who is not opposed to socialism and budapests alliance 
with the soviet union 
grosz a leading contender to succeed kadar as party chief has 
said the political future of the party leader may be up for debate 
at next weeks conference 
in the event that some 1000 delegates attending the 
conference decide that personnel changes are necessary and if 
these changes include the person of janos kadar he will accept the 
decision grosz told reporters while in britain last week 
kadar has said he would step down if asked but he has shown 
little sign of wanting to do so 
hungarians will watch closely to see whether outspoken reformers 
move up or down in party rankings when the conference ends with 
another central committee meeting may 22

the labor department launched an effort 
wednesday to ensure that pension fund managers who control a 
growing percentage of the nations corporate stock are free from 
improper pressures in takeover battles 
over the next several months department investigators will be 
monitoring how selected investment managers vote on takeover 
defenses and other issues that affect the value of stock according 
to david m walker assistant secretary of labor 
the departments pension and welfare benefits administration 
issued guidelines in february saying pension fund investment 
managers should keep the interests of the members of the fund in 
mind when voting proxies for shares in their care the enforcement 
project is intended to see if the guidelines are being followed 
were not trying to come out procorporate management or pro 
any other party the important thing is that pension funds not be 
viewed as tools or pawns of corporate management or any other 
party walker said 
there has been growing concern in recent years that investment 
managers have been subject to pressure from parties trying to block 
takeovers such as corporate managers or union leaders who have 
the ability to add to or take away from a fund managers business 
we want to make sure theres not undue influence improper 
influence that would adversely affect the economic interests of 
the plan walker said 
if the enforcement project turns up violations investment 
managers could be subject to civil enforcement proceedings walker 
said adding if the plan suffers an economic loss then there 
is personal liability 
walker said he did not know how much abuse exists however a 
survey released in september by the employee benefit research 
institute a washingtonbased nonpartisan research organization 
showed that 65 percent of pension fund investment managers reported 
being pressured at least once in voting on corporate takeovers 
the stakes are high in this area for a lot of parties theres 
a great potential for abuse and we hear a lot of assertions 
were trying to do a little bit of preventive medicine before 
abuse becomes widespread walker said 
the question of improper influence over fund managers has become 
more important as more companies call on shareholders to adopt 
poison pills and other measures designed to thwart corporate 
raiders 
pension funds controlled 24 percent of the nations stock last 
year up from 19 percent in 1980 and 10 percent in 1970 but the 
percentages are significantly higher for stocks traded on the new 
york stock exchange walker said and pension funds own 60 percent 
of some companies he said 
the department estimates by the year 2000 pension funds are 
likely to control half the stock in all us companies

the nine astronauts who worked in 
skylab the only manned american space station gathered wednesday 
to celebrate its launch nearly 15 years ago and to urge a greater 
commitment to space exploration 
space is our frontier and beginning its exploration may be 
our generations greatest contribution to human history said 
alan bean commander of the second of three skylab crews 
gerald carr who headed the third mission agreed saying future 
space probes should avoid the 10 to 12day mindset and plan for 
the long haul 
bean carr and their seven colleagues joined dozens of engineers 
and other members of the skylab team in observing the historic 
events following skylabs launch aboard a saturn v rocket on may 
14 1973 from kennedy space center in florida 
the three skylab missions from may 1973 to february 1974 
resulted in significant information about biomedicine solar 
physics astrophysics engineering and technology materials 
processing and other topics 
but the skylab team first had to overcome problems that 
threatened to jeopardize the mission before the astronauts stepped 
aboard 
ground crews noticed shortly after the launch that a meteorite 
and heat shield had ripped off and struck solar panels that were 
left improperly deployed 
but ground crews managed to alter the labs orbit and develop a 
shield that the first crew members joseph p kerwin charles 
pete conrad jr and paul weitz carried into space with them 11 
days after the initial launch 
the crew made a daring space walk to adjust the panels when they 
arrived and salvaged the mission 
other skylab crew members were owen k garriott and jack lousma 
who flew on the second mission and edward gibson and william r 
pogue on the third 
tuesdays conference sponsored by the national aeronautics and 
space administration and the university of alabama at huntsville as 
well as local space and aeronautics groups was held at the wernher 
von braun civic center named in honor of the former german rocket 
scientist who helped develop the american space program after world 
war ii 
the skylab astronauts showed no reluctance to join a similar 
mission again 
eight of us got together after dinner tuesday night and 
someone asked if we would volunteer to go to mars said kerwin 
scientist pilot on the mission eight hands shot up as rapidly as 
possible 
we would do it in a minute said carr commander of the last 
mission 
kerwin said the nations space program reached its peak in 1967 
when it received 7 percent of the federal budget he said it had 
been shrinking since then now getting a fraction of 1 percent of 
the budget 
i hope thats not permanent he said 
one thing that skylab showed carr said is that people can hold 
up in space longer than was thought 
the first crew stayed aboard 28 days the second 59 days and 
the third 84 days 
carr now an aerospace consultant in huntsville ark said 
todays generation of space scientists should avoid reinventing 
the wheel they would be remiss if they dont take the lessons that 
have already been learned and reapply them and build on that 
data

an elementary school principal paid off 
an unusual bet with pupils by donning a tuxedo and bowtie and 
eating a lunch of pizza and cola atop the schools sundrenched 
roof 
below on the school grounds of luthervilletimonium elementary 
school 500 pupils shouted triumphantly eat eat eat 
the scene tuesday was an odd victory celebration for the 
students who were challenged at the beginning of the school year 
by principal fred brown to read 1 million pages by the end of the 
school year 
the prospect of seeing him eat lunch on the roof of the school 
was the reward 
were not sure whether it browns offer was a flip remark 
said librarian doris glotzbach but we picked up on it and 
wouldnt let it go 
there were doubts about whether the students could get through 
enough books to reach the goal but the chance of putting brown on 
the roof apparently proved incentive enough 
it did the job as far as motivating students to read said 
fifthgrade teacher dennis kimmel they were carrying around 
books with them all the time

the consumer product safety commission 
announced wednesday the recall of two brands of baby rattles and a 
puzzle game because they present a choking hazard to infants 
the commission said li peng enterprises inc of los angeles 
withdrew its rainbow bell rattle and toysrus of rochelle park 
nj withdrew its crib pals shake and twist baby rattle and its 
colorforms story book puzzle 
the rainbow rattles item ct8013 are plastic with a handle 
made of what appears to be beads at one end and four bellshaped 
noise makers in a circle at the other end 
the commission said it did not know of any injuries caused by 
the rattles but said they posed a choking hazard because the 
handle is small enough to enter a childs mouth and can reach the 
back of the throat 
about 86400 were sold between june 1987 and august 1987 for 
285 
the crib pals shake and twist baby rattles no 098132 are 5 
inches by 1 inches and have a ball containing liquid and six 
colored pellets the commission said the rattle can break during 
use and the pieces present a potential choking hazard although no 
injuries or deaths have been reported approximately 24000 were 
sold from march 1986 to december 1987 through toysrus stores for 
148 
the colorforms no 150 story book puzzles have five wooden 
pieces and come in two models the pinky brite bear and the rosy

the pentagon said wednesday it would increase 
government payments to defense contractors for work in progress to 
help ease the burden of lining up financing to perform weapons work 
the increase in the socalled progress payment percentage will 
apply to defense department contracts awarded on or after oct 1 
the start of fiscal 1989 the pentagon said in a prepared statement 
the progress payment rate for large contractors will be 
increased from 75 percent to 80 percent a month while the rate for 
small business concerns will be hiked from 80 percent to 85 
percent the defense department added 
the increase is the first since 1981 and follows two reductions 
in progress payment rates in 1985 and again in 1986 
the move will cost the us treasury an estimated 500 million 
in fiscal 1989 but is justified because the current 75 percent 
rate is imposing an excessive financing burden on the defense 
industry wrote robert b costello the undersecretary of defense 
for acquisition who approved the change 
under longstanding practice defense contractors are allowed to 
submit monthly bills for contract work in progress instead of 
waiting until all work is completed that system of progress 
payments was developed as weapon systems grew larger and more 
complex in many cases requiring years of work and straining the 
ability even of the biggest company to borrow enough money to keep 
assembly lines moving 
the defense department has never paid progress fees at the full 
contract rate however currently for large firms it pays out a 
maximum 75 percent of the monthly bill the remaining 25 percent is 
withheld pending deliveries completion of contract work or final 
audits 
the progress payment rate for large contractors has ranged as 
high as 90 percent in the early 1980s when inflation was soaring 
in double digits but held steady at 80 percent from 1968 to 1981 
the last change in the rate dropping it from 80 percent to 75 
percent occurred in 1986 at congress direction in order to trim 
government spending to comply with the grammrudman balanced budget 
law 
unless congress intervenes with new legislation however the 
pentagon is no longer bound to keep the 75 percent rate 
according to the defense department the 25 percent financing 
share now required of the defense industry is higher than 
historical levels and is not compatible with current interest rates 
and economic conditions

supporters of jesse jackson say the 
democratic presidential candidate was shortchanged in delegates he 
received at kansas district conventions 
jackson backers filed a formal challenge to the delegate 
selection process last week as state party officials prepared for 
a state democratic committee meeting on saturday to choose the last 
of kansas delegates to the democratic national convention in july 
in atlanta 
supporters say jackson should have been allocated 12 national 
delegates instead of the seven he received based on the results of 
county caucuses march 19 
they also say massachusetts gov michael dukakis should have 10 
delegates instead of 12 and sen albert gore jr should have two 
instead of five the number of uncommitted delegates would remain 
at two under the challenge 
a total of 26 national delegates was selected april 22 at 
congressional district conventions 
jackson supporters also complain that the way delegates are 
chosen in kansas is confusing and unduly complicated 
its an unfair process said charles meek state coordinator 
for the jackson campaign when you say caucus to the average 
person they say what do you mean all were asking for is what 
is fair 
were still formulating an answer to the challenge said joe 
scranton executive director of the kansas democratic party we 
dont know what that answer will be yet 
the state party has until may 24 to rule on the jackson 
challenge 
delegates are selected to the national convention based on a 
process that started with 117 local caucuses which chose the 
people who vote at the district conventions 
the district conventions then selected 26 national delegates 
from the five congressional districts the third and final step is 
the selection of 13 delegates at the state committee meeting those 
delegates will be chosen based on the results of the district 
conventions with seven going to dukakis and three each to jackson 
and gore 
bill beachy former state party executive director who is acting 
as a consultant to the jackson campaign in the challenge said the 
26 national delegates selected at the district conventions should 
accurately reflect the results of the local caucuses under a party 
rule 
that rule was not followed he said 
candidates must receive at least 15 percent of the caucus votes 
before they can receive any delegates according to the rules 
beachy says people were allowed to regroup at the district 
conventions and previously uncommitted delegates threw in with 
either dukakis or gore 
although gore did not break the 15 percent threshold in the 
local caucuses in three congressional districts he received one 
delegate from each of those districts after picking up uncommitted 
delegates at the district conventions 
they shouldnt be allowed to regroup after the caucuses 
beachy said the caucuses set what the delegate allocations 
should be 
scranton acknowledged there is a difference of opinion in 
interpretation of party rules 
he also joined jackson supporters in their complaints about the 
complicated process 
anyone who has tried to administer this from the county 
selection on up to the national selection is painfully aware of 
how complicated it is scranton said

eight soldiers who trained jamaican 
troops after the 1983 grenada invasion have been indicted by a 
federal grand jury for allegedly submitting thousands of dollars in 
false travel vouchers to the army 
the special forces soldiers from fort bragg who were 
temporarily housed in the americana hotel in ochos rios jamaica 
allegedly conspired to receive two sets of receipts one showed the 
amount actually paid for their rooms 2750 the second showed 
that the hotel received 55 
the indictment handed down tuesday said that just before or 
immediately after returning to fort bragg in may 1984 the eight 
destroyed the receipts that reflected what was actually paid 
they then filled out false travel vouchers that showed they paid 
the greater amount and were reimbursed according to the indictment 
each of the eight was indicted on a single count of conspiring 
to defraud the united states along with a second count of 
submitting a false claim for reimbursement of lodging expenses 
a spokesman for the us attorneys office in raleigh said the 
conspiracy charge carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison 
a fine of up to 250000 or both 
the false claim charge carries a maximum of five years in prison 
and a fine of up to twice what was taken or 250000 or both the 
spokesman said 
the indictment did not indicate the total amount of the false 
vouchers and the army would not comment wednesday 
the indictment alleged that the eight were assigned in december 
1983 to jamaica to provide trained personnel to serve as security 
forces for the government of grenada following the invasion of that 
country two months before the eight returned to fort bragg in may 
1984

interior secretary donald p hodel on 
wednesday attacked a bill to amend indian adoption and child 
custody laws saying it contains provisions that smack of pure 
racism 
hodel wrote sen daniel k inouye dhawaii chairman of the 
select committee on indian affairs that he was extremely 
alarmed about some portions of the bill 
assistant interior secretary ross swimmer a former principal 
chief of the cherokee nation who is in charge of indian affairs 
asked the committee to hold up action on the bill until the 
department could propose a substitute 
hodel said one provision of the bill gives parents no right to 
object to a tribes attempt to transfer custody or adoption cases 
from state to tribal court unless the objection is consistent 
with the best interests of the child as an indian 
the provision ignores all other aspects of the childs status 
as a human being that in my view is pure racism hodel said 
current law permits tribes to claim jurisdiction in adoption and 
custody cases only for children of enrolled members but the bill 
would extend that jurisdiction to children whose parents and 
other ancestors of the child may have had no connection with the 
tribe perhaps for years or even generations hodel said 
in his testimony at a hearing of the committee swimmer said 
we do not believe that indian parents and their children should 
have to return to the reservation of their tribe which is often in 
another state for a court proceeding concerning the child 
we strongly oppose the expansion of the definition of indian 
child and recommend that the definition should not only contain a 
membership requirement but also that the domicile of the 
birthparent or parents is in indian country swimmer said 
if the family does not live in indian country on a reservation 
then state courts should have jurisdiction following certain 
guidelines of federal law for placement of children in foster homes 
and adoptions unless the best interest of the child requires a 
different placement swimmer said

american and soviet negotiators reached tentative 
agreement wednesday night on a handful of sticking points on 
preventing cheating on a missileban treaty a senior us official 
said 
the issues are technical but us senate leaders have vowed not 
to take up the treaty until they are settled 
the official who spoke on condition of anonymity declined to 
predict senate passage of the nuclear missile treaty as a result of 
the progress in talks supervised by secretary of state george p 
shultz and soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze 
but he said it is still our expectation were going to get 
this resolved before president reagans visit to moscow may 29 
for a fourth summit meeting with mikhail s gorbachev 
the issues involving verification of the agreement to scrap all 
us and soviet intermediaterange missiles were taken up by two 
teams of negotiators headed by american maynard glitman and col 
gen nikolai chervov the senior arms control specialist on the 
soviet general staff 
four or five issues were tentatively resolved including two big 
hurdles the us official said one deals with us demands to 
inspect soviet missile containers big enough to hold only a stage 
of a rocket the other involves how much access us inspectors 
will have to soviet missile plants and bases 
nine verification problems surfaced in recent weeks in 
addition the soviets demanded the right to inspect west german 
pershing 1a missiles stored in the united states 
in another sign of progress the two sides agreed to exchange 
notes on futuristic weapons the aim is to persuade sen sam nunn 
dga the chairman of the senate armed services committee and 
other critics that the ban would apply to intermediaterange 
weapons that have not been developed yet 
shultz said earlier wednesday he could not guarantee senate 
approval of the treaty before the moscow summit 
i cant tell you what the senate is going to do shultz told 
reporters before his first meeting at the us mission with 
shevardnadze thats for the senate to decide but i think it 
would be a good thing to have ratification before the summit 
meeting 
on monday the senate indefinitely postponed debate on the 
treaty democratic and republican leaders said the soviet response 
to us complaints about restrictions on monitoring were inadequate 
sen robert c byrd of west virginia the democratic leader 
said we dont want to give the soviets loopholes to cheat 
state department officials were less critical but also urged the 
soviets to modify restraints they intended to impose on american 
monitors at missile plants 
shultz suggested that shevardnadze was as interested as he was 
in seeing the treaty ratified 
i am not going to try to characterize the disagreements the 
secretary said 
since nobody has ever done anything like this before its not 
surprising there are problems obviously we think were on the 
right track however we approach this in a problemsolving 
spirit 
gennady gerasimov the soviet foreign ministry spokesman said 
in an interview with the british broadcasting corp we think 
that we can iron out our differences they are not very big so 
we still hope and we think that the senate is going to ratify the 
treaty before the moscow summit 
the pact on intermediaterange missiles which reagan and 
gorbachev signed last december is unprecedented in its provisions 
for onsite inspection to guard against infractions 
it also is the first ussoviet agreement to eliminate an 
entire category of nuclear weapons 
under its provisions the soviets would destroy 683 missiles and 
the americans 364 all their rockets with ranges of 315 to 3125 
miles 
shultz had two sessions with shevardnadze on wednesday and two 
more scheduled for thursday the secretary of state will go to 
belgium friday to brief the north atlantic treaty organization and 
then fly home to report to reagan and the senate 
shultz and shevardnadze were also dealing with summit 
preparations and other issues such as human rights and the presence 
of cuban troops in marxistruled angola

a second luxury yacht seized for carrying tiny 
amounts of drugs remained in us customs custody wednesday as the 
crackdown under the new zero tolerance policy continued 
and a jetliner owned by colombias avianca airlines was seized 
wednesday following the investigation that began when cocaine was 
found aboard it 
the seizures come a day after the 25 million ark royal was 
allowed to sail away following payment of a fine 
the 600000 ms mindy a boat used to entertain customers of 
north miamis cigarette racing team was boarded monday as it 
returned from the bahamas and docked in port salerno 
a search by customs agents turned up cocaine residue on a dollar 
bill and traces of marijuana in a plastic bag 
its simply being detained and checked right now for 
narcotics and a determination will be made later whether to 
confiscate the ship customs spokesman michael sheehan said 
wednesday 
neither the ships captain lewis shaver nor his unidentified 
first mate who were the only people aboard the boat registered out 
of orange beach ala were charged with drug possession 
sheehan said the planes seizure also was consistent with zero 
tolerance 
the new tough policy allows the confiscation of a boat plane 
or other conveyance if it carries any amount of drugs no matter 
how small 
the planes seizure was based on a 358pound cocaine shipment 
found march 27 sheehan said adding that the delay was to allow 
for a full investigation 
avianca has a right to appeal the process by petitioning the 
government for release of the plane sheehan said 
since october 1986 customs has made 10 seizures aboard avianca 
planes many of them in flower shipments for a total of 1000 
pounds of cocaine 
the ark royal seized under the gettough rule was held for 
three days after the coast guard found some marijuana seeds and 
stems in a trash can and a drawer saturday 
but the 133foot vessel complete with hot tubs and a grand 
piano was released tuesday afternoon when michael rogerson 
president of the californiabased company that owns the boat paid 
a 1600 fine 
fewer than 10 percent of vessels seized by the government are 
ever returned to owners the ark royal was in that minority because 
its owner moved swiftly and filed a convincing petition customs 
officials said

nancy reagans stargazer hopes to keep her 
white house consulting link until the reagans return to california 
but says shes troubled by being in the spotlight and by the 
kooks in her business 
joan quigley so discreet about her work that one of her 
highsociety acquaintances said she didnt know anything about 
this astrology bit contends her role has been greatly 
exaggerated 
mrs reagan is a very able woman and is very nice to deal 
with quigley said she uses astrology constructively 
but after the reagans leave the white house next january 
theres no way shed sign up a subsequent president as a 
client quigley said in an interview 
after the end of this year i will never do anything connected 
with any us president or his wife or anybody again she said 
tuesday quigley has been besieged by reporters and photographers 
since sundays disclosure of her highlevel consultations 
the socialite and heiress author of three books on astrology 
was a regular guest on merv griffins television talk show from 
1973 to 1985 making astrological predictions she met mrs reagan 
through griffin a longtime friend of the reagans who shares a july 
6 birthday with the first lady 
but despite her television appearances quigley has largely 
evaded public scrutiny 
she is one of the few ive met astrologically who doesnt seek 
or want publicity said robert cooper executive secretary of the 
tempe arizbased american federation of astrologers he calls her 
wellversed in classical astrology 
quigley a phi beta kappa graduate of vassar college said she 
developed her interest in astrology from her mother and her disdain 
for sensationalism from her father the late john b quigley a 
prominent san francisco republican and hotelier his view of it as 
a bizarre profession caused her to keep her work secret early in 
her career 
the publicity of the past few days she said is very 
embarrassing to me 
ive been put in a terrible situation because im an ethical 
person and i dont talk about my clients but i had to come forward 
to show that i am a serious person with a scientific approach to 
astrology 
she declines to discuss her handful of clients but is quick to 
criticize pop astrologers and syndicated horoscope writers she 
regards as the kooks and charlatans of her profession 
how can it be possible that the same thing is happening to 
onetwelfth of the worlds population on a given day they give 
astrology a superstitious name quigley said 
quigley said she offered her services to the reagans in the 1980 
campaign then signed on as a consultant for an undisclosed fee in 
1981 after reagan was shot and mrs reagans concerns about his 
scheduling were heightened 
quigley said she has spoken with mrs reagan this week but would 
not reveal her reaction to the flap a spokeswoman for the first 
lady has said she will continue to use astrological portents in 
shaping the presidents schedule 
reagan according to the astrologer has a fabulous chart 
hes an aquarian and all our greatest presidents except for 
washington have been aquarians lincoln fdr and reagan she said

china has ended pork rationing according to 
chinese officials the agriculture department said wednesday 
a chinese agriculture official privately stated that pork 
rationing in beijing had stopped being enforced the departments 
foreign agricultural service said in a report other officials 
said that pork rationing had ended throughout the country though 
no official announcement has confirmed this 
china began rationing pork in most major cities last fall in 
response to shortages pork traditionally supplies about 80 percent 
of the total animal protein in the chinese diet 
the pork shortages that led to the rationing did not however 
affect chinas ability to supply hogs to its limited export markets 
primarily hong kong the report said in fact the country 
has had a surplus of hogs for export to hong kong but increases in 
hog trade between the two countries have been limited by a chinese 
export quota 
the report said an end to rationing shows that chinese 
agricultural officials believe the tight pork supply situation is 
now being resolved as producers respond to lower feed prices 
higher pork prices and government incentives to promote larger 
production 
it also is an indication that many urban consumers are willing 
to pay more for the higherquality free market pork instead of 
enduring the cheaper fattier meat that has been sold at lower 
prices in state markets the report said

underground leaders in the occupied lands urged 
palestinians on wednesday to burn the earth with fire and anger 
in continued rebellion 
defense minister yitzhak rabin said the uprising has the same 
goals as palestinian terror organizations and declared that 
terror must be met by force 
doctors at ramallah hospital in the west bank said a 19yearold 
arab died of gunshot wounds suffered in a clash with israeli 
soldiers last month in a village near bethlehem 
an army spokesman said reports of the death were being 
investigated it would bring to at least 186 the number of 
palestinians killed in the israelioccupied west bank and gaza 
strip since palestinian riots began dec 8 
instructions for more arab strikes boycotts and other 
resistance appeared in a new underground leaflet it was 
distributed as soldiers rounded up at least 11 journalists and 
other community leaders in overnight raids 
lets burn the earth with fire and anger under the feet of the 
occupation the leaflet said painful blows should be inflicted 
against the occupation soldiers and policemen and the 
collaborators 
the bulletin was the 16th from the united leadership of the 
uprising in five months of rebellion among the 15 million 
palestinians in the occupied territories which israel captured 
from jordan and egypt in the 1967 war 
it said the leadership calls for a complete boycott of the 
zionists and asks the people to ready themselves for civil 
disobedience by storing food in houses enough for at least a 
month 
police spokesman alex lapidoth in jerusalem said more than 2000 
extra officers were ordered deployed in the holy city from thursday 
through early next week 
he said they were needed to handle anticipated arab protests 
this weekend at the end of the moslem feast of ramadan and on 
sunday jerusalem day when israelis celebrate the 21st anniversary 
of citys reunification 
the leaflet ordered demonstrations on friday the moslem sabbath 
a day of anger and general strike sunday and a march by 
teachers to protest the closing of palestinian schools 
rabin told a meeting of bnai brith leaders from around the 
world the uprising has the same political goals that the 
palestinian terror organizations try to achieve by terror and 
atrocities 
terror must be met by force he said any giving in to 
violence will invite more violence terror and the increasing 
danger of war 
he defended the use of force to put down the revolt saying 
soldiers and police acted within the limits of israeli law 
i know that you have seen television day and night all the 
stories of confrontation between civilians and the military he 
said i will not deny it this is what we have to do 
in the west bank village of qabatiyeh 47 palestinians were 
charged with manslaughter in the lynching death of an arab man 
accused of collaborating with israeli authorities israel radio 
reported 
mohammed id sakanda was dragged from his home and hanged from an 
electricity pole in february 
israeli soldiers closed the main vegetable market in hebron and 
used loudspeakers to order merchants there and in other towns to 
keep their shops closed in the morning when leaders of the 
uprising have told them to open 
a struggle between the army and palestinian leadership over when 
stores will close and open has continued for months

the occupational safety and health 
administration imposed a 31 million fine wednesday against ibp 
inc for requiring employees at its dakota city neb meatpacking 
plant to do such repetitive work that their health was endangered 
the fine is the second largest osha has ever imposed against an 
individual company the only bigger fine 42 million was 
levied against bath iron works in bath maine in november 1987 
said osha spokesman terry mikelson 
mikelson said inspectors and a specially hired expert in 
ergonomics found a significant occurrence of repetitive motion 
injuries among workers at the plant the agency maintains that ibp 
could have taken numerous steps to reduce the risk of such 
injuries but did not 
osha deputy assistant secretary frank white said the injuries 
are a major health hazard in one of the most dangerous 
occupations in the country and we want the meatpacking industry 
in general and ibp in particular to eliminate the problem 
ibp has known about the high toll that these disorders have 
had on its work force but has chosen not to deal with it white 
said 
ibp a subsidiary of occidental petroleum co has 15 working 
days to contest the fine the company already is contesting a 26 
million fine levied by osha last july for safety and record 
violations at the dakota city plant 
in a statement issued late wednesday ibp officials said the 
citation represents a misguided attempt by osha to force the 
meatpacking industry to blindly accept untested theories about the 
prevention of repetitive motion disorders 
oshas goal is to intimidate companies by threatening enormous 
penalties unless they accept alice in wonderland theories the 
statement said 
the company said that it has urged osha to develop a special 
program for the meatpacking industry but osha has not done that 
al zack a spokesman for united food and commercial workers 
union said he was pleased with oshas action and its 
recommendations for changes in working conditions at the plant 
there are very simple ways of preventing injuries zack 
said and its better to prevent the injuries than fining the 
employer afterward it would be far preferable if ibp would stop 
denying there is a problem and start working on solutions 
mikelson of osha said the history of the latest fine dates back 
to november 1987 when safety inspectors from the agency noticed 
a pattern of repetitive motion injuries a sometimes crippling 
injury caused by repeated hand wrist and arm motion 
as a result of that finding mikelson said osha expanded its 
inspection to healthrelated issues and hired an expert in 
ergonomics david cochran of the university of nebraska at 
lincoln to do more extensive studies 
what the studies found mikelson said was that 620 workers at 
45 work stations at the dakota city plant were at grave risk of 
developing repetitive motion illnesses of those 377 workers 
actually had developed the illness mikelson said some of those 
required surgery to correct some are on restricted work schedules 
and some are on permanent disability leaves he said 
the affected employees work on the production lines doing such 
work as cutting trimming hide removal and lifting meat with 
hooks mikelson said 
osha maintains that ibp should have done such things as changing 
the design of knives educating workers about the need to change 
positions periodically and slowing its production line 
much of this particular situation is connected with a speedup 
of the production line mikelson said 
the 31 million fine represents a 5000 penalty for each of 
the 620 workers mikelson estimated that a total of 3000 people 
work at the dakota city plant one of 15 ibp plants 
osha began investigating ibp in the winter of 1986 after 
receiving a worker complaint about conditions at the dakota city 
plant a preliminary investigation showed that ibps records showed 
an unusually low occurrence of worker injuries and illnesses 
mikelson said 
osha then launched a more extensive investigation which 
resulted in the 26 million fine for underreporting injuries and 
illnesses at the plant 
at the time when osha was beginning its first investigation ibp 
and workers at the plant were engaged in a bitter lockout that 
turned into a strike the sevenmonth strike by the united food and 
commercial workers union ended last july

pat robertson announced wednesday that he 
would halt his republican presidential race next week and said in 
a newspaper inerview that he will likely return to his financially 
ailing christian broadcasting network 
barbara gattullo a spokeswoman for americans for robertson 
said the decision to return to cbn is not set in stone but the 
important thing is whether or not he returns to cbn he will 
continue to be involved in politics 
she said robertson would file papers shortly with the federal 
election commission for a new political action committee 
americans for the republic 
robertson himself speaking to reporters outside the white 
house endorsed vice president george bush who already had the gop 
nomination well in hand 
the former television evangelist said he would formally withdraw 
from the race monday 
i will be making that official on monday as a candidate 
because the race now is over and the people that i wanted to bring 
through the process are pretty much home now in relation to their 
races he responded when asked if he were withdrawing 
but an aide richard pinsky later described robertsons planned 
move as a suspension rather than a withdrawal 
asked whether he would be releasing his delegates robertson 
responded well of course i will be releasing them 
many of them were not really bound to me because in the 
caucuses it has to do with their own preferences however the 
procedures go on the first ballot we want to make sure that 
theres a unanimous vote for george bush robertson told 
reporters 
pinsky later said robertson would release the delegates but not 
immediately 
meanwhile in an interview published in the virginianpilot amp 
the ledgerstar of norfolk robertson said he likely would return 
to the christian broadcasting network which he founded nearly 30 
years ago as chief executive officer a job his son now holds 
i dont have a comment to make said cbn spokesman benton 
miller none of the staff or i have been provided any 
information by him at this point concerning what his future plans 
are 
since 1967 robertson had coanchored the 700 club program 
that is the heart of the network in terms of viewership and fund 
raising he left the program in 1986 to organize his presidential 
campaign and in september 1987 resigned both as the networks 
chief executive officer and as a pastor in the southern baptist 
church to run for office 
the network quickly reported a big drop in revenue and began 
laying off personnel at the time spokesmen refused to blame 
robertsons political ambitions for the shortfall 
in march cbn announced it faced a deficit of 500000 for the 
month and sent out pleas for more donations 
i did not realize that my personal presence on the 700 club 
was as important as it is to the audience robertson told the 
newspaper 
his return was seen as both a political and economic necessity 
by several experts 
he needs to shore up his base said one larry sabato a 
university of virginia political scientist and longtime robertson 
watcher this campaign in the later stages has been injurious to 
that base such severe setbacks as he has suffered have shaken even 
his staunchest supporters 
robertson who has spent over 22 million on his campaign has 
but 46 delegates to the national convention while bush has more 
than 1300 robertson finished third to bush and sen bob dole in 
most of the early primaries 
ms gattullo said the new political action committee will raise 
money and train conservative christians who want to become involved 
in the political process the staff of americans for robertson 
would switch to the new pac keeping the same offices in virginia 
she said 
the new pac has a purpose similar in some ways to robertsons 
nowdefunct freedom council which had taxexempt status before it 
folded in 1986 after americans for robertson was incorporated 
critics challenged the council as being merely a front for 
robertsons thenundeclared campaign and it is being investigated 
along with cbn and americans for robertson by the internal revenue 
service 
unlike the council americans for the republic will actively 
support candidates ms gattullo said

the pilots of aloha flight 243 knew they had 
problems as they tried to land their plane with a large section of 
its cabin wall and ceiling torn away but for a time they thought 
their predicament was even worse it was revealed wednesday 
according to a tape of radio communications from the crippled 
boeing 737 the pilots were certain as they approached the airport 
on the island of maui that the nose landing gear had failed to 
deploy 
this would have made landing the severely damaged aircraft 
especially dangerous according to aviation experts 
be advised we have no nose gear we are landing without a nose 
gear copilot madeline mimi tompkins told the maui airport 
tower in a strained but controlled voice as capt robert 
schornstheimer struggled to keep the aircraft aloft 
well need all the emergency equipment you got she 
continued although giving little hint as to how serious flight 
243s predicament really was last april 28 in the skies above 
hawaii 
only seconds before the plane landed on the runway did the 
controller tell the pilots the landing gear actually was deployed 
they possibly had been misled by a false instrument reading 
the tape was played wednesday by the federal aviation 
administration the same day that schornstheimer and tompkins were 
honored by the air line pilots association for their heroics they 
met with vice president george bush on tuesday 
schornstheimer told the pilots group that training and teamwork 
allowed him and ms tompkins to stay calm and fly the airplane 
as they rapidly descended from 24000 feet to a safe landing with a 
20foot section of the cabin exposed to the sky one engine out and 
another engine damaged by flying debris 
a flight attendant was swept to her death during the flight 
the two pilots were presented the superior airmanship award from 
the 40000member pilots union for landing the plane safely without 
any additional casualties 
the faa tape provided little hint of the drama that was 
unfolding aboard the aircraft the plane was just approaching the 
south coast of maui when the first word of trouble aboard the plane 
reached the control tower 
maui tower aloah 243 were inbound for a landing ms 
tompkins advised matter of factly 
after providing the planes position she added we are 
unpressurized declaring an emergency 
the tower directed another plane away from the runway and 
advised that flight 243 had a clear straight approach and 
emergency vehicles would be waiting 
while schornstheimer flew the plane ms tompkins handled the 
radio while they must have been aware of the huge missing section 
of the cabin wall and ceiling they never suggested the extent of 
the planes damage to the control tower during the 10 minute and 18 
second descent and landing 
faa spokesman fred farrar suggested that the controller had no 
need to know the information and the crew probably was busy 
otherwise 
ms tompkins at one point advised there were injuries on board 
how many 
we have no idea we cannot communicate with our flight 
attendants she replied the strain in her voice now showing 
muffled noise could be heard in the background as the wind 
whipped through the cockpit its door torn off by the rapid 
depressurization the pilots later explained they had to resort to 
hand signals to communicate 
as schornstheimer struggled to keep the plane flying on a direct 
path to the maui airport ms tompkins advised that the cockpit 
instruments indicated the nose landing gear had not deployed 
two minutes later there came good news 
just for your information the gear appears down the gear 
appears down the tower informed flight 243 seconds before it 
landed 
aloha 243 just shut it down where you are everythings fine 
the fire trucks are on the way the controller then said 
during the alpa ceremony schornstheimer said what seemed 
like a short time to mimi and i because of our busy cockpit duties 
must have seemed like an eternity to our passengers and flight 
attendants 
ms tompkins praised the captain an 11year veteran of aloha 
bob analyzed the situation confronting us and he reacted 
she said all of his decisions were the right ones 
despite the experience she said she was eager to return to the 
cockpit im looking forward to going back to hawaii and flying 
again

the house cast aside president reagans 
objections wednesday and passed a defense department budget bill 
that restricts his arms control policies and star wars programs 
the 252172 decision in the democraticcontrolled chamber went 
largely along party lines 
the bill will eventually be sent to a conference committee to be 
reconciled with the different pentagon budget measure now on the 
senate floor 
the senate meanwhile voted wednesday for a 455 billion star 
wars budget narrowly rejecting a move to cut deeply into reagans 
cherished antimissile research program 
the house bill authorizes the pentagon to spend 2995 billion 
in the fiscal year starting oct 1 the same total as the senate 
plan and the amount reagan approved last december in an agreement 
with congressional leaders aimed at reducing federal budget 
deficits the current budget is about 299 billion 
but the house added a ban on any star wars tests that violate 
the socalled narrow interpretation of the 1972 antiballistic 
missile treaty and also voted against buying any nuclear weapons 
that violate the numerical limits in the unratified 1979 salt ii 
nuclear arms treaty 
the senate by a 5145 margin voted wednesday afternoon to kill 
a provision in that chambers bill that would also ban weapons 
beyond the salt ii limits 
the house also added a directive telling reagan to order the 
military into the fight against illegal drug smuggling the senate 
is likely to consider a similar proposal 
reagan opposes both arms restrictions and is also unhappy with 
the 35 billion approved by the house for the strategic defense 
initiative as star wars is formally known 
reagan had wanted 48 billion for star wars next year compared 
with the current sdi budget of 39 billion 
in a letter to the house reagan said he was deeply 
disappointed by the chambers actions and said the restrictions 
would seriously undermine our position in negotiations with the 
soviet union and would hold back the progress of the strategic 
defense initiative 
reagan said he wants progress in nuclear arms control but 
added we cannot do it alone it is time for the house to step up 
to these responsibilities and pass a defense authorization bill 
that will strengthen our security 
but rep les aspin dwis chairman of the house armed services 
committee said i dont believe the president has any reason to 
be upset i think its a good bill we gave the president a lot of 
what he wanted 
hours before the final house vote the senate voted 5048 
against a deep reduction in star wars 
the senate defeated a proposal by sen bennett johnston dla 
to reduce the sdi budget to about 38 billion and devote the extra 
750 million to the space shuttle and a space station 
johnstons loss was similar to his defeats in each of the past 
two years when he failed by a single vote to slash the sdi budget 
last year vice president george bush cast the tiebreaking vote in 
his role as the senates presiding officer 
congress has consistently scaled back reagans annual requests 
for sharp increases in spending for the 5yearold program sdi 
program 
defense secretary frank c carlucci has said he would recommend 
a reagan veto of the entire pentagon budget bill unless congress 
votes enough money for star wars 
johnston argued that its going to be very very difficult to 
get that space station going unless we give it some more money 
whats the higher priority here the space station and the shuttle 
or sdi the space station has a lot of defense implications 
dollars are scarce 
but sen john warner rva said johnstons proposal would be 
very detrimental to the defense budget 
originally sen william proxmire dwis simply proposed 
reducing the proposed sdi budget from 46 billion to 39 billion 
but that lost on a 6629 vote 
while the house measure restricts reagans arms control policies 
and star wars it granted reagans request for spending for a vast 
variety of weapons 
that total includes 180 f16 jet fighter planes 84 fa18 jets 
42 f15 jets a dozen f14 jets three new navy destroyers two 
more attack submarines one trident missilefiring sub the first 
of the new seawolf class subs and 611 m1 tanks

queen margrethe ii turned the 
struggle to form a new danish government into a battle royal on 
wednesday when she named a neutral politician to lead coalition 
negotiations 
her unexpected choice of svend jakobsen parliaments chairman 
since 1981 upset prime minister poul schlueters hopes to quickly 
reassemble his coalition of four centerright parties following 
parliamentary elections on tuesday 
normally the chief negotiator called the royal 
investigator is the person most likely to become prime minister 
but jakobsen 53 has said he does not want the job of prime 
minister 
the pronato schlueter gambled on an early election after 
failing to stop a resolution in parliament last month which 
tightened enforcement of denmarks peacetime ban on nuclear 
weapons a measure seen as a threat to nato strategy 
election analysts said elections tuesday for the 179member 
folketing or parliament showed a modest shift to the right and 
strengthened the parties giving the western alliance unqualified 
support 
but the inconclusive results left the political field open to 
both the government and the socialist opposition bloc to woo the 
socialliberal party which holds the balance of power 
the issue of denmarks relations with nato faded in the 
political confusion and uncertainty 
margrethe assigned jakobsen to discuss a national policy agenda 
with the eight parties in the folketing as a prelude to formation 
of a governing coalition 
emerging from amalienborg palace jakobsen pledged to strive 
to be totally neutral in searching for a government program 
supported by a broad majority 
jakobsen was nominated by the socialist opposition to block 
schlueter from the position jakobsen won the backing of the 
socialliberals 
schlueter submitted his resignation to the queen earlier 
wednesday a formal step to launch coalition jockeying the monarch 
then held consultations with all the party leaders 
after a second meeting with the queen in seven hours schlueter 
said a majority supported jakobsen to conduct the political talks 
although he said he had strong reservations about using the 
office of parliamentary chairman in this political game 
jakobsen is a former finance minister in a social democratic 
government but his present position in the legislature is supposed 
to be above partisan politics 
jakobsen told reporters he would begin separate meetings with 
the parties on thursday 
earlier schlueter said the first aim of negotiations should be 
to resolve the row which led to the election the first vote in 
four decades to be fought on a foreign policy issue 
he indicated he wants to revise the resolution which requires 
the government to advise each visiting warship that nuclear weapons 
are barred from danish ports 
britain and the united states say the resolution undermines 
their standing refusal to confirm or deny the presence of nuclear 
arms on military vessels 
white house spokesman roman popadiuk said in washington 
wednesday that once a new danish government is formed the united 
states will discuss with it the controversy over nucleararmed 
ships in danish waters 
we have always had an excellent relationship with the 
government of denmark and expect that relationship will continue 
with the new government once it is formed he said 
in the election schlueters fourparty coalition won 70 seats 
the same number it held before and the social democratic and the 
socialist peoples parties lost two for a total of 79 
socialliberals dropped one seat and have 10 in the new chamber

1030 am between the mainstream amal militia backed by syria 
and proiranian hezbollah

days and the iranian embassy said presidents hafez assad of syria 
and aly khamenei of iran were forming a fourman committee to 
enforce a final ceasefire 
an embassy statement said assad and khamenei reached agreement 
by telephone on a ceasefire to begin at 11 pm 4 pm edt and 
deployment of truce observers another lull in the fighting 
occurred after the truce deadline

have fled those remaining huddled in basements and bomb shelters 
witnesses reported fires burning out of control snipers 
shooting from rooftops at moving vehicles ambulances under attack 
as they tried to pick wounded from the streets 
hospitals appealed for blood donations the sahel hospital 
closest to the battle zone told rescuers through moslemrun voice

with the flood of casualties 
ap photographer ali mohammed in the ghobeiri neighborhood 
heard a woman shout through the shellfire there is a wounded man 
here he is dying help us please take us out of here

which most of the 18 foreigners missing in lebanon are believed

to the radical hezbollah there has been no word on the fate of the 
captives who include nine americans 
brig gen ghazi kenaan syrias military intelligence chief in 
lebanon said if the bloodletting continues we will have no 
other option but to respond to the pleas of the population and end 
their ordeal his statement was broadcast before the latest truce

civil war was the nations undisputed power broker until iran 
began challenging its influence 
syria sent 7500 of the soldiers into moslem west beirut in

and walid jumblatts druse militia the syrians drove hezbollah 
from some west beirut strongholds but has not entered the southern 
slums 
salim hoss lebanons acting prime minister accused militia 
leaders of providing criminals with the means of killing and 
destruction that burn a safe area

against humanity in south beirut and urge them to order a 
ceasefire before it is too late he said in a statement 
a slum resident in a telephone call to the voice of the nation 
said they are destroying our homes they are killing our 
children they militias claim they want to protect us but we 
need to be protected from them 
theyve done worse than israel did to us in the 1982 
invasion he said we dont have water power or food and we 
dont know where to go 
a police spokesman said amal forces led by tanks had dislodged 
hezbollah fighters from several areas on the western edge of the 
slum abutting the airport and hezbollah overran the main amal 
base east of the airport highway 
police said amal brought 2500 fighters from south lebanon 
during the tuesday truce to reinforce its 4000 men in south 
beirut hezbollahs fighting strength in the area is estimated at 
3000

navy officials said wednesday they are weighing a 
request from two washington state congressmen to investigate a 
string of six crashes of the a6 attack bomber that killed 10 
people in the last year and a half 
at least four of the crashes occurred during training runs and 
all involved bombers from the whidbey island naval air station 
north of seattle

scientists said wednesday that soviets 
still suffer psychological scars from the chernobyl nuclear 
disaster more than two years after it took place 
soviet and western scientists could reach no consensus on the 
number of deaths that eventually may be linked to the explosion and 
fire that destroyed the no 4 reactor at the chernobyl power plant 
on april 26 1986 
an american doctor said cases of leukemia may begin to appear in 
one to three years a soviet scientist said the number of voluntary 
abortions in areas of byelorussia near the plant increased 20 
percent in the months after the accident 
at least 31 people were killed at the plant 80 miles north of 
kiev capital of the soviet ukraine a huge cloud of invisible 
radiation spread over europe and eventually worked its way around 
the world 
wednesday was the first day of three days devoted to a 
conference on medical consequences of the disaster it brought more 
than 160 soviet scientists together with delegates from 24 foreign 
countries 
the accident was very severe but the wounds are healing 
said hans blix general director of the international atomic energy 
agency he said nuclear plants remain a feasible source of 
electricity despite the accident 
yevgeny chazov the soviet health minister said in an opening 
statement soviet scientists have no reason to conceal anything 
about the accident 
several soviet delegates said the nation must combat what they 
called radiophobia an unreasonable fear of nuclear power 
oles pyatak deputy director of the soviet center for radiation 
medicine said scientists had noted increases in tension and 
intestinal disorders attributable to stress and the unwillingness 
of some couples to have children viktor knizhnikov who heads a 
radiationsafety laboratory said rumors arose periodically about 
the chernobyl plant leaking radiation again reports in the 
official press have said public opposition halted construction of 
nuclear plants near odessa in the southern ukraine the 
byelorussian capital of minsk and krasnodar in southern russia 
knizhnikov told reporters of a 20 percent increase in voluntary 
abortions in areas of byelorussia just north of chernobyl following 
the accident 
he said there was no evidence of an increase in spontaneous 
abortions or birth defects and virtually no chance any children 
would have been born deformed 
the high rate of abortions continued through 1986 but the number 
then returned to normal he said 
specialists have said the disaster could add 30000 cancer 
deaths to the 600 million expected in the next 50 years said 
robert gale an american doctor who helped treat the worst cases of 
radiation sickness 
half the extra cases would be in the soviet union 40 percent in 
the rest of europe and the remaining 10 percent in north america 
and asia he said 
gale emphasized that the figures were estimates and said my 
own feeling is that they may be on the high side maybe by a factor 
of 10 
an increase in leukemia also might be noticeable in one to three 
years among the 135000 people who were evacuated from an 18mile 
zone around the plant gale said 
an extra 100 cases would be significant and easily detectable 
he said and one may be able to precisely identify the cases 
caused by radiation 
some other american doctors disputed that 
fred mettler a radiologist and specialist in nuclear medicine 
at the university of new mexico said there is no way to determine 
the cause of a particular case of cancer 
because of a lack of information about how much and what kinds 
of radiation people were exposed to firm conclusions about the 
medical effects would be difficult to reach he said 
soviet officials said they had not been prepared to deal with 
the chernobyl accident and did not have enough trained workers or 
reliable equipment to monitor the radiation 
the accident was not even reported until three days after it 
happened when sweden detected high radiation levels and demanded 
an explanation 
their western colleagues said the soviets have done a good job 
since 
officials of the international atomic energy agency said 
modifications of soviet nuclear plants now under way would prevent 
another accident of the chernobyl type

indictment is serving a sentence for harboring ms buck when she 
was a fugitive wanted for the brinks heist evans also was

set off the bomb in the capitol 
after the bombing a communique was mailed to national public 
radio in washington and a local public radio station wamu that 
said we purposely aimed our attack at the institutions of 
imperialist rule rather than at individual members of the ruling 
class we did not choose to kill any of them this time but their 
lives are not sacred the indictment said 
credit was also claimed in communiques or calls to news 
organizations for the other bombings to dramatize the groups 
political goals the indictment said 
in his statement stephens said the defendants were charged with 
being part of a secret organization which described itself as a 
communist politicomilitary organization and which operated under 
the names revolutionary fighting group armed resistance unit and

and training exercises for the bombing missions the indictment 
charged 
whitehorn evans and buck were charged with conspiracy while 
all seven defendants were charged with malicious destruction of 
property in connection with the bombings of the capitol and the 
three washington military facilities 
let this be a warning to those who seek to influence the 
policies of the united states government through violence and 
terrorism that we will seek unrelentingly to bring them to

the president of the motion picture 
association of america urged congress on wednesday to rein in some 
of the cable television industrys power to control the 
entertainment marketplace 
but leaders of the cable tv industry dismissed the movie 
industrys concerns and rejected charges that cable tv has become 
an unregulated monopoly 
at a hearing marked by a few lively exchanges mpaa president 
jack valenti sparred with ted turner president of turner 
broadcasting system and john malone president of 
telecommunications inc the nations largest cable company 
cable is no longer a babe in swaddling clothes valenti told 
members of the house energy and commerce subcommittee on 
telecommunications which is looking into the effects of cable 
deregulation 
cable tv he said has grown into a multibilliondollar industry 
dominated by several large companies 
consumers are held hostage by their cable system they have no 
alternative they can either commit suicide or go bowling said 
valenti who represents the major hollywood studios and independent 
producers 
malone and turner defended their industry saying it has brought 
more than 50 basic channels and more than a dozen pay channels to 
television viewers in more than half the country 
before cable we had the three big networks and they dominated 
what people saw now there are the three networks and more than 50 
cable channels turner said 
more than 80 percent of americas tv households can receive 
cable and about 52 percent of all households subscribe the steady 
increase in cable subscribership and in the amount of 
cableexclusive programming has cut into the audience of the 
broadcast networks and the receipts of movie theaters 
edward o fritts president of the national association of 
broadcasters said the cable industry has become the mouse that 
roared able to raise rates at will and decide what broadcast 
signals to carry 
fritts urged congress to pass a law requiring cable companies to 
carry local broadcast signals and prohibit cable companies from 
showing any syndicated program for which a local broadcaster has 
purchased exclusive rights 
as cables clout has grown it has been winning contracts away 
from the broadcast networks to carry more and more major sports 
events and rep dennis eckart dohio wondered whether in the 
future average sports fans will have to subscribe to cable to watch 
their home teams play 
malone suggested that while congress could pass a law to protect 
broadcast coverage of sports events it would be more prudent to 
wait to see what the free market does 
malone disputed valentis claim that cable tv is a monopoly for 
movies he said consumers can go to the theater rent video 
cassettes or watch them on the broadcast networks 
malone also defended the investment his company and other large 
cable companies have made in industry programming ventures saying 
that without this investment many of these channels would have gone 
out of business he 
cable companies helped shore up the discovery channel and 
turners enterprise 
valenti however said such investments give cable companies 
incentive to carry on their systems the services in which they have 
an equity stake denying viewers other programming choices 
these monopolies can decide what the consumer is going to 
see valenti said

the city of east st louis endangers its 
police force by failing to equip officers properly a prosecutor 
said wednesday at the opening of a trial on criminal charges of 
reckless conduct against the city 
but mayor carl officer countered in afternoon testimony i 
know of no officer of the east st louis police department required 
to go to work if they felt their safety was endangered 
the mississippi river city plagued by unemployment crime and a 
growing municipal debt is accused of failing to supply its 
sevenmember patrol force with properly working radios and cars 
officials said it was the first illinois city to be tried on 
criminal charges convictions would carry fines of 1000 on each 
of nine misdemeanor counts filed feb 22 by the st clair county 
states attorney 
states attorney john baricevic told circuit judge robert 
lechien that some police had bought their own radios and that 
detectives had used their own cars 
the city was aware of the situation and recklessly ignored 
it baricevic said the city had the money to correct the problems 
but failed to do so he said he said he planned to call about 30 
witnesses 
the mayor testified the policeradio problems were routine 
they are mechanical equipment they are manmade they break 
down he said he contended some of the vehicle problems were due 
to abuse by the police 
east st louis city attorney sam ross contended wednesday that 
there were no local state or federal regulations saying 
municipalities must provide officers with radios 
officer ray waggaman a 16year east st louis police veteran 
testified that he felt endangered by problems with the radios and 
cars 
waggaman said he bought his own portable radio in 1983 because 
the police radio did not transmit or receive properly he said he 
was not reimbursed 
waggaman said he informed his shift commander repeatedly of the 
problems which included cars with bald tires and low oil and 
without spotlights 
during cross examination ross said there were no regulations to 
define what a properly equipped vehicle was 
its a luxury is it not ross asked waggaman referring to 
the radios its for the convenience of the officer 
waggaman said he knew of no regulations governing the equipment 
roosevelt malone a former alderman and former chairman of the 
city councils public safety committee testified that police chief 
isadore chambers told the panel on numerous occasions that new 
police equipment was needed 
chambers has said that while the force has six radios for its 
patrol cars he often had as many as seven uniformed officers on 
the streets when a seventh officer is available two members of 
the force must share a car so both have access to a radio 
east st louis once a thriving industrial city became one of 
the nations poorest with the decline of the industries and the 
exodus of whites in the 1960s 
sixtyone percent of the citys 55000 residents receive some 
kind of public assistance and about 40 percent of its citizens are 
unemployed 
officials say the citys financial problems show no sign of 
subsiding it recently reached a 4 million settlement with a man 
seriously beaten by another inmate in the city jail in 1985

a biologist said wednesday that a newly 
discovered herpes virus spread by casual contact might be a sixth 
cancercausing virus and appears to work with the aids virus in 
wiping out the immune system of aids victims 
robert gallo the national cancer institutes chief of 
tumorcell biology said more evidence was needed before the highly 
contagious herpes 6 or human blymphocyte virus could be blamed 
for causing certain types of cancers 
gallo spoke at the annual meeting of the american society for 
microbiology which convened here sunday 
researchers have found a high prevalence of antibodies to the 
herpes 6 virus in people with hodgkins disease burkitts 
lymphoma nonhodgkins lymphoma and childhood acute leukemia 
gallo said 
one could argue the virus must be playing a role to be 
detected so readily in those tumors gallo said 
currently five other viruses are believed to cause cancer they 
are hepatitis b which can cause liver cancer epsteinbarr which 
can cause nasopharyngeal cancer htlv which can cause leukemia 
papillomavirus which may cause cervical cancer and 
cytomegalovirus linked to prostate cancer 
the herpes 6 virus also has been found alongside the aids virus 
in t4 cells which mastermind the immune system and are the prime 
target of acquired immune deficiency syndrome gallo said 
since the aids virus kills only a small percentage of t4 cells 
at a time gallo said the new herpes virus might explain the total 
annihilation of t4 cells in aids patients 
tests to detect herpes 6 have differed widely on its prevalence 
in the united states one test indicated that it is carried by 
between 5 percent and 30 percent of the population another 
indicated between 70 percent and 90 percent

jurors who convicted a woman of killing two 
people with cyanidelaced excedrin capsules will return to court 
friday for a hearing on allegations of jury tampering a judge 
ruled wednesday 
us district judge william dwyer granted a request to question 
the 12 jurors by defense attorney thomas hillier ii who cited an 
anonymous telephone call allegedly received by a juror during 
deliberations 
the jury monday convicted stella nickell 44 of killing her 
husband bruce nickell 52 and susan katherine snow 40 both had 
swallowed extrastrength excedrin capsules containing cyanide in 
1986 
dwyer said the court by law must look into any allegations of 
jury tampering but he emphasized that in ordering the hearing he 
was not suggesting in the slightest any misconduct by any juror 
he invited hillier and assistant us attorney joanne maida to 
submit questions to him dwyer said he would question jurors 
himself under oath 
laurel holliday a juror had told the judge before the verdict 
that a female caller told her mrs nickell had failed a lie 
detector test information that had not been allowed as evidence in 
the threeweek trial 
the judge let ms holliday stay on the jury after she said the 
call would not influence her hillier concurred with that decision 
at the time 
ms maida on wednesday argued against the need for questioning 
saying any inference of misconduct was pure speculation 
mrs nickell faces a maximum penalty of life in prison at 
sentencing june 17

lech walesa said wednesday a nineday 
shipyard strike failed because it lacked nationwide support but 
if necessary we will try again the government said it did not 
plan to punish the strikers 
parliament enacted a law giving the government special powers to 
speed its program of economic reform which inspired more than two 
weeks of strikes the law retained the right of official trade 
unions to strike 
strikers at the lenin shipyard where walesa is an electrician 
sought recognition of a local chapter of solidarity which was 
outlawed after the declaration of martial law in december 1981 
about 1000 workers who had occupied the yard without working 
the method strikers use in poland marching out tuesday behind 
walesa ending the job action 
walesa founded solidarity the first independent labor 
federation in the soviet bloc during a summer of labor turmoil 
that followed price increases in 1980 
wednesday was polands first strikefree day since april 24 the 
labor unrest involving six major strikes was the worst since the 
martial law crackdown on solidarity 
a major impetus for the strikes was the reduction or removal of 
government subsidies which increased prices of necessities an 
average of 42 percent in the first three months of 1988 strikers 
demanded pay raises of up to 60 percent and some were granted 
premier zbigniew messner referred to the strikes and to 
protests at several universities when he introduced the special 
powers act in parliament 
he linked the unrest in part to dissatisfaction with the pace of 
economic reform and declared a decided section of the nation 
displayed a praiseworthy sense of responsibility by not 
striking 
the government knows many groups of the population still live 
poorly but none of the existing conflicts or any of the key social 
and economic issues will be resolved by resorting to illegal 
strikes messner said 
parliament passed the bill 3820 with two abstentions it gives 
the government the right to take over enterprises or fire managers 
who resist attempts to change the economic system it also lets the 
government intervene in setting prices and wages 
it did not include a provision in an earlier draft that would 
have abolished for this year the already limited right of official 
unions to strike 
the law is intended to counteract bureaucratic resistance to 
economic reforms make wages and prices more realistic reduce 
centralized controls increase competition and foster private and 
managerial enterprise 
walesa 44 said stopping the strike showed our strength as 
well as our helplessness 
lack of support from the rest of the country hurt the strike 
said walesa who won the nobel peace prize in 1983 
at times we were paralyzed because there were so few of us 
he said if there are people who think we lost it is because we 
still lack solidarity among workers nationwide 
addressing reporters at st brygidas church near the shipyard 
he said if necessary we will try again nothing ended nothing 
is finished 
he said the 15member shipyard strike committee that held five 
rounds of negotiations with management would not be dissolved 
government spokesman jerzy urban told the associated press by 
telephone the decision to give up the strike was judicious and 
so eloquent that it requires no comment whatsoever 
asked what the government planned to do to the strikers he 
said i can declare on behalf of the government that our policy 
will be a positively nonrepressive policy 
urban said he was making the statement in principle and could 
not guarantee the policy would encompass all the possible cases 
some shipyard supervisors were back on the job wednesday and 
officials said normal work would resume thursday walesa said he 
was telephoned at home and asked why he was not at work and replied 
that he didnt know he was supposed to be 
referring to his pledge during the strike to be the last to 
leave the yard walesa told the journalists i said i would leave 
as the last one maybe i will go back as the last one too maybe 
ill ask for a vacation 
a commentary by the official news agency pap said the end of the 
strike showed the myth about solidaritys might has fallen but 
strike committee chairman alojzy szablewski took this view 
when the strikers were leaving the yard i could see 
solidaritys revival

president reagan gave george bushs 
presidential bid his longawaited endorsement wednesday night 
saying i intend to campaign as as hard as i can for his vice 
president 
reagans endorsement delivered at a 1500aplate republican 
fundraising dinner came hours after bush won the support of his 
only remaining presidential rival pat robertson 
although the presidents backing was never in doubt reagan as 
titular head of the party remained officially neutral while the gop 
race was contested even though bush clinched the nomination two 
weeks ago 
reagan told his audience of 3000 republicans i intend to 
campaign as hard as i can my candidate is a former member of 
congress ambassador to china ambassador to the united nations 
director of the cia and national chairman of the republican party 
im going to work as hard as i can to make vice president 
george bush the next president of the united states 
in endorsing bush reagan said he was breaking a silence ive 
maintained for some time with regard to the presidential 
candidates 
the presidents terse endorsment came at the end of a speech in 
which he cited the accomplishments of his adminstration he 
mentioned bush three times and on one of those occasions referred 
to him as george bosh 
eight years ago george bush and i said to the american 
people the time is now it still is the story of america is one 
of people who have made their dreams come true by realizing that 
the time for action is always now reagan said 
at the end of reagans speech bush joined him at the podium and 
the two held clasped hands aloft as hundreds of balloons were 
released from the ceiling 
bush who spoke before reagan praised the president saying 
you began a great national renewal what an inspiration you have 
been to all of us your simple humanity your decency your 
strength 
earlier as bush waved from a secondfloor balconey in the old 
executive office building robertson told reporters on the white 
house drive below that he had given his endorsement to the vice 
president during a private session 
i will be making that official on monday because the race 
is pretty much over robertson said 
the former television minister has won only 46 delegates in the 
republican primary and caucus competition he said he was waiting 
until monday so his supporters would have a shot at winning 
additional national convention seats at gop caucuses this weekend 
in arizona and virginia 
i didnt ask anything for myself i spoke about education and 
the need to bring the 1984 platform into line with the realities of 
1988 robertson said we definitely had a meeting of the minds 
on the platform 
robertson said he told bush he would work to get his supporters 
to back him 
in a prelude to his formal endorsement reagan made his 
intentions known at a meeting of gop congressional leaders in the 
cabinet room earlier wednesday the republican leaders applauded 
when reagan and bush entered the room 
vanquished republican presidential hopeful sen bob dole who 
attended the session later had some advice for bush which he 
shared with reporters 
dole said bush would have to build on the reagan record build 
on the reagan constituency try to hold it if you can but sooner 
or later youre going to be out there running as its going to 
be the bush campaign the bush agenda the bush vision for the 
future and i think that will develop in time i think he can do 
it 
on more specific advice on what bush would have to do in the 
coming months to get elected dole said i think ill leave that 
to bush he did enough he took care of me all right 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater called the presidents 
endorsement of bush the warmest of political embraces 
fitzwater said reagan would campaign for bush even before the 
republican convention in august 
im sure once we return from the summit in moscow may 29june 
2 there will be a number of events this summer fitzwater said 
reagans blessing comes two weeks after the pennsylvania primary 
in which bush won sufficient republican convention delegates to 
lock up the party nomination

republican george bush and democrat michael dukakis turned their 
campaigns west on wednesday toward final primaries in oregon and 
california both firmly in command and focusing on the fall 
president reagan in a move that surprised no one bestowed his 
official blessing on bush 
im going to work as hard as i can to make vice president 
george bush the next president of the united states reagan told 
3000 republican faithful at a 1500aplate fundraising dinner 
wednesday night 
i intend to campaign as hard as i can said the president 
in endorsing bush reagan said he was breaking a silence ive 
maintained for some time with regard to the presidential 
candidates 
after reagan spoke bush came to the podium and the two held 
their clasped hands in the air as hundreds of balloons were 
released from the ceiling 
the lone remaining republican opponent television evangelist 
pat robertson bowed to the obvious at last and offered bush his 
endorsement 
robertson said he would suspend his own candidacy for the 
republican presidential nomination on monday weeks after he had 
ceased active campaigning against the vice president later 
however his campaign said he would discuss his campaign status on 
monday but quoted robertson as saying he is not withdrawing from 
the race or releasing his delegates 
reagan delivered a political tease of sorts when he and bush 
walked into the cabinet room to meet with gop congressional leaders 
earlier tuesday 
i just have a very brief announcement to make reagan said 
and that is that ill have something to say about the campaign 
tonight 
with two fresh primary wins in his column dukakis took a 
highspeed train ride and denounced the reagan administration for 
not supporting rail service 
one of the reasons our airports are so overburdened is that we 
have been spending the last eight years without a national 
transportation policy dukakis said 
bush with a mathematical lock on the gop convention and 
dukakis with a seemingly insurmountable delegate lead for the 
democratic nomination were both flying to the west coast on 
thursday to begin campaign swings 
both planned visits to oregon ahead of tuesdays primary there 
and california which ends the primary season june 7 along with new 
jersey new mexico and montana 
a gallup poll of likely democratic voters in california released 
wednesday indicated a big dukakis lead 67 percent to 26 percent 
for remaining rival jesse jackson 
jackson campaigned in portland ore and shook off resounding 
primary losses to dukakis in west virginia and nebraska 
robertson appeared before reporters at the white house and said 
he had given bush his endorsement in a private meeting and would 
get out of the race 
i will be making that official on monday because the race 
is pretty much over said robertson who won only 46 delegates in 
a campaign that spent more than 20 million 
he said i didnt ask anything for myself and promised to 
work to have his supporters back bush 
asked if he would run again in 1992 if bush loses this fall 
robertson said its conceivable its not a certainty 
robertson said he soon may return to the christian broadcasting 
network that he founded and which he left last fall to run for the 
presidency he said contributions and viewers have dropped 
dramatically in the last year 
i assumed that i had built a very competent staff and that 
they would be able to run cbn in my absence robertson said in an 
interview with the norfolk va virginianpilot and ledgerstar 
i did not realize that my personal presence on the 700 club was 
as important as it is to the audience 
dukakis the massachusetts governor rode two highspeed trains 
being tested for use between boston and new york and denounced the 
reagan administration for what he said was no national 
transportation policy and a failure to support amtrak 
he rode the trains from boston to providence ri and back a 
50mile oneway trip that the train covered in 32 minutes he said 
equipment needed for hourly service between new york and boston 
would cost about 200 million 
this is a very very modest investment for what could be and 
should be a profitable service dukakis said 
jackson spoke to about 1800 students at the predominantly black 
jefferson high school in portland he exhorted them to reject drugs 
and violence and afterward led a 15block antidrug march from the 
school through one of the citys most crimeridden areas 
you get those guns out of your pockets and the drugs out of 
your life and you can make a difference he said 
jackson insisted he was in the race until the end despite two 
more landslide wins by dukakis tuesday night including a delegate 
shutout of jackson in west virginia 
dukakis has moved within striking distance of the 2081 
delegates needed to nail down the democratic nomination according 
to the latest associated press delegate count dukakis had 1589 to 
jacksons 944

room at her fathers inn dying of a gunshot wound 
interest in the painting was keen experts had said before the 
auction in part because it serves as a link to the artists last 
days 
but the standingroomonly crowd was still after the final bid 
there was no applause as is customary when a high price is paid for 
an artwork in which interest has been expressed prior to the sale 
bidding wasnt too spirited the price was disappointing 
said ellis abraham a new york attorney who was interested in 
bidding for a client or himself 
auctioneer christopher burge president of christies in 
america called the sale a wonderful price for a beautiful 
picture 
the bidding started at 6 million the 1375 million included 
the 10 percent commission paid to the auction house 
the portrait last changed hands in 1980 when an anonymous buyer 
purchased it at a sothebys auction for 198 million 
over the past 14 months three of paintings by van gogh who 
sold almost nothing during his lifetime have fetched previously 
unheardof multimilliondollar prices that shocked the art world 
in march 1987 van goghs sunflowers sold for 399 million 
at christies in london to a japanese insurance company three 
months later the trinquetaille bridge went for 202 million 
also at christies in london it was bought by an unidentified 
collector in switzerland 
then in november history was made when van goghs irises 
a composition of purple flowers and green leaves set off by a 
single white iris sold at sothebys in new york for 539 million 
to an anonymous buyer the highest price paid at auction for a 
painting 
in the painting auctioned wednesday adeline dressed in blue 
sits in profile on a chair her blond hair is tied with a blue 
ribbon her gaze is serene her posture correct and her hands are 
folded demurely in front of her he observed her very deeply and 
when he came to paint her he painted both the grace and stiff 
awkwardness of an adolescent girl said michael findlay senior 
vice president of christies and an expert on impressionist and 
modern painting 
but mrs carrie who died in 1965 at the age of 88 said in a 
1956 essay that she didnt immediately appreciate the painting 
i admit that i was only moderately satisfied with my portrait 
it was somewhat of a disappointment for i did not find it was true 
to life mrs carrie wrote 
however she was quoted in a 1953 interview as saying 
monsieur vincent divined not the young girl i was but the woman 
i was to become 
mrs carrie described van gogh who lived at her fathers inn 
during the last 2 months of his life as a disciplined artist and 
a soft and calm man who enjoyed playing with her baby sister 
she described how a doctor and police were summoned after he 
returned to the inn after shooting himself and how his brother 
theo who was the artists chief backer came running from the 
train station his face distorted by grief 
at the same auction wednesday alberto giacomettis sculpture of 
three walking men trois hommes qui marchent sold for 38 
million the most ever paid at auction for a 20th century sculpture 
pierre renoirs painting lombrelle of a woman sitting in a 
garden with an umbrella in her hand brought 66 million

kill kathy kendrick 24 who friends say once rejected simmons 
amorous attention and james chaffin 33 who apparently was a 
chance victim 
police said simmons had a grudge against most of the people he 
is accused of shooting others were wounded that day as four 
russellville businesses were terrorized by a pistolwielding 
intruder 
after simmons surrendered police found the bodies of 14 
relatives including his wife his children and grandchildren at 
his home near dover police said they were killed during the 
christmas holidays simmons is to be tried july 18 in their deaths 
epperson said simmons made the comments about getting even 
during conversation at the convenience store where simmons worked 
rusty taylor was the only name he called epperson said 
referring to one of the four people simmons is accused of wounding 
defense attorney robert e irwin said the defense would have 
only two or three witnesses the defense opens its case thursday 
earlier wednesday joyce butts assisted to and from the witness

said he screamed he shouted across the office that he didnt 
get paid enough 
mrs butts said the shooting resulted in nightmares i see 
things scary she said i hear things i see people they 
dont have faces theyre after me 
vicky jackson who the prosecution says was taken hostage after 
mrs butts was shot at the freight company recalled saying to 
simmons gene please dont shoot me please dont shoot me 
ms jackson said she was cowering when simmons holding a gun to 
her right temple took her by the right arm and told her to get up 
vicky im not going to hurt you ms jackson said simmons 
told her i came to kill joyce i got everybody that hurt me im 
not going to hurt you 
ms jackson said simmons put down one of the two pistols but he 
kept the other one pointed at her and would not let her leave she 
added because he said he didnt want the police barreling in 
there or barging in there i guess he thought they wouldnt 
shoot him if they had me there 
he refused to give her the other gun she said

paraguays authoritarian government 
canceled a meeting between pope john paul ii and civil leaders 
scheduled for next week but a church group said wednesday it will 
try to go ahead with the assembly 
no meeting has been canceled on such short notice on any of the 
popes 36 previous foreign tours and the incident raised new 
tensions between the roman catholic church in paraguay and the 
government of president alfredo stroessner 
john paul on wednesday visited cochabamba on bolivias desolate 
high plains where he listened to the lament of jobless miners and 
povertyravaged peasants and pledged the churchs support 
the meeting next tuesday was to be held in a governmentowned 
sports stadium in paraguays capital of asuncion and was intended 
to bring the pontiff into contact with a broad mix of civilians 
they were to include peasants lawyers religious leaders and 
members of opposition parties not recognized by the government 
the invitations to opposition leaders prompted government 
criticism patria the daily newspaper of stroessners ruling 
colorado party on sunday described the meeting as a corrupt 
assembly 
patria reported tuesday that government officials citing 
security reasons notified the popes local envoy that the 
meeting had been canceled 
the permanent episcopal council said it would search for another 
site 
john paul is due to meet stroessner soon after the pontiff 
arrives from peru next monday the pope is on a 13day tour of four 
south american countries uruguay bolivia peru and paraguay 
the vatican declined comment about the cancellation of the 
meeting for the moment i have nothing to say said vatican 
spokesman joaquin navarro traveling with the pope 
the government and paraguays bishops were at odds over the 
planning of the popes visit and there was little cooperation 
between them 
the church has criticized the government and its human rights 
record the catholic radio station in asuncion caritas has 
provided air time to government opponents 
in the mining city of oruro bolivia wednesday an unemployed 
tin miner juan alborte cartagna wailed as he addressed the pope 
on a stage we are dying of hunger father help us we dont 
have even a piece of bread 
the miner who has three children placed a steel mining hat on 
the popes head as tears streamed down the miners face the 
gesture drew cheers from an audience estimated by the church at 
160000 many dressed in old or patched clothing 
oruro with an unemployment rate easily double the national 
average of 22 percent is considered the center of misery in 
bolivia the country is the poorest in south america 
later the pope said a mass for more than 200000 people after 
returning to cochabamba 
in a meeting with priests and seminarians he praised foreign 
priests working in bolivia saying you are exercising your 
ministry with sacrifice and generosity in this your adoptive 
country 
a group of bolivian bishops complained to the vatican last month 
about the appointment of three foreignborn bishops of bolivias 
834 priests 634 are foreigners 
later the pope urged 22000 young people in a cochabamba sports 
stadium to avoid the temptations of drugs sex and marxism 
cochabamba a cocaine trafficking center in the countrys 
principal cocagrowing region called the chapare is plagued by 
increasing drug use among the young 
coca processing is outlawed in bolivia but the countrys drug 
industry supplies an estimated onethird of the cocaine that 
arrives in the united states and europe 
in oruro the pope was greeted by brass bands and groups of 
dancers in multicolored sequined costumes and garishly painted 
masks with twisting horns 
under blue skies the pontiff addressed the crowd from a tall 
stage that provided a clear view of the staterun san jose mine 
from which most workers have been fired in a government austerity 
program 
i know of the many workers who have been displaced from their 
jobs john paul said the deep mines that years ago were the 
great source of national wealth are now only mute witnesses to 
so many lives silently consumed there 
the bolivian church has been criticized by the countrys 
conservative government for backing the social security demands of 
jobless miners and peasants 
because of a collapse in world tin prices the government of 
president victor paz estenssoro shut down 14 of the 21 stateowned 
mines leaving 21500 of 27000 miners without jobs

the government denied wednesday that 
gen manuel antonio noriega had agreed to step down as armed forces 
commander and leave the country in return for dismissal of charges 
against him in us federal court 
an administration source in washington said the reagan 
administration had offered to drop drugsmuggling and 
moneylaundering charges against noriega in return for the 
generals retirement and exile 
boris moreno director of the governments national information 
system or sni told the associated press in panama there have 
been simple conversations on diverse subjects there has been no 
agreement about anything 
upon being informed of the existence of such reports gen 
manuel antonio noriega told sni categorically the sovereignty of 
panama is not negotiable and is indeclinable moreno said 
he continued such reports only come from sources interested 
in sidetracking the conversations and in aggravating the existing 
situation these reports form part of the confusion and 
confrontation provoked by certain elements of the washington 
establishment 
the official news agency panapress on wednesday said that 
president reagan entered in direct contact with general 
noriega the agency did not elaborate 
moreno when asked if that meant reagan spoke by telephone with 
noriega said he did not know 
the source in washington who spoke on condition of anonymity 
said that under the proposed deal noriega would step down probably 
in august and he would stay out of panama until after the next 
presidential elections there 
the us government has called for noriegas ouster since he was 
indicted in federal court in florida in february the reagan 
administration has imposed a variety of economic sanctions on 
panama in recent months to try to hasten the departure of noriega 
who is considered the power behind panamas government 
raymond takiff one of noriegas four us lawyers told the ap 
in miami that he was unaware of the alleged deal takiff and lawyer 
frank rubino met with noriega tuesday in panama city 
rubino had told the ap in panama on tuesday at the moment 
there are no plans for his noriegas retirement 
terence kneebone the us embassy spokesman in panama city 
said he had no knowledge of the alleged deal 
asked if state department envoy michael kozak met in panama on 
wednesday with the general or his representatives kneebone said 
no comment the reagan administration has sent kozak to panama 
in recent weeks to talk with noriega

abcs supercarrier launched earlier this 
spring immediately ran into heavy weather from the critics 
the show set aboard the fictitious uss georgetown has been 
called a ripoff and a not particularly good one of the hit 
movie top gun 
the navy after looking at a few scripts hoisted anchor and 
withdrew all support without the navy the show could no longer 
film aboard the carrier or aloft with navy planes 
in the ratings after six showings supercarrier ranks 68th 
of 105 shows not great but not so terrible either against the 
likes of murder she wrote on cbs and family ties on nbc 
and the ratings increase slightly in the halfhour after family 
ties 
supercarrier carries on using a sound stage in valencia 30 
miles north of los angeles and more than 50 miles from the nearest 
navy base 
people ask how we can do a show about an aircraft carrier 
without navy support said executive producer steven e de souza 
even when we had navy support we only spent two weeks on a 
carrier its very hard 
we went to jacksonville fla and spent a fortune waiting to 
get on the forrestal then we had to go to norfolk to get on the 
john f kennedy the day we were to shoot at the long beach naval 
station we had to cancel because of prince andrew coming in it 
cost us 30000 
add that to what we spent in jacksonville and thats a lot of 
money down the drain chasing the chimera of navy cooperation so 
weve been faking it 
de souza said it was not the proposed story lines that caused 
the navy to drop its cooperation as had been reported 
the stories the navy supposedly rejected never existed he 
said we never had a story about the captain falling in love with 
a woman pilot the information were getting is that the navys air 
arm the brown shoes didnt like the show and the reason they 
didnt like it was that it isnt just about the pilots as top 
gun was 
we have a lot of characters who are black shoe navy and we 
hear theyre delighted with the show we have a lot of regular 
sailors that young people can identify with kids see top gun 
but they know theyll never go to college and never be an aviator 
de souza said chuck fries entertainment inc which makes the 
show was being pulled in different directions by the navy and abc 
the navy could never articulate exactly what it wanted he 
said but they did say once they wanted us to show the crew 
offduty and at home the network wanted the ship at sea and the 
planes in the air 
the premise for supercarrier based loosely on the book of 
the same name by george wilson is a good one it focuses not only 
on the pilots but on the crew as well from the captain down to 
the newest member 
the problem comes in the stories which on some occasions seem 
to have been salvaged from voyage to the bottom of the sea the 
shows characters come off as cartoons you dont become involved 
with them the way you do with the people on china beach 
another abc military series thats doing much better in the ratings 
in one episode two pilots from the georgetown were duped by two 
beautiful young women into flying a cargo plane to mexico the 
plane was carrying guns stolen from the carrier the pilots should 
have been courtmartialed for stupidity 
the carrier was used to evacuate people from an island 
threatened by either a volcano or a rebel army it was impossible 
to tell which one sailor learned he had inadvertently proposed 
marriage to an island girl something to do with goats all it 
needed was maria montez and someone to say give me the cobra 
jewel 
the last episode has something to do with nazi gold recovered 
from a sunken ship by archaeologists but theres more its packed 
in poisoned grain and it gets into the carriers water system 
where is indiana jones when you need him

three earshattering booms 
mark the flight of an f111 thundering at supersonic speed just 200 
feet above a test range in the florida panhandle 
the fighterbomber drops an experimental bomb then the pilot 
yanks the throttle back to idle cutting the jets thrust 90 
percent 
in seconds the planes speed drops from 940 mph to just under 
600 a radical maneuver designed to limit noise and damage from 
sonic booms 
without it windows might have shattered in holley and navarre 
which lie near the end of the range with it residents might not 
even hear the booms 
its such a violent deceleration we are actually thrown 
forward in the cockpit held back by our seat straps said maj 
dan isbell in an interview we try our best to be good neighbors 
we dont want to go around breaking peoples windows 
isbell a test pilot from chattanooga tenn was describing a 
typical mission at mach 12 or just over the speed of sound at 
the air forces only supersonic test range in the eastern united 
states the special lowlevel missions test nonnuclear weaponry 
being developed here including socalled smart bombs that glide to 
their targets with pinpoint accuracy 
col harvey greenberg eglins chief claims officer said the 
air force nationwide received 265 claims for 465138 in the 1987 
budget year but paid only 67003 for 160 claims deemed valid 
while denying 80 some claims carry over to the next year 
eglin accounted for 27 of the valid claims and 4931 in 
damages air force records show 
but it has been worse in the past a single boom in 1984 
produced 34 claims that cost eglin 15865 
the only other places where the air force permits lowlevel 
supersonic flights are edwards air force base calif and certain 
other desert areas in the west isbell said 
but none is as close to populated areas as eglins range b70 
holley and navarre lie just five to seven miles to the west 
the 13milelong range is in the western half of a 
720squaremile military reservation about 10 miles northwest of 
fort walton beach once billed as home of the sonic boom 
local newspapers and radio stations carry air force news 
releases about impending supersonic flights so residents wont be 
startled if they hear the booms said george roberts a civilian 
spokesman in eglins public affairs office he said missions have 
been canceled when the releases failed to make the newspapers 
predicting the strength of sonic booms is an inexact science 
that depends on such variables as aircraft size speed altitude 
and weather factors including wind air pressure and temperature 
isbell said 
temperature inversions are the most serious complication 
capable of bouncing the sonic shock waves great distances isbell 
said inversions have been suspected of breaking windows as far away 
as downtown pensacola about 30 miles to the west 
the f111 is the largest of several types of aircraft used in 
lowlevel supersonic testing and thus produces the loudest and most 
damaging booms 
an aircraft flying faster than the speed of sound generally 
creates three shock waves one by its nose another by its 
midsection and the third by its tail isbell said 
shock waves are caused when air molecules cannot get out of the 
way of a plane flying faster than the speed of sound 
the booms however dissipate rapidly over distance those 
produced at high altitudes rarely are heard on the ground and 
supersonic flight above 30000 feet or almost 6 miles up is 
unrestricted isbell said 
studies conducted by the national aeronautic and space 
administration which was checking the potential for damage from 
space shuttles indicate window breakage is about the worst damage 
that can be caused by an aircraft 
some people however give sonic booms credit for more 
a man living just across the alabama state line about 50 miles 
west of eglin once complained that a sonic boom knocked his mobile 
home off its foundation the man later admitted he hadnt heard a 
sonic boom and wasnt even home at the time he later told isbell 
that he first thought it was caused by dynamiting at a quarry

a theologian for the national association 
of evangelicals says carbon14 tests on the shroud of turin will 
not affect evangelical belief in christs resurrection whatever 
the results 
it is no more than an interesting investigation says the 
rev arthur climenhaga chairman of naes theological committee 
even if proof could be offered that the shroud of turin was the 
shroud of christ that would be no more than an additional artifact 
in the historical evidences of christs resurrection already so 
well attested 
the vatican is allowing the carbon14 tests on bits of the 
shroud preserved in turin italy and bearing the image of a 
crucified man to determine its age and whether it dates to the 
time of christ 
results of the tests are expected later this year

farmers who recently overcame their 
aversion to computers now must face another test accounting 
yes its not enough to be computer literate to succeed in 
agribusiness these days youd better understand the numbers youre 
crunching as well 
bankers are telling farmers that accounting out of a shoebox 
is no longer good enough to support a loan application instead 
farmers must provide sophisticated data about their operations and 
show they understand the figures 
it makes a banker skittish when someone cant answer what we 
consider basic questions warns william scarborough a vice 
president with sanwa bank 
when i meet a customer who can talk intelligently with me 
regarding financial plans how to control that how to optimize 
returns and can present this type of information to us it lends a 
lot of credibility to the management and general character of the 
operation 
dave esterman president of fresnomadera production credit 
association puts it more simply farmers have normally operated 
out of a shoebox and were trying to get them out of that mode 
one question is obviously are you a good farmer says tom 
gallo vice president of wells fargo bank who along with the other 
bankers participated in a recent seminar on agricultural computing 
here 
but he emphasized that it is not enough to be an expert about 
all the technical details of farming and have limited understanding 
of the farms finances 
the other aspect of being a good farm manager is being a 
financial manager as well understanding where those numbers come 
from and what they mean gallo said 
what technical data do bankers want before they will consider 
lending farmers money dave smith professor of farm management and 
accounting at fresno state university offered this checklist 
current business and personal financial statements including a 
full accounting of outstanding debts 
three years worth of tax returns 
a cashflow budget 
details of proposed programs for cropping and marketing along 
with a three to fiveyear history of crop yields 
land locations maps and lease arrangements 
a list of trade suppliers and credit agreements 
a complete equipment list including descriptions ages and 
serial numbers 
partnership or corporate organization details 
insurance coverage 
the day when a farmer can just be a farmer and let his banker 
be concerned about the financial aspects of his business is past 
esterman said 
the farmer who can relay his financial message in a way we 
understand and he also understands with help from a computer is 
the type we are looking for not the kind who comes in with bills 
in his back pocket he added 
gallo said that when he began in banking a decade ago i 
remember sitting down with customers at the kitchen table and 
helping customers prepare an application statement weve gotten 
away from that 
lenders often are unwilling to start with the farmers own raw 
financial figures the bankers warned they want information that 
has been spotchecked by a certified public accountant for accuracy 
or even audited as a more complete assurance of accuracy 
that requires consistency and use of generally accepted 
accounting principles which were not widely followed on the farm 
until about three or four years ago smith said 
smith said computers can help provide the more sophisticated 
bookkeeping required on farms today but esterman cautioned that 
merely switching to computer bookkeeping will do little good if 
you are not in the habit of keeping good records whether in a 
notebook or otherwise

when youre looking up when other people are 
looking down you see things they cant possibly see said the 
economist observing that the adage had particular meaning in his 
profession 
a lot of his colleagues are looking for bad news these days he 
sasee a lot of bad omens they see the falling 
jobless rate not as healthy but as a signal of inflation and higher 
interest rates to come 
they observe that the factory utilization rate iid and so they s rising 
but 
rather than seeing this as good news for depressed areas they view 
it as an indicator of stress on the economy to be followed by 
inflation 
but there are things to be seen by looking up too said the 
economist 
you find for instance that the relatively low 54 percent 
civilian jobless rate doesnt necessarily mean the labor pool is 
exhausted and that wages therefore must rise 
there are plenty of people unemployed close to 68 million in 
fact and while some of these are unskilled teenagers many of 
them are adult men eager to work he observed that the jobless rate 
today is higher for adult men than it was in may 1979 when the 
economy was in a similar expansion mode 
since ding on plant and equipment should rise 8 percent 
this year 
we are in a capital spending boom he said explaining that it 
would mean expanded capacity thus limiting the strain on existing 
capacity and greater productivity which would reduce inflation 
pressures 
well said the listener to the upwardlooking economist you 
must concede that the federal reserve is concerned that interest 
rates have been edging higher 
of course he said and then he went into a long analysis of 
pessimism people today he observed were conditioned for the 
worst by the 1970s when the nation was harassed for years by 
doubledigit interest and inflation rates 
but why he asked do we assume that any movement in either rate 
must be for an extended period of time sure he said interest 
rates might rise and inflation stir but that doesnt mean they are 
longterm phenomenons 
he pointed out that higher interest rates are designed to slow 
the economy why he asked do we think they wont do the job that 
they wont slow the expansion and if expansion slows he 
continued shouldnt rates then fall 
there is one thing you must remember he said you should 
remember that the economy is always at risk every day and in many 
ways danger is a given as it is for all living things 
but that he concluded does not mean that when the trend is 
down it is down for all time that when things turn bad they 
cannot be corrected the economy is cyclical he said and that 
means a downturn presages an upturn

in a moneyisnoobject land rush 
big egos and bigger bucks are tearing down grand but aging estates 
on the worlds highestpriced real estate to make room for lavish 
supershrines 
the wealthy socalled golden triangle area beverly hills 
belair and brentwood roars and rumbles and rings with the din of 
bulldozers and power saws 
some residents consider the new megamansions architectural 
obscenities the enormous 12 million palace under construction for 
television mogul aaron spelling is bigger than the white house and 
has been dubbed the hilton by disgusted neighbors 
our peaceful neighborhood has been shattered said one jp 
guerin 
its ostentatious and overconsumption added another 
audrey irmas who won a court injunction limiting construction 
hours and the number of trucks permitted at the site the 
spellings are very selfcentered to come in and destroy a 
neighborhood like this 
mrs irmas called the mansion which includes a bowling alley 
and an entire floor of closets the mental institution because 
youd have to be crazy to build something like that 
thats nothing said elaine young of the real estate firm 
alvarez hyland and young the biggest monument is going to be by 
the sultan of brunei behind the beverly hills hotel hes torn down 
five houses for a palace 
one was the estate of actor james coburn she said adding he 
the sultan paid full price 5 million and its a teardown 
sentiment or nostalgia hold no sway in highstakes real estate 
homes once owned by james cagney bing crosby and others have 
crumbled beneath bulldozer treads crosbys estate was just part of 
the property spelling leveled for his project 
everything is emotional they want it they buy it said ms 
young nobody does a square footage cost on properties here 
anymore 
beverly hills where property value within the 56squaremile 
city limits is estimated at more than 5 billion issued permits 
for 28 teardown projects in 1985 43 in 1986 and 51 last year said 
city spokesman fred cunningham fourteen have been granted so far 
this year 
the trend is to buy a bargain basement house for 1 million 
or more raze it and build a grand gated kingdom 
they are buying these charming homes and ripping them down and 
building these things said mrs irmas 
a new law allows a structure to occupy a maximum 55 percent of 
the property some of these were really out of scale in the 
neighborhood and we put in an emergency ordinance to stop it 
cunningham said 
architect cliff may father of the california ranchstyle house 
is a critic of the huge projects 
good architecture is something that fits in the neighborhood 
but nowadays many architects are building monuments to their 
clients and the homes look like castles and mausoleums may said 
talk show host and producer merv griffin has also plowed money 
into real estate a few years ago he spent 5 million modest by 
beverly hills standards on a fouracre stone mansion and 
completely refurbished it 
now hes carving out a homesite on 150 acres in the santa monica 
mountains near the benedict canyon homes of annmargret and cher 
earthmoving equipment is readying a 16acre plateau for a 
palladian villa 
author sidney sheldon bought a sunset boulevard teardown for his 
future mansion to be called rose hill 
the megamansion brouhaha is not confined to the golden triangle 
on the exclusive palos verdes peninsula overlooking the pacific 
the 49room via visalia estate owned by dennis and mary ellen 
hardin has provoked interest in an ordinance to limit structure 
size the home has been dubbed the visalia sheraton by angry 
neighbors 
i enjoyed not looking at all this said neighbor beth 
pinkley who complains the house with turrets pillars and an 
ornate brick and stone wall is an eyesore it lures unsavory 
lookyloos she said it puts us at risk 
elsewhere in southern california refurbishing old mansions as 
opposed to tearing them down remains in vogue particularly those 
with plenty of square footage to knock around in examples include 
the knoll a 35000squarefoot estate remodeled by kenny rogers 
and sold for 22 million to oilman marvin davis and the kirkeby 
the old beverly hillbillies estate undergoing extensive 
remodeling by tv producer jerry perenchio 
he stole that place for 135 million it was the best buy in 
town and will be worth 25 million when hes finished ms young 
said of the kirkeby 
in the shadow of the kirkeby is the modest 25 million home 
where president and mrs reagan will likely spend their postwhite 
house years the value of the properly alone is estimated at almost 
3 million 
ms young said investors from all over the country are showing 
up with suitcases full of money 
they dont even haggle over price she said youve got a 
lot of people who have made money and this is a place to dispose of 
it homes are much more important here than they are in new york 
and here people are much more into show 
this is a definite show town everybody is trying to outdo 
their neighbor from cars to houses to designers to everything

the farm credit system has posted its third 
consecutive quarterly profit a 165 million net in its first 
fiscal quarter that reversed its loss of 155 million a year 
earlier 
the profit reported tuesday was due entirely to a 160 million 
reduction in the reserve for loan losses and a 10 million net gain 
on other property owned 
the systems net interest income of 146 million the 
difference between interest income and interest expense fell 
short of its other expenses of 151 million a year earlier the 
system had net interest income of 149 million less than the 164 
million in other expenses 
the farm credit system has been able to reduce its loanloss 
reserves because borrowers are considered better able to repay 
their loans 
the improvement in the agricultural economy experienced in the 
latter half of 1987 continued into the first quarter of 1988 
alan d fass president and chief executive of the federal farm 
credit banks funding corp said in a news release 
fass announced the farm credit systems profit jointly with h 
brent beesley president and chief executive of the farm credit 
corporation of america 
the farm credit system consists of 37 borrowerowned banks and 
associations serving the rural economy congress put it on a more 
secure footing last year by authorizing the issuance of up to 4 
billion in governmentbacked lowinterest loans 
the 1987 legislation by increasing confidence in the farm 
credit system made it possible to narrow the interestrate spreads 
on farm credit debt obligations over us treasury securities 
fass said the firstquarter net interest income was boosted by 
special factors and may be lower in the rest of 1988 
the allowance for loan losses as of march 31 was 2744 billion 
down from 2951 billion at the end of 1987 and 3532 billion as 
of march 31 1987

a broad move by five big brokers to limit 
computerized stock trading has won enthusiastic endorsement from 
critics who claim the strategy has caused unwarranted price 
convulsions and alienated many investors 
but some question the effectiveness of the halt on index 
arbitrage program trading because four of the firms will continug 
using the strategy for their clients investments 
kidder peabody amp co morgan stanley amp co painewebber inc and 
salomon brothers inc on tuesday announced limitations on program 
trading for their own accounts only while bear stearns amp co said 
it had imposed a total suspension 
the moves marked the most aggressive voluntary steps yet to calm 
an outcry over the strategy which has been blamed for destructive 
volatility in the stock market before and since the october crash 
it is necessary for all to work toward the goal of restoring 
confidence in and guaranteeing the vibrancy of the marketplace 
john gutfreund chairman and chief executive of salomon said in a 
statement that also reflected a view expressed by the other firms 
any action taken by member firms to tone volatility and 
increase investor confidence should be applauded said richard 
torrenzano spokesman for the new york stock exchange which also 
has taken steps to limit program trading i think its meaningful 
and a step in the right direction 
wall street sources said the firms have been under enormous 
pressure from stock exchanges customers lawmakers and even their 
own salespeople for coordinated action to control the computerized 
practice which involves the massive purchase and sale of stock 
index futures and the underlying stocks on which they are based 
although their action wont mean an end to program trading some 
traders said it should help limit the volatility because the 
brokerages had used the technique much more frequently than their 
customers did 
we welcome their decision of course said anthony a 
lacroix chairman president and chief executive of advest inc a 
hartford connbased securities firm that has urged tough 
restrictions on program trading we think its a right one for 
the capital markets in the long run and will encourage individuals 
to come back to the market 
nevertheless experts say proprietary program trading by these 
brokerages has accounted for only about 20 percent of the total 
volume of trades attributed to the strategy some critics said this 
leaves plenty of room for more uncertainty 
liquidity in our financial markets has dried up and this may 
be the first sight of rain weve seen in a long time said rep 
edward j markey dmass chairman of the finance subcommittee of 
the house energy and commerce committee in reaction to the 
suspensions however with customers still in the index arbitrage 
business the question remains if intraday volatility will 
increase or decrease 
capital guardian trust co chairman robert g kirby a member of 
the presidential panel that investigated the stock crash said the 
big brokers probably had determined that bad publicity over the 
technique didnt outweigh the profits they derived from it 
these guys decided that lifes too short kirby said i 
think they get the blame for all the volatility in the marketplace 
but all the volatility is going to go on because of their 
customers 
most index arbitrage program trading is done on behalf of 
institutional clients such as pension funds and banks who see the 
strategy as one of the few moneymakers in a market that has 
languished since the october crash 
at the same time program trading has frightened billions of 
investor dollars out of the market because it can swing prices 
violently without regard to a stocks real value the result has 
been a severe drop in trading volume and stock underwritings 
some said the actions tuesday reflected a growing belief in the 
securities industry that lawmakers would take steps aimed at 
restoring investor confidence unless brokerage firms could reform 
themselves 
whats really developed is a tremendous fear by the wall 
street commmunity that legislators may take significant action that 
might be an overreaction said jack barbanel a futures expert 
at the gruntal amp co investment firm in new york 
goldman sachs amp co shearson lehman hutton inc merrill lynch 
amp co and first boston co had previously announced suspensions of 
index arbitrage program trading for their own accounts but only 
goldmans was considered significant because the firm was among the 
biggest users of the technique

program trading is a catchall term for a range 
of computerized trading strategies that most often refers to index 
arbitrage which involves the rapid purchase and sale of stocks and 
stockindex futures 
in this strategy traders attempt to profit on discrepancies 
between the price of the actual stocks traded in new york and the 
value of indexes based on them such as the standard amp poors 500 
traded in chicago 
when the stocks trade at a significant discount to the index 
futures traders sell the futures and buy the stocks conversely 
when the index futures sell at a big enough discount from the 
underlying stocks traders sell the stocks and buy the index 
futures 
the speed at which these transactions are executed is crucial to 
the program trading strategy because the price discrepancies 
between stocks and stockindex futures are temporary during the 
course of a trading session 
big brokerages use powerful computer programs that track these 
discrepancies and instantly set off buy or sell programs when 
conditions are deemed profitable

fortyodd years of personal promotion failed 
to make wilbur blanks orangepeeling invention a success but a 
few seconds of exposure on cbs 60 minutes have sparked a 
deluge of orders for the gadget 
commentator andy rooneys glowing comments and brief 
demonstration of the device in a show broadcast several weeks ago 
prompted an unprecedented wave of demand for the quik orange peel 
which blank has been selling in its current form for about eight 
years 
this has been mindboggling blanks wife jane said in an 
interview from the couples home in this westcentral illinois 
town we had no idea he was going to say anything about the 
orange peel you cant believe the reaction 
rooney demonstrated the peeler which had been lying in his 
desk for three years during a commentary on gadgets he gets in 
the mail 
this is one of the best things i ever got rooney said 
its changed my life 
it really is magic you can amaze your friends with this 
in the past two weeks blank and his wille products co have 
received dozens of mail and phone orders for the peeler which he 
sells in groups of five for 6 
last week we sent out about 500 or 600 orders blank said 
were getting more every day 
blank nearly had given up on ever selling the public on his 
invention which he developed in california while working as a 
welder before world war ii 
i was fresh off the farm and i got out to california and 
found i loved oranges but hated to peel them he said thats 
when i came up with my orange peeler 
the original model made of stainless steel wire looked more 
like a bottle opener than an orange peeler blanks patent 
application was rejected and for four decades tried unsuccessfully 
to market the device 
he showed his peeler to fred wadley at iv die co in peoria 
about eight years ago and wadley fashioned one from 
brightlycolored orange plastic 
wadley has produced about 30000 peelers since then but says 
sales must soar before the product can be declared a commercial 
success 
rooney isnt sure why he still had the peeler in his desk drawer 
three years after blank sent it to him 
i just saw it in the drawer one day when i was looking for 
something and i decided to give it a try rooney said in a 
telephone interview i really liked it 
rooney said viewers flooded the network with calls and letters 
after the 60 minutes segment 
we always get a lot of mail but we got more than usual on 
this letters are still coming in he said 
rooney speculated that the benefits of primetime exposure would 
be fleeting although a planned 60 minutes followup filmed at 
the blanks home could help 
blank sold his blacksmith and welding shop two years ago but 
still runs a mobile home park and other business interests he 
isnt counting on the quik orange peel to make him rich 
i dont want to be a millionaire id have too many people on 
my back then he said id be happy with about 90000 i 
could live real comfortably in toulon on 90000 of course if it 
goes above that im not going to turn it down

the battle over desert partners lps attempted 
hostile takeover of usg corp moves to the companys annual meeting 
today where desert partners has another chance to appeal to 
shareholders for support 
directly at stake are six seats on usgs 15member board of 
directors 
desert partners has nominated its own a slate of candidates for 
the seats rivaling usgs own slate and is waging a hostile 22 
billion buyout offer for the building products company as well 
most shareholders already have voted their choices by mail 
although those voting by mail may change their votes at the meeting 
election results were not expected today federal regulations 
allow usg 10 days to tally the votes and announce the winners said 
usg spokeswoman randi killian 
an election victory by the hostile bidder would not translate 
into immediate control of usg by desert partners a partnership led 
by oilmen cyril wagner jr and jack e brown of midland tex 
but a desert partners victory would indicate shareholder 
approval of the groups demand that usg drop its poison pill 
takeover defense a major impediment to the proposed acquisition 
desert partners which owns about 99 percent of usgs 515 
million common shares outstanding is offering 42 cash a share for 
up to 39 million shares the partnership proposes purchasing the 
remaining shares for 42 worth of debt securities and warrants 
bringing the total indicated value of the deal to about 22 
billion 
usg has proposed to fight desert partners with a defensive 
recapitalization which would be submitted to a shareholder vote on 
june 24 usg would borrow 22 billion to pay its shareholders 37 
a share in cash debentures with a face value of 5 and a share of 
stock in the recapitalized corporation for each of their shares

south koreas shipbuilding orders have 
decreased by 413 percent so far this year from the same period in 
1987 because of the national currencys appreciation in foreign 
exchange officials said today 
orders received so far consist of 626300 gross tons of export 
ships and 800 gross tons of domestic ships the officials said 
but the officials also said that despite the sluggish orders 
local shipmakers still have a combined outstanding order of 6 
million gross tons enough to keep them busy until the first half 
of next year 
the value of the south korean won has risen 743 percent against 
the us dollar so far this year a higher won makes south korean 
exports more expensive abroad while lowering the prices of imports

an outside review of the deadly 1984 gas 
leak at a bhopal india plant was intended to objectively assesses 
the cause of the disaster union carbide corp says although the 
resulting report provides little new information on the incident 
the report released tuesday by the firm arthur d little inc 
supported carbides claims that sabotage by a disgruntled employee 
caused the disaster it also refuted as physically impossible 
the indian governments contention that the disaster stemmed from 
negligence 
we wanted the world to know that somebody that had a 
reputation that was worldwide and sterlingwould look at things 
critically said bud holman a carbide attorney 
the report did not provide a motive for sabotage or name the 
worker believed responsible 
but holman said the company and the indian government knew the 
workers identity and it eventually would be revealed in court he 
said the worker wanted to punish a superior who had demoted him 
ashok kalelkare a senior vice president of arthur d little 
based in cambridge mass presented the findings tuesday to a 
london symposium sponsored by the institute of chemical engineers 
of the united kingdom 
an indian government attorney involved in the case on declined 
comment on the report today saying it would be improper while 
were in litigation he insisted on anonymity 
in composite trading on the new york stock exchange carbide 
closed up 75 cents a share to 2387 on tuesday 
at least 2850 people were killed and 20000 injured when methyl 
isocyanate gas leaked from a holding tank at union carbide india 
ltds bhopal plant on dec 3 1984 
more than 500000 people have filed claims in the case and the 
indian government filed criminal charges against carbide in 
december 
the arthur d little report theorized that a worker entered the 
plants storage area during a shift change the night of dec 2 
1984 and hooked a rubber hose to the methyl isocyanate tank with 
the intention of ruining the tanks contents 
the chemical produces a deadly gas when mixed with water 
the results of this investigation show with virtual 
certainty that the bhopal incident was caused by the entry of 
water to the tank through a hose that had been connected directly 
to the tank the report stated it is equally clear that those 
most directly involved attempted to obfuscate these events 
the report was based on interviews with more than 70 former 
employees of the nowclosed plant 
among those interviewed was an unidentified instrument 
supervisor who told investigators that the day after the disaster 
he discovered a gauge on the chemical tank had been replaced with a 
plug nearby he also noticed a length of hose with water running 
from it the report said 
the report theorized that the gauge was removed the hose 
inserted and the hole filled with a plug once the water had been 
added to the tank 
the indian government contends that water got into the chemical 
tank when a worker failed to install a slipblind a device 
that prevents water from backing up while cleaning a filter about 
400 feet away 
but arthur d littles report asserted the theory was 
implausible for three reasons the workers hose pressure wasnt 
high enough to raise the water to the level of the chemical tank a 
safety valve to prevent such a mishap was found in good working 
order after the accident and pipes that would have remained filled 
with water after such an occurrence were dry 
the report alleged that workers altered plant logs to hide that 
they tried to drain the tank after realizing water had been added 
the consultants report was highly critical of the indian 
government saying it stuck to the negligence theory despite 
evidence to the contrary and hindered union carbides ability to 
discover what actually happened 
the company finally got access to key plant records and through 
them the names of plant employees when a us magistrate ordered 
india to produce copies of the documents as part of the civil suit 
to which it was a party

the international trade commission plans to 
impose import duties on forklift trucks allegedly dumped below 
cost in the united states by japanese manufacturers 
in a unanimous ruling sought by hyster co of portland ore 
the sixmember commission said tuesday that the us forklift 
industry had suffered material injury because of the japanese 
practices 
the ruling means the importers of forklift trucks will have to 
pay cash duties equal to the dumping margin on each japanese 
forklift they import the department of commerce will determine the 
dumping margins with several expected to exceed 50 percent 
the commerce department ruled last month that japanese producers 
had been dumping their forklifts in the united states japanese 
manufacturers have not paid any duties since january 1986 
in a petition filed in april 1987 hyster and four labor unions 
alleged that japanese producers were using unfair tactics to claim 
half of the us market in small to mediumcapacity internal 
combustion lift trucks 
such trucks comprise 70 percent of the us market list prices 
range from 14000 to 65000 
hyster along with the united shop and service workers the 
independent lift truck builders union the international 
association of machinists and aerospace workers and the 
international union allied industrial workers of america claimed 
the dumping practices were costing thousands of jobs in the united 
states 
we have placed the japanese producers on notice that open 
trade policies of the united states should not be abused through 
illegal pricing and marketgrabbing strategies said william h 
kilkenny hysters chairman 
we are hopeful that the element of fairness will return to our 
us marketplace he said 
among the japanese manufacturers affected by the ruling are

british airways wants to fly the supersonic 
concorde to atlanta as part of its regularly scheduled service 
i cant tell you when because i would then be in the position 
of asking permission to do it it will happen but you wont know 
it because it will drive in quietly british airways chairman 
lord john king told a british american business group luncheon 
tuesday 
the plan would be to link atlanta up with the washington 
service king said 
the tentative plan calls for three concorde flights a week from 
london to washington to atlanta the airline now flies the concorde 
twice daily from london to new york and three times a week from 
miami to washington to london 
atlanta would be a major new gateway for british airways king 
said he said he believes atlanta could support concorde service 
british airways has seven of the supersonic planes 
the atlanta to london flight with a stop in washington 
probably would take about 5 hours according to british airways 
spokesman john lampl the fare probably would be around 6000 
that compares with current nonstop service from atlanta to 
london an eighthour flight which costs 677 if tickets are 
purchased 21 days in advance

bad loan portfolios in texas have prompted the 
states banking chief to increase projections on the number of 1988 
bank failures from 50 to 70 
bank failures have not subsided during the first part of 1988 
and in fact are running ahead of last years pace said texas 
banking commissioner kenneth littlefield we have not seen a 
turnaround 
last year 50 texas banks failed to set a national record so 
far this year 23 have failed another 179 statechartered banks 
are on the regulators problem list and littlefield said tuesday 
that few will last until the state economy makes a rebound 
he blamed troubled real estate loans for accelerating the 
closure rates in addition he said problem assets are squeezing 
net interest margins and forcing losses for the banks 
but if the banks sell off those assets in a falling market it 
could mean even more losses as the banks absorb the difference 
between the book and market values 
a good number of texas banks are in an almost helpless 
situation said littlefield who is encouraging federal aid for 
banks rather than closing the institutions through more 
aggressive use of openbank assistance much can be done to help 
the smaller banks 
the federal deposit insurance corp reported texas banks lost 
almost 2 billion in 1987 and had 1263 billion in bad loans and 
repossed properties at the end of the year a 44 percent increase 
over 1986 
fdic spokesman alan whitney said owners of failing banks often 
dont ask for assistance because they feel their case is hopeless 
whitney said fdic is working to merge failing banks to pay off 
depositors 
of the 23 texas failures 13 were merged with other banks

xerox corp will eliminate 800 managerial 
and professional jobs from its us marketing group but expects to 
be able to shift displaced employees to other positions in the 
group a company spokesman said 
the job cuts are being made only in areas that do not have 
direct contact with customers such as public relations said xerox 
spokesman john rasor 
the cutback is part of a companywide effort to reduce expenses 
and then invest in areas that directly serve the customer rasor 
said 
workers whose jobs are eliminated will initially fill jobs now 
available because of a hiring freeze that has been in effect 
throughout the group which sells and services the companys 
copiers 
a barry rand the groups president said tuesday that layoffs 
would be a last resort and that no one who takes another job with 
the company will take a pay cut 
the us marketing group headquartered in rochester employs 
about 2600 people here and about 27500 throughout the united 
states the cutback will affect 675 jobs in rochester and 125 at 
other locations rasor said

ltv steel co today said it has signed a 
contract to sell its steel plant in warren to the renco group inc 
of new york city 
terms of the sale were not disclosed in the companys 
announcement 
included in the sale is ltvs republic drainage products co in 
canton and its six plants the company said 
the clevelandbased ltv steel said completion of the sale is 
targeted for june 30 and is subject to the approval of us 
bankruptcy court in new york which has jurisdiction over ltv 
corps reorganization proceedings 
in 1986 the dallasbased ltv corp parent company of ltv 
steel filed for reorganization under chapter 11 of the us 
bankruptcy code 
ltv announced last november that it wanted to sell or find a 
business partner for its warren plant which is the largest steel 
mill remaining in the mahoning valley the plant has about 2200 
employees 
ltv described the renco group as a privately held concern with 
15 diversified manufacturing and distribution operations nationwide 
all employees at the warren plant and the republic drainage 
plants including management are expected to be retained ltv said 
ltvs coke plant in warren is not included in the sale and will 
continue to be part of ltv steel the company said 
ltv president david h hoag said repairs to the warren blast 
furnace will be completed as scheduled later this summer 
we believe this sale of the warren works and the drainage 
products plants is in the best interest of ltv steel the affected 
employees and local communities we urge the employees their 
unions and the communities of the mahoning valley to extend their 
welcome and cooperation to renco as it becomes a major employer and 
force in the local economy hoag said in a statement 
us rep james a traficant dohio said he was informed of 
the sales this morning by ltv officials traficant represents the 
mahoning valley area 
the good news is that they will retain all management and 
hourly workers said traficant the questionable news however 
is that the group has very limited activity in the steel industry 
however our local people have turned the plant around and made it 
profitable 
hoag said last fall that the sale would fit in with the 
companys plans to concentrate its operations and capital 
investment primarily in three flatrolled facilities in cleveland 
east chicago ind and hennepin ill 
the warren plant has an annual raw steel production capacity of 
15 million tons the company said it produces hot and cold rolled 
sheet and strip steel hotdipped galvanized sheet steel silicon 
steel and terne plate

united auto workers local 72 is withdrawing 
a suit seeking to prevent chrysler corp and the city of detroit 
from using federal money to move subcompact car production from 
kenosha to detroit the locals bargaining chief said 
were going to drop that one rudy kuzel said tuesday 
they company negotiators asked for that because of some of 
the economics they were compelled to give us the lawsuit was a 
bargaining chip 
the union lawsuit filed in february charged that chrysler and 
detroit were illegally using a federal grant to remodel chryslers 
detroit plant for work it planned to move this july from kenosha 
chrysler since has announced it will build the subcompact cars 
in kenosha until the end of the year when it will stop all auto 
assembly and stamping operations at kenosha 
kuzel said chrysler agreed to increased pension and other 
monetary benefits for about 6500 hourly workers and 8000 retirees 
because it did not want to risk 50 million in federal money it 
would have lost had the union suit in us district court been 
successful 
the contract which is to cover about 5500 workers chrysler 
intends to lay off or retire at the end of the year and about 900 
hourly workers it will retain in its engine division gives workers 
severance and retirement options 
chrysler also has promised to keep the engine division at 
kenosha open for four years from sept 15 when the local contract 
becomes effective 
the portion of the contract that governs those who will be laid 
off is a twoyear agreement kuzel said in outlining the pact 
tuesday for union members who were to vote on it today 
the contract proposal calls for return of 8000 to 10000 owed 
each worker under an employee investment plan used to help then 
financiallystrapped american motors corp 
kuzel said workers would get the money back over two years but 
would not get any interest or bonus payments that would amount to 
a total of about 58 million chrysler bought amc last year 
kuzel said chrysler also added 5 million to a 15 million job 
bank fund that will be used to pay full wages to eligible workers 
as long as the money lasts 
the proposal also calls for payments of about 100 a week to 
each laidoff worker under the unions supplemental unemployment 
benefit fund

the bowtied bunny still stands for sexy female 
centerfolds lively interviews and mens fashion tips but behind 
the flagship magazine a pragmatic new philosophy is emerging at 
playboy enterprises inc 
gone are the companyowned key clubs and casinos the luxurious 
chicago mansion and the big bunny jetliner trappings that 
reflected and reinforced founder hugh hefners hedonistic image 
in their place hefners daughter christie is building a 
leaner organization that while more fiscally sound is decidedly 
more staid right down to its recent acquisition of the sarah 
coventry jewelry line 
in six years as company president the 35yearold ms hefner 
has pared playboy to its core of publishing licensing and video 
businesses the proof of her pruning shows up on the bottom line 
profits in the past seven quarters 
she took charge of a company that was reeling from the loss of 
lucrative casino licenses in great britain denial of permission to 
operate a casino in atlantic city nj declining magazine sales 
and a faltering cable television channel 
under her leadership playboy has closed the last of its 
companyowned key clubs and disposed of its interests in movie 
theaters modeling and book and record clubs 
the entire management team headed by christie has repositioned 
the company to the point where profitability is now the norm and 
the potential for the future is probably brighter than at any time 
in the last several years said investment banker david leibowitz 
of american securities corp 
having righted and steadied the ship ms hefner is charting a 
course for playboy that partially follows the successful example of 
an unlikely model the walt disney co 
just as disney formed touchstone pictures and buena vista 
syndication to make and distribute movies with uncharacteristically 
adult themes playboy hopes to expand by escaping its traditional 
image 
in our case its sort of the flip side of disney ms hefner 
said in a recent interview 
we make products for adults and under the playboy name they 
have a particular aura that is sexy and fun she said thats 
an aura that works for certain products but not for others if we 
want to be able to expand as a licensor or publisher or videofilm 
creator wed like to be able to do that without the playboy name 
as a restriction 
so in addition to its array of playboy and playmate brand 
videotapes casual apparel jewelry and accessories the company 
plans to become a distributor of similar products that will not 
carry the playboy name or bunny emblem and theoretically will 
have a broader appeal 
its the mass market that middle market thats of most 
interest to us ms hefner said 
the first move in that direction was playboys quiet acquisition 
of sarah coventry in november through its neutrally named new 
subsidiary licensing unlimited inc 
the new strategy doesnt mean the playboy trademark has outlived 
its usefulness playboy magazine with an average paid circulation 
last year of more than 36 million is still the companys 
strongest suit though circulation may never again approach the 
1972 zenith of 72 million 
the magazine survived a government crackdown on pornography and 
a ban by 7eleven stores in 1986 and contributed more than 98 
million to playboys 1987 revenues of 162 million sales of video 
products including the revamped playboy channel and video 
centerfolds added about 29 million followed by 23 million from 
other publications and 105 million from licensing and 
merchandising 
although the playboy channel has had trouble holding 
subscribers the company maintains high hopes for its video unit 
which just released its first playmate video in eight months thanks 
to a new distribution deal with hbo video 
playboys 11 million profit in 1987 and strong performance in 
the first nine months of the current fiscal year followed a 62 
million loss in 1986 before turning profits in 1984 and 85 the 
company had notched a string of losses stretching back to the first 
quarter of fiscal 1982 the year ms hefner took over 
in the early years after i took over we were of necessity 
mostly engaged in the business of closing down business selling 
off businesses and solving old problems she said 
in the last few years ive been much more able to put my mark 
on the company and thats coincided with my fathers desire to be 
much less involved in the operations of the company 
hefner who lives in the los angeles playboy mansion reduced 
his involvement in the company after suffering a stroke about three 
years ago he retains the titles of chairman and chief executive 
officer still approves every playboy magazine cover and centerfold 
shot and provides creative input on the homevideo products 
while she speaks admiringly of her father whom she calls 
hef ms hefner said the company he built into one of the great 
business successes of the 1960s ran into trouble in the 1980s 
because it hadnt kept pace with changing attitudes about leisure 
time 
some analysts also blame her fathers preoccupations 
he hefner spent more time supervising the photo sessions for 
the centerfolds than he did reading the balance sheets of his 
company said dan lee of drexel burnham lambert inc in new york 
hefs daughter in contrast is an active thoroughly involved 
boss described by robyn radomski playboys chief spokeswoman as 
demanding and energetic ms hefner said she shares her fathers 
enthusiasm for business but not his penchant for pajamaclad 
hobnobbing with the jet set 
what i like to do is have the chance to speak to the national 
press club or lecture on a case study on my management style at the 
harvard business school or host a dinner party for highlevel 
prospective investors she said 
an honors graduate of brandeis university with a degree in 
english and american literature ms hefner joined playboy in 1975 
after working for a year as a journalist for the boston phoenix a 
weekly newspaper 
her parents divorced when she was 3 years old her mother 
mildred remarried and christie used her stepfathers name gunn 
until 1973 when she renewed her relationship with her father and 
took back the hefner name 
ms hefner who lives within walking distance of playboy 
headquarters said she splits her working time between company 
offices in chicago new york and los angeles where her boyfriend 
a television executive resides 
ms hefner calls herself a business person first and 
foremost and a feminist 
i realized many years ago that there would be some people out 
there who would never be satisfied with what i did she said 
my mission in life is not to change everybody in the world my 
mission in life is to make the best of this extraordinary 
opportunity and believe as i do that the vast majority of people 
will judge me honestly and objectively

every morning for the past seven or 
eight years a halfdozen men have met for coffee and cigarettes at 
the oval table in the rear of spring hills only restaurant poplar 
house 
the roundtable as the group of contractors and builders is 
sometimes called has watched with skepticism as the sleepy 
southern town prepares for its transformation into a regional 
automaking center 
spring hill population 1100 is the home of general motors 
corps multibilliondollar saturn plant which is scheduled to 
begin producing cars in 1990 
but whether the investment is paying adequate dividends for 
spring hill is a question that still sparks debate over morning 
coffee here 
saturn is located in a kind of nevernever land on 2450 acres 
that are not taxed by any county town or state government and that 
officially lie in no town 
it is its own empire said james brewer a 68yearold 
engineer who has lived in spring hill for 40 years and is an 
acknowledged leader of the roundtable 
brewer thinks spring hill is missing its chances to cash in on 
the growth saturn will bring to the area once its 3000 employees 
begin work 
he abhors mayor george jones efforts to toughen development 
laws which impose impact fees on new building and make it harder 
for developers to erect fastfood restaurants convenience stores 
and the like 
one regulation that particularly bothers brewer is a new 
ordinance that restricts the size of business signs to 2 feet by 2 
feet 
everyone agrees they want to ensure their quality of life but 
to brewer quality of life includes fast food and the fast 
development that has been experienced by other southern boom towns 
theyre not doing anything to encourage people brewer said 
of the towns stance toward developers 
to the mayor quality of life comes with controlled growth for 
example he views the erratic building that has occurred around 
nashville in the past 10 years as incompatible with spring hills 
goals if prepared spring hill can avoid the overburdened roads 
and services that frustrate nashville residents jones said 
gm announced in 1985 that it would build a 5 billion plant in 
spring hill as a joint venture with the united auto workers the 
state anxious to land the plant promised to build a 50 million 
highway to the town and provide 20 million to train workers the 
plant would need 
almost all the saturn employees will be uaw members who were 
laid off in other states by gm 
in return saturn agreed to make payments in lieu of taxes to 
maury county which distributes money to neighboring towns 
land speculation cooled somewhat when gm said it would halve its 
planned production at the plant to 250000 cars a year in fact 
more homes were built in 1980 before saturn arrived than in 1987 
but for every fallow field in spring hill there is a realtors sign 
advertising its availability and even the skeptics admit the place 
is bound to change as the startup date for saturn nears 
within two years the town will probably be unrecognizable 
developers have begun submitting plans to build tracts of homes for 
the newcomers the largest proposal yet by developer howell r 
pettigrew of arlington texas proposes building about 3100 
multifamily homes and 1000 singlefamily homes on 11000 acres off 
the saturn parkway over a 20year period 
pettigrew also plans to develop 195 acres for commercial use and 
270 acres for industrial use said steve campbell who is working 
on the proposal for pettigrew 
its advanced spring hill probably 10 to 20 years already 
mayor jones said of saturns effect on the town 
the town has advanced in jones view by increasing its police 
force from two to seven fulltime officers by building a town hall 
to grow into and by updating its zoning regulations 
the 12 million town hall built with money from saturn moved 
out of its oneroom trailer which was also donated by saturn to a 
building on a 165acre complex on a hill off main street called 
the town center at spring hill the development eventually will 
feature restaurants stores and multifamily homes 
despite such plans contractor ray williams is among those who 
believe spring hill is chasing away developers by requiring them to 
pay impact fees for services 
the only thing ive ever built in spring hill is my house and 
thatll probably be the only thing i ever build williams said 
williams like brewer believes landowners should be able to do 
as they please with their land farmers dont want people telling 
them what to do said williams 
zoning regulations such as the one governing sign size 
discourage prosperity he said 
everybody in the country wants to go to las vegas to see those 
signs but who in the hell wants to go to spring hill 
spring hill resident don hickman an engineer with south central 
bell is one who views the slow lurch into the future gladly 
in the long term spring hill will be a very attractive place 
to live because of the strict zoning laws were not faced with the 
tenement type projects he said 
we may have some lean years in spring hill but in the long 
run its going to pay off

the manufacturing site for the saturn 
car lies between the towns of spring hill and columbia obscured 
from view by a manmade rolling hillside bordered by a bright white 
picket fence 
after saturn arrived both towns annexed land as close to the 
plant as possible to take advantage of the housing and commercial 
development that will follow the completion of a new parkway to the 
plant 
despite their neighborly proximity townspeople know little 
about what goes on inside the compound saturn officials say the 
town wanted them to place the plant out of view while their 
neighbors occasionally grumble that they are being intentionally 
shut out 
but saturn is intended to be a mystery a successful topsecret 
weapon against import cars general motors corp which funds 
saturn as a subsidiary rather than a division of the company 
expects the plant to turn a profit immediately said laurie kay a 
spokeswoman for saturn 
almost a fourth of the plant has been completed since 
construction began in june 1987 saturn plans to offer a family of 
saturn cars subcompact and compacts in 1990 for the 1991 model 
year ms kay said 
state legislators who visited the sprawling site in march viewed 
the halfcompleted powertrain building where car engines and 
transmissions will be built construction also has begun on three 
other buildings where cars will be assembled and painted before 
rolling off the line 
part of the plan to make saturn competitive with imports 
involves approaching production work differently and saturn 
officials along with their partners in the venture 
representatives of the united auto workers union are adopting 
management techniques developed by the japanese said ms kay 
employees will be involved in all aspects of production from 
understanding the cost of supplies to sales she said 
they will be on salaries rather than the traditional hourly wage 
rates with 20 percent of their pay based on the performance of the 
company ms kay said 
saturn jobs will first be offered to the estimated 300000 uaw 
members who have been laid off around the united states by gm said 
ms kay about 6000 people have applied for the 3000 jobs that 
are to be filled by mid1989 
the plant is designed to produce 250000 cars a year initially 
gm plans to increase production depending on the autos reception 
by car buyers 
saturn has begun reviewing about 1700 applications for a 
network of dealerships which are expected to reach 123 cities by 
the end of the first model year 
saturn has sent employees to japan to study japanese automaking 
procedures as well as to germany said ms kay 
were looking very hard at everything were not inventing 
everything she said 
we are taking a fresh look at what we do

soybean futures prices opened sharply higher 
today on the chicago board of trade in reaction to the agriculture 
departments latest supplyanddemand estimates grain futures were 
mixed 
the soybean markets early gains of as much as 9 cents a bushel 
were expected after the usda revised downward its estimate of the 
us soybean stockpile predicting stocks would dwindle from 275 
million bushels on this aug 31 to 145 million bushels a year later 
the usda also reduced its estimate for this years brazilian 
soybean harvest to 176 million metric tons from 18 million metric 
tons 
this adds to the general feeling or perception that soybean 
stocks are shrinking very quickly said walter spilka an analyst 
in new york with smith barney harris upham amp co 
the usda report issued tuesday afternoon was considered 
neutral for corn futures which opened slightly higher and was 
construed as somewhat bearish for wheat 
the government predicted this years winter wheat harvest would 
be about 4 percent larger than last years and that prediction 
weighed on wheat futures this morning spilka said 
in early trading wheat was 1 cents to 2 cents lower with the 
contract for delivery in may at 301 a bushel corn was cent to 
1 cent higher with may at 199 a bushel oats were cent lower 
to cent higher with may at 162 a bushel soybeans were 6 cents 
to 9 cents higher with may at 714 a bushel 
cattle futures were mostly lower and pork futures were higher in 
early trading on the chicago mercantile exchange 
live cattle were unchanged to 37 cent lower with june at 78280 
cents a pound feeder cattle were 232 cent lower to 65 cent 
higher with may at 7997 cents a pound hogs were 17 cent to 53

the stock market was holding steady at sharply 
lower levels at around midday today weakened by investors anxiety 
about the prospect of higher interest rates 
the dow jones average of 30 industrials was down 3996 points at 
196369 at noon edt close to its level of an hour earlier but 
widened from its initial losses 
the broader market also showed deep declines losing stocks 
outstripped advancers by about 6to1 on the new york stock 
exchange with 1269 issues losing only 182 gaining and 372 
unchanged 
volume on the big board was 10335 million shares up from 6195 
million traded by the same time on tuesday 
the anxiety about higher interest rates was fueled today by 
comments by british chancellor of the exchequer nigel lawson that 
there could be an internationally coordinated boost in rates 
lawson who made the comments in an interview with the wall 
street journals overseas editions that was published today noted 
that a coordinated effort by west germany japan and other leading 
nations to hike interest rates is certainly possible following 
the federal reserves increase in shortterm rates to curb us 
inflation 
separately white house economist beryl sprinkel confirmed that 
the fed has nudged up shortterm rates in recent weeks he defended 
the move as making sense in the face of a strong economy and recent 
growth in the money supply 
some observers and market players expect the fed to raise its 
key discount rate the interest it charges big financial 
institutions possibly this week 
market analysts point out that hauntingly similar jitters about 
rising interest rates were a big factor behind octobers stock 
collapse and those memories are still fresh in the minds of 
nervous investors 
the major problem with the stock market has been the rise in 
rates said larry wachtel an analyst for prudentialbache 
securities inc 
the nyses composite index was down 220 at 14355 
at the american stock exchange the market value index had lost

former treasury secretary donald t regan 
called on congress today to ban index arbitrage trading saying the 
computerdriven transactions are undermining public confidence in 
the stock market 
i dont think its too extreme to say that overall confidence 
in our free market system is threatened by this sort of scandal 
regan told the senate banking committee and thats what it is 
a scandal 
regan former chief executive of wall streets merrill lynch amp 
co has been the focus of attention recently for a book he has 
written on his years as white house chief of staff under president 
reagan most attention has been drawn to his revelation that first 
lady nancy reagan regularly consulted an astrologer about the 
presidents schedule 
before regan spoke sen alfonse damato rny read regans 
horoscope to him which said that he could not force colleagues 
to be more understanding until may 17 
regan did not respond but said later that his testimony comes 
at an interesting time in terms of my own personal activities 
regan said that program trading is fundamentally changing and 
endangering the basis on which our economy and stock market have 
functioned for generations 
he said that although individuals still own most stocks 
institutions in recent years have dominated trading 
if the public feels that the markets are rigged not only in 
favor of the big guy but also in favor of some unidentified 
computerbased trading strategy then confidence in our markets 
indeed in our system will plummet regan said 
regan called on the nations financial markets and the federal 
agencies that regulate them to impose their own restrictions on 
program trading 
in index arbitrage traders use computers to profit from price 
discrepancies between the stock and futures markets by 
simultaneously buying in one market and selling in the other 
at the same hearing charles r schwab who heads his own 
discount brokerage firm said program trading should be totally 
abolished 
the individual investor in this country is angry schwab 
said most of all he is angry about washingtons failure to 
enact reforms needed to promote greater stability in the securities 
markets 
regan and schwabs comments came a day after five big wall 
street firms announced they have halted index arbitrage trading for 
their own accounts as a means of restoring investor confidence in 
the stock market 
however leo melamed chairman of the executive committee of the 
board of governors of the chicago mercantile exchange defended 
index arbitrage today at a breakfast meeting with reporters in 
washington 
he acknowledged that some individual investors believe program 
trading destabilizes the market but he maintained that index 
arbitrage does just the opposite because it ensurse that stock and 
futures prices closely track each other 
im not going to defend perception he said the reality 
is it is not a factor in the volatility index arbitrage was and 
is a stabilizing factor 
i dont believe theres many individual investors who 
understand the issue he added 
the chicago mercantile exchange trades the most popular futures 
contract which is based on the standard and poors 500

companies with fewer than 100 workers increased 
employment at a faster rate than large businesses during the latter 
half of 1987 but the number of new small firms decreased sharply 
during the period according to a study released wednesday 
employment among small companies rose by 19 percent during the 
last six months of 1987 compared with an increase of 06 percent 
for larger businesses a study by the american express small 
business partnership showed 
the partnership charts small business growth based on data from 
7 million companies with fewer than 100 employees 
during the latter half of 1987 new small business 
incorporations plunged 771 percent 
sales of small business goods and services increased by 106 
percent during the period compared with an increase of 013 
percent for their larger counterparts the rate is down however 
from the 127 percent increase in sales small businesses reported 
during the first half of 1987 
david birch who heads the small business partnership noted 
that small businesses held up well during this uncertain economic 
period 
he noted that the first half of 1987 was a period of 
uncharacteristically high levels of new business startups and 
therefore any decline in the latter half should be considered in 
context 
small businesses in the pacific states posted the greatest 
growth with employment up 226 percent and sales up 152 percent 
those in the south atlantic region had the highest gain in 
employment which rose 231 percent and a 125 percent increase in 
sales

stock prices closed sharply lower wednesday as 
players dumped shares amid fears of higher interest rates 
the financial timesstock exchange 100stock index closed down 
358 points or 2 percent at 17568 
volume was a hefty 5755 million shares compared with tuesdays 
3975 million 
stock prices opened lower as the market bearishly interpreted a 
comment from chancellor of the exchequer nigel lawson that major 
industrialized nations might coordinate a worldwide hike in 
interest rates 
the comment published in european editions of the wall street 
journal pressured london for most of the session 
during the day the newspaper issued a statement saying it had 
failed to fully report lawsons remarks 
meanwhile chase manhattan bank boosted its prime lending rate a 
half percentage point to 9 percent the first increase since just 
before the stock market crash in october 
however charles larkham an equity analyst with the london 
investment firm james capel and co ltd said we dont think 
its the beginning of a major lurch lower in stock prices 
another dealer said the rampant takeover talk that had fueled 
the london market over the last month had run out of steam 
the market had been spoiling for a selloff for quite some 
time and when no takeover bids panned out players liquidated 
their positions he said 
a lower finish in tokyo earlier wednesday added to the downward 
pressure several analysts said 
a few bargain hunters were spotted late in the day attempting to 
take advantage of the sharply lower prices but the market failed 
to make a significant turnaround dealers said 
prices didnt have the stomach to bounce back by the end of

share prices dropped on wall street today as 
anxiety about the prospect for higher interest rates was heightened 
by a rise in the prime lending rate by two major banks 
the dow jones average of 30 industrials was down 4427 points at 
195938 at 2 pm edt widened from its losses earlier in the

the broader market also showed deep declines losing stocks

volume on the big board was 13882 million shares 
citibank and chase manhattan bank boosted their prime rates by a 
half percentage point to 9 percent they were the first increases 
in the prime since just before octobers stock market collapse 
chase was the first big bank to raise the key rate which is 
watched closely because bankers use it as a base rate for loans to 
many businesses and for consumer loans including mortgages 
chases move was announced around noon today after wall street had 
already sustained sharp losses on interestrate fears 
it tends to reduce confidence in the stock market said hugh 
johnson senior vice president of first albany corp in albany 
ny referring to the increase in the prime rate 
higher interest rates by raising the cost of borrowing tend to 
dampen companies expansion plans and investments

a brazilian delegation seeking to renegotiate 
debt repayments may be able to reach a preliminary agreement with a 
committee of international banks soon the bank panels chairman 
says 
according to citicorp william r rhodes a bank official who is 
chairman of the 14bank committee said in a speech tuesday in 
washington that the committee had reached preliminary agreement 
on nearly all major items in the talks he said he expected an 
overall agreement within a week or two but added it could take 
longer 
under negotiation is a 62 billion debtrestructuring package 
the largest ever undertaken which would cover more than half of 
brazils 112 billion foreign debt 
according to the text of his speech rhodes said that if a final 
agreement could be worked out it would bring brazil fully 
current on interest payments to commercial banks 
for the past month rhodes told the council of the americas 
in washington i have been estimating that we would complete our 
negotiations on a preliminary agreement within a week or so were 
breaking new ground in some areas which makes predictions on 
timing difficult however we are very close 
rhodes said the negotiators were working on stretching out 
payments due on 62 million in debt over the next 20 years rather 
than the eight years called for under the original loans 
the points agreed to so far rhodes said include new loans 
totaling 52 billion to cover brazilian external financing for 
1987 through the first half of 1989 
he said the world banks participation in the package will be 
significant and the most extensive since the package negotiated 
with mexico in 1986 and will include substantial cofinancing of 
commercial bank loans 
rhodes noted that brazil has been the focal point of the debt 
crisis for the last year or so beginning with its moratorium on 
interest payments to commercials banks declared in february 1987 
he said that some economists estimate that the moratorium cost 
the country at least one to two billion dollars when the banks 
retaliated by cutting off shortterm credits and taking other 
measures

share prices dropped on wall street today as 
several major banks raised their prime lending rates and confirmed 
investors fears about higher interest rates 
the dow jones average of 30 industrials was down 3896 points at 
196469 at 3 pm edt 
the broader market also showed deep declines losing stocks 
outstripped advancers by about 7to1 on the new york stock 
exchange with 1380 issues losing only 214 gaining and 351 
unchanged 
volume on the big board was 1542 million shares 
more than a halfdozen big us banks boosted their prime rates 
by a half percentage point to 9 percent the first increase in the 
prime since just before octobers stock market collapse 
chase manhattan bank was the first big bank to raise the key 
rate which is watched closely because bankers use it as a base 
rate for loans to many businesses and for consumer loans including 
mortgages chases move was announced around noon today after wall 
street had already sustained sharp losses on interestrate fears 
it clearly hit a raw nerve this market was clearly 
vulnerable said monte gordon vice president and director of 
research for dreyfus corp 
the hike in the prime came against a background of growing 
edginess about the outlook for interest rates 
british chancellor of the exchequer nigel lawson indicated 
earlier today that there could be an internationally coordinated 
boost in rates 
lawson who made the comments in an interview with the wall 
street journals overseas editions that was published today noted 
that a coordinated effort by west germany japan and other leading 
nations to hike interest rates is certainly possible following 
the federal reserves increase in shortterm rates to curb us 
inflation 
separately white house economist beryl sprinkel confirmed that 
the fed has nudged up shortterm rates in recent weeks he defended 
the move as making sense in the face of a strong economy and recent 
growth in the money supply 
some observers and market players expect the fed to raise its 
key discount rate the interest it charges big financial 
institutions possibly this week 
higher interest rates by raising the cost of borrowing tend to 
dampen companies expansion plans and investments

soybean futures prices closed sharply higher 
wednesday on the chicago board of trade in reaction to the 
agriculture departments latest supply and demand report grain 
futures retreated slightly 
the surge in soybean prices was expected after the usda in a 
report issued tuesday afternoon predicted the us soybean 
stockpile would dwindle from 275 million bushels this aug 31 to 
145 million bushels a year later 
the usda also reduced its estimate for this years brazilian 
soybean harvest from 18 million metric tons to 176 million metric 
tons a smaller brazilian harvest could increase world demand for 
us soybeans 
this just reaffirms the uptrend in the market and the bullish 
attitude of the trade in the soybean complex particularly in the 
beans said walter spilka an analyst in new york with smith 
barney harris upham amp co 
tuesdays usda report was seen as neutral for corn futures 
which finished modestly lower in wednesdays session 
the government predicted this years winter wheat harvest would 
be about 4 percent larger than last years and that prediction 
weighed on wheat futures wednesday spilka said 
at the close wheat was cent to 1 cents lower with the 
contract for delivery in may at 303 a bushel corn was 2 cents to 
3 cents lower with may at 197 a bushel oats were 3 cents to 
3 cents lower with may at 158 a bushel soybeans were 4 cents to 
9 cents higher with may at 712 a bushel

consumers confidence rebounded in april 
suggesting consumer spending will remain strong in coming months 
the conference board said wednesday 
the business research organization said its index of consumer 
confidence rose to 1146 in april from 1127 in march leaving it 
just below its level of 1149 in february 
the index peaked at 1157 in september the month before the 
stock market crash that was its highest level in 15 years 
the index based on a monthly survey of 5000 households is 
considered an important indicator for the economy because consumer 
spending accounts for twothirds of the gross national product 
consumers have been spending cautiously in recent months and 
analysts have attributed their hesitance in part to concerns about 
the economy 
the base year for the consumer confidence index was 1985 when 
it was at 100 its margin of error is plus or minus 2 or 25 
points meaning the change from march to april is near the limit of 
the margin of error

foreign secretary sir geoffrey howe said wednesday 
the swiss government must be prepared to allow british companies to 
make takeover bids in switzerland without legal restrictions if 
swiss companies expect to be able to buy up british concerns 
swiss companies for example expect to make takeovers in our 
market their government must ensure british firms can make 
takeovers in theirs said howe at an agricultural forum in london 
the foreign secretary made no direct mention of the 21 billion 
pound or 397 billion hostile takeover offer by the swiss 
chocolate company nestle sa for yorkbased rowntree plc a 
british confectioner 
jacobs suchard sa another swiss confectioner also has built 
up a 299 percent stake in rowntree 
the moves have been highly controversial in britain because 
swiss companies are protected from takeover by swiss law 
swiss companies are eager to buy operations within the european 
economic community of which switzerland is not a member to better 
take advantage of the lack of barriers to takeovers 
howe said the eecs plan to create a single barrierfree 
european market by 1992 would make takeovers more of a twoway 
process

democrats stepped up their challenge wednesday 
to president reagan on trade threatening an allout fight until 
the november elections unless he drops his veto threat and signs a 
1000page trade measure 
dont turn your back on americas future mr president dont 
give american men and women a pink slip senate majority leader 
robert c byrd dwva said at a congressional billsigning 
ceremony 
the signing and a capitol hill rally held outside democratic 
national headquarters were parts of a show of political muscle 
orchestrated by house speaker jim wright dtexas as a sendoff for 
the bill before it goes to the presidents desk 
with 15 television cameras trained on him and scores of baffled 
tourists wandering through wright signed the massive bill at a 
ceremony in ornate statuary hall near the house chamber supporters 
of the legislation applauded and wright passed out pens that were 
used in the ceremony 
senate president pro tempore john stennis dmiss was expected 
to sign the measure quickly and return it to wright for delivery to 
the white house democratic leaders indicated they planned to have 
it there by the end of the week 
wednesdays ceremonies clearly were aimed at casting the bill in 
a flattering light and thus make a veto sound all the more harsh 
democrats said the issue was bound to strike a resonant chord on 
the campaign trail party chairman paul kirk said voters would 
rally to the banner of the democratic party in house and senate 
races 
on hand for the rally were lawmakers their aides religious and 
labor leaders and a handful of laidoff workers brought in by the 
aflcio for the occasion republicans were absent 
at the bills signing rep dan rostenkowski dill the 
chairman of the housesenate conference committee that drew up the 
bill urged reagan to sign the measure 
there have been recurrent reports of friction between 
rostenkowski and wright over provisions of the bill that appeared 
to guarantee a veto notable among them has been a feature 
requiring companies with at least 100 employees to give 60day 
notice of plant closings and major layoffs 
rostenkowskis office said he had not been invited to the rally 
but our nose isnt out of joint about it and neither should yours 
be press secretary jim jaffe said he said the affair was 
being blown up 
in explaining his veto plan reagan has pinpointed the 
plantclosings provision as well as the bills curbs on alaska oil 
exports 
at the white house spokesman marlin fitzwater reaffirmed that 
reagan will veto the bill 
the trade bill was one of the items discussed by reagan in a 
private meeting with republican leaders of congress afterward 
talking with reporters in the white house driveway senate minority 
leader bob dole rkan expressed confidence that the veto will be 
sustained 
house minority leader bob michel rill said that after 
reagans veto is upheld the house could move very quickly to 
enact a replacement bill minus the provisions on alaskan oil and 
plantclosing notification 
the centerpiece of the bill are provisions that would overhaul 
the system under which the united states uses trade restrictions to 
aid us industries threatened by imports and retaliate against 
international trade violations for example authority to order 
retaliatory tariffs and quotas would be transferred from the 
president to the us trade representative 
the bill has hundreds of other provisions ranging from a 
potential 2 billion in agricultural subsidies to repeal of the 
windfall profits tax on oil company earnings 
at the rally wright described house majority leader thomas 
foley dwash as the architect of the legislation foley said 
the support of americans for the plantclosings feature were 
indicated in every poll but he did not cite any specific poll 
results and a morning news conference at which pollsters were 
supposed to release results was canceled 
the legislation passed the house 312107 a margin more than 
enough to override the expected veto but it won final passage in 
the senate on april 27 three votes short of the twothirds needed 
for an override and democrats were still uncertain of just where 
they would find the additional support 
well consult the stars sen john kerry dmass said 
wryly 
the bill won final passage on april 27 but has been sitting on 
capitol hill while the democrats tried in vain to win over two 
votes for a veto override by reopening the measure and stripping 
out its restrictions on alaska oil exports

share prices dropped on wall street today as 
several major banks raised their prime lending rates and confirmed 
investors fears about higher interest rates 
about a dozen big us banks boosted their prime rates by a half 
percentage point to 9 percent the first increase in the prime 
since just before octobers stock market collapse 
market analysts point out that hauntingly similar jitters about 
rising interest rates were a big factor behind the oct 19 crash 
and those memories are still fresh in the minds of nervous 
investors 
the major problem with the stock market has been the rise in 
rates said larry wachtel an analyst for prudentialbache 
securities inc 
chase manhattan bank was the first big bank to raise the key 
rate which is watched closely because bankers use it as a base 
rate for loans to many businesses and for consumer loans including

procter amp gamble co is testing colored 
diapers blue for boys pink for girls in several states to see 
if pastels catch on for babys bottoms 
the diapers which bear the luvs deluxe brand name also include 
extra padding in the front for boys diapers and in the middle for 
the girls version 
the padding is part of a patented system aimed at better 
absorption pampg spokeswoman carol boyd said wednesday the 
padding is just placed a little differently she said 
the diapers are being made available in kansas oklahoma 
missouri arkansas and evansville ind as part of a market test 
ms boyd said pampg will see how well theyre accepted before 
deciding whether to market them across the country 
its too soon to know whether or not these diapers will be 
available nationally she said consumers ultimately will be 
the ones to judge 
parents comments prompted pampg to offer the colored diapers ms 
boyd said adding that its the first time the company has 
attempted such an experment parents are the ones who told us 
that they liked that it was a fashion decision she said 
cincinnatibased procter amp gamble has been locked in a tight 
competition with kimberlyclark for the lead in disposable diaper 
sales pampg held twothirds of the 3 billion us retail market at 
the start of the decade but its pampers brand slipped behind 
kimberlyclarks huggies in 1985 good sales by the luvs brand 
helped pampg maintain the overall lead 
pampg recaptured 60 percent of the market by 1986 with aggressive 
marketing and product changes 
pampg lost a legal battle with kimberlyclark last year when a 
jury in dallas ruled that the elasticized waistband in huggies 
disposables was not a patent infringement pampg had asked for an 
injunction to stop kimberlyclark from making elasticized huggies 
saying the diapers violated pampgs patent for heatshrinkable 
material used in the huggies waistbands

the first spike in banklending rates since the 
october stock market crash jolted wall street on wednesday 
heralding a period of more expensive loans for purchases ranging 
from plant machinery to homes and cars 
several big banks pressured by increased costs of borrowing 
money themselves raised their prime lending rate from 85 percent 
to 9 percent nearly erasing the results of three rate decreases 
over the past seven months chase manhattan bank led the move and 
was followed by competitors 
the prime rate lags behind more subtle increases in interest 
rates elsewhere but the rate is closely watched because bankers 
use it as a basis for calculating loans to businesses as well as 
determining many types of consumer loans including increasingly 
popular homeequity loans 
stock traders reacted badly to the rate rise partly because it 
aroused memories of the higher interest rates that preceded the 
stock crash the dow jones industrial average fell 3780 points to 
a threemonth low of 196585 
the last time banks raised the prime rate was in september when 
it went from 875 percent to 925 percent the rate retreated to 9 
percent on oct 22 two days after the black monday stock collapse 
it fell to 875 percent nov 5 and to 85 percent feb 2 
the primerate increase partly reflected moves by the federal 
reserve the nations central bank to nudge interest rates higher 
in order to forestall sharp increases in inflation that many 
analysts fear might accompany recent surprisingly strong economic 
growth 
the clearest evidence of that growth came last week when the 
labor department said unemployment had hit a 14year low this 
suggested worker shortages will rise pushing up wages and 
intensifying demands for goods and services that increase the cost 
of living and doing business many economists said 
interest rates are going up now basically because the fed 
dragged and dragged its feet and finally was presented with 
incontrovertible evidence that the economy was doing well perhaps 
too well said robert brusca chief economist for nikko 
securities international inc in new york so the fed couldnt 
just sit by and do nothing 
sandra shaber an economist at the futures group a 
washingtonbased forcasting firm said the prime rate increase 
would have a broader effect now than in years past because it is no 
longer just a benchmark rate for new loans to a banks best 
corporate customers 
what does it mean for consumers once upon a time the impact 
would have been limited she said but now because of the 
increased use of homeequity loans and other adjustable rates even 
people who have current debt outstanding they feel the effects 
their financing costs rise it squeezes their discretionary 
spending in general 
the fed has two fundamental choices in trying to balance 
economic growth and inflation it can control the amount of money 
in the banking system and can adjust its key lending fee to 
financial institutions known as the discount rate that rate has 
stood at 6 percent since sept 4 
economists said it was clear the fed had recently tightened the 
amount of money in the banking system but some doubted the fed 
would act quickly to raise the discount rate which would be 
considered a much stronger sign of tightening 
my guess is the fed will not try to push interest rates up 
beyond current levels said david blitzer chief economist for 
standard amp poors corp a major investment research and 
creditrating concern 
there will be concern about the impact on the economy 
especially in housing and auto sales he said secondly the 
inflation fears are a little bit overdone 
some economists said the low unemployment rates did not 
necessarily mean impending inflation they argued that despite 
record numbers of people working wages generally have not been 
rising 
others said it was clear that higher prices are looming partly 
because of the increased cost of oil grain and other commodities 
as well as the impact of a lower dollar which makes imports more 
expensive 
nevertheless many economists agreed the fed would remain 
extremely reluctant to push up interest rates sharply and risk a 
recession especially in an election year 
they also said the central bank had learned from the 
doubledigit inflation experience of the late 1970s that a little 
tightening now eliminates the need for more severe action later 
the fed understands if you let this process get out of hand 
then you have a very hard time stopping it and you need incredibly 
high interest rates brusca said it wants to tap the brakes a 
little bit rather than slam them on in a great fury

the dollar got a boost from rising interest 
rates and closed higher against most major currencies in domestic 
trading wednesday after dipping overseas 
gold prices were mixed republic national bank of new york said 
gold bullion was bid at 44880 a troy ounce as of 4 pm edt down 
from 44960 late tuesday 
the dollar began its climb shortly after noon when the first of 
a number of major banks announced they would hike their prime 
lending rates to 9 percent from 85 percent 
frank watson a vice president at swiss bank corp noted that 
the increase had been expected still traders had to buy dollars 
to cover their positions the dollar also was supported by 
indications that the federal reserve has tightened credit the 
dollar cannot go a lot lower in this environment of higher interest 
rates said ronald holzer chief dealer at harris trust and 
savings bank in chicago 
trading was relatively dull and volume was light 
the foreign exchange market appeared little affected by a report 
that britains chancellor of the exchequer nigel lawson said major 
industrialized nations might coordinate a worldwide hike in 
interest rates 
the comment published in overseas editions of the wall street 
journal sent the stock markets into a tailspin although the 
newspaper issued a statement saying it had failed to fully report 
lawsons remarks 
people were looking at the comments but didnt know what he 
meant holzer said 
traders could interpret the comments several ways if the 
stock market really came off that could mean a flight to quality 
by investors and thats bullish for the dollar watson said 
but its bearish for the dollar if interest rates rise in 
europe and japan 
trading was quite in europe as many banks wound down their 
operations ahead of thursdays ascension day holiday which is 
observed by several countries 
in tokyo the dollar fell 039 yen to a closing 12424 yen

much of the gi generation that fought in world 
war ii and returned home to create an economic and baby boom is 
retiring in relative comfort a florida researcher reports 
more than half of retirees age 65 to 74 have income at double 
the poverty level and 12 percent form an elite with income from at 
least three sources according to charles f longino of the 
university of miami 
but elderly affluence isnt spread evenly across the nation 
longino reports in the june edition of american demographics 
magazine 
there are a cluster of states with a large share of the 
comfortably retired longino said in analyzing 1980 census data 
the most recent information available with sufficient detail for 
the study 
connecticut florida hawaii nevada and new jersey had many of 
the comfortably retired while the pension elite made strong 
showings in connecticut and washington longino found 
the poverty level for a family of four was 8414 in 1980 
the world war ii gis reaped the benefits of government programs 
that provided educations and home loans costofliving escalators 
for their social security benefits and federal laws protecting 
private pensions longino noted in addition many were able to 
invest in stocks and bonds in a time of booming economy 
longino looked at three groups of retirees in his study those 
aged 55 to 64 6574 and 75 and over in 1980 he termed them the gi 
generation after the term government issue which became a 
popular for soldiers in the 1940s 
just over half 511 percent of those in the 6574 age group 
were listed as comfortable and 123 percent were in the elite 
elite 
for the younger group 591 percent were comfortable and 47 
percent were in the elite they were less likely to qualify as 
elite since few were receiving social security in addition to other 
retirement benefits 
the oldest group listed 375 percent as comfortable and 85 
percent as elite few in this group had incomegenerating assets 
and most completed a large share of their working lives before 
world war ii when pension benefits were less common and lower 
longino found the confortably retired of the 6574 age group in 
such resort and retirement states as florida nevada and new 
jersey in connecticut where many new york executives have 
retired and hawaii 
hawaii has a large asian population where extended families are 
more common a situation which boosts the household income measure 
used as the basis for this calculation longino noted 
for the pension elite connecticut and washington placed well 
as did florida maryland new jersey longino also noted that there 
are clusters of affluent elderly in some metropolitan areas 
he cited as examples fort lauderdale and palm beach fla san 
diego and palm springs calif and along the east coast of mobile 
bay ala 
longino is director of the center for social research in aging 
at the university of miami and his work was partially funded by 
the american association of retired persons american demographics 
published by dow jones amp co inc reports on population matters 
here is a statebystate rundown of the percentage of americans 
aged 6574 who are considered confortably retired or among the 
pension elite

the commodity futures trading commission on 
wednesday approved a new stock index futures contract for the first 
time since the october stock market crash 
the commission voted unanimously to permit the chicago board of 
trade to trade contracts based on the chicago board of options 
exchange 250 stock index and the cboe 50 stock index 
the action came only a day after five big wall street firms 
announced that customer concerns about stock market volatility had 
prompted them to stop for their own accounts a form of futures 
trading known as index arbitrage 
in index arbitrage pension funds mutual funds and other 
institutional investors use computers to profit from momentary 
price discrepancies between the stock and futures markets by 
simultaneously buying in one market and selling in the other 
the securities and exchange commission which governs the stock 
market has blamed index arbitrage for accelerating the oct 19 
stock crash and for the continuing vulnerability of the market to 
wild price swings 
former treasury secretary donald regan told the senate banking 
committee on wednesday stock index trading should be suspended 
however wendy l gramm chairwoman of the cftc defended 
futures index trading as important and beneficial to our 
economic and financial system 
commission member robert r davis said the cftcs approval of 
the contracts wednesday will illustrate that while the events of 
last october raise important policy issues we are not prepared to 
let competing market factions use government regulatory authority 
to provide special status and competitive position to any faction 
to the detriment of the broader public interest 
the cboe 50 and cboe 250 are weighted indexes based on the 
largest 50 and largest 250 stocks traded on the new york stock 
exchange a rival to the cbot the chicago mercantile exchange 
trades futures contracts based on the largest 100 and largest 500 
stocks on the nyse 
stock index futures allow an investor to buy a group of stocks 
and to hedge the risk by purchasing offsetting futures contracts 
the improvement in risk management afforded by the trading of 
stock index contracts rebounds to the interest of millions of small 
investors who rely on institutions to manage their savings ms 
gramm said in a statement 
she said the fears of some individual investors have made 
futures trading a perceptual issue but she said the way to 
address it is through education of the public not by blocking 
innovative products that can improve market efficiency

the latest repurchase plan included 52 million shares snapped 
up in the wake of last octobers stock market crash when scores of 
companies bought back their own shares to help stave off further 
price declines 
martin s davis chairman and chief executive officer said the 
buybacks had enhanced shareholder value by giving each 
shareholder increased ownership of the company 
since the initial buyback was launched in 1983 about 44 million 
shares have been repurchased at an average price of slightly over 
21 a share the company said gulf amp western said it had about 118 
million shares of common stock outstanding after adjustment for a

stock prices dropped sharply wednesday in edgy 
trading weakened by fears of higher interest rates that pushed the 
dow jones industrial average to a threemonth low 
the key index of 30 premier stocks slid 3780 points to 
196585 its lowest closing level since it closed at 196154 on 
feb 11 most of the slippage occurred early in the session 
losing issues outstripped gainers by about 7to1 on the new 
york stock exchange with 1363 issues declining 238 advancing and 
367 unchanged 
big board volume totaled 17672 million shares up from 1312 
million tuesday 
wall streets fear of higher interest rates were aggravated by 
an announcement from big banks that they had raised their key prime 
lending rate from 85 percent to 9 percent the first rise since 
the october crash 
hauntingly similar jitters about rising interest rates were a 
big factor behind the crash and those memories are still fresh in 
the minds of nervous investors 
in addition higher interest rates by raising the cost of 
borrowing tend to dampen companies expansion plans and 
investments 
the major problem with the stock market has been the rise in 
rates said larry wachtel an analyst for prudentialbache 
securities inc 
chase manhattan bank was the first big bank to raise the key 
rate which is watched closely because bankers use it as a base 
rate for loans to many businesses and for consumer loans including 
some types of mortgages 
it clearly hit a raw nerve this market was clearly 
vulnerable said monte gordon vice president and director of 
research for dreyfus corp 
the hike in the prime came against a background of growing 
edginess about the outlook for interest rates 
british chancellor of the exchequer nigel lawson reportedly 
suggested that there could be an internationally coordinated boost 
in rates 
lawson who was quoted in an interview with the wall street 
journals overseas edition wednesday noted that a coordinated 
effort by west germany japan and other leading nations to hike 
interest rates is certainly possible following the federal 
reserves increase in shortterm rates to curb us inflation 
separately white house economist beryl sprinkel confirmed that 
the fed has nudged up shortterm rates in recent weeks

pork futures prices rose sharply wednesday on a combination of 
technical factors and indications that a seasonal downturn in hog 
supplies had begun analysts said 
on other markets cattle futures were mostly higher stockindex 
futures fell sharply and preciousmetals futures dipped as the 
prime lending rate rose soybeans posted strong gains while grains 
were lower and energy futures advanced 
the rally in pork futures on the chicago mercantile exchange was 
powered mainly by technical buying based on traders analyses of 
price charts market analysts said 
for example heavy buying occurred and selling interest 
evaporated each time the contract for june delivery of hogs moved 
above tuesdays high price of 5197 cents a pound said charles 
richardson an analyst in denver with lindwaldock amp co 
on the fundamental side some traders believed the annual drop 
in hog supplies had begun said chuck levitt an analyst in chicago 
with shearson lehman hutton inc 
more pigs are born in the fall than at any other time of year 
and most of those animals have been sold for slaughter by late 
spring levitt said 
since monday the hog flow has dried up considerably and some 
people feel this is the start of the seasonal move he said 
the drop in supplies means higher prices but we can also 
expect an increase in volatility levitt said the size of 
todays advance is already giving us a prelude to that 
cattle futures advanced in line with higher cash prices but 
traders were cautious about establishing new positions ahead of 
mondays monthly cattleonfeed report from the agriculture 
department analysts said 
live cattle settled 10 cent lower to 62 cent higher with the 
contract for delivery in june at 7342 cents a pound feeder cattle 
were 20 cent lower to 90 cent higher with may at 80 cents a 
pound hogs were 32 cent to 138 cent higher with june at 5277 
cents a pound frozen pork bellies were 35 cent to 175 cents 
higher with may at 5307 cents a pound 
stockindex futures plunged along with stock prices as big banks 
raised their prime lending rates from 85 percent to 9 percent it 
was the first increase in the closely watched rate since the 
october stock market crash 
standard amp poors 500 stockindex futures on the chicago 
mercantile exchange registered early losses in reaction to a sharp 
drop in worldwide stock prices caused by interest rate fears 
analysts said 
the second jolt came at midday when us banks began announcing 
higher prime lending rates 
the market did not react well to the increase in interest 
rates said robert ray an analyst in chicago with dean witter 
reynolds inc 
the contract for june delivery of the sampp 500 index settled 520 
points lower at 25340 
the preciousmetals markets also registered disappointment at 
the rise in interest rates but they absorbed the news in a matter 
of hours then began moving higher and finished nearly unchanged 
the markets were aware that beyond the negatives of a higher 
prime rate is the feeling that it fuels inflation and thats 
bullish for the precious metals said bette raptopoulos metals 
analyst for prudentialbache securities inc in new york 
on new yorks commodity exchange gold settled 40 cents lower 
across the board with june at 45120 a troy ounce silver was 18 
cents to 2 cents lower with may at 6552 a troy ounce 
soybean futures prices soared as much as 9 cents a bushel on 
the chicago board of trade in reaction to the agriculture 
departments latest supply and demand report grain futures 
retreated slightly 
the surge in soybean prices was expected after the usda in a 
report tuesday afternoon predicted the us soybean stockpile 
would dwindle from 275 million bushels this aug 31 to 145 million 
bushels a year later 
the report was seen as neutral for corn futures which finished 
modestly lower in wednesdays session 
the government predicted this years winter wheat harvest would 
be about 4 percent larger than last years and that prediction 
weighed on wheat futures wednesday analysts said 
wheat settled cent to 1 cents lower with may at 303 a 
bushel corn was 2 cents to 3 cents lower with may at 197 a 
bushel oats were 3 cents to 3 cents lower with may at 158 a 
bushel soybeans were 4 cents to 9 cents higher with may at 712 
a bushel 
energy futures prices were mostly higher in quiet trading on the 
new york mercantile exchange unleaded gasoline made the greatest 
gains because of a report showing heavy drawdowns of supplies over 
the past week analysts said 
west texas intermediate crude oil settled 3 cents to 18 cents 
higher with june at 1749 a barrel heating oil was 28 cent lower 
to 44 cent higher with june at 4746 cents a gallon unleaded 
gasoline was 20 cent to 63 cent higher with june at 5225 cents a 
gallon

british chancellor of the exchequer nigel lawsons comments that 
there could be an internationally coordinated boost in interest 
rates sent a rush of worry through world securities markets 
wednesday 
lawson who made the comments in an interview with the wall 
street journals overseas editions noted that a coordinated effort 
by west germany japan and other leading nations to hike interest 
rates is certainly possible following the federal reserves 
increase in shortterm rates to curb us inflation 
the journal later issued a statement saying it had not fully 
reported lawsons comments 
separately white house economist beryl sprinkel confirmed that 
the federal reserve has nudged up shortterm rates in recent weeks 
he defended the move as making sense in the face of a strong 
economy and recent growth in the money supply 
in reports published wednesday in overseas editions of the wall 
street journal lawson noted we did have very close coordination 
in the immediate aftermath of octobers stock market collapse 
the journal said later in a statement it had failed to fully 
report lawsons remarks 
in an interview lawson was asked if there is a possibility 
that governments may act in a coordinated way to raise rates in the 
near future as they have done to lower rates in the past he 
replied in part that is certainly possible the statement 
said 
however the article failed to note that in response to a 
followup question about the chances of coordinated interest rate 
rises in the near future lawson would only state what i am 
saying is that we do keep very closely in touch with each other i 
wouldnt go further than that 
in tokyo the journal report sent stock prices tumbling the key 
225share nikkei index fell 25120 points or 092 percent to 
close at 2716105 
the remarks by lawson came at a bad time with the market 
already worried about the us refunding said a trader in tokyo 
referring to the quarterly sale of 26 billion in notes and bonds 
the threeday sale ends thursday 
share prices also headed lower in london and frankfurt 
prices on many bond markets also moved lower in response to the 
comments by both lawson and sprinkel sending interest rates 
higher traders said us treasuries british west german and 
japanese government issues all fell after the reports circulated 
in new york the bellwether 30year issue eased slightly in the 
early going 
bond prices move in the opposite direction as interest rates 
several central banks refused to comment on the lawson remarks 
any action by the federal reserve to increase interest rates 
would affect the us dollar lawson noted west germany and japan 
have resisted boosting their interest rates ahead of a us rate 
hike for fear of weakening the dollar 
in his interview with the journal lawson also dismissed market 
concern that the united states would resume a handsoff approach to 
the dollar after the upcoming presidential election and allow the 
dollar to fall again 
lawson predicted the group of seven major industrialized nations 
would maintain their commitment to stabilize the dollar 
currency traders in new york dismissed lawsons comments and 
the dollar continued to move in narrow directionless activity

the aflcio on wednesday said a new 13 
million broadcast advertising campaign was designed to show that 
unions like their workers are interested in fairness justice and 
life outside the job 
the ads which all end with a chorus singing america works 
best when we say union yes have begun appearing on the 
television networks and in 13 local markets the 30second spots 
are expected to reach more than nine out of 10 of all american 
homes at least four times 
radio spots will be aired as well including one that urges 
listeners to ask congress to override president reagans expected 
veto of the trade legislation unions have been pushing a provision 
of the bill requiring mandatory notice of plant closings for large 
companies 
at a closedcircuit tv news conference to the 13 cities where 
the tv ads will be shown aflcio president lane kirkland said 
the labor movement has a long welldocumented record of fighting 
for the rights and the standard of living of working americans but 
in spite of that there are still many americans who have serious 
misconceptions about what unions do and about whether or not they 
are necessary in todays work place 
the goal of union yes he said is to talk directly with 
american workers about the value of unions in the work place today 
one of the best ways to do that now is through television 
morton bahr president of the communications workers of america 
told reporters in washington that the ads fill a need to let the 
population at large know what the trade union movement stands for 
he said many americans have a stereotype of unions and union 
members they see a heavyset fellow smoking a cigar and wearing a 
500 suit 
one commercial focuses on women with a woman saying unions have 
ensured fairness in promotions another obviously pregnant woman 
says that because of unions she will be able to take time off to 
have her baby and come back to a job 
the first phase of the ad campaign runs through midjune the 
second phase picks up on labor day in september the campaign 
which is paid for with union dues is expected to last two years 
the ads will star actors jack lemmon tyne daly and howard 
hesseman 
local tv ads will run during may and june in new york los 
angeles chicago philadelphia san francisco boston detroit 
cleveland pittsburgh washington atlanta nashville tenn and
