deep in a mangrove swamp near the gulf of 
mexico archaeologists have discovered traces of what could be 
another ancient mexican civilization 
so far the only clues to these mysterious people are a fourton 
stele or stone slab covered with hieroglyphic writing and a 
19inchhigh clay figure of a fertilityrite priest 
but says fernando winfield capitaine director of the 
xalapa museum of anthropology the finds are so promising that 
the museum is planning to mount an expedition to that area of 
veracruz state in cooperation with the national geographic 
society 
the stele was found in november 1986 it is covered with 
inscriptions in an unknown language but with some mayan numerals 
the priest in the clay figure is wearing the human skin of a 
flayed sacrificial victim 
both are about 1800 years old 
that would place them in the second century ad which is 
after the archaeological olmecs who flourished in the area from 
around 1050 to 500 bc and before the mayas who emerged around 
the fourth century ad winfield said in an interview 
adding to the intrigue the mayas lived in the yucatan 
peninsula more than 700 miles to the east winfield said at the 
museum in xalapa where the stele and figure are kept 
but there are two dates on the stele in mayan writing in 
their socalled long count calendar made up of dots and bars 
equivalent to may 22 143 ad and july 13 156 ad winfield 
said 
if the mysterious people did exist winfield said they also 
appeared to be unrelated to the other two of the four known 
civilizations that inhabited the gulf coast the totonacas who 
emerged around the seventh century ad in the area where the 
artifacts were found or the huaxtecas farther north about one 
century later 
they could be the xicalancas of which clavijero briefly 
talked about winfield said referring to the rev francisco 
javier francisco javier clavijero 17311787 a jesuit priest who 
was the first to systematically study mexicos ancient languages 
and peoples 
in his history of ancient mexico clavijero in three lines 
briefly mentioned the xicalanca civilization in relation to the 
olmecs but did not go into details 
in nahuatl the trading language of the aztecs who came 
much later xicalanca means the people who live by the great body 
of salt water as the gulf of mexico was called 
the two artifacts were found within 130 feet of each other in 
the village of la mojarra where the piojo river meets the acula 
river the crocodileinfested region is so swampy that it can be 
reached only by boat winfield said 
la mojarra with a population of fewer than 200 is up the acula 
about 20 miles south of the port of alvarado in veracruz state but 
neither the village nor the piojo river can be found on any map of 
mexico 
carved in relief on the previously polished stele which is of 
basalt one of the worlds hardest rocks is the full length 
profile of a regal figure a man about 25 years old holding out in 
both hands a vessel in a gesture of offering 
he was probably a ruler or a chief warrior or a high priest 
or maybe all three since that was the custom in the gulf region 
in ancient times winfield said 
the figure wears earstops a tall headdress adorned with four 
representations of something like a rain god trimmed with eight 
feathers and a breastplate full of other allegorical figures over 
what appears to be a pleated cotton shirt or tunic 
a total of 577 glyphs or picturewords divided into 21 neat 
rows running from top to bottom plus 33 elements like the 
raingod representations cover the rest of the slab 
it was all carved during one continuous period winfield 
said it was a single piece of work it is the oldest and richest 
piece of writing found yet about this area of ancient mexico 
about 7 feet tall slightly oblong and with a gently rounded 
top the stele once stood on the right bank of the acula just 
outside la mojarra 
over the years erosion toppled it and it lay in the river 
until a fisherman discovered it and dragged it out with the help of 
villagers 
archaeologists retrieved the stele but winfield said he kept 
the find quiet for two years so work could proceed without the 
pressure that such a discovery creates 
the second piece the ceramic figure of a priest made with the 
regions thick orange clay has a square base it is the only one 
of two artifacts from that area with a base the other also in the 
museum is so badly damaged it cannot be studied winfield said 
in the la mojarra figure only the head is missing 
that type of clay figure was very popular among the four gulf 
cultures the aztecs called it in xipe totec or the lord of the 
flayed and it was variously worshiped as the god of spring of 
fertility of abundance and of the metalworkers 
a peasant at la mojarra found the shattered figure many years 
ago while digging the foundations for his house and kept the pieces 
in a cardboard box 
we got wind of it three weeks ago and we convinced him to let 
the museum have it winfield said 
winfield suspects the la mojarra area could have been a 
ceremonial site 
if so there surely must be more stele and artifacts to be 
found he said

when the albion tornado roared toward 
east state street three years ago earl rice ran to warn his wife 
ruth on their front porch when i saw the wind pick her up and 
throw her over the rail 
across the street the rev robert j reilly prayed hard as the 
gathering winds sucked him toward a secondfloor window and his 
strength ebbed 
next door 5yearold katie steff screamed tornado coming 
as her father samuel huddled the family above their funeral home 
in a moment of eerie silence a few seconds later steff knew they 
were in the eye of the huge twister 
fortyone tornadoes including nine of the highest intensities 
swept through pennsylvania ohio new york and ontario during eight 
hours of may 31 1985 killing 88 people and injuring more than 
1000 
the tornado outbreak worst since april 1975 caused 450 
million in property damage in the united states 
of the dead 62 were killed in their houses or mobile homes and 
a disproportionate number 15 were between 66 and 70 years old 
according to the national weather service 
the albion tornado was among the worst packing winds estimated 
at up to 260 miles per hour as it fell upon farmland on the 
ohiopennsylvania border the twister estimated at 1200 feet 
across quickly moved northeast through this pleasant crossroads 
town near lake erie on a 14mile tear that killed 12 people 
i watch the sky now just like everyone else mayor bonda 
dahlin said recently tornadoes were oklahoma texas nebraska 
kind of things but i dont think its something well ever 
forget 
people here still cringe the minute theres a dark cloud in 
the sky theres such anticipation said borough secretary paul 
mcknight 
rice 72 a retired railroad worker heard the first frantic 
warnings on the police scanner and ran to the door to see his wife 
get swept away he woke up trapped in his own house 
i started hollering rice recalled there were timbers all 
over me the beams were across my legs and i couldnt move they 
tried to jack up the beams but that just put more pressure on my 
legs then they got a chain saw and cut the beams in half and 
pulled me out 
rice suffered only cuts and bruises his wife suffered broken 
arms and a dislocated shoulder 
reilly 68 pastor of st lawrence roman catholic church was in 
his rectorys living room when the roof went off and the windows 
went out 
i kind of spreadeagled in front of the window as the thing 
began to suck me out i grabbed anything i just hung on until it 
ended reilly said i asked god to make it that i was ready to 
meet him 
the church and rectory were destroyed but two days later reilly 
said mass under a tarpaulin in the ruins 
steff 43 a mortician gathered his wife four daughters and a 
friend in the family room of their secondfloor apartment katie 
screamed just as albions fire siren began to wail 
then something hit the house and we all got into the bathroom 
things just bombarded the building steff recalled then we 
heard a silence just for a second like in the eye of a hurricane 
then everything hit us from the other side patty my wife opened 
the door of the family room and it was gone 
the steffs business and home were destroyed a 200000 loss 
steff ran across the street to help free cathy gibson from her 
threestory victorian house which was down 
i called into the debris to tell her help was coming steff 
said later she told me she was never so glad to hear an 
undertakers voice 
a deputy erie county coroner steff helped set up a morgue at 
northwestern high school they brought in 11 bodies 
today the tornados southwesttonortheast path can be clearly 
seen in rebuilt splitlevel houses and new mobile homes grassy 
lots and sharply pruned oak trees that make the east side of albion 
look like a new subdivision 
it was only a few months ago mcknight said that he closed 
the books on albions claims with federal and state disaster 
officials 
mayor dahlin estimated that fewer than 200 of the towns 1800 
people moved away after the tornado because of memories lack of 
money or whatever 
people are getting on with their lives she said 
businesses are being rebuilt changing hands and there are new 
ones 
reillys modern new 400seat church is linked by a glass 
breezeway to a new threebedroom rectory behind a new recreation 
building stands in red brick the complex cost 11 million he 
said 
one of the greatest experiences of my life as tragic as it 
was was to see the spirit of the people of this town they took a 
tragic blow they rebuilt the town reilly said 
its almost profane to say it was a good thing but the bottom 
line is that the community is stronger and closer knit and the town 
is even physically better with all the new construction he said 
the steffs fully insured rebuilt their small funeral home with 
two viewing rooms but took the opportunity to move their living 
quarters to a house in another part of town 
we shed our tears over it were trying to get our lives 
together you can dwell on the negatives but the positives are the 
concern and the love of the community steff said 
when i walked out the door that day i knew i was going to 
stay 
the rices built a modern twobedroom splitlevel house its 
starting to feel like home rice said with a shrug 
you still think about it last september i had an operation 
for cancer and when i was in the recovery room i thought i was 
still under the house he said 
i dont want to see another one

at times carlos salinas de gortari sounds 
too much like a reformer to be the presidential candidate of the 
institutional revolutionary party which has governed mexico since 
1929 
the 40yearold candidate preaches democratic reforms and clean 
elections as he campaigns not so much for the office which he is 
certain to win but to regain his partys lost credibility 
salinas de gortari whose thick black moustache and balding head 
feature prominently in political cartoons is described by those 
close to him as a pragmatist influenced strongly by his harvard 
education 
before his nomination last fall as a candidate in the july 6 
election he was president miguel de la madrids budget and 
planning secretary a key figure in developing the economic 
austerity programs that have prevailed in mexico since 1982 
salinas de gortari has strong family ties to the northern state 
of nuevo leon home to political conservatives who oppose the 
guided economy and government controls dear to governing party 
ideologues in mexico city 
some foes within the party felt salinas de gortari would be 
identified too strongly with the business sector and with 
conservative groups within the party 
but this has worked to the partys advantage salinas de gortari 
has managed to bring private business back into the party fold by 
advocating fewer government controls and urging business leaders to 
join the government in the battle for world markets 
the time is past when the state was the instrument to solve 
all of societys problems he told a cheering crowd at a recent 
meeting of business leaders in monterrey nuevo leons capital 
he also wants more foreign investment to modernize mexico 
technologically 
what he says agrees with what private business thinks mexico 
must be said agustin legorreta president of the business 
coordinating council 
mexican business traditionally has identified with the 
conservative national action party although it must maintain a 
close relationship with government agencies 
salinas de gortari speaks confidently of the resurgence of 
mexico the country has a 105 billion foreign debt but has 
renegotiated it and is keeping up payments 
last month in puebla a politically conservative state in 
central mexico salinas de gortari upset some party officials with 
his call for reforms 
the citizens vote must be respected he said the party 
will defend its victories but it must accept its defeats 
he also promised reforms to encourage more independent judiciary 
and legislative branches 
let us lead the democratic reform the country demands he 
stated 
the political reforms may be difficult because they imply the 
acceptance by the pri of electoral losses and the consequent loss 
of power of local or regional party bosses 
the party never has lost a presidential election or 
gubernatorial race in any of mexicos 31 states since its founding 
it is generally conceded in mexico that the governing party wins 
elections but it often is criticized for winning by more than 
the necessary votes by stuffing ballots to claim overwhelming 
victories 
there is a great internal debate going on now said a source 
close to the candidate salinas de gortari is demanding elections 
free of fraud and there is a lot of pressure being put on local 
party leaders to be more democratic 
this year with the country in the middle of a serious economic 
crisis and an increasingly vociferous opposition that includes a 
dissident group led by former party leaders those close to salinas 
de gortari believe reforms have a good chance in his sixyear term 
it is better in the long run to win by a small margin than to 
announce we won by a large margin and lose all credibility said 
a source in salinas entourage during a recent campaign trip 
some pri officials privately admit the party may even lose a 
senate seat something that has never happened before 
de la madrid won the elections in 1982 for the pri with an 
official 71 percent of the vote a figure many considered 
exaggerated pri officials now predict salinas de gortari may win 
the july 6 election with a more realistic 55 percent to 60 percent 
of the votes 
we do not know if he will have the freedom to do what he wants 
to do said alejandro junco publisher of the newspaper el norte 
of monterrey and a frequent government critic but we are 
condemned to be optimistic evey six years

first her married name was chiseled 
off her tombstone three times later the stone vanished and so did 
its replacement 
even in death sylvia plath is not at peace 
the admired american poet lies in an unmarked grave high in the 
yorkshire hills a bleak resting place for a tormented soul who 
killed herself when she was 30 
nobody knows who is tampering with her grave but some suspect 
feminist activists of erasing hughes from the stone in the 
belief that plaths marriage to british poet ted hughes contributed 
to her misery by turning her into a housewife 
plaths reputation has grown since her suicide in 1963 the 
bell jar her semiautobiographical novel has sold 200000 
copies in britain she posthumously won the 1982 pulitzer prize for 
her collected poems 
her grave in heptonstall a clutch of stone houses in the 
austere south pennine hills has become a place of pilgrimage a 
little rosebush grows on it and some modest wreaths and cut 
flowers lie about crows and magpies fly above 
a large granite tombstone once stood on the grave inscribed 
in memory sylvia plath hughes 19321963 
below were two lines of poetry 
even amidst fierce flames 
the golden lotus can be planted 
they were written by hughes now britains poet laureate he was 
estranged from his wife she gassed herself in their london 
apartment feb 11 1963 
in february of last year residents say two women were seen 
picking the lead letters of the hughes name off the tombstone they 
said the name had been removed twice before 
the stone then disappeared 
we get visitors from all over the world to see the grave and 
they come in to say they cant find it it seems a shame said 
judith parish who runs the newspaper shop 
i think feminists interfered with the inscription because they 
object to the addition of hughes name to sylvias said elaine 
connell a local teacher 
some people think hughes was somehow to blame in his wifes 
death because he left her to cope with the children miss connell 
said she said a local newspaper had reported the tombstone was 
removed for restoration 
but that was hardly true as only the one name had been picked 
off and the tombstone was never returned she said 
the question of feminist involvement was raised again after the 
publication this year of sylvia plath a biography by linda 
wagnermartin professor of english at michigan state university 
hughes 57 was reportedly furious with wagnermartin for 
writing that he left his wife to do the housework and raise the 
couples two children while he pursued his career 
hughes was recognized as a fine poet when he married plath after 
they met in 1956 at cambridge university and critics say his 
influence deepened his wifes poetic creativeness 
the poet who remarried 18 years ago never talks to the media 
and his sister olwyn who sometimes speaks for him did not return 
phone calls 
the sunday times of london reported in march that hughes sent it 
a 15page rebuttal of wagnermartins book after reading an early 
draft of it 
hughes conceded that plath may have resented his comparative 
freedom but insisted that to suggest she was jealous of his 
poetic ability would be a major misjudgment of her character 
the paper said 
wagnermartin told the associated press that she felt hughes was 
not sensitive enough to his wifes needs in the last months of 
their marriage 
i saw her daily calendar of the things she had to do like 
mowing cooking and shopping and there was no suggestion that ted 
was going to help with them the professor said 
however critic frank kermode reviewing the biography in 
londons sunday telegraph wrote surely the enemies she had to 
deal with werent housewifely duties and the selfishness of men 
but interior demons much more terrible 
plaths bestknown poems dealt with illness suffering and death 
she had already survived a suicide attempt at age 20 
she is buried near hughes parents outside the churchyard wall 
of st thomas the apostle 
i was told that it took some pressure to get a tombstone and 
it was only put on her grave five or six years after the burial 
wagnermartin said i have no idea who interfered with the stone 
and the grave but i am sure it is not the people of yorkshire 
villager ronald eveleigh 76 a retired engineer and admirer of 
plaths poetry said he made a border of little stones around the 
grave when the tombstone disappeared 
i also got larger stones and scratched or painted the name of 
sylvia plath on them so the grave could be identified by visitors 
but those were taken away eight times altogether he said 
eveleighs wife evelyn said she tried to discover who was 
responsible for the grave 
i couldnt find out and it seemed the church authorities were 
being evasive she said adding i presume its up to ted 
hughes 
the rev john harrison vicar of heptonstall confirmed that the 
hughes family was responsible for the upkeep of the grave 
the gravestone was removed last year because of vandalism i 
have no idea if the stone is going to be replaced he said

nancy reagan and raisa gorbachev toured kremlin 
churches sunday holding hands and dismissing their reported feuds 
as rumors but when talk turned to religious activities the 
soviet first lady abruptly cut the conversation short 
while president reagan and general secretary gorbachev squared 
off over human rights inside the kremlins great palace the two 
women wore smiles and strolled handinhand toward the cameras in 
an attempt to put to rest the stories about the tense relationship 
that emerged from their last meeting at the washington summit 
weve gotten along very well every other time a smiling 
mrs reagan said in response to queries about the supposed frosty 
relationship 
the soviet first lady true to the forthright style she 
displayed at the white house chimed in at length and insisted that 
she considered such reports frivolous 
rumors have it and there was a question that there is some 
misunderstanding between myself and the presidents wife she 
replied through an interpreter i would like to say i think 
its not serious 
mrs gorbachev said her contacts with mrs reagan have been part 
of the ongoing improvement in relations between the two 
superpowers we do have a lot to talk about and we are going to 
have something to remember which is very important i welcome mrs 
reagan here and the president to moscow she said 
at one point mrs reagan was asked whether former white house 
chief of staff donald t regan incorrectly portrayed her in his 
book as having asked after an extended dinner lecture from mrs 
gorbachev who does that dame think she is 
mrs reagan with an icy stare replied curtly yes 
even though the two women offered nearly constant smiles the 
first lady did display a bit of the impatience shed shown during 
the washington summit as mrs gorbachev maintained an extensive 
dialogue with the press corps 
during a tour of the kremlins sunsplashed cathedral square and 
its ancient goldendomed stone churches the two first ladies were 
often shouldertoshoulder pointing at the sights and talking 
through interpreters abot the fortress collection of buildings 
that served as the residence places of worship and tombs of the 
czars 
mrs gorbachev attired in a fitted winter white wool suit and 
dark suede high heels repeatedly patted the back of her neck to 
smooth her closelycropped red hair on her left shoulder she wore 
a gold and greenstone firebird a famous figure in russian fairy 
tales mrs reagan wore a blackandwhite checked oscar de la renta 
twopiece suit complete with black patent heels and purse and 
white pique bowed blouse all set off by a matching set of gold and 
black bracelets sparling earrings and a large stone ring 
the soviet first lady quickly took charge of the tour as she put 
her arm about mrs reagans waist and guided her about the inside 
the 14th century cathedral of the assumption the largest and one 
of the oldest churchesturned muesums in the kremlin 
the vaulted stone church crowned with five gilded domes has 
40foot high walls covered with a rich collection of priceless 
paintings and icons that show scenes from the life of christ and 
the virgin mary it is the repository of the finest and most 
revered icons in russia some dating from the 12th century brought 
to the church and restored 
after they entered the cathedral mrs gorbachev was asked about 
what she wanted to tell the american people about what the summit 
should produce 
peace and friendship and that they understand the soviet 
people she replied asked what else the former university 
lecturer shot back what do you mean what else thats the most 
important thing 
mrs reagan appearing a bit bewildered was asked her 
impressions of the soviet union wonderful very exciting its a 
little overwhelming she replied eyes wide and blinking 
at that point mrs gorbachev interrupted insisting please 
i beg you allow us to see the cathedral 
the soviet first lady then guided mrs reagan from reporters and 
launched into a lecture about the religious paintings that adorned 
the golden wall that divides the church sanctuary from its main 
hall as they reached one icon depicting a sorrowful virgin and the 
infant jesus touching the mothers cheek mrs gorbachev remarked 
that it was one of the most beloved images in the nation 
very very very maternal mrs reagan remarked 
mrs reagan then turned from mrs gorbachev and towards the 
interpreter asking now let me finish and she queried whether 
the cathedral was used mainly as a museum or for religious 
activities 
nyet responded mrs gorbachev to which the first lady 
quickly replied oh yes nyet the word nyet that i 
understand 
mrs gorbachev then added that there had been no religious 
observances in the cathedral since 1918 but the interpreter 
apparently corrected the date to 1917 
it has obviously a very religious feeling mrs reagan said 
softly of the paintings she then turned to mrs gorbachev and 
asked if it were true that a concert was planned for the cathedral 
during next months celebration of the millenium the observance of 
the 1000year anniversary of the spread of christendom to russia 
nyet mrs gorbachev replied curtly putting her arm around 
mrs reagans waist briskly guiding her out the door and jumping 
into a discussion of icons frescoes and wood carvings out of 
reporters earshot 
according to mrs reagans press secretary elaine crispen the 
two women held hands again as they took a walk along the kremlin 
embankment that overlooks the moscow river spectators applauded 
the two women as they strolled about the cobblestone square and 
they then retired to the great kremlin palace where they had tea 
mrs crispen said the two discussed the supposed feud and she 
quoted mrs gorbachev as saying all these rumors are trivial 
stories 
mrs reagan then replied speaking of the media yes but you 
cant get them to change their minds ive told them so many times 
that the rumors are not true mrs crispen quoted her as saying 
the two ladies agreed that what was important was their 
husbands work and the change in relations between their two 
nations mrs crispen said

the pentagon plans to build an experimental 
rocket that would be dropped from a b52 bomber and used to launch 
military satellites into space a newspaper reported sunday 
the threestage winged rocket would be dropped about seven 
miles above the earth and then blast into space placing payloads 
of up to 600 pounds into orbit the new york times reported 
quoting government and industry experts 
officials have said they hope a prototype will fly next year 
the pentagon wants to test the rocket for a program designed to 
develop lightweight satellites and launchers for various military 
uses including spy and communication satellites 
the experimental rocket is being pursued by the defense advanced 
research projects agency which develops futuristic projects for 
the pentagon 
there is concern on capitol hill that the rocket could be 
launched in secrecy the times reported 
although there is an agreement requiring spacefaring countries 
to notify the united nations of all payloads going into orbit the 
rocket could be fired from remote parts of the world far from 
soviet trawlers and spy satellites that monitor military launchings 
from the united states 
the pentagon has given no indication that it would violate the 
treaty obligation but some military officials say privately that 
it would be useful for the united states to have the option of 
quick secret launchings in the event of war 
the lightsat program which includes the rocket is part of a 
fiveyear 240 million effort 
on may 13 the pentagon signed a letter of contractual intent 
with orbital sciences to buy one test rocket with an option for 
five more industry sources say orbital sciences would be joined 
by hercules inc which makes solidfuel rockets 
the threestage solidfuel rocket would weigh 15 tons and 
measure 50 feet in length 
proponents say the airlaunched rocket system would be 
inexpensive less vulnerable to attack than groundbased spaceports 
and ideal for quickly launching small spy satellites to monitor 
fastmoving battles 
donald c latham a former assistant secretary of defense said 
the nation looked into airlaunched rockets 20 years ago and 
found them wanting there are better ways to make systems low cost 
and survivable

president reagan becomes the first us 
leader in 14 years to step foot on soviet soil sunday carrying the 
only superpower treaty to ban an entire class of nuclear weapons 
but the summit was clouded by uncertainties that developed 
saturday when us officials said prospects had faded for signing 
three secondary arms agreements and the soviets harshly criticized 
us aid to afghan rebels 
reagan and his wife nancy were scheduled to board air force one 
midmorning for a 90minute flight to moscow and the presidents 
fourth summit with soviet leader mikhail gorbachev the couple 
planned to bid farewell to finnish president mauno koivisto and his 
wife tellervo at an airport ceremony 
the reagans spent three days in this baltic capital recuperating 
from jet lag and preparing for their historic fiveday visit to 
moscow 
reagans chief of staff howard h baker jr arrived in helsinki 
on an overnight flight from washington bringing with him the newly

baker carried two bulging briefcases into the vip lounge at the 
helsinki airport where he waited to link up with reagan for the 
flight to moscow 
reagan and gorbachev will exchange ratification documents during 
a kremlin ceremony wednesday morning it is the first ratified 
superpower arms treaty in 16 years the first major arms control 
agreement of the reagan administration and the only treaty to ban 
an entire class of nuclear weapons 
the exchange ceremony substitutes for the previously hopedfor 
signing of an agreement slashing by half the arsenals of strategic 
nuclear weapons the most powerful and dangerous in the superpower 
arsenals 
reagan was described saturday by his national security adviser 
lt gen colin powell as well rested and looking forward to 
his first session with the general secretary scheduled withing an 
hour of the presidents arrival 
gorbachev and his wife raisa arranged to greet their american 
guests in the kremlins 200foot long st georges hall a gilded 
and marble reception room on the second floor of the former 
residence of the czars 
as the first ladies planned an afternoon tour of the fortress 
collection of churches apartments and bell towers the two men 
were scheduled to meet over a table in the hall of st catherine at 
the west end of the palace 
the us senate voted 935 on friday to approve the inf treaty 
signed by reagan and gorbachev at their washington december summit 
in a rare televised session the soviet unions collective 
presidency unanimously ratified the pact 17 hours later 
a soviet government spokesman described the action as a very 
good prelude to reagans visit 
but in a presummit snag us officials revealed that chances 
had evaporated for signing an agreement on advance notification of 
ballistic missile tests by the superpowers and they said two 
lesser armscontrol measures may not be ready for signing during 
reagans talks with gorbachev 
the agreements while not major would have given the leaders 
grounds to boast of progress on arms control issues particularly 
in view of the failure of the superpowers to conclude a treaty to 
curb strategic nuclear weapons 
aside from the arms agenda officials said they did not expect 
announceable progress on differences on human rights and 
regional disputes 
asked by reporters in washington about problems with the 
secondary arms agreements baker said nothing will seriously 
detract from the importance of the summit meeting 
soviet officials meanwhile criticized the united states for 
its insistence on sending us aid to afghan rebels after the 
withdrawal of red army troops and they hinted they might halt 
their withdrawal from afghanistan if neighboring pakistan failed to 
stop aiding afghan rebels 
the foreign ministry statement carried by the tass news agency 
and the evening news show vremya took aim at the lavish supplies 
of us arms to pakistan intended specifically for the 
antigovernment afghan forces 
the united states has been supplying afghan rebels with an 
estimated 500 million annually in arms and other military supplies 
channeled through pakistan it has pledged to continue to do so as 
long as the soviet union keeps up its military support of the 
afghan government 
asked about the soviet comments baker told reporters the 
relationship between the united states and the soviet union is 
complex and spans many issues a single summit or four summits as 
weve had now isnt going to solve them all at one time the 
general relationship is better and i think prospects for general 
peace are improved 
gerald ford was the last us president to visit the soviet 
union traveling to the port of vladivostock located on the sea of 
japan in 1974 richard nixon met the same year in moscow with the 
late leonid brezhnev 
reagan in an interview with soviet television broadcast over 
the weekend throughout the soviet union and eastern europe said he 
could not have envisioned a trip to moscow under the soviet 
leadership before gorbachev 
very frankly i have to say i think there is a difference 
between this general secretary and other leaders of your country 
i dont think they had any dreams of perestroika 
gorbachevs program to restructure the nations troubled economy

meaningful assessments as we see it longheld dislikes have been

millenniums history has objectively bound our two countries by a 
common responsibility for the destinies of mankind

the american people welcome the emerging positive changes in our 
relationship and hope that your visit and talks here will be 
productive providing a fresh impetus in all areas of dialogue and 
interaction between our two great nations

understanding cooperation and a safe and stable world this makes 
it incumbent on us to discuss constructively the main aspects of 
disarmament 
the set of issues related to 50 percent cuts in strategic 
offensive arms while preserving the 1972 abm treaty problems of 
eliminating chemical weapons reductions in armed forces and 
conventional armaments in europe cessation of nuclear testing 
the world is also looking to us mr president for responsible 
judgments on other complex issues of today such as the settlement 
of regional conflicts improving international economic relations 
promoting development overcoming backwardness poverty and mass 
diseases and humanitarian problems and of course we shall discuss 
bilateral relations 
our previous meetings have showed that constructive sovietus 
relations are possible the treaty on intermediate and shorter 
range missiles is the most impressive symbol of that but even more 
important and complex problems lie ahead of that 
and so mr president you and i still have a lot of work to do 
and it is good when theres a lot of work to be done and people 
need that work we are ready to do our utmost in these coming days 
in moscow

let me assure you that you can look forward to hospitality 
warmth and good will you will have many meetings with soviet 
people they have a centuriesold history behind them they love 
their land and take pride in their accomplishments 
they resent things that are presently standing in their way and 
they are heatedly discussing how their country can best progress 
they are full of plans for the future 
being ardent patriots soviet people are open to friendship and 
cooperation with all nations they harbor sincere respect for the 
american people and want good relations with your country 
here within the walls of the ancient kremlin where one feels 
the touch of history people are moved to reflect over the 
diversity and greatness of human civilization so may this give 
greater historical depth to the sovietamerican talks to be held 
here infusing them with a sense of mankinds shared destinies

here is a transcript of president reagans 
statement sunday at the opening of his summit with soviet leader 
mikhail s gorbachev 
mr general secretary mrs gorbachev 
mr general secretary thank you for those kind words of welcome 
weve traveled a long road together to reach this moment from 
our first meeting in geneva in november 1985 when i invited you to 
visit me in washington and you invited me to visit moscow 
it was cold that day in geneva and even colder in reykjavik when 
we met the following year to work on the preparations for our 
exchange of visits we faced great obstacles but by the time of 
your visit to washington last december although we still had to 
grapple with difficult issues we had achieved impressive progress 
in all the areas of our common agenda human rights regional 
issues arms reduction and our bilateral relations 
we signed a treaty that will reduce the level of nuclear arms 
for the first time in history by eliminating an entire class of 
us and soviet independent range missiles we agreed on the main 
points of a treaty that will cut in half our arsenals of strategic 
offensive nuclear arms we agreed to conduct a joint experiment 
that would allow us to develop effective ways to verify limits on 
nuclear testing 
we held full and frank discussions and planted the seeds for 
future progress 
it is almost summer and some of those seeds are beginning to 
bear fruit thanks to the hard work we have both done since our last 
meeting including monthly meetings of our foreign ministers and 
the first meeting of our defense ministers 
we have signed the geneva accords providing for the withdrawal 
of all soviet troops from afghanistan and the first withdrawals 
have begun we and our allies have completed technical arrangements 
necessary to begin implementing the inf treaty as soon as it enters 
into force 
for the next major step in arms control reductions in us and 
soviet strategic offense arsenals our negotiators in geneva have 
produced hundreds of pages of joint draft treaty text recording 
our areas of agreement as well as those issues still to be resolved 
our new nuclear risk reduction centers have begun their 
transmissions of routine notifications to reduce the risk of 
conflict our scientists are installing the equipment for our joint 
experiment to verify limits on nuclear testing our experts have 
held broadranging discussions on human rights and important steps 
have been taken in that area 
we have greatly expanded our bilateral exchanges since we signed 
our agreement in 1985 i hope youll agree with me that more of our 
young people need to participate in these exchanges which can do 
so much to lay the basis for mutual understanding in the next 
generation 
i could go on the list of accomplishments goes far beyond what 
many anticipated but i think the message is clear despite clear 
and fundamental differences and despite the frustrations that we 
have encountered our work has begun to produce results 
in the past mr general secretary youve taken note of my 
liking for russian proverbs and so as not to disappoint anyone on 
this visit i thought i would mention a literary saying from your 
past another example of your peoples succinct wisdom 
rodilsya ne toropilsya it was born it wasnt rushed 
mr general secretary we did not rush we have taken our work 
step by step and i have come here to continue that work we both 
know it will not be easy we both know it will not be easy we both 
know there are tremendous hurdles yet to be overcome 
but we also know that it can be done because we share a common 
goal strengthening the framework we have already begun to build 
for a relationship that we can sustain over the long term a 
relationship that will bring genuine benefits to our own peoples 
and to the world 
thank you and god bless you

after paying tribute to the nations war dead 
in a traditional memorial day ceremony a brass band will wend its 
way through a pioneer cemetery monday to salute a 19th century 
madam called the hooker with the heart of gold 
its tongueincheek said ceremony chairman larry 
mcnichols its certainly not a part of the formal program 
mcnichols mother for years brought a yellow rose to mark anna 
wilsons grave as part of a tradition begun by those who had 
benefited from the madams charitable donations 
mcnichols and several friends rekindled interest in the generous 
woman he calls a soiled dove the prospect hill preservation 
brass band has played in her memory each memorial day since 1980 
the 25piece band will visit miss wilsons grave after the 
traditional memorial day observance at prospect hill cemetery 
which sits on a hill near the old oregon trail where thousands of 
pioneers pushed their way west past omaha 
miss wilson ran the citys highestpriced house of illrepute 
for about 30 years she retired from the business in the mid1890s 
investing her money in real estate 
miss wilson died in 1911 soon after giving her former house of 
prostitution to the city for use as a hospital her will left an 
estate valued at 1 million to be divided among the city 
hospitals a mission childrens charities and the cemetery 
the madamturnedphilanthropist is buried among some of the 
leading citizens of her time judges doctors politicians 
ministers and brewery barons 
everybody that was anybody is buried in that cemetery said 
louise baumann president of the cemetery foundation 
details are sparse on the early life of miss wilson born the 
daughter of a baptist minister in georgia in 1835 she achieved 
notoriety soon after arriving in omaha in 1867 the year nebraska 
became a state 
the first territorial capitol was between douglas and farnam 
on ninth street and anna wilsons establishment was right around 
the corner from it mcnichols said 
miss wilson met riverboat gambler dan allen in 1871 they lived 
together unmarried until he died 1884 and they are buried 
sidebyside under a large stone slab 
the wilson house of prostitution was one of several in the 
citys old redlight district a few blocks from the missouri river 
adjacent to what is now downtown omaha

its 2 am in moscow and peter jennings ought to 
be asleep but he isnt hes taping the evening news for abc 
in daylight hours abcs pierre salinger wanders around the 
hotel rossiya with shirttail out cbss charles kuralt dashes 
upstairs to file a story columnist roland evans looks despairingly 
for the cnn studio so he can interview soviet spokesman gennady 
gerasimov and the gofers go for this go for that are 
everywhere 
like invading armies the television networks have moved in 
bringing an entourage of hundreds and a mountain of 
hightechnology their beachhead is the hotel rossiya overlooking 
red square and the kremlin 
and the toughest negotiations of the summit may have preceded 
president reagans arrival here sunday the networks convinced 
soviet authorities to improve the lighting of red square for a 
backdrop on the evening newscasts 
virtually every bigname network personality is vying for summit 
air time 
cbss dan rather wants to put the summit in the context of 
changes under way in the soviet union abcs jennings did some 
manonthestreet interviews tom brokaw of nbc has the only 
terrace anchor station and cnn is the only network shown in soviet 
hotels 
the networks have brought their own satellite dishes microwave 
transmissions walkietalkies telephones electrical generators 
copying machines fax machines and in some cases shipped in 
their food 
be careful radio radiation reads a sign in front of three 
giant satellite dishes outside the rossiya 
abc offered to provide its staff with smoke alarms at the 
rossiya a 3000room hotel where more than 30 people were killed 
in a fatal fire in 1977 it even has a daily newsletter for its 
people entitled moscow newsletter 
uniformed soviet officials pace up and down the rossiyas halls 
where rooms are packed with televisions monitors and other gear 
on the fifth floor the networks built outdoor booths so reporters 
can conduct interviews with the kremlin wall and st basils 
cathedral as a backdrop 
nbc said it plans to broadcast its nightly news live while abc 
and cbs plan something called tape live which provides a 
slight delay thats the middle of the night moscow time 
thus the lighting of st basils took on added import for the 
networks they entered into negotiations with the kremlin moscow 
city officials and gostelradio the soviet broadcast network and 
the lighting crisis was resolved satisfactorily said william lord 
executive director at abctv 
each network has about 100 people in moscow including 
russianspeaking american students who have been recruited to serve 
as everything from office gofers to interpreters 
but for all the trouble and expense network executives say 
serious summit scoops may be difficult to come by in the soviet 
union where bureaucrats and officials arent as sensitive to the 
demands of television 
they are less responsive in terms of time said joe angotti 
an nbc executive producer added cbs executive producer lane 
vernardos when in rome do as the romans do does not work for 
television 
with their own technology television is able to transmit 
directly to a satellite and then back to the united states we 
are independent of the soviets lord said 
but while the american broadcasters along with their european 
and japanese counterparts have tried to stay clear of the soviets 
network executives say the people at gostelradio have given them 
unprecedented leeway 
they really want to cooperate and they are trying to be 
flexible said nbcs angotti 
television reporters say the soviets essentially have kept to 
their presummit pledge that journalists can talk to anybody they 
wish theyve interviewed dissidents took trips outside moscow 
by train and talked with students at moscow state university 
people are more willing to talk about more than they have been 
before rather said 
no one wants to say how much money theyre spending on the 
summit but tom bettag a cbs producer for the nightly news thinks 
its going to be worth it 
weve made a heavy commitment because other news is likely to 
be slight he said congress is on the memorial day vacation 
and there is a hole before the primaries so it will be extremely 
quiet back home

khmer rouge guerrillas denounced as 
stinking and deceitful an announcement by vietnam that it would 
pull 50000 troops from cambodia this year according to a 
broadcast made available sunday 
a communique released saturday by the khmer rouge military 
command said hanoi actually was shifting its troops around cambodia 
in a frantic attempt to counter escalating guerrilla attacks 
vietnam which invaded cambodia in late 1978 is fighting a 
coalition of three resistance groups including the communist khmer 
rouge on thursday it announced a partial pullout of 50000 troops 
to be followed by a total withdrawal in 1990 
vietnam says it has made annual withdrawals since 1982 but the 
united states says the only genuine pullout was in november when 
20000 troops were withdrawn 
the united states estimates vietnam still has 120000 to 125000 
troops in cambodia and says the other troop movements were only 
rotations 
vietnam and the prohanoi regime in cambodia said better 
security in the country made possible the vietnamese reduction 
scheduled to begin next month 
but the khmer rouge communique broadcast over the clandestine 
khmer rouge radio said vietnam this month has been moving troops 
back and forth from one battlefield to another aimlessly like a 
frightened monkey to withstand guerrilla strikes it called the 
claim stinking and deceitful 
there is no sign that the vietnamese enemy is preparing to 
withdraw 50000 troops from cambodia the communique said this 
is more shameless propaganda to deceive world public opinion 
the communique cited details of what it claimed to be vietnamese 
troop movements in recent months 
western analysts regard khmer rouge claims with suspicion and 
most are not verified by independent sources 
on saturday china also said the vietnamese claims of troop 
withdrawal were deceptive 
the khmer rouge is the most powerful of three rebel groups in a 
coalition led by prince norodom sihanouk announcements of the 
vietnamese withdrawal have sparked some fears that the khmer rouge 
could return to power 
the khmer rouge ruled cambodia from 1975 until the vietnamese 
invasion millions of cambodians were killed or died of starvation 
or disease in the regimes attempt to impose radical agrarian 
communism

party for elections scheduled next thursday

in the past two months and there have been 12 assassination

president najib on sunday convened 
afghanistans first parliament in 15 years with a call for moslem 
guerrillas to lay down their arms immediately and take legislative 
seats held open for them 
he said he would not concede any territory to the guerrillas 
who have been fighting his sovietbacked government for a decade 
in a 20minute speech interrupted seven times by applause from 
members of the parliament najib continued his efforts to protray 
himself as no longer the leader of a oneparty state 
the parliament was elected april 14 as part of a government 
effort to widen its base it consists of the house of 
representatives and a 158member senate and replaces the 
revolutionary council as afghanistans lawmaking body 
the guerrilla groups called the elections a farce 
najibs peoples democratic party of afghanistan holds only 46 
seats or 25 percent of the 184 occupied seats in the house of 
representatives but virtually all the rest are held by groups or 
individuals with ties to the government according to foreign 
observers 
two former guerrillas hold what the government calls 
opposition seats 
there are 50 vacant seats that najib says have been left open 
for the guerrillas if they stop fighting the vacancies are for 
electoral districts which are either controlled by the guerrillas 
or are the scenes of heavy fighting 
we are ready to listen to the views of the opposition najib 
said speaking in the pushtu language we are ready to receive 
them in kabul 
a translation was provided in english for foreign diplomats and 
journalists 
the parliament was convened in the ornately columned 
giltceilinged star palace in the foreign ministry compound the 
legislators some in turbans and robes others in western attire 
were brought to the compound in buses guarded by soldiers 
inside the palace no shooting was heard during the opening 
session but each day artillery booms around kabul which sprawls 
on a plain around the bases of several hills 
najib said the signing of an accord last month providing for the 
withdrawal of soviet troops from afghanistan opened new doors for 
peace in afghanistan but he said it does not mean overnight 
peace 
the usbacked guerrillas have not halted their battle despite 
the start of the soviet withdrawal may 15 and they say theyll 
keep fighting as long as najib a former secret police commander 
remains in power 
rocket attacks by the guerrillas have grown more frequent since 
soviet troops started withdrawing the kabul times reported that 
five people were killed in rocket attacks friday 
the parliament opened with a blackbearded clergyman intoning 
verses from the koran and najib prefaced his speech with in the 
name of allah the merciful and almighty 
the afghan president spoke of his desire for a neutral and 
nonaligned nation but he also spoke of continued friendship 
with the soviet union he said his government wanted a mixed 
economy and foreign investment so that all afghans in their shops 
can carry out their work and be sure of their future 
the last parliament met in 1973 the year king zahir shah was 
ousted in a coup by his cousin mohammad daoud daoud was 
assassinated five years later in a coup that installed a 
sovietstyle government

california legislator tom hayden the 
former radical protest leader said at a booksellers convention he 
has revised his thinking about the death penalty 
while being questioned about his recently published book 
reunion a memoir hayden was asked saturday if hes withdrawn 
his opposition to the death penalty 
ive come to a kind of tortured conclusion that im not going 
to lead a fight to repeal the death penalty said hayden a 
democratic assemblyman who represents santa monica 
we live in a society in calfornia that is very open and very 
violent hayden said people who commit murders are generally 
in prison about eight years and then they are back on the streets 
until that is corrected im not going to oppose the death 
penalty 
hayden who is married to actress jane fonda was at the 88th 
annual convention of the american booksellers association to 
promote his book published by random house 
in reunion hayden looks back at the political turbulence of 
the 1960s as the beginning of his disillusionment with government 
then follows through to a renewal of his faith in government 
growing out of the watergate scandal 
its a story that began as a history and it became more 
personal as time went on because i was searching for truth about 
the 60s and about my youth hayden said 
hayden said he believed in the 1960s that america was drifting 
toward a police state 
but after watergate i had to try to understand that many of 
the people who had tried to put me in jail had failed and were 
going to jail themselves

democrats were elated with the photo buried 
in the bsection of the new york times of a crane installing media 
booths in the hall that will host the partys convention this 
summer 
its the appearance of motion things looked like they were 
screwed up and now it looks like things are happening party 
spokesman mike mccurry said only half in jest as he referred to 
the conventions public relations debacle of a week earlier 
mccurry quickly added that the atlanta convention plans are in 
fact on track following a press walkthrough two weeks ago that 
left media representatives with a sinking feeling that things were 
nightmarishly behind schedule 
the party is scurrying to undo the perception that their july 
1821 presidential nominating convention will be a logistics 
disaster and moving to keep that perception from becoming reality 
by way of damage control convention chairman don fowler rushed 
out a letter to all media organizations promising the staff is 
vigorously pursuing appropriate action to respond to questions 
that went unanswered at the walkthrough 
he promised a press packet june 1 to include such information as 
a critical vendor list for necessities like furniture and 
utilities such a list went out about a month earlier at the 
partys 1984 convention 
written materials and informed staff members were on hand to 
reassure the press at a second walkthrough a few days later that 
their concerns are being handled on such matters as housing 
vendors and turnaround credentials that allow reporters to give 
their pass to a colleague when leaving the floor 
emphasis is being placed on the fact there will be an increase 
of 10 to 15 percent above 1984 numbers of media credentials issued 
convention veteran wally podrazik who has handled media 
logistics in past years was brought on board the day of the first 
walkthrough and this weekend will be joined by cynthia myers to 
help with media arrangements 
the person responsible for the mediatour foulup was ousted 
and mccurry who headed the democratic national committee press 
office has assumed overall responsibility as communications 
director for both the party and the convention 
were in a lot better shape than many people suspect 
mccurry insisted 
he and others involved with the convention say the basics 
housing transportation and credentials are more or less 
arranged but the staff members knowledgeable on those matters were 
not at the first media tour on may 16 
it is fair to say we did not put our best foot forward in that 
walkthrough said convention press secretary ruth berry 
the presidential campaigns of michael dukakis and jesse jackson 
however say they are having no problems as they embark on their 
own convention preparations 
all the things we feel we need to do are getting done said 
dukakis spokesman leslie dach 
jackson logistics manager john oleary said he has had nothing 
but cooperation and its basically a wide open door of 
information from the convention officials 
but oleary a veteran convention staffer who managed the hall 
for the 1984 convention in san francisco also said he sees the 
atlanta operation as comparatively behind schedule even in light of 
his observation that democratic conventions are inherently 
complicated disorganized functions 
i wish they would have picked up a greater number of 
experienced people earlier said oleary the convention will 
happen its just a question of how much pain and grief will be 
suffered and by whom 
he noted the drumbeat of concerns being voiced about the size of 
the omni basketball arena which will seat 11000 compared to the 
15000 seating capacity in 1984 at the moscone center hall 
the democrats have solved the problem providing comparatively 
more total seating by using the georgia world congress center 
across the street from the omni for media workspace spillover 
viewing areas via large screens and office and reception rooms 
but that does not mean that spectators and party bigwigs are 
going to be happy being relegated to watching the convention from 
across the street 
the democrats are doing a hard sell to make the wcc seem an 
attractive alternative there said mccurry people can sprawl out 
in comfort instead of being squished in the crowded omni and be 
handed a refreshment by a young democrat 
we are going to be agressively promoting the world congress 
center as a place to hold meetings and briefings and press 
conferences he said 
as for the omni everyone sighed with relief last week when the 
atlanta hawks were edged out of the national basketball association 
playoffs that assured they would not tie up the omni convention 
hall until late june 
thank god the celtics beat the hawks said marcia hale in 
charge of dukakis campaign convention arrangements 
the omni is now available but an access problem remains for the 
world congress center which is booked with a trade convention until 
the first of july 
because of that the media trailers cables and arrangements 
that normally would be done over six or seven weeks will have to be 
completed in just over two weeks said jeff gralnick vice 
president and executive producer of special programming for abc 
news 
gralnick was philosophical about the foulup noting the 
republican convention in new orleans has had no such problems but 
that its axiomatic that republicans are more organized than 
democrats

former city councilman lee cooke handily 
defeated incumbent mayor frank cooksey in his bid for a second 
threeyear term besting the mayor by more than 15 percent of the 
vote in a weekend runoff 
turnout for saturdays election was put at about 20 percent by 
city clerk elden aldridge who said its a lower turnout than 
anything we have had in a number of years i would say its lower 
because of memorial day weekend and people scattered here and 
there 
with all the vote in cooke had 36985 votes or 584 percent 
to 26308 or 416 percent for cooksey 
cooke 43 a former president of this capital citys chamber of 
commerce captured 40 percent of the vote in the may 7 nonpartisan 
primary to advance to the runoff against cooksey 54 who ran 
second in the field of eight with 32 percent 
at issue in the campaign were the citys sagging economy and 
rising taxes and utility rates 
austin was caught in an economic downturn several months into 
cookseys first term and fairly or unfairly the business 
community regarded him as their mortal enemy said dean rindy 
cookseys media adviser 
frank had the misfortune to get elected mayor of disneyland 
just when the power got cut off rindy said 
during the campaign cooksey tried to emphasize his 
accomplishments many of them in the environmental area such as 
the passage of bonds to clean up sewage discharge and the 
implementation of a watershed ordinance 
cooke meanwhile blamed the downturn in the economy on cooksey 
and said the city council with cooksey in the lead was not doing 
enough to keep the budget in line and attract businesses to austin 
he is reported to have spent 364000 on his mayoral bid to 
272000 by cooksey

appeal 
a boulder philharmonic orchestra concert that was to have 
featured members of the denver broncos football team manhandling

20000 tickets were sold to watch chicago bears football legend 
walter payton conduct an orchestra in chicago 
so he set up the concert in which the 100member orchestra would 
play hits from the beatles star wars and bruce springsteen in full 
orchestration with members of the nfls american football 
conference champions on the podium 
among the broncos who had agreed to participate were vance

something wrong

president reagans arrival in moscow was big news 
around the world but thousands of this citys residents seemed 
oblivious to the historic occasion as they basked in the glorious 
spring weather 
as reagans plane touched down in the early afternoon sunday 
the arbat a cobbled pedestrian walkway about a mile long was 
crowded with people strolling watching the street artists and 
standing in line to buy ice cream shishkabobs sundaes soft 
drinks and juice 
even the military officials seemed relaxed as they sauntered 
along the walkway carrying walkietalkies as they mingled with 
pedestrians some sat on wooden park benches in the middle of the 
walkway which had been decorated with freshly planted flowers 
crowds on the walkway lined by 16th century houses were larger 
than those gathered at the foot of the nearby street leading to 
spaso house the home of us ambassador jack matlock where reagan 
and his wife nancy are staying 
although soviet television broadcast the arrival and reagans 
meeting with mikhail s gorbachev live the televisions in the 
window of an electronics store showed cartoons another tv set in a 
crowded snack bar featured a video of tina turner gyrating on stage 
to the tune get back 
the arbat is moscows version of montmartre with scores of 
street artists drawing portraits in charcoal and oil where 
bystanders often crowd around to watch the progression of the work 
artists line the street with their work glowinthedark oil 
painters a few restrained nudes and landscapes 
other forms of entertainment on the arbat are a lone scale with 
people lined up to find out their weight and a childrens show with 
large stuffed farm animals and a live chicken the brown bear 
held a paper summit friendship flag with the starsandstripes and 
the hammer and sickle 
some residents took advantage of sunday to shop as usual there 
were lines to purchase anything from an ice cream cone to a portion 
of red sauercraut to a clump of radishes in some stores there are 
two lines one to pay for an item the other to pick it up 
one popular speciality store served two types of pate sausage 
potato salad and sandwiches

they want to get out of a store or a jampacked subway car

the white house advance team handling nancy reagans schedule 
visited the moscow pet market but decided it wasnt the kind of 
thing the first lady needed to see on her maiden trip to the soviet 
union 
the outdoor market is a fascinating slice of soviet life a huge 
area where people sell dogs cats birds fish mice lizards 
hamsters snails and every kind of animal equipment from dog 
brushes to aquarium cleaners 
held every saturday and sunday the market is definitely not the 
cleanest place in moscow nor the quietest debris from stalls that 
have been torn down litter the area and the dirt floor was covered 
with sawdust all the while the animals carry on the racket of 
barking meowing and tweeting 
the russians carry their pets to the market all kinds of ways 
newborn kittens peer out of gym bags or sleep in cardboard boxes 
and puppies play in playpens generally the habitat is children 
birds seem particularly popular people buy them because they 
are beautiful said the man hawking his white pigeons one 
sellers stuffed at least 20 green yellow and blue parakeets into a 
cage 
the animals while plentiful are not cheap a siamese kitten 
cost about 64 a pug went for 640

the summit press center is located in a modern hotel complex 
built in 1980 as an international trade complex the facility is 
much like the one the americans set up at a hotel in washington for 
the ussoviet summit last december it has banks of telephones 
and telex printers 
americans and soviets officials hold press conferences on 
everything from arms control to the printing of a new book in a 
cavernous room where reporters sit at long tables many typing at 
computers 
reporters use their press passes as collateral to get earphones 
that provide simultaneous translation in english russian spanish 
french and german 
soviets waiters sell cheese salami and ham sandwiches for a 
fee as well as instant coffee no milk or cream pepsi is 
dispensed for free but at one point it ran out 
tables with a range of pamphlets and books on the soviet union 
are available for free the white house also has a press office at 
the center while the us information agency has its own hideaway

is it live or is it bosendorfer 
a rocket scientist and a robotics expert using a 9foot piano 
have teamed up to create an instrument that can record every 
flicker of a virtuosos finger and then improve on it 
the bosendorfer 290 se imperial grand looks like a piano next to 
a computer but behind the keyboard optical sensors tiny electric 
motors and three linked computers form the guts of a frighteningly 
accurate musical instrument 
invented by a wayne stahnke a scientist from the national 
aeronautics and space administrations jet propulsion laboratory in 
pasadena calif the bosendorfer is played like any piano inside 
the instruments are recording even microscopic motions 
once the pianist walks away a punch of a few computer buttons 
brings forth the performance just played depressing the piano keys 
and pedals exactly as the musician did but the bosendorfer can 
also improve on the performance 
in its most straightforward mode the piano listens to a 
live piano performance remembers that performance note for note 
and then reproduces that performance on the very instrument upon 
which that performance was played said john amuedo a recording 
engineer who worked on artificial intelligence projects at the 
massachusetts institute of technology 
the potential for the 100000 instrument a sort of player 
piano for the computer age was immediately apparent to pianist 
frederick moyer and composerproducer gunther schuller who are 
collaborating on the first recording using the bosendorfer 
because the piano records its own performance not with 
microphones but with tiny optical and electronic sensors the 
sometimesdisturbing background noise that can crop up at a live 
performance has no impact on a recording made on the bosendorfer a 
subway car could clatter through the concert hall and it wouldnt 
matter 
once a performance is over the hall could be cleared and the 
performance could be played amid silence or the piano could be 
shipped to a recording studio where the keys could be punched to 
bring forth the performance with all its spontaneity and energy but 
none of the background noise 
with the push of a few computer keys the handlers of the 
bosendorfer can correct the tiniest of errors mistakes inaudible 
to the human ear but visible among the numbers and symbols on the 
computer terminal 
it raises a kind of moral aesthetic question as to how perfect 
you want to make your recording said schuller you can make it 
so perfect that it becomes almost inhuman 
in march moyer performed mussorgskys pictures at an 
exhibition and several short pieces by mendelssohn at wellesley 
college afterward schuller and amuedo went to work on the editing 
and found on the computer screen the inevitable tiny errors that 
even the best of pianists make 
moyers performance the first cassette disc using the 
bosendorfer is to be released this fall on gm recordings 
amuedo defends the editing capabilities of the instrument as 
merely improving techniques already widely used by recording 
engineers record producers edit recordings heavily even live 
recordings he argues the bosendorfer merely makes the process 
easier and cleaner nor he said is the idea of a noteperfect 
recording anything new as anyone who has heard a player piano 
knows 
using existing techniques a pianist could play a passage 
beautifully but make one mistake correcting the error would 
require tossing out the wellplayed section and replaying it with 
the bosendorfer engineers merely have to plug in the correct note 
schuller also sees the bosendorfer as an unparalleled teaching 
tool pianists can listen to their own playing exactly as it sounds 
on the piano and the computer can slow down a performance without 
affecting the pitch of a note allowing pianists to judge their own 
execution of rapid passages 
amuedo is unconcerned the bosendorfer will kill the market for 
live performances with all their errors a tiny mistake passes 
unnoticed in a live performance he said on a record that is heard 
several times it can become an annoyance 
no amount of editing is going to salvage a musically bad 
performance amuedo said when vladimir horowitz gets up and 
plays he makes lots and lots of mistakes and yet still people pay 
20 and 30 to hear him play because he makes music out of those 
mistakes

a senior adviser to soviet leader mikhail s 
gorbachev charged at the start of summit talks sunday that the 
united states had rejected a pair of soviet proposals aimed at 
clearing the way for drastic reductions in longrange nuclear 
missiles 
the accusation came as gorbachev welcomed president reagan to 
the moscow summit with an appeal to end nuclear testing and 
preserve the 1972 antiballistic missile treaty which would limit 
the presidents star wars plan for a spacebased missile defense 
system 
reagan responded that us and soviet negotiators are making 
progress toward a treaty reducing strategic weapons by as much as 
50 percent citing other joint efforts to ease eastwest tensions 
the president said that our work has begun to produce results 
yevgeny velikhov vice president of the soviet academy of 
sciences told reporters that american negotiators had rejected 
kremlin proposals to ease the two countries impasse over star wars 
and verify limits on submarinelaunched cruise missiles 
the two issues are among the main obstacles to the proposed 
start or strategic arms reduction treaty being negotiated by us 
and soviet experts in geneva defense secretary frank carlucci 
dismissed any attempt to link star wars to progress on a start 
agreement 
national security adviser colin powell held out little hope of 
completing a treaty before reagan leaves office next january 
velikhov who has advised gorbachev on the star wars issue said 
the americans had rejected a soviet proposal to discuss what types 
of testing could be permitted under the 1972 abm accord 
that treaty limits each side to a missile defense at one site 
the joint statement issued after the reagangorbachev summit in 
washington last december said both sides would be allowed to test 
as required the united states said that allows tests of 
potential star wars weapons but the soviets disagree 
velikhov said that within the framework of the december 
statement we need to settle some technical questions but he 
charged that the americans want to destroy the treaty 
if the united states deploys a nationwide defense it will 
violate the abm treaty and jeopardizes effort to cut strategic 
offensive weapons velikhov said 
the two sides also agreed in december to negotiate ceilings on 
submarinelaunched nuclear missiles but not to include them in the 
6000warhead limit proposed for the strategic weapons treaty 
the soviets said velikhov have proposed monitoring the 
presence of nuclear warheads on submarinelaunched cruise missiles 
using devices to detect neutron and gammaray emissions 
american officials have rejected that idea they say it would be 
too easy to bypass such devices and that they oppose allowing 
soviet inspectors to board american submarines for onsite 
verification of any limits on the missiles 
gorbachev told reagan that it is incumbent on us to discuss 
constructively the main aspects of disarmament the set of issues 
related to 50 percent cuts in strategic offensive arms while 
preserving the 1972 abm treaty problems of eliminating chemical 
weapons reductions in armed forces and conventional armaments in 
europe cessation of nuclear testing 
us officials have repeatedly rejected gorbachevs appeals for 
an end to nuclear testing and refused to join an 18month soviet 
testing moratorium 
white house chief of staff howard baker said on nbctvs meet 
the press show that there could be a fifth summit meeting before 
reagan leaves office next january but only if the two sides 
reach agreement in start talks 
marshal sergei f akhromeyev chief of the soviet general staff 
said the two countries might be able to strike a start deal by the 
end of reagans second term 
my own personal opinion is that weve covered more than half 
the ground akhromeyev said in an abctv interview here 
powell said reagan would certainly like to see the start 
treaty completed during his term the broad outlines are there 
were now down in the trenches working out the very difficult 
issues having to do with verification and cruise and mobile 
missiles 
i would like to see some progress this week and progress is 
possible but there is a lot of hard work ahead powell said 
georgi a arabatov a soviet government adviser on american 
affairs said on meet the press that gorbachev will welcome 
any step towards agreement and if there is an opportunity to have 
an agreement before the term of president reagan expires he would 
be very glad 
powell said agreement on a joint verification experiment for a 
nuclear test ban which seemed doubtful saturday may be back in 
the cards for signing at the moscow summit 
carlucci in an interview with cable news network said 
progress is being made also on a peaceful nuclear explosives 
treaty although powell said it wouldnt be ready for signing at 
the summit

democratic candidate michael dukakis said in an 
interview broadcast sunday that the soviet unions economic 
problems led kremlin leader mikhail s gorbachev to another summit 
with president reagan 
dukakis the frontrunner for his partys presidential 
nomination said that gorbachev is probably the first soviet leader 
to recognize that communism is a failure at least the way its 
been practiced in the soviet union 
unless the soviet union begins to devote significantly more 
resources to its domestic economy and less to the military 
than theyre going to become a thirdrate economic power he said 
the massachusetts governor who was interviewed by the bbc last 
week while he campaigned in california said most thoughtful 
observers agree that it is the very serious condition of the soviet 
domestic situation that has been largely responsible for 
gorbachevs involvement in the summit 
i think that is the driving force behind this the recognition 
on his part that theyre falling further and further behind 
theyre losing the economic race the technological race and that 
they cannot be a great nation unless they significantly reduce the 
amount of resources theyre putting into the military he said 
dukakis holds a commanding lead over democratic rival jesse 
jackson in the number of delegates needed to clinch the nomination 
and in recent opinion polls dukakis leads likely republican 
nominee george bush 
if he wins in november dukakis said there would be some very 
very significant differences in his foreign policy from that of 
president reagan 
for one thing i think weve got the best opportunity for 
meaningful arms control and arms reduction weve had in our 
lifetimes he said

a painting depicting a grinning president reagan 
in blue jeans and cowboy hat astride a white horse is among the 
troublesome summit issues that advisers to reagan and soviet leader 
mikhail s gorbachev will be trying to untangle 
soviet authorities confiscated the painting by louisiana artist 
george rodrigue which had hung briefly in a private cajun food 
restaurant in moscow that is serving gumbo and fried catfish to 
visiting us government officials and journalists covering the 
summit 
the soviets also took away a painting showing gorbachev in a 
yellow suit holding a red soviet flag with the kremlin and a 
peasant family in the background officials said they will not 
return the art until they make sure reagan is not insulted by his 
portrayal as a cowboy 
the soviets dont understand american art they just dont 
know how to read this said rodrigue a drawling bootclad 
cowboy born in lafayette la they dont appreciate that this is 
an individuals artistic interpretation something not permitted 
here 
rodrigue said that although the soviets removed both paintings 
it was the one of reagan not of gorbachev that concerned them 
the reagan painting copied for republican party posters was 
presented to the president in new orleans in 1986 and will be on 
exhibition until it is given to him permanently when he leaves 
office next january the artist said 
the painting was displayed briefly in a restaurant that john d 
folse a cajun chef and owner of lafittes landing restaurant in 
donaldsonville la was allowed to open here for the duration of 
the summit 
folse said the flap over the paintings was not the only 
bureaucratic complication he has encountered he said the 14 tons 
of food he shipped here from louisiana caused confusion among 
soviet customs officials who apparently had never seen crayfish or 
oysters 
we expect we are going to diplomatically work out this issue 
of the paintings before the summit ends folse said the 
soviets are making lots of changes with perestroika but we cant 
expect them to adapt to american art or american food overnight

a third battle of manassas is brewing this 
one over a shopping center complex being built near where the union 
and rebel forces clashed in 1861 and again in 1862 
neither the outrage of preservationists the pleas of civil war 
buffs nor 166 signatures on congressional legislation has been able 
to stop bulldozers from plowing ground on the project 
construction crews already have begun to lay access roads and 
prepare the property for sewers they expect to start construction 
on the first section of 560 townhouses and detached homes in 60 
days 
the developers say the section is not part of the land 
considered sacred by historians but local preservationists argue 
that even if the hill from which confederate gen robert e lee 
directed troops has not yet been touched the excavation work 
should stop until congress has had time to act 
the national manassas battlefield about 30 miles from 
washington is cherished for its bucolic surroundings where 
visitors can easily imagine what civil war troops saw in 1861 and 
1862 during two of the souths important victories the battles of 
manassas or as northerners say the battles of bull run 
but the washington metropolitan area is one of the nations 
fastest growing regions and any land around the 4500acre 
historic park not owned by the government is vulnerable to 
surburban sprawl 
as for the 600 acres adjacent to the park where lees troops 
gathered and battlefield hospitals were located hazelpeterson co 
plans to go ahead with construction unless stopped by congress 
said robert c kelly spokesman for the firm the most prominent 
development company in northern virginia 
a few weeks ago reps robert mzarek dny and michael 
andrews dtexas started action to stop construction by 
introducing a bill that would have the interior secretary take 
possession of the land for park expansion 
it quickly got the approval of at least 166 members of the house 
who signed on as cosponsors but did not win over the three 
congressmen whose districts comprise northern virginia all are 
republicans and all are wellacquainted with the wealthy hazel 
family and its involvement in local gop politics 
in fact not one of virginias 10 members of congress had signed 
on in support of the mzarekandrews bill or entered into the debate 
in any way 
last week that changed and suddenly there was new hope for 
historians that the bulldozers would be idled 
rep frank wolf rva whose district is near the battlefield 
introduced a bill that would enable the government to acquire the 
land through legislative taking a process that is faster than 
that proposed by mzarek and andrews wolfs bill also provides for 
highway construction to relieve traffic congestion threatening the 
park 
mzarek and andrews quickly gave their support for the plan and 
immediately signing on as a cosponsor was rep stan parris rva 
a longtime friend and partner in some business ventures with john 
til hazel who runs hazelpeterson co 
supporting development are county officials who anticipate 
increased tax revenues 
we are pleased and happy the project is being built said 
robert noe prince william county executive before wolf introduced 
his bill the greatest hope for stability in the tax base is 
economic development and a regional mall is the catalyst for the 
kind of economic development communities need 
interior secretary donald hodel also has opposed congressional 
intervention saying the land would cost the government too much 
hazelpeterson spokesman kelly said his firm bought the land for 
between 10 million and 12 million hodel said it probably would 
cost the government 70 million to acquire it 
not only is the cost high but it will not solve the problem 
since the proposed mall could simply move further down the road 
either imposing a traffic burden on the park or requiring that land 
also to be purchased said hodel in a letter to rep morris 
udall dariz chairman of the house interior committee 
development is going to occur all around the battlefield 
whether it is us or someone else said kelly this land is not 
for sale we dont want it taken and we are proceeding with 
construction

pope john paul ii named 25 new cardinals 
from 18 countries sunday including prelates from lithuania and 
hong kong in a move to bolster the roman catholic church in the 
soviet union and china 
two americans archbishops james a hickey of washington and 
edmund c szoka of detroit were on the list 
the new princes of the church who will be formally elevated 
at a june 28 vatican session bring the number of cardinals to 161 
four new cardinals come from italy two each from the united 
states brazil spain and india and one each from canada 
mozambique colombia australia hungary cameroon austria 
france west germany mauritius hong kong switzerland and 
lithuania 
hickey 67 in a statement in washington said he was truly 
honored very humbled and deeply grateful to be chosen he said 
he would work with all those of good will to build a more 
just and caring community 
szoka 60 told a news conference in detroit that hes deeply 
moved and honored and will carry on the same functions whether 
im cardinal or not 
in announcing the appointments at the end of a mass in st 
peters basilica john paul noted that the new cardinals come from 
every continent reflecting the universality of the churchs 
860 million followers 
most of the new appointees were heads of large dioceses or 
vatican departments traditionally held by cardinals 
vatican officials described as especially significant the naming 
of cardinals for lithuania the catholic stronghold in the soviet 
union and hong kong a british colony that reverts to communist 
chinese rule in 1997 
these were courageous appointments vatican spokesman 
joaquin navarro told reporters these are not symbolic choices 
but options for the future 
as lithuanias first publicly named cardinal the pope chose 
vincentas sladkevicius 68 the apostolic administrator of 
kaisiadorys who was appointed president of the lithuanian epispocal 
conference in april 
from 1963 to 1982 he was impeded by soviet authorities from 
performing his religious duties and was virtually confined to his 
residence according to the vatican 
sladkevicius becomes the second resident cardinal in the soviet 
union julijans vaivods of latvia was elevated by john paul in 1983 
at least 2 million of lithuanias 35 million people are 
estimated to be roman catholics the pope who has frequently 
expressed his desire to visit his flock in the soviet union has 
publicly disclosed that at least on two occasions he has been 
refused permission to travel to lithuania 
the pope moved to bolster the church in china by elevating john 
baptist wu chengchung the 63yearold bishop of hong kong there 
has been no resident cardinal in china since the communists took 
over in 1949 
china cut ties with the vatican in 1957 and established a 
breakway catholic church which claims 3 million members an 
unknown number of other catholics remain secretly loyal to the 
pope and several are imprisoned for their religious practices 
the two us appointments bring to nine the number of american 
cardinals 
archbishop roger mahony of los angeles 52 was considered for 
promotion but passed over in what navarro acknowledged was a 
great exclusion for the american church the spokesman said 
mahony was not included because of his young age and was likely to 
become a cardinal at a later time 
named as the first cardinal in mozambique a marxist country 
that the pope will visit during his september tour of southern 
africa was alexandre jose maria dos santos archbishop of maputo 
the rev hans urs von balthasar a swiss theologian highly 
regarded by the pope was the only nonbishop among the 25 new 
cardinals 
in addition to voting in a papal conclave cardinals advise the 
pope serve on special vatican commissions and act as spokesmen for 
the church in their countries 
the number of cardinals under the age of 80 and therefore 
eligible to vote for a new pope will now number 121 one more than 
the limit set by church rules the vatican offered no immediate 
explanation however two of the cardinals will turn 80 this summer

about two dozen soviet jews waving posters and 
yellow stars of david outside the kremlin walls urged president 
reagan on sunday to make a summit appeal to soviet leader mikhail 
s gorbachev for relaxation of curbs on jewish emigration 
elsewhere in the soviet capital armenians beseeched reagan to 
bring up their demands for control over land in a neighboring 
republic ans also called on reagan to bring up their demand for 
control over land in a neighboring republic 
we demand freedom of emigration read a poster held by sasha 
ostroverkh 7 who wore a mickey mouse tshirt and was the youngest 
of the jewish protesters who gathered at the lenin library one 
block from the kremlin 
sashas father vladimir said his family has been trying to 
emigrate since 1979 the government says ostroverkh had access to 
state secrets while working as a social psychologist for the 
communications ministry 
a few policemen kept their distance and made no attempt to 
disperse the demonstrators but workers who normally take sunday 
off noisily sandblasted the library steps and sprayed the 
protesters and reporters with clouds of dust 
a lot of refuseniks live a horrible life their secrets are 
older than they are said ostroverkh 42 holding up his left 
hand on which he had written a prayer in hebrew 
he said he wanted to emigrate to israel so my son can be 
religious not study things like grandfather lenin was good 
because he made the jews work on sabbath 
sergei diky 38 who also has been refused permission to 
emigrate since 1979 held a poster which read we welcome the 
summit and hope for a dramatic turn in the fate of refuseniks 
you can only talk to my government from a firm position he 
said 
this government is used to living not in a humane or moral 
way but in their own way said diky whose brother and sister 
emigrated to boston in december 
i hope mr reagan will be strong enough not to surrender to 
those who are against us ostroverkh said 
reagan plans to meet monday with a group of refuseniks and 
soviet human rights activists at spaso house the official 
residence of the us ambassador where the reagans are staying 
during the fiveday summit 
soviet authorities reportedly have made it difficult for some of 
the group to see reagan 
according to alexander ogorodnikov a russian orthodox activist 
in moscow police removed two lithuanian activists nijole 
sadunaite and antanas terleckas from a moscowbound train friday 
night in their republics capital of vilnius 
the following night however the two were told there had been a 
mistake and they were allowed to travel to moscow on sunday for the 
meeting with reagan ogorodnikov said 
roald alec zelichonok a leningrad jew refused permission to 
emigrate for more than 10 years said a kgb officer warned him 
thursday night he would face administrative measures if he went 
to moscow for the reagan meeting 
on saturday ogordnikov said police pulled five ukrainian 
catholics off a train destined for moscow and put on another train 
headed back to lvov the five had hoped to meet reagan even though 
they had not been invited to spaso house 
meanwhile hundreds of armenians gathered sunday at 
vagankovskoye cemetery in northwest moscow and later at downtown 
pushkin square to call on reagan to take up our issue in his 
negotiations one of them said 
armenian painter koryun nahabidyan said that in their speeches 
and posters the demonstrators welcomed reagan to the soviet union 
and demanded that the government turn the nagornokarabakh region 
over to the armenian republic 
nagornokarabakh which is part of azerbaijan has been the 
subject of street rallies in moscow and the armenian capital of 
yerevan since february

president reagan and his wife nancy out for a 
pleasant sunday stroll won cheers and applause in the citys 
showcase arbat mall during a chaotic 10minute episode in which 
grimfaced kgb agents roughed up members of the crowd and the press 
the agents knocked over a fruit stand as they steamrolled 
through the crowd 
the reagans seemed stunned by the tumultuous scene and at times 
appeared to be jostled themselves the president and first lady 
were completely encircled by kgb officers who locked arms in a 
tight circle using elbows and shoulders to spew people out of 
their way 
nancy reagan stopped the procession at one point to rescue helen 
thomas the white house correspondent for united press 
international who was complaining loudly about the rough treatment 
she sort of put out her hand and pulled me in to the 
presidential party miss thomas said 
tumult or not the shirtsleeved crowd of sunday shoppers loudly 
cheered and applauded the president and first lady reagan shook 
hands with onlookers who managed to get close enough 
at one point the president and mrs reagan climbed atop an open 
carriage and waved to the crowd drawing widespread cheers 
the unscheduled excursion occurred an hour after reagan 
completed his first round of summit talks at the kremlin with 
soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev 
it had been widely rumored that reagan would have a surprise 
event sunday evening but his destination was not announced until 
after his motorcade left the us embassy residence where he is 
staying en route to the shopping area known as the arbat several 
hundred yards away 
it was a very heartwarming welcome indeed they all seemed 
very friendly reagan said he said he was not surprised i 
have always heard that the russian people are very friendly and 
outgoing 
the kgb which has primary responsibility for reagans security 
here was not informed of the walk until minutes before the 
president and first lady set out from the embassy residence 
officials said 
in some ways the event was similar to gorbachevs unscheduled 
stop in a crowd in downtown washington during the summit last 
december to the delight of onlookers the soviet leader left his 
limousine and shook hands in the crowd while there was an air of 
excitement there was none of the turmoil that marked reagans 
event 
when reagan and his wife stepped from their armored car people 
nearby broke into smiles and began cheering word of their arrival 
spread quickly and people began surging toward the party to get a 
look 
somebody must have spread the word in advance reagan said 
later 
the kgb agents seemed to panic at the crowds reaction and began 
thrusting people out of the way us secret service agents 
appeared startled and pushed people with more force than they 
usually exert though significantly less than the kgb 
mutual broadcasting reporter peter maer said he was punched in 
the stomach by a kgb officer picked up and thrown over a barricade 
about the height of a bicycle rack 
a television sound technician said his jacket pocket was ripped 
off by the kgb and a photographer said he was punched in the back 
another photographer said his camera was broken while a 
colleague complained he was bearhugged and choked by his camera 
straps 
general tell your men to stop white house assistant press 
secretary mark weinberg shouted repeatedly at the kgb officer in 
charge of the security detail 
american reporters tried to warn soviets with children to stay 
back from the chaos a fruit stand was overturned as agents pushed 
past running and jumping over obstacles to catch up with the 
president 
standing on the sidewalk outside the nearby us embassy the 
kgb officials were first briefed on the reagans plans and 
immediately held hurried consultations and sent agents down the 
street to the arbat 
during the reagans walk members of the presidential party 
including spokesman marlin fitzwater and deputy chief of staff 
kenneth duberstein were shut out from the circle around reagan 
the scene calmed when the reagans departed the market electing 
to walk down the street back to the embassy instead of riding in 
their limousine 
reagan chatting briefly with reporters said he was pleased by 
the friendly reception he received from soviet citizens as his 
motorcade drove into moscow on his arrival from helsinki finland 
thousands of people lined the route and american and soviet flags 
were suspended over the city on ropes attached to blimps

president reagan considered a private visit with a 
prominent refusenik family sunday according to us sources who 
said the idea was scrubbed when word came that it could hurt the 
familys chance to emigrate 
a honey cake was baked and waiting at the apartment of tanya 
yuri and vera zieman the ziemans talked excitedly of how water 
trucks washed their street clean and workers had daubed fresh paint 
on their apartment building signs that the soviets were aware of 
plans for a reagan visit 
but the reagans never came 
after 11 years of waiting it was another disappointment 
when we started to apply to emigrate i thought it would not 
be easy for us sighed tanya as she gazed at the crowd on the 
street the one thing i didnt want to attract is publicity the 
mob like this 
a us official who asked not to be identified said white house 
planners scrubbed consideration of a zieman visit after the soviets 
passed word that the ziemans would never leave the country if 
reagan went to their home 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater denied sunday there ever 
were definite plans for the zieman visit saying only that a number 
of sites were scouted for potential reagan trips 
the ziemans will be among the refuseniks the term given to 
those refused permission to emigrate meeting with reagan on monday 
at the spaso house the us ambassadors home where the president 
is staying 
human rights is one of the most contentious issues on the agenda 
for reagans fiveday moscow summit with kremlin leader mikhail s 
gorbachev who has vehemently rebutted western criticism of soviet 
human rights policies 
last week the kremlin abruptly canceled one of mondays two 
planned meetings between reagan and gorbachev the discussions had 
been scheduled to take place between a reagan visit to a moscow 
monastery and his meeting with dissidents and refuseniks 
the ziemans are moscow jews who in 1977 first sought permission 
to emigrate several other longterm refuseniks have been granted 
such permission in recent months but an estimated 2000 soviet 
jews have had applications pending 
the ziemans have been notified that they cannot leave because 
yuri a computer specialist would be a risk to soviet security 
they were alerted to a possible visit by the reagans last week 
when us scouting officials came to their home 
and they were not the only expectant parties soviet officials 
had cleaned up the neighborhood right up to patching the road and 
driveway right in front of the apartment local militia and 
plainclothes agents patrolled the area 
the reagans failure to show clearly disappointed the ziemans 
and about 300 curious residents who gathered outside their 
apartment building alerted to something unusual by the heavy 
police presence 
after the ziemans applied to emigrate tanya lost her job as an 
english professor and yuri lost his as an advanced computer 
specialist working as a hospital plumber until ill health forced 
him to stop last fall 
their elder daughter galya got out of the soviet union last 
year apparently because authorities did not realize from her 
married name of khatutsky that she was a member of the zieman 
family she now lives in boston mass campaigning for her 
familys emigration 
with her perfect britishaccented english curly hair and 
cherubic cheeks daughter vera 12 charms the many foreigners who 
visit the ziemans threeroom apartment the presidential couple 
reportedly became interested in the ziemans case after vera wrote 
to the reagans in english on april 4 asking for their help to 
emigrate 
yuri who is suffering from hepatitis and an undiagnosed 
condition that gives him double vision lay on the sofa and 
discussed his hopes for reagans moscow visit 
if not this visit i dont know what will help me he said 
i think many refuseniks are expecting good news now 
hopes traditionally run high amid dissidents and wouldbe 
emigres in the soviet union when prominent western politicians 
visit since the kremlin traditionally solves several or even a few 
dozen human rights cases during such meetings 
on sunday very few of those who gathered on the street outside 
knew the ziemans or that they are refuseniks they just knew 
something unusual was happening 
but one elderly lady was convinced reagan would never show 
there arent enough security around she said if the 
president was coming there would be kgb in every doorway

the top of the kremlin hierarchy

had seen he didnt order us to print things but led by example 
one day when gorbachev was addressing workers at the 
electoavtomatika electronics plant the microphone failed 
other officials would have crushed bones because of that 
said plant director yevgeny kuznetsov not mikhail sergeyevich 
he pushed aside the microphone and said fine comrades it will 
be more informal this way 
for 18 years mrs gorbachev the siberianborn daughter of 
railroad workers taught marxist dialectics and historical 
materialism at the agricultural institute working on the second 
floor of a 19th century building where girls of good family were 
once taught by russian orthodox priests 
by all accounts she was a bright hardworking teacher who 
demanded much from her students and also from herself 
every year mrs gorbachev taught 180 students in the elements 
of marxismleninism delivering lectures in a room with 
hospitalgreen walls decorated with large portraits of descartes 
kant hegel and other philosophers 
she was paid 320 rubles a month about 500 
mrs gorbachev was once grabbed by a guard after she entered the 
institute he had mistaken her for a student and wanted her to 
leave her coat in the students cloakroom recalled the former 
dean mikhail p chuguyev 
mikhail pankratovich when are people going to recognize the 
fact that i work here and am not a student chuguyev recalls her 
saying 
mrs gorbachev working at a beaten wooden desk now decorated 
with a single rose in a vase taught philosophy from the ancient 
greek times to the present her courses were mandatory for economic 
majors 
she was respected greatly because she was the best prepared 
the rest of us went to her lectures to see how they should be 
done chuguyev said 
gorbachev himself entered the institute as a parttime student 
in 196268 working towards a degree as an advanced 
agroeconomist a speciality important for someone keen on rising 
in the party hierarchy in the farming region of stavropol 
he asked for no special treatment and was interested in 
pursuing the truth to the very end remembers alexander d 
kamensky dean of parttime students at the institute and a friend 
of the gorbachevs for decades 
one day in the midst of a fourhour chemistry experiment 
gorbachev was whisked away by a limousine on urgent party business 
but he returned later in the day telling kamensky i want to 
finish the experiment by myself and see the results 
gorbachev was born in 1931 to a peasant family in privolnoye a 
village on the blackearth steppes about 100 miles north of the 
stavropol regional center 
with his moscow university law diploma in his pocket he 
returned to stavropol in 1954 as an intern in the prosecutors 
office but he was snapped up by the komsomol communist youth 
league and began a career that included stints as local komsomol 
leader party boss for the city of stavropol and party chief for 
the stavropol region an area about the size of south carolina 
when gorbachev was named regional party chief in 1970 raisa 
gorbachev went to her superiors at the agricultural institute and 
asked not to be named head of the philosophy department a 
promotion for which she had been in line 
people will say that ive been promoted because of my 
husband she told her coworkers not because of what ive 
done

president reagan welcomed to the soviet union by 
appreciative crowds and kremlin pomp began his fourth summit 
sunday with mikhail s gorbachev the leaders immediately clashed 
over human rights setting the stage for what one us aide called 
tumultuous conversations 
in receiving reagan gorbachev told his guest their previous 
meetings have shaken loose the enemy images of old stereotypes 
he thanked reagan for having traversed the great distance that 
lies between our two capitals to continue our political 
dialogue he noted that reagan was finally visiting a country 
which you have so often mentioned in your public statements 
reagan who once spoke of the soviets as an evil empire 
made clear that serious differences remain 
weve traveled a long road together to reach this moment 
the american president told gorbachev as they began the first of 
their talks but he added we both know it will not be easy to 
surmount obstacles standing stubbornly in the way of a pact to 
slash longrange nuclear weapons stocks 
instead of signing a treaty to cut strategic arsenals by 50 
percent which both sides had hoped would come at this meeting the 
two leaders will ceremoniously exchange the final ratified copies 
of the treaty they signed at their last meeting in washington a 
far simpler agreement to scrap all mediumrange nuclear missiles 
as the reagans retired for the evening working groups of 
specialists in the major areas of ussoviet relations began 
separate negotations on outstanding issues with the understanding 
they would report any progress as the leaders talks continue 
despite elaborate preparations by soviet work crews and security 
forces the white house abandoned an unannounced plan for the 
president and his wife nancy to visit the home of a jewish family 
whose 12yearold daughter appealed to the reagans for help in 
getting permission to leave the country 
instead they toured the historic arbat district by carriage 
before retiring to spaso house the nearby us ambassadors 
residence where they are staying during the trip crowds at the 
arbat roughly treated by frantic kgb security officers cheered 
and applauded the reagans 
white house chief of staff howard h baker jr said the leaders 
discussed human rights and afghanistan frankly and with a good 
deal of energy during their first meeting which lasted 1 hour 
11 minutes about 20 minutes longer than scheduled 
the white house aide said based on what weve seen so far 
subsequent talks are going to be tumultuous conversations 
they strike sparks off each other pretty well and they did 
today baker said 
a senior american official speaking on condition he not be 
identified said human rights was one of the issues over which 
the two leaders differed but not the only one 
the same source said afghanistan also was discussed the soviet 
union has indicated in recent days it might halt its troop 
withdrawal if pakistan doesnt stop supplying arms to afghan rebel 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater told reporters after the 
first meeting that the united states assumes the soviets will abide 
by their agreement signed in geneva to pull their forces out of 
the asian nation 
soviet foreign ministry spokesman gennady i gerasimov 
characterized the opening round of talks as businesslike and 
cordial but he offered few details 
gerasimov charged reagan does not have a concrete 
understanding of the human rights issue in the soviet union and 
objected to others lecturing soviets on how to conduct their 
affairs 
reagans position is based on the past and does not take into 
consideration what is happening today the spokesman said 
apparently referring to gorbachevs somewhat more tolerant 
emigration policies and glasnost which permits broader but 
still limited criticism of soviet officialdom and society 
the foreign ministry official said his government knew about its 
drawbacks we are trying to correct them gerasimov added 
but we dont like it when someone else is making us feel like a 
pupil 
during a picturetaking session at the outset of his first 
meeting with gorbachev reagan was asked if he intended to lecture 
his counterpart on human rights i have no intention of trying to 
be a teacher he said 
gerasimov said gorbachev searching for ways to continue the 
improvement in ussoviet relations suggested the superpowers 
might launch a joint manned mission to mars or participate in an 
international conference or seminal on human rights the united 
states has been cool to both soviet initiatives in the past 
baker discussing the failure to reach agreement before the 
summit on nuclear testing and other pacts nearing completion told 
nbcs meet the press that their not being signed in moscow 
underscores the careful and prudent way the administration is 
approaching this detail can kill you literally if you dont 
get it right

arrested in july and sentenced to seven years in prison guillo was 
arrested in august after entering afghanistan with guerrillas who 
are fighting the sovietbacked government 
the conditions of detention were rough absolutely 
deplorable guillo 45 told reporters at charles de gaulle 
airport early sunday 
it was nine months of complete isolation except for rare 
visits from the french charge daffaires he said 
but it was nothing compared to the others there is an italian 
journalist turkish iranian pakistani prisoners their life is a 
real hell they have no contact with their families they are cut 
from the world 
guillo is an independent photojournalist who often worked for 
the sygma agency covering the 10yearold civil war in afghanistan 
the secretarygeneral of the french foreign ministry gilbert 
perol stressed that obtaining his release should not be construed 
as an element of political negotiations with afghanistan

commitment of any sort perol said we have settled the guillo 
case period 
kabul radio said friday that the release followed a written 
request from french president francois mitterrand to afghan

the afghan resistance on his ninth reporting trip to the country 
since 1979 his arrest was announced in september 
on jan 4 he was sentenced to 10 years in prison for espionage 
and subversive activities 
for 15 days they afghan police hesitated between killing me 
on the spot and arresting me formally he told reporters saturday 
in new dehli where he stopped en route to paris they would have 
blamed the killing on the mujahedeen 
the afghan rebels call themselves mujahedeen or holy warriors 
guillo called his trial pure comedy and a travesty of 
justice 
in a televised interview with french journalists earlier this 
month guillo said he would never ask for a pardon because he was 
not guilty and considered himself a hostage

rose cipollones husband has spent five 
years fighting to get three cigarette makers to pay for his wifes 
lung cancer death very soon he and the tobacco industry will have 
the answer in their landmark court battle 
testimony in the product liability trial is over and after 
closing arguments this week the jury will begin deliberating 
whether the 22 billionayear tobacco industry should be held 
responsible and pay its first dollar in damages 
the fourmonth federal court trial has been monitored closely by 
both the industry and health groups with both sides fighting for 
the attention of the nations 50 million smokers 
a verdict against the companies could clear the way for other 
lawsuits totaling millions of dollars in potential damages 
to date plaintiffs have not won a single cigarette liability 
case of the dozen or so that have gone to juries since world war 
ii many other suits have been dismissed or withered in the face of 
defense efforts by the wellfinanced tobacco industry but about 
100 others are pending 
once the first case is won then the tobacco folks ought to 
pack up their bags said john madigan director of governmental 
affairs for the american cancer society 
tobacco lawyers see little chance of a loss here and years of 
appeals are almost certain if there is one 
but for some antismoking forces a victory already has been 
won the case produced hundreds of previously secret internal 
corporate documents introduced as evidence and now available for 
litigators working against the tobacco industry 
they show that the cigarette companies had knowledge of the 
problems with their products long before the general public was 
aware said mike davis an austin texas lawyer who has 13 suits 
pending 
meanwhile at least five bills are pending in congress placing 
stricter limits on the industry the documents have garnered 
support for them said madigan 
after the lawyers closing arguments the case will go to six 
jurors chosen by lot from among the 11 who have heard the 
testimony but they will consider few of the claims in the original 
complaint filed by antonio cipollone in 1983 a year before his 
wife died at 58 
most of cipollones legal claims have been stripped away by 
defense efforts but the fundamental issue appears straightforward 
free will vs corporate responsibility 
to the defendants philip morris co lorillard inc and liggett 
group inc mrs cipollone was an intelligent strongwilled woman 
who knew the risks as she made a conscious decision to smoke 
to her husband mrs cipollone was the unwitting victim of a 
broad conspiracy that used the advertising and public relations to 
confound the public on the dangers of smoking 
us district judge h lee sarokin threw out a number of 
liability claims but he also said the jury can consider whether 
there was a tobacco industry conspiracy vast in its scope 
devious in its purpose and devastating in its results 
the completion of the case comes as a relief to cipollone a 
64yearold retired cable splicer whose tearful testimony about his 
wifes dying moments stirred courtroom observers 
most of documents at the core of the case were introduced as 
evidence for cipollone by a harvard medical school physician and 
economist qualified as an expert on the history of tobacco company 
research 
the exhibits include 
handwritten notes by a morris research director in the 1970s 
saying an industryfunded research groups program was designed 
so that results cannot harm us morris attorney charles wall said 
that the writer was hypothesizing and that the research was 
conducted objectively by independent scientists 
a 1968 draft memo by another morris research executive citing a 
gentlemans agreement not to do biological research on smoking 
and health wall said no such agreement existed and noted that 
some companies did do such research 
a 1972 industry trade group executives memo saying the defense 
against critics of smoking included creating doubt about the 
health charge without actually denying it wall denied such a 
strategy and said the industry merely wanted to publicize the other 
side of a controversy 
whatever the documents say the companies contend they have 
nothing to do with rose cipollone 
first off their expert medical witnesses testified that smoking 
is not a proven cancer cause and in any case they argued mrs 
cipollones lung cancer was not the type associated with smoking 
cipollones attorney marc z edell presented experts 
contending there is proof of the cancersmoking link pointing to 
numerous scientific findings and the us surgeon generals reports 
both sides called marketing and advertising experts to testify 
about the messages mrs cipollone received on the effects of 
cigarettes experts disputed whether she was addicted to smoking 
the jury heard testimony from top company executives 
researchers and family members and finally through depositions 
from rose herself a daughter of italian immigrants who said she 
sought to ward off cancer with prayers to st jude the patron 
saint of people in desperate trouble

president mohammad zia ulhaq on 
sunday dissolved the national assembly fired his prime minister 
and accused the lawmakers of failing to maintain law and order in 
pakistan 
zia made the announcement at a news conference minutes after the 
ousted prime minister mohammad khan junejo returned home from a 
tour of china south korea and the philippines 
zia also disbanded junejos 33member cabinet 
the action could plunge the country into a new political crisis 
junejo 56 was heading the first civilian cabinet after eight 
years of martial law imposed by zia in july 1977 
the national assembly and junejos cabinet were scheduled to 
remain in office until 1990 they were elected in december 1984 
junejo was appointed prime minister in march 1985 
zia an army general who took power in a bloodless coup in 1977 
told reporters that legislators inability to maintain law and 
order and failure to bring about an islamic society led him to 
disband the assembly and cabinet 
he said the countrys constitution and the senate the upper 
house of the parliament would stay intact 
zia said that according to the constitution elections should be 
held within 90 days he said a caretaker government would be 
announced monday in a major policy change he said political 
parties will be permitted to propose their own candidates to 
contest the assembly seats 
in the 1984 elections political parties were not permitted to 
field candidates that led opposition parties to boycott the vote 
the national assembly has failed to realize the objective for 
which it was elected zia said the prime minister has ceased 
to be the prime minister from today because the national assembly 
has been dissolved 
zia and junejo generally had got on well but political 
observers had started sensing a divergence of views on domestic 
policy issues particularly the role that political parties should 
play in the country 
zia is opposed to giving political parties any immediate role 
but junejo formed his own pakistan muslim league party two years 
ago 
opposition political parties became active following the 
formation of junejos party 
these parties include benazir bhuttos pakistan peoples party a 
particular source of annoyance to zia bhutto is the daughter of 
the late prime minister zulfikar ali bhutto whose civilian 
government zia toppled in july 1977 
zia said he had watched with concern that law and order had 
broken down to an alarming extent 
there was enormous damage to life and property the 
countrys islamic ideology and integrity were unsafe he said 
public morality has deteriorated to an unprecedented level zia 
added 
in the past two years hundreds of people have died in ethnic 
violence in karachi pakistans biggest city 
zia said that he had repeatedly reminded junejo to improve the 
law and order situation and to speed up the process of 
islamization but he said junejo took the view that he had to go 
along with the wishes of the assembly which favored a gradual move 
to islamism

mikhail s gorbachev engaged president reagan in a 
lighthearted battle of russian proverbs at their summit reunion 
sunday and made pointed reference to reagans past enmity toward 
the soviet union 
at the start of reagans first visit to what he once called an 
evil empire gorbachev challenged his guest to learn more about 
the soviet union and its people 
you mr president have traversed the great distance that 
lies between our two capitals to continue our political dialogue 
the soviet leader said in a welcoming speech he noted that reagan 
was finally visiting a country which you have so often mentioned 
in your public statements 
reagan said the steady improvement in ussoviet relations and 
more frequent meetings between superpower leaders was the result of 
patience then he reached for a russian proverb to put his thoughts 
into words 
rodilsya ne toropilsya it was born it wasnt rushed 
reagan said reading from a notecard 
the president initiated the exchange of proverbs at his 
washington summit meeting with gorbachev in december when he 
referred to the quandary of arms control negotiations doveryai 
no proveryai trust but verify he said 
greeting reagan on sunday in the kremlins opulent st georges 
hall gorbachev took note of his guests fondness for literary 
references 
aware of your interest in russian proverbs let me add another 
one to your collection he said it is better to see once than 
to hear a hundred times 
gorbachevs advice came after an oblique reference to reagans 
critical remarks in the past about the soviet union which the 
president had never visited 
reagan aroused the wrath of the soviet media and government 
officials in 1983 when he told an american television audience that 
the soviet union was an evil empire 
but gorbachev and reagan agreed sunday that times have changed 
since their first summit in geneva in november 1985 
as we see it longheld dislikes have been weakened habitual 
stereotypes stemming from enemy images have been shaken loose 
the soviet leader said 
everyone can improve even in later years us affairs 
expert georgi a arbatov said on nbctvs meet the press 
program as he tried to explain why reagans views of the soviet 
union had changed 
on the eve of his arrival here reagan said in a soviet 
television broadcast that he could not have conceived of visiting 
moscow during the early years of his presidency 
i think there is a difference between this general secretary 
and other leaders of your country that ive met with in the past 
reagan told the staterun broadcast service no i could not have 
foreseen your present leader

for most of the members of the writers guild of 
america the 2monthold strike has been a stressful time of 
picket lines union meetings no paychecks and lost creative 
opportunity 
for the writers of late night with david letterman being on 
strike has been well not that different from going to work 
we sleep till noon said head writer steve odonnell get 
up drink some coffee go down to the writers guild see if 
anythings going on then we go home but now during the strike 
 
until oneliners earn them money again which should be soon 
since late night has reached a tentative independent agreement 
with the guild the shows writers have been offering them in 
magazine pieces or interviews with reporters looking for that 
missedmonologue angle on the strike story the show has been in 
reruns since the strike started march 7 
odonnell joined by late night staffers jeff martin randy 
cohen and maria pope reminisced friday about a typical day of work 
at the show 
we come down to beautiful almostlandmark rockefeller center 
at 930 or 10 and linger until its quite dark outside said 
odonnell its handtomouth were usually working on the next 
days show if not that days show the day of the broadcast so 
thats why were not too worried about stockpiling things up 
sometimes our days are not too miserable because sometimes a lot 
of our writing consists of a sentence something like 
martin lets go up and talk to our audience 
perfect says odonnell see then we knock off and go get 
the thickest steak in town or other times it will just be a 
phrase a concept a man a plan a canal panama 
martin dave says something funny 
odonnell dave takes bullhorn to window and tries to get 
pedestrian to bring him up a hot dog then we look at each other 
and say thats it thats it whos for dessert 
but now there are picket lines to walk 
there is like just a minimum of actual union activities 
said odonnell we go picketing once a week 
i think people passing by as they see these writers in their 
notverysolidlooking picket lines i think they have a series of 
thoughts the first is do writers have a union and then do they 
work that hard and then perhaps the last stage is wait a second 
tv writers get paid plenty 
i dont think a lot of people understand the strike wasnt for 
more money it was to keep royalties from being cut back 
wait a second said cohen it wasnt for more money 
what the hell have we been doing said martin who has been 
playing golf 
but seriously 
we certainly support the guild said odonnell if it 
wasnt for them wed certainly be in bad shape but the actual 
issues in this strike do not pertain to latenight comedy writers 
its a nice little vacation said martin 
but life on strike means missing important events in the life of 
late night 
just that morning the local papers were splashed with 
lettermans smiling filephoto face next to headlines about a 
mystery woman driving his car who told officials at the lincoln 
tunnel where she didnt have the toll that she was mrs david 
letterman 
usually dave has to go on a murder spree to make the front 
page of the new york post said martin and he recommends if 
youre going to steal daves car please please have correct 
change

communist party chief bosko krunic 
said sunday that yugoslavias political stability has been shaken 
and he warned of major social upheavals as a result of the 
countrys economic crisis 
but krunic rejected a multiparty system and other radical 
reforms in a speech to about 800 communist party delegates meeting 
to find ways of dealing with yugoslavias social and financial 
problems 
we are i should say in the epicenter of the crisis with 
economic stagnation on the brink of a recession a high inflation 
that threatens to run away and ever sharper social problems and 
political dissatisfaction said krunic 
yugoslavia is saddled with a 170 percent inflation a 21 
billion foreign debt and a 15 percent unemployment rate 
the threeday conference comes halfway between two party 
congresses and follows rumors of an attempted military coup to 
suppress dissent in slovenia yugoslavias most advanced republic 
slovenia this month filed an unsuccessful motion in the federal 
parliament requesting the removal of premier branko mikulic 
a society which enters such a crisis cannot emerge from it 
without profound changes said the party chief social 
upheavals are certain to take place and may be grave 
the government launched an emergency economic program on 
saturday including an almost 24 percent devaluation of the 
everweaker national currency the dinar hefty price hikes and 
wage cuts of up to 30 percent 
krunic said these measures are not easy at all but are 
causing and will cause many shocks clashes of interest great 
social problems 
the austerity package was expected to further erode sagging 
living standards which have already dipped by onethird since 
1980 and set off a new wave of social unrest sporadic worker 
strikes have flared in various parts of the country to protest of 
the belttightening moves which were announced several weeks ago 
the stability of the political system has been shaken 
krunic told the delegates 
conference documents pledge a separation of party and state 
administration curbs on red tape and more openness 
in a draft document circulated before the meeting the party 
membership is called to end the partys impotence and inertia and 
oppose bureaucratic and static rule which is believed to be the 
main cause of numerous deformations and failures 
the document demands that the party abandon its leadership 
role and instead act as a leading force in society whose major 
goals are freedom democracy and the material wellbeing of the 
people 
but krunic rejected changes toward a multiparty system and 
other radical reforms as a way of regaining control of the economy 
he made clear that the communist party intends to continue its 
oneparty rule and a system of selfmanagement that provides for 
limited worker powersharing in managing companies 
the party chief asserted it was the historic mission of yugoslav 
communists not to permit the blind forces to gain the upper hand 
or changes which regardless of intentions would objectively mean 
abandoning selfmanagement 
krunic claimed that recent calls for a new constitution and a 
reshaping of the political system according to western models are 
in fact counterrevolutionary 
he said the current system must keep the gates tightly shut 
to solutions leading to a dogmatic soviettype system on the one 
hand or to a westerntype multiparty democracy on the other 
krunic also revealed the party was exposed to pressures from 
the bourgeois right wing which pulls toward restoration of the 
capitalistic relationship and bourgeois democracy 
he said such changes of the political system would lead us to 
national conflicts which are known from the past 
neverthless krunic said one of yugoslavias most important 
tasks was the establishment of a free market for capital and 
workers which is a highly controversial topic among yugoslav 
communists for some party officials he said referring to the 
dogmatic party wing opposed to a freemarket economy such an 
innovation is tantamount to anarchy and the abandonment of 
socialism 
krunic said the view espoused by many party hardliners that 
use of foreign capital for increasing industrial production was a 
threat to socialist ownership was unacceptable 
compounding yugoslavias economic problems are unresolved ethnic 
tensions in this mostlybalkan nation whose republics range from 
the southern serbian province of kosovo with its 85 percent 
albanian population to northern slovenia which borders on 
austria and italy 
in an open letter published thursday 22 slovenian officials 
including government members journalists and other intellectuals 
demanded a thorough explanation of this springs rumored military 
coup which they called the crudest violation of assured rights 
of citizens and of the current constitution of yugoslavia 
the government said the coup rumors were false

soviet jewish activists urged president reagan 
on sunday to drive a hard bargain for free jewish emigration when 
he meets with mikhail s gorbachev in moscow 
the soviets will not be persuaded by mere words yuli 
edelstein a former soviet labor camp inmate said during a rally 
for soviet jews attended by about 200 people in jerusalem 
edelstein and other activists demanded that the united states 
link trade agreements and scientific and cultural exchanges to the 
level of jewish emigration from the soviet union 
the activists also described gorbachevs policy of glasnost 
or openness as a public relations stunt that has not led to real 
improvements for soviet jews 
more than 2 million jews remain in one big labor camp the 
soviet union and the door is still closed said moshe arens a 
member of prime minister yitzhak shamirs cabinet and the 
rightwing likud bloc 
arens called on reagan to use the level of jewish emigration as 
a test for soviet sincerity on other issues such as arms control 
shamir aide avi pazner said in a telephone interview that we 
have seen very few soviet changes but added that shamir was 
satisfied with reagans efforts 
us officials have said the plight of soviet jewry would be on 
the summit agenda reagan was to meet monday with a group of 
prominent refuseniks soviet jews denied permission to emigrate 
refusenik zeev dashevsky told israel army radio in a telephone 
interview from moscow that he viewed his scheduled meeting with 
reagan as a sign that the president assigned importance to the 
issue 
we want to tell him that even though positive things have been 
done in the past two years basic problems remain and the situation 
is not good at all said dashevsky who has been denied an exit 
visa for the past 11 years 
moscow has released several prominent jewish activists from 
prisons and labor camps in the past year last year 8011 jews 
left the soviet union the highest number since 1981 
the soviet union severed ties with israel after the 1967 middle 
east war during which israel captured territory from moscows arab 
allies 
in the past year the soviets sent a consular delegation to 
jerusalem and approved a reciprocal visit by israeli diplomats

some politicians in foreign minister shimon 
peres leftleaning labor party fear that a newly chosen slate of 
dovish candidates could cost them the national elections in 
november 
their concern was triggered by a meeting of the partys central 
committee on thursday in which more than half of 29 candidates 
chosen to run for parliament favor making more concessions to the 
arabs for peace than the party has advocated in the past 
the partys dovish turn appears to contradict a recent shift in 
israeli public opinion polls which show a majority support 
rightwing prime minister yitzhak shamir and his allies in 
espousing a tougher stand toward the arabs 
i am definitely worried by the change the fact is more doves 
than expected were elected and this will harm us very much in the 
elections agriculture minister aryeh nehamkin said 
those on labors new slate include several peace activists and a 
former ultra leftwing legislator lova eliav who has had contacts 
with the plo and has advocated a full israeli pullout from the west 
bank and gaza strip 
the latest public opinion poll taken this month and published 
may 13 by the yediot ahronot daily showed labor and allied parties 
winning 59 seats the likud and its allies were predicted to win 61 
after israels last elections in 1984 the labor and likud 
parties formed a coalition in which labors peres served as prime 
minister for the first two years and likuds shamir for the past 
two years 
political analysts say israelis swing to the right reflects a 
hawkish public mood stirred by the sixmonthold palestinian 
uprising in the west bank and gaza strip 
the analysts say that the labor infighting could further damage 
the partys electoral image by presenting a confused picture to the 
public 
with such a fractious and contradictory slate it will be 
difficult to formulate an attentiongrabbing campaign to compete 
with parties either to the left or the right wrote columnist dan 
margalit in the haaretz daily 
the doves and hawks in the labor party are divided over how to 
implement a plank in its platform which calls for giving up some 
land occupied in the 1967 middle east war in exchange for peace 
with arab states 
the hawks favor a formula which would leave israel with the 
jordan river valley a stand unacceptable to arabs they also 
completely reject negotiations with the plo 
labors newest candidates have a more lenient approach to 
territorial compromise and some favor talking with the plo if it 
officially recognizes israel 
i think that labor is back where it should be on the road of 
looking for peace that peace has a price and you dont get it 
without compromising said russianborn lova eliav 66 
he predicted a tough israeli election campaign over the peace 
issue 
people are extreme dangerously so i think its time for 
voters to choose a party that wants to take the road for peace 
even if its a very very uphill road he said

the heiress to maines most famous modern 
fortune and one of the republican establishments favorite sons are 
vying for the gop nomination to challenge democratic incumbent 
joseph e brennan a former governor for his house seat 
on june 14 republican voters in maines 1st congressional 
district will choose between businesswoman linda beanjones a 
granddaughter of ll bean and edward s ted omeara the 
executive assistant to the states popular senior senator william 
s cohen both candidates are making their first bid for public 
office 
with a campaign fund 10 times the size of omearas beanjones 
is far better financed partly because she has loaned her campaign 
168000 much of that war chest has been spent on television 
advertising which emphasizes her links to the sporting goods 
empire founded by her grandfather and plays down her background as 
a conservative publisher and activist 
im prepared to spend whatever it takes to win she said 
omeara is little known outside gop inner circles and is 
counting on support from republican regulars to win next months 
primary but he has been hampered by a tradition of neutrality in 
primary campaigns which has limited the activities of some of his 
natural allies including gov john r mckernan us rep olympia 
j snowe and even cohen himself 
publicly however omeara is undaunted 
never once did i ask them for an endorsement omeara said 
i never had any expectation of it i never wanted to put them in 
the position of having to get involved in the primary 
the gop primary winner will face brennan a former twoterm 
governor in novembers general election for his 1st district seat 
which represents 563073 residents in an area about the size of 
connecticut brennan who was elected to the house in 1986 as he 
concluded eight years as governor is unopposed for the democratic 
nomination 
also unopposed in the primary is snowe who is winding up her 
fifth term as the 2nd district incumbent the democrats have lined 
up former state sen kenneth hayes who teaches at the university 
of maine in orono to challenge her in the general election 
beanjones 46 is perhaps best known as founder of the 
ultraconservative maine paper a weekly publication which folded in 
1982 after three years 
she also played a role in the successful campaign to defeat an 
equal rights amendment to the state constitution and traveled to 
an arms control meeting in geneva to support president reagans 
strategic defense initiative 
her focus on issues has changed since announcing her candidacy 
now she refers to herself as the private sector candidate who 
wants to eliminate many smallbusiness regulations she is against 
higher taxes and abortion but favors helping women on welfare find 
jobs by providing day care and she said she approves the expanded 
use of nuclear power 
since becoming a candidate she also has adopted her family 
surname saying i cherish the connection it embodies what i am 
today 
omeara 36 is a seasoned organizer having worked on several 
gubernatorial and congressional campaigns he was an aide to snowe 
before taking a position in 1981 with cohen for whom he has served 
as campaign finance director he now is in charge of the senators 
six offices in maine 
omeara said he favors reductions in the federal deficit is 
prochoice on abortion favors the equal rights amendment and wants 
action not further study to curb acid rain pollution

the soviet press said sunday that president reagan 
had made a turnaround on eastwest relations in the past three 
years resulting from a fresh look at changing world realities 
rather than a reversal of his staunch anticommunist views 
one commentator said the soviet union has high hopes for 
reagans fourth summit meeting with mikhail s gorbachev but 
another said progress will depend largely on whether reagans 
approach is realistic and constructive 
soviet television preempted regular programming for a live 
broadcast of the presidents arrival at moscows vnukovo airport 
and his initial meeting with the soviet leader in st georges hall 
in the kremlin 
an expanded 90minute version of the evening news program 
vremya devoted a full 52 minutes to the summit rerunning much 
of the welcoming ceremony at the airport and the speeches by both 
leaders it also carried more than two minutes on nancy reagans 
tour of the cathedral of the assumption conducted by raisa 
gorbachev giving rare prominence to the wife of a soviet leader 
vremya carried a lengthy interview with gorbachev adviser 
georgi arbatov a member of the soviet communist party central 
committee and director of the institute of usa and canada he 
dismissed past antisoviet speeches by reagan as propaganda 
i didnt see in them any serious political topics arbatov 
said it was what is called in america public relations and in 
many cases of course unconvincing propaganda 
vremya also took to the streets for public opinion on the 
summit many people spoke of hopes for peace and lessening the 
nuclear threat although one man scolded the united states for 
raising human rights issues 
they should report on their own human rights problems before 
discussing ours the unidentified man told the vremya 
interviewer 
staterun newspapers printed traffic restrictions that will be 
in effect until reagan leaves the soviet capital on thursday 
the communist party newspaper pravda printed reagans official 
portrait and biography in the bottom right corner of its front 
page as is customary for visiting heads of state 
tass the official news agency said that the biographies of a 
son of a shoe dealer from illinois and a son of a peasant from the 
stavropol region represent the essence of the two opposite ways 
of life 
said tass this is going to be a meeting of two fundamentally 
different social systems with their own values ideals and 
priorities the relations between them determine to a large extent 
the fate of the whole planet 
in a separate dispatch tass diplomatic correspondent vadim 
biryukov wrote 
just three years ago there was hardly anyone who could 
imagine that the 40th american president known for his 
anticommunist views and power approaches to the solution of 
problems on the international scene would be the high 
representative of the united states that would sign a sovietus 
intermediaterange nuclear forces treaty and moreover bring to the 
soviet capital the first document on nuclear arms reduction in 
history ratified by the us senate 
does it mean that the american leader has changed his views 
biryukov asked 
perhaps it would be more correct to describe this turnaround 
as a result of understanding the fact that the world has changed 
and that the interests of our countries are changing and the 
president has probably taken a fresh look at the existing realities 
without giving up his known views 
biryukov said the soviet union pins its most serious hopes 
on the summit meeting 
pravda said summit progress depends largely on how realistic 
and constructive is reagans approach 
biryukov wrote that since the december summit talks in 
washington the united states has not allowed any progress toward 
agreement on the reagans star wars plan for a spacebased shield 
against nuclear attack the soviets regard the strategic defense 
initiative as a violation of the 1972 antiballistic missile treaty

one of britains leading astrologers says the 
stars are wrong for this weeks postsummit meeting in london 
between president reagan and british prime minister margaret 
thatcher 
reagan an aquarian and mrs thatcher a libran enjoy a 
marvelous cerebral relationship with all the right ingredients to 
get things done but this isnt the week to do them said russell 
grant president emeritus of the british astrological psychic 
society 
press association britains domestic news agency said sunday 
it commissioned the forecast from grant 
grant said reagans meeting with mrs thatcher on thursday and 
friday with mercury starting to go backwards through the planetary 
system comes during a very unstable period 
the president flies to london after his meeting in moscow with 
soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev 
if he has got an astrologer advising him i would have steered 
clear of this period more than any other time in the year grant 
said 
you could reach an agreement today and in a months time 
people could renege on it he said what is going on at the 
moment is so volatile and so unpredictable that you really cannot 
stand by what is said 
but the astrologer said the intuitive powers of nancy reagan a 
shrewd cancerian could be invaluable during the presidents 
london visit 
he said queen elizabeth ii a taurus who is having a tea for the 
reagans at buckingham palace on thursday would also be a positive 
influence 
mrs reagans interest in astrology made headlines around the 
world this month when former white house chief of staff donald 
regan published a book alleging that the first ladys astrological 
advice affected the presidents schedule 
the president has denied this

a soul food restaurant it isnt although 
some patrons might wonder about souls wafting through the rooms of 
a soontoopen eatery converted from a funeral home 
i have not encountered any negative reaction from the local 
people about it phil robbins coowner of the new restaurant 
the gables said recently the local folks have dropped in and 
they seem to be very excited about it 
robbins 47 one of three owners of the former jacoby brothers 
funeral home said holding parttime jobs as a cook when he was 
younger in order to supplement his teachers salary piqued his 
interest in restaurants 
so april 29 robbins and two other alton high school employees 
one a school teacher and the other a custodian bought the 
building for 65500 
though reaction has been positive at least one local restaurant 
owner wonders whether eating at the gables set to open in 
midjune will be hard to swallow 
i could see where it might raise some questions some people 
it might bother if theyre kind of squeamish anyway said lori 
schneider who manages grandmothers kitchen she says eating at 
the restaurant wouldnt bother her 
judy goforth the local postmaster said this business about 
a funeral home doesnt seem to be a big deal because the towns so 
small theres probably nobody in the funeral home more than five 
times a year 
in a small town she explained you go to the funeral 
the church and somebody has a big meal afterward 
and anyway she added the majority of the people will be 
tourist types the ones who live here arent the superstitious 
type 
the whiteframe building with spacious rooms was built around 
1900 it has been home to graftons mayor and the village dentist 
and was converted to a funeral home about 15 years ago 
the 2500squarefoot restaurant will hold about 200 customers 
robbins says the gables menu will be moderately priced and feature 
seafood and chicken 
he expects most patrons will be tourists visiting the 
mississippi river town of 1000 about 30 miles northeast of st 
louis 
robbins said the he plans to include a brief history of the 
building on the menu including its funereal past and he stressed 
that jacoby brothers was only a viewing parlor and mortuary 
work was done elsewhere 
i think well get over our hurdle if theres any hurdle at 
all he said

the commander of 
this supersophisticated warship says its presence in the persian 
gulf gives us officials many new options including reducing the 
number of navy vessels 
i think that it really gives the tactical commanders here in 
the gulf an opportunity to pick and choose as they see fit capt 
will c rogers iii said in an interview on the bridge of the 
9400ton vincennes 
the vincennes on was on its first trip north through the gulf 
its arrival in the waterway was part of an extensive turnover in 
the navys gulfbased force planned for the next several days at 
least 10 ships are involved in the rotation announced by the 
pentagon in april 
the san diegobased vincennes is the first of the navys 
billiondollar aegis missile cruisers to be deployed as a member of 
the middle east force operating in the gulf 
the aegis system is an array of powerful radars and missile 
weaponry linked with computers to enable a single ship to manage a 
widespread battle carrying out dozens of radar surveillance and 
firing missions at the same time 
us officials have not explained why the vincennes designed 
primarily for carrier battle group defense in the open ocean is 
being assigned to the gulf where its long reach and massive clout 
would appear to exceed any current threat posed to the navys 
convoy escort operations or us interests 
some vincennes officers and crew members say privately they are 
puzzled by the deployment the ship was abruptly pulled out of a 
naval exercise off california after less than four days in port to 
prepare it made a 13000mile highspeed dash to the arabian sea 
in 32 days 
the vincennes varied capabilities can make it the equivalent of 
several other warships in a combat situation rogers said saturday 
it can be a force multiplier on the other side of the coin 
because of these capabilities to manage an area as large as the 
persian gulf virtually as far as its surveillance capabilities it 
can be a force reducer as well he said 
asked whether the navy was considering a cut in the 17 warships 
it has in the gulf rogers said that was above my pay grade but 
there certainly is an option there 
iran and iraq both have attacked neutral ships during the 
tanker war a fouryear spinoff of their 7year gulf war more 
than 500 commercial vessels have been damaged several have been 
sunk and more than 300 seamen have died during the tanker war 
rogers who earlier described iran as a lowlevel threat in 
the gulf said the armed speedboats used by iran to raid neutral 
shipping usually in reprisal for iraqi air attacks cannot be 
disregarded 
small craft are always difficult targets and a dedicated 
attack by anyone who wants to press it home is a difficult problem 
to deal with regardless of the capabilities of the defender he 
said 
rogers said his ship would stay alert but at the same time i 
dont want to give the impression that were leaning forward on our 
toes to get a major conflagration started here because thats not 
the case at all 
us policy in the gulf recently was expanded to allow navy 
ships to intervene in attacks on vessels not flying the us flag 
iran has carried out four such raids since then but us officials 
say no american warships were close enough to get involved 
rogers a native of fort worth texas said the vincennes 
despite its hightech radar and weapons is as vulnerable as other 
warships to mines and that basically is where our prime concern 
is

the valedictorian at st bernard high 
school was a bit wistful at last weeks graduation as he recalled 
some of the problems his class faced at one of the parishs 
singlesex secondary schools 
during freshman year the boys in his class had to cope with 
intimidation from upperclassmen joseph zanco said 
in our sophomore year we had another problem to deal with 
females they were everywhere but in the school he said 
zancos successor will be spared that lament because next year 
the four high schools in st bernard parish in suburban new orleans 
will go coeducational for the first time in a generation 
the change was sparked by a lawsuit won last year by a parent 
last year who wanted his son and daughter to attend the same school 
hilbert walls suit said his children were victims of 
discrimination because they werent being taught the same things 
calls to walls home went unanswered sunday 
courtordered racial desegregation of new orleans schools helped 
lead to the sexual segregation of st bernards high schools 22 
years ago 
the parish was a magnet for socalled white flight from the 
inner city and the population boom strapped the school boards 
budget to economize school officials decided to split high 
schools by sex building sports stadiums at boys schools and home 
economics labs at girls schools 
at the time we thought we were doing the taxpayers a 
service davies said it all went off quite well in those 
days there werent many boys trying to be cheerleaders and being 
a secretary was still thought of as a job for girls so there was 
no reason to have a big stenographic lab for boys they just 
werent going to sign up for it 
school board president john lane said the reversion to 
coeducation wont be cheap a nofrills conversion modifying 
bathrooms adding extra equipment and duplicating courses will 
cost the board about 300000 he said 
financially its going to be devastating this year lane 
said but the staff is ready and the kids are ready 
henry smith a supervisor with st bernard parish schools 
looked forward to the change it teaches kids to socialize 
better and its my personal observation that students tend to 
behave a bit better he said

democratic presidential frontrunner michael 
dukakis wooed environmentalists sunday while campaigning in advance 
of new jerseys primary and prepared to meet with black supporters 
to plot a national strategy for the fall 
the massachusetts governor apparently confident of a win here 
june 7 made only two public appearances taking a boat cruise with 
environmentalists before heading to a barbecue 
as the ss miss belmar prepared to head out into polluted ocean 
waters dukakis told a small gathering at the docks that as 
president he would forcefully direct cleanup programs 
im going to do everything i can as president of the united 
states to make sure that our oceans and our rivers and our 
coastlines are what they ought to be dukakis said 
he said a strong federal environmental policy is particularly 
needed in areas like new jersey which blames much of the pollution 
in its waters on neighboring new york 
ironically the reagan administration appointee who heads the 
boston epa office had to get a court order to speed up the dukakis 
administrations cleanup of boston harbor the nations filthiest 
harbor 
nobody is without sin dukakis said conceding he was wrong 
to delay the cleanup which will cost more than 3 billion 
while aboard the boat members of local environmental groups 
showed dukakis a harbor chart marked in areas polluted by sewage 
sludge and trash dumping less than a mile off one public beach a 
brown film covered the water which was strewn with floating 
garbage 
its pretty disgusting dukakis said 
dukakis denounced the dumping of raw sewage into waterways and 
said the nations trashdisposal problem could be eased with vastly 
expanded recycling and conservation programs he also spoke in 
favor of new biodegradeable plastics made from corn and other 
crops 
dukakis who hopes to lock up the democratic nomination with 
wins in new jersey and california on the final primary day also 
attended three private receptions a gathering with hispanic 
leaders an environmental forum and a reception for a state senator 
running for congress 
he was to return home to boston sunday night and meet monday 
morning with about 60 black supporters from across the country 
before attending local memorial day services 
dukakis has conceded the black vote to rival democrat jesse 
jackson throughout the primary season in recent weeks however he 
has begun to actively seek black support which is seen a critical 
in order to defeat the expected gop candidate vice president 
george bush particularly in closely contested southern states 
jackson also was in new jersey on sunday while bush was 
conducting private meetings with advisers at his summer home in 
maine 
polls have shown dukakis with a wide lead over jackson here 
dukakis was to return to new jersey later this week before 
heading back to california to campaign through primary day he also 
plans to make stops in montana and new mexico which also hold june 
7 primaries

hundreds of syrian troops with automatic 
weapons patrolled the slums of south beirut on sunday and a 
leading shiite moslem cleric pledged to work for the release of 
foreign hostages believed held there 
although i possess no great means of pressure i shall exert 
continuous efforts to resolve the question of the hostages 
sheikh mohammed hussein fadlallah spiritual guide of the 
proiranian hezbollah was quoted as saying 
i am viewing the hostages issue from both humanitarian and 
islamic standpoints it is hurting our credibility the beirut 
daily addijar quoted fadlallah as saying in an interview published 
sunday 
fadlallah has made several such pledges in the past three years 
although hezbollah or party of god has publicly denied 
involvement in the kidnappings the group is widely believed to be 
an umbrella for underground factions that are holding the hostages 
in damascus an informed syrian source said the hostages were 
not part of a syrianiranian deal under which the syrian army 
intervened friday to halt a threeweek battle between rival shiite 
militias that killed 300 people and wounded 1000 the source spoke 
on condition of anonymity 
syrias information minister mohammed salman said saturday 
that there is no timetable for the release of the hostages 
salman said syria was seeking to establish a central authority 
in lebanon ravaged by 13 years of civil war 
unless we reach that there will not be presidential 
elections he said warning of a constitutional vacuum after 
president amin gemayels term ends in september 
a syrian command source said saturday that syrian soldiers would 
remain outside the hay madi district which harbors the main 
barracks of the hezbollah 
most of the 18 foreign hostages including nine americans were 
believed to be held in the hezbollah barracks the hostage held 
longest is american terry anderson chief middle east correspondent 
for the associated press he was kidnapped march 16 1985 
a lebanese security source speaking on condition of anonymity 
said the syrian deployment around hay madi would stop kidnappers 
from moving the hostages from one place to another 
the syrians armed with automatic weapons and rocketpropelled 
grenade launchers moved into the south beirut suburbs after the 
fighting between hezbollah and the prosyrian amal militia 
during the fighting hezbollah seized control of more than 90 
percent of the 16squaremile enclave from amal 
salman said saturday that syrian troops would withdraw within 
a few days and leave security in the hands of lebanese police 
but on sunday salman said he meant that they would be withdrawn 
gradually and only as the security situation allowed 
he said syrian troops will remain stationed at eight points on 
the perimeter of the area and be on constant alert to move in 
when security demands or when requested by the lebanese security 
forces 
he also said the syrians have no plans to disarm either amal or 
hezbollah

the uprising which began dec 8 has quieted 
a militant jewish settler said her car was stoned by about 150 
schoolgirls near the west bank town of qalqiliya and that she had 
to fire into the air before the army rescued her 
daniella weiss a leading figure in the gush emunim bloc of the 
faithful settlement movement criticized the army for reopening 
the schools there is no justification for allowing them to go 
back to regular studies because they are becoming a terrorist 
force she told israel radio 
the worst violence was in the isolated west bank village of 
jaba north of nablus military sources and hospital officials said 
troops wounded seven palestinians with live bullets 
israel radio quoted arab reports as saying an arab woman died in 
the clash but the army denied the report 
the sources said the clash occurred when protesters blocked the 
road to jaba with stones and threw rocks at a patrol trying to get 
in the soldiers fired tear gas and rubber bullets but opened fire 
with live ammunition after the protesters refused to disperse 
in the west bank village of bazzariya near nablus an officer 
shot and wounded an arab villager after the man attacked him with a 
cement block at a roadblock set up by protesters the army said 
in the gaza strip a 29yearold man was in serious condition at 
shifa hospital after being shot by israeli troops who fired on 
stonethrowers in the shati refugee camp hospital officials said 
on saturday night youths threw stones and firebombs in nearby 
jabaliya camp and israeli troops responded with tear gas and 
rubber bullets arab news reports said about 60 people were 
treated for injuries at the camp clinic

opened a week after classes resumed in elementary schools and 
kindergartens high schools are to reopen next week 
at one middle school for girls in elbireh the principal showed 
a reporter damage that she said was done by israeli soldiers who 
used the school as a headquarters she spoke on condition that her 
name and the name of the school not be used 
in one room obscenities about arabs were written on walls in 
hebrew with an orange crayon the star of david and the word 
israel in hebrew also were scrawled on several classroom walls 
samira mustafa a mother of two teenage daughters said parents 
were worried about israeli soldiers stationed near palestinian 
schools 
its quiet now why are the soldiers outside the schools 
she asked they want the boys and girls to throw stones at them 
a young girl in a school uniform was asked if she thought 
reopening schools signaled quieter times i dont think so 
because even the uprising people want us to go back to class she 
said 
a spokesman for the military government in the west bank said 
that the government is expected to free from prison dozens of 
youths ages 14 to 18 who were arrested in demonstrations and want 
to return to classes 
this is a goodwill gesture on our part said spokesman 
olivier rafowicz we think it could help in a kind of 
normalization

white house chief of staff howard baker said 
sunday that president reagan still has confidence in attorney 
general edwin meese iii but believes meeses legal problems could 
harm george bush politically 
baker said reagan certainly doesnt have a closed mind about 
meese but the chief of staff added it would take an 
extraordinary event to shake that confidence that the president 
still has in the attorney general 
baker interviewed on nbcs meet the press was questioned 
about reports that vice president bush would like to see meese 
leave the justice department and said that while bushs opinions 
carry weight in the administration the president must decide 
these issues himself 
baker acknowledged meeses problems could hurt bushs election 
prospects but added that the show isnt over yet noting that 
independent counsel james mckay has yet to report the results of 
his investigation of the attorney generals financial dealings 
lets give meese his opportunity to rebut whatever 
allegations if any are made in the mckay report before we make a 
final judgement on its ultimate political impact baker said 
asked if reagan shares bakers judgement that meeses woes could 
hurt bush politically baker said oh i think so for the 
moment and to some degree but i think that he too would urge you 
to wait and see how all this unfolds and develops

democrat michael dukakis wooed new jersey environmentalists 
sunday while rival jesse jackson continued his attacks on the 
reagan administrations drug policy as the primary campaign headed 
into the final stretch republican george bush vacationing in 
maine again met with advisers to map out his november strategy 
with the four remaining primaries just over a week away the two 
democrats spent their memorial day weekend campaigning in new 
jersey which has 109 delegates at stake all told 466 delegates 
are up for grabs on june 7 in california new mexico montana and 
new jersey 
dukakis is within striking distance of the 2081 needed to 
nominate with 1711 delegates jackson has 984 delegates 
frontrunner dukakis who leads jackson in recent new jersey 
opinion polls took a boat cruise with environmentalists and also 
attended three private receptions 
dukakis inspected polluted waters off asbury park nj saying 
its pretty disgusting 
he promised to work aggressively to direct environmental cleanup 
programs but acknowledged that his own states efforts to clean up 
dirty boston harbor had gotten off to a slow start 
while the candidate campaigned in new jersey the british 
broadcasting corp televised a taped interview with dukakis in 
which the massachusetts governor said the soviet unions economic 
problems led kremlin leader mikhail s gorbachev to another summit 
with president reagan 
dukakis said gorbachev is probably the first soviet leader to 
recognize that communism is a failure at least the way its been 
practiced in the soviet union 
unless the soviet union begins to devote significantly more 
resources to its domestic economy and less to the military 
than theyre going to become a thirdrate economic power he said 
dukakis who was interviewed by the bcc last week while he 
campaigned in california said most thoughtful observers agree 
that it is the very serious condition of the soviet domestic 
situation that has been largely responsible for gorbachevs 
involvement in the summit 
jackson meanwhile renewed his criticisms of the 
administrations decision to negotiate with panamanian ruler manuel 
antonio noriega who faces charges of drug trafficking 
theyre negotiating with noriega for silence jackson told a 
breakfast fundraiser in newark nj and churchgoers at the new 
hope baptist church 
the democratic candidate suggested that reagan tried to work out 
a deal to force noriega from power to silence him before the moscow 
summit with gorbachev 
jackson said bush would like to see noriega silenced before the 
general election in november 
with the last round of primaries approaching jackson was 
acknowledging that his campaign was nearing its end 
when the race is over june 7 life goes on june 8 he said 
but added we should never forget this campaign 
he also noted that bush has been raising the drug issue and 
suggested that his own emphasis on the issue was responsible for 
the vice presidents interest 
bush has thanked me but he should ask me how to do it because 
he doesnt know how jackson said now that ive set the 
agenda i want to work out the plan 
bush who is spending the week at his vacation retreat in 
kennebunkport maine met with his close advisers sunday to 
continue mapping his strategy for the november election 
the likely republican nominees showing in recent opinion polls 
in which he trails dukakis in a oneonone matchup in double 
digits in some surveys has advisers worried about his prospects 
bush met with republican govs john sununu of new hampshire and 
james thompson of illinois on saturday to plan how to depart from 
some reagan administration policies 
the vice president is a man firmly committed to setting his 
own agenda thompson said after the meeting i dont think 
there was any doubt about that at all 
sununu said the domestic side is going to be one of the strong 
points of the bush campaign and the bush presidency in contrast 
to what he said were management failures of the dukakis 
administration as governor of massachusetts 
in response to sununus comments dukakis spokesman leslie dach 
said if there werent jobs in massachusetts for the people who 
lived in new hampshire the new hampshire unemployment rate would 
practically triple

about 600 turkish cypriots rallied sunday 
to demand the removal of the austrian commander of the un 
peacekeeping force on the divided island after a un soldier 
killed a turkish cypriot 
protesters burned an effigy of maj gen gunther greindl the 
commander of the 2300man un force and carried banners calling 
him a murderer 
the rally followed a religious service in a mosque in famagusta 
in memory of hussein kafa the 57yearold farmer was killed may 21 
in the village of pyla the only place where the turkish cypriots 
and greek cypriots still live together 
officials of the un force said kafa crossed into the 
peacekeeping forces zone of operations in the village claiming he 
wanted to mend a wall around his farm 
they said that when two austrian soldiers ordered him out of the 
buffer zone he drew a pistol and fired at them the soldiers fired 
back three pistol shots killing kafa instantly 
rauf denktash president of the breakaway turkish cypriot state 
in the northern third of the island charged after the shooting 
that greindl ordered austrian troops to harass kafa and held him 
responsible greindl denied the allegation 
at the end of the rally kafas three daughters left a black 
wreath at the austrian base 
the eastern mediterranean island has been divided into greek and 
turkish sectors since 1974 when turkey invaded the island in the 
wake of an athensbacked coup 
in another development kenan atakol head of the foreign and 
defense ministeries of the selfproclaimed turkish state accused 
the peacekeepers of negligence in the shooting death of a turkish 
soldier by greek cypriot police on saturday 
cpl yusuf sanli was shot after he tried to rape a greek cypriot 
woman fatally shot a national guardsman and wounded another 
officials in the southern greek sector said 
the village where the killing took place is in the buffer 
zone which should be under the control of the un force atakol 
said at a news conference they should not have let the armed 
greek cypriots enter this region 
about 30000 turkish soldiers are based in the turkish sector 
the village atheniou is near the green line that divides the 
sectors 
greek cypriot police moved into the village southeast of nicosia 
several hours after the guardsmen were shot and fatally shot the 
soldier when he tried to open fire at them 
there is negligence on the part of the peacekeeping forces 
atakol said had they informed us before the operation launched 
death of the two soldiers would have been avoided 
he said sanli might have crossed the line by mistake and tried 
to hide or ask for food my investigation shows that he was a 
goodmannered disciplined and religious person he said

scratch when her mount nun sense died a few minutes before the 
start 
a horse called mother superior to be ridden by sister sebastian

a dissident historian predicted sunday that a 
joint sovietpolish investigation will determine that soviet not 
nazi german forces were responsible for a world war ii massacre of 
thousands of polish soldiers 
i think the new commission will determine we are to blame 
roy a medvedyev said in a telephone interview 
the soviet government has for years blamed the killing of more 
than 4000 polish officers in the katyn forest on nazi occupation 
forces but on may 11 the soviet newspaper literary gazette 
published the first hint that moscow would accept the version of 
western historians 
western scholars say the massacre in the forest near smolensk 
250 miles west of moscow was carried out in april 1940 by the nkvd 
the soviet state security and police force headed then by 
lavrenti beria the dreaded henchman of dictator josef v stalin 
i have seen german protocols which said that soviet bullets 
were found in the exhumed bodies the literary gazette quoted 
soviet historian a latshev as saying at a moscow symposium of 
polish and soviet historians and filmmakers 
latshev said the blank spot of the katyn massacre could no 
longer be tolerated 
soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev under his policy of 
glasnost or openness has encouraged historians to uncover the 
truth about historical events that were formerly distorted or 
banned from discussion the policy has led to sensational 
admissions of repressions under stalin 
last year gorbachev and polish leader gen wojciech jaruzelski 
signed an agreement on ideological cooperation that stressed the 
necessity for a more truthful history of polishsoviet relations a 
sovietpolish commission was set up to investigate blank spots 
in the two countries relations 
radio moscow in a report thursday monitored by the british 
broadcasting corp in london said a wreathlaying ceremony was 
held at a recently renovated monument at katyn to the polish 
officers shot dead by the nazis in 1941 but the report went on 
to say that version of the massacre was now being reconsidered 
relatives and families of the executed polish officers will 
under new rules be allowed to visit the memorial the broadcast 
quoted smolensk regional official alexei orlov as saying 
in 1944 a soviet commission stated that the officers were 
killed by germans but in the early 1950s a us investigatory 
commission blamed the soviets 
mevedyev said times have changed and that the poles insist on 
an objective investigation he predicted the result will be a 
finding that stalin and beria were responsible

drag racing fans pelted police 
with rocks beer cans and bottles and nine people were arrested in 
clashes with police that forced the closing of bonneville raceway 
on its biggest night of the year 
dozens of spectators got cuts scrapes and police dog bites in 
brawling that broke out about 8 pm saturday but only two were 
treated for minor injuries authorities said 
west valley city police chief dennis nordfelt said three 
officers were treated for injuries caused by flying rocks and 
glass practically every officer that was there got hit or 
kicked or hit with a projectile including myself he said 
the melee began after two offduty west valley police officers 
working as track security tried to arrest an unruly spectator and 
forced him to the ground norfelt said 
the officers were jumped by other fans and called for 
assistance they were joined by six or seven other officers with a 
dog unit 
violence then erupted in waves between an angry crowd of 500 to 
1000 spectators and about 75 officers including officers from 
adjacent salt lake city the salt lake county sheriffs department 
and state highway patrol 
most fans apparently were not aware of the fighting until police 
ordered the track closed for safety reasons about 830 pm and 
tried to clear the area inciting the mob further 
the disturbance was the worst ever at the annual fox hunt 
drag race typically the raceways most raucous and popular event 
this years race drew contestants from around the west and 10000 
to 12000 spectators 
dick godfrey owner of the raceway said saturday that police 
were to blame for responding overzealously to an isolated problem 
involving only a few fans 
if they police had waited 45 more minutes the race would 
have been over and we would not have had this problem godfrey 
said 
nine people were arrested on charges of public intoxication 
disorderly conduct inciting a riot assault and resisting arrest 
he said 
nordfelt said law enforcement officials met sunday with godfrey 
and plan further meetings this week to seek ways to eliminate

about 1267 companies from 20 western 
countries are doing business in south africa but 188 companies from 
seven countries have pulled out according to a survey published 
monday 
the international confederation of free trade unions survey said 
britain led the field with 374 companies still operating in south 
africa it said the united states led the countries that pulled out 
with 134 companies 
the brusselsbased confederation is the largest trade union 
organization in the noncommunist world with a membership of 87 
million workers in 97 countries 
activists have urged western companies to withdraw from south 
africa to pressure the government to end apartheid 
under apartheid south africas system of traditional and 
legalized racial segregation the 26 million blacks have no vote in 
national affairs the 5 million whites control the economy and 
maintain separate districts schools and health services 
confederation secretary general john vanderveken said in a press 
release that the report was clear evidence of the triumph of 
corporate greed over morality 
he derided the claim often made by investors in south africa 
that their presence could be an instrument for reform cheap 
labor is what brings them to south africa not a desire to restore 
social justice vanderveken said 
the report was particularly critical of companies such as the 
british tyre and rubber co which it said are failing to respect 
internationally agreed minimum standards on wages and working 
conditions 
it also blamed some british companies for claiming to have 
pulled out of south africa but having retained substantial 
interests there 
the independent black trade union movement of south africa is 
adamant that economic sanctions remain the best way of bringing 
peaceful change to their country vanderveken said the icftu 
remains committed to that policy

the army once again postponed the test burn 
of a pershing ii rocket motor sunday and will have to conduct the 
test by tuesday or face a further 30day delay officials said 
the test burn is an important step in imposing terms of the 
intermediaterange nuclear forces treaty which calls for the 
united states and the soviet union to eliminate mediumrange 
missiles 
mary wilson spokeswoman for the pueblo army depot activity 
said army officials were told they have until 5 pm tuesday to 
finish the test or it will have to be postponed under the inf 
treaty 
after the treaty enters into force all assets of both 
countries covered by the treaty would be frozen for 30 days she 
said the test must then be treated as an elimination and done 
according to provisions of the treaty 
the inf treaty was ratified friday by the us senate friday and 
by the soviet presidium on saturday the treaty is expected to be 
formalized by president reagan and soviet leader mikhail gorbachev 
during the current moscow summit and will be in force wednesday 
adverse weather conditions have forced repeated postponements 
since the originally scheduled test date of may 20 
wilson said an absence of wind led to sundays postponement on 
saturday instability in the upper winds and a threat of 
thunderstorms forced officials to call off the test 
the army is aiming for a test burn at about 630 am monday 
wilson said 
if the test isnt completed by tuesday a soviet delegation 
probably would be allowed to monitor the test under the inf treaty 
wilson said 
the test burn is needed to determine the suitability of the 
pueblo site for destroying the armys 420 pershing missiles to 
comply with the inf treaty

a team from north carolina state university won a 
battle of wits sunday with students from 15 other schools to win 
the national college bowl championship 
the questions ranged from science and politics to entertainment 
trivia and contestants were quick to distinguish their sport from 
the popular board game trivial pursuit 
trivial pursuit is about trivia but college bowl is about 
things you should have learned in college said mike barkin a 
25yearold law school graduate on the team of runnerup emory 
university 
one might think of college bowl players as eggheads but 
eggheads are the worst college bowl players said don reid who 
created the television game show 35 years ago and attended this 
weekends contest 
it college bowl takes someone who is able to participate 
quickly in anything in life someone whos alive to whats going 
on in the world 
one question in the final between nc state and emory was on 
mondays tuesdays and thursdays he works from 9 to 5 on 
wednesdays from 9 to 1 and on fridays until early afternoon 
during working hours he often takes two or three hours to read and 
answer his fan mail 
emorys barkin pushed his buzzer and yelled president 
reagan before the moderator finished reading the question 
that was correct but it wasnt good enough to match the points 
nc state team tallied during the twoday event at the chicago 
campus of the university of illinois 
dan petrus a 24yearold veterinary student at nc state who 
trains four hours a week with his college bowl team said hes good 
at the game because i remember a lot of facts and im able to 
recall them quickly 
no prizes were awarded but petrus said the reward of beating 
fourperson teams from colleges such as princeton university 
university of chicago massachusetts institute of technology and 
cornell university is knowing that youve been able to think 
faster and outthink the others its an ego thing 
only six of the 100 contestants were women one of them peggi 
malys a medical student at emory said she likes the game because 
it develops mental agility and cultural literacy

former president siaka stevens 
who led this west african nation for 17 years died sunday at his 
home after a brief illness he was 82 
the government of sierra leone and all peoples congress party 
regret to announce the death of his excellency siaka stevens the 
government said in a statement 
it said stevens died at 150 pm 1050 am edt at his juba 
hill home in freetown the capital stevens slipped into a coma on 
thursday the second time since suffering a stroke in december he 
also had suffered partial paralysis on his left side his doctors 
said 
there was no immediate word on funeral plans 
stevens was one of the few african leaders ever to relinquish 
power voluntarily 
he became prime minister of sierra leone in 1968 after a 
military coup and assumed the presidency on april 21 1971 two 
days after sierra leone became a republic 
stevens was president until november 1985 when he transferred 
power to his handpicked successor maj gen joseph momoh the 
armed forces commander 
on a continent where leaders normally hold power for life 
stevens was only the fourth black african head of state to retire 
from office 
president leopold senghor of senegal who led his west african 
nation to independence from france in 1960 resigned in 1981 
amadou ahidjo resigned as president of cameroon in 1982 after 
governing for the first 22 years of independence 
julius nyerere of tanzania retired as president in 1985 just 
days ahead of stevens after 24 years in office but held onto the 
countrys most powerful political position chairmanship of the 
governing party 
stevens described in whos who in africa as a bluff 
friendly approachable pragmatic socialist was born aug 24 
1905 
he had made a name for himself and secured a following as a 
trade unionist when the british still ruled sierra leone 
as british rule came to an end stevens refused to join a 
threeparty coalition that was to assume power instead he formed 
the opposition all peoples congress 
stevens was on the sidelines on april 27 1961 when sierra 
leone became independent and sir milton margai became the countrys 
first prime minister 
margai died a day after the third anniversary of sierra leones 
independence and was succeeded as prime minister and head of the 
governing party by sir albert margai no relation 
stevens party won the march 1967 general elections but shortly 
after stevens was sworn in as prime minister he and other 
officials were arrested by the chief of the army 
after a month of infighting among the military that saw power 
change hands at least three times a militaryled national interim 
council took control and returned the leadership of the country to 
stevens civilian government 
he survived two coup attempts in september 1970 and march 1972 
stevens was among the first voices in what has become a chorus 
of protests in africa over the lending policies of the 
international monetary fund which normally demands that wouldbe 
borrowers cut subsidies devalue their currency and take other 
unpopular measures 
stevens called such moves political suicide 
sierra leone was in an economic crisis at the time of stevens 
retirement there were chronic shortages of fuel food and foreign 
exchange and the coastal nation of 5 million people had a 
reputation as a paradise for smugglers 
stevens relations with president momoh his former protege 
became strained after an unsuccessful coup plot early in 1987 the 
former vice president and 17 others were convicted of treason in 
the abortive attempt 
no charges were brought against stevens but several of those 
convicted were his close associates 
britain subsequently refused stevens a visa 
the coup plotters were sentenced to death their appeal is now 
before the high court

the moderate nationalist coalition 
convergencia i union led elections sunday to retain its majority in 
the 135seat catalonian regional parliament 
with 615 percent of the votes counted the party of regional 
government president jordi pujol lost two seats and kept 70 
regional government spokesman augusti bassols said the party won 
46 percent of the ballots counted in the northeastern autonomous 
region 
we have to be very satisfied after governing eight years to 
once again retain the absolute majority in the catalonian 
parliament pujol said 
the catalonian branch of the spanish socialist party won 297 
percent of the votes to retain its 41 seats 
the socialists control the national parliament in madrid and 
hold majorities or govern in coalitions in 10 of the countrys 17 
regional parliaments 
the communistoriented coalition catalonian initiative won 74 
percent of the vote and nine seats up three seats from 1984 the 
conservative popular alliance won 52 percent falling to six seats 
from 11 seats 
the republican left party won 42 percent of the vote and six 
seats while the centrist democratic social center of former prime 
minister adolfo suarez running for the first time obtained 38 
percent of the vote and three seats 
bassols said turnout was about 60 percent of the 45 million 
eligible voters in the autonomous region which includes the 
provinces of barcelona tarragon lerida and gerona 
the campaign characterized in the local and national press as 
boring revolved more around the personalities of the 
57yearold pujol and his 47yearold socialist rival raimon 
obiols than on substantive issues 
since 1980 pujol has been the undisputed leader of centerright 
catalonian nationalism which has been a potent force since the 
turn of the century in the region known for its industrial and 
commercial prowess 
in the 1960s when dictator gen francisco franco was in power 
in madrid pujol went to jail for defending democracy and 
catalonian language and culture 
pujol has jousted periodically with the central government for 
greater regional autonomy guaranteed to all 17 regions by spains 
1978 constitution 
like the other regions catalonia depends on revenues collected 
by madrid for its budget 
since spain returned to democracy in 1977 catalonians have 
tended to vote left in national elections and center or right in 
regional balloting

with two principal dancers from leningrads 
kirov ballet in starring roles and the american ballet theater 
company in top form a fulllength performance of la bayadere 
made for an electric evening 
altynai assylmuratova and farukh ruzimatov are the first soviet 
dancers to guest with american ballet theater 
la bayadere was first performed in russia in 1877 it was 
staged and choreographed after marius petipa for american ballet 
theater by natalia makarova in 1980 miss makarova who was a kirov 
ballet dancer before she defected to the west at that time danced 
the part of nikiya the temple dancer or bayadere 
on saturday night ruzimatov danced the role of the warrior 
solor who falls in love with the bayadere performed by miss 
assylmuratova then the radjah introduces solor to his daughter to 
be his bride and solor falls for her beauty 
when ruzimatov entered the stage he was a coiled spring a 
slim lithe man about to burst with energy an entrance of such 
contained excitement has seldom been seen since rudolf nureyev was 
young ruzimatov lived up to that promise with his turns in air 
the elevation of his jumps and the beauty of his technique 
miss assylmuratova has splendid technique also and her duet and 
solo dancing dazzled however she seemed tense instead of 
conveying freedom as she flew across the stage one expects her to 
relax more for her second performance also she didnt convey the 
acting part of her role as ruzimatov did his 
susan jaffe danced the radjahs daughter she held her own in 
what must have seemed daunting company 
victor barbee was very effective as the high brahmin who also 
loves the bayadere and whose mime gestures help move the plot 
johann renvall was the third acts bronze idol and did his solo in 
a dignified way instead of making it look silly 
the second act in the kingdom of the shades is all of la 
bayadere usually seen in this country its soothing beauty rests 
on the corps de ballets being able to move in unison and to hold 
long difficult balances on saturday night ballet theaters corps 
de ballet was exquisite

an investor group considering a takeover 
of payless cashways inc has stepped up pressure on the building 
materials retailer by asking for a special shareholders meeting to 
rescind a takeover defense provision 
the group also criticized a compensation plan for payless 24 
top officers if they lost their jobs because of a change in the 
companys ownership the plan which had not previously been 
disclosed was ratified earlier this month by payless board of 
directors payless spokeswoman brenda nolte said friday 
the investor group is led by new yorkbased takeover specialist 
asher b edelman and sutherland lumbersouthwest inc a privately 
owned competitor of payless that also is based in kansas city 
payless has about 200 stores in 25 states 
the group owns 99 percent of payless stock or 334 million 
shares and has said that it might attempt a takeover of the 
company 
the group disclosed its intentions may 19 when it said that it 
controlled 76 percent of payless stock it has spent about 70 
million since then to increase its holding in the company 
the investor group requested the special shareholders meeting in 
a letter sent to payless late friday the letter asked that the 
meeting be held within 90 days 
david stanley chairman and chief executive of payless has said 
that a takeover by the edelmansutherland group would not be in the 
best interest of the company 
payless adopted its takeover defense may 12 the same day it 
ratified the executive compensation plan the provision essentially 
increases the cost of a takeover 
financial analysts have said the takeover could cost as much as 
1 billion 
the investor group has asked that three amendments to payless 
bylaws be submitted to a vote by shareholders 
in addition to the amendment rescinding the takeover defense 
provision another amendment would allow shareholders to vote on 
any takeover offer made to the company that had the approval from 
holders of at least 10 percent of payless stock the third 
amendment would require any further takeover defenses to be 
approved by holders of at least 50 percent of the shares

the smell of success stinks say some 
residents of this eastcentral illinois town whose canneries supply 
food that stocks the nations cupboards 
each spring residents await the return of noxious fumes that 
waft off water used to process beans and corn at two local 
canneries that support the towns economy 
i just tell people it only hurts your nose it doesnt hurt 
your lungs said hoopeston chamber of commerce official rose 
buck thats the smell of success 
millions of gallons of the contaminated water are sprayed 
irrigationstyle onto nearby fields until winter weather arrives 
warm temperatures release the vapors and winds carry them around 
and into the town of 6400 residents 
while canning company officials say special equipment has 
helped the odor leaves many breathless 
there is nothing more offensive than the bean water said 
hoopeston city councilman willis bird who farms near the ponds 
sitting along illinois rts 1 and 9 you dont get used to it 
you just hope youre not in that field too long 
but the putrid smell best described as rotting vegetables 
represents money in the bank for the townspeople 
two centuryold hoopeston canneries owned by pillsburyjoan of 
arc canning co and stokely usa inc employ hundreds of local 
residents and pump millions of dollars into the areas economy 
thousands more migrant seasonal workers are hired each year to help 
with the fall harvest 
if we dont have that smell we would be in trouble bird 
said adding that most americans probably dont realize what 
hoopeston endures to keep canned goods in the nations grocery 
stores 
they dont even know where a can of beans comes from they 
dont know where milk comes from or how much work is done to keep 
the beans clean he said 
nine types of beans come into the pillsburyjoan of arc plant 
dry and must be washed and then soaked and softened in water most 
of the water is then discarded 
the rehydrated beans including kidney garbanzo and blackeyed 
peas are sold to consumers nationwide under the joan of arc and 
other labels and used in chili sold by the wendys hamburger chain 
plant manager gary kortkamp of pillsburyjoan of arc says the 
company invested in a 1 million stateoftheart water 
reclamation facility three years ago that eliminated much of the 
odor 
the system strains the larger bean parts out then pumps the 
water into tanks where microscopic organisms eat much of the 
remaining bean matter 
im talking about a relative smell kortkamp said on a 
scale of one to 10 we have improved it to an eight or nine 
but some odor remains bird said 
after they have processed it two or three times then it gets 
into that big lagoon out there then they spray it into the air and 
it gets a little rank he said 
in the fall fumes from water used to process sweet corn 
contribute to the odor problem pungent corn water then is sprayed 
onto fields north of town 
stokely sells the corn and a variety of other canned goods under 
its label 
while the scent might annoy some vistors many longtime 
residents say its all in the nose 
that doesnt stink a hoopeston policeman said when asked 
about the smell ive lived here all my life and im used to it
