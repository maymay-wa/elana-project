stable and friendly relationship 
saturday morning when the soviet delegation was at the alamo in 
san antonio two demonstrators told akhromeyev that he did not

friendship between the soviets and americans getting to know 
them

opposition candidate cuauhtemoc cardenas 
claimed victory in mexicos presidential elections saturday a day 
before the government planned to release the official results 
we have won the presidential elections the national 
democratic front candidate said we will not recognize 
authorities that might rise out of electoral fraud 
there was no immediate response from the governing institutional 
revolutionary party or its candidate carlos salinas de gortari 
which have also claimed victory 
cardenas told reporters he had won 10 of 31 states and the 
federal district which includes mexico city 
he said his victory claim was based on projections drawn from 
results leaked by the government and his leftofcenter coalitions 
own count of 67 million votes mexico has more than 38 million 
registered voters 
cardenas said he would win with 388 percent of the vote 
he said salinas would have 3269 percent winning five states 
and conservative national action party candidate manuel clouthier 
would be third with 255 percent of the vote winning in five 
states 
the federal election commission said saturday it would give the 
final official results from the presidential and congressional 
races to the political parties on sunday 
while cardenas and the governing party both claimed victory 
clouthier said saturday he was ahead in the national vote count he 
also announced a series of nationwide protests against fraud 
i summon you to declare yourselves in civil resistance from 
this moment on clouthier said told tens of thousands of 
supporters in mexico citys huge main plaza 
in northern mexico hundreds of national action party backers 
occupied one of four international bridges linking ciudad juarez 
with el paso texas saturday night in a driving rainstorm they 
vowed to remain until official election results were announced 
the party claimed it had taken four districts in juarez from 
institutional revolutionary party 
clouthier said institutional revolutionary party was now the 
third political force in the country 
his campaign manager francisco gonzalez garza said the 
national action party tally showed clouthier winning at least four 
senate seats and 12 of mexico citys 40 voting districts 
the institutional revolutionary party also released results 
saturday from what it said was 67 million votes 
the governing party said the results showed salinas leading with 
4869 percent of the vote cardenas second with 2716 percent and 
clouthier third with 1895 percent 
cardenas had earlier claimed winning the capital home to a 
fourth of mexicos 80 million people and institutional 
revolutionary party officials said privately they might have to 
concede the capital and the states of michoacan morelos and mexico 
to him 
the institutional revolutionary party has not lost a 
presidential gubernatorial or senate race since it was founded in 
1929 
like clouthier cardenas accused the governing party of 
widespread fraud in the elections 
cardenas earlier accused the governing party of trying to steal 
his mexico city triumph by demanding a recount in the federal 
district or seeking to nullify his votes 
i call upon the president of the republic and candidate carlos 
salinas de gortari to comply with their word and their commitment 
to preserve the legality of this electoral process he said 
the institutional revolutionary party has ordered local election 
officials in the capital to file formal complaints about what it 
claims are multiple votes for cardenas the government newspaper el 
nacional said saturday 
cardenas is on the ballot as the candidate of three parties 
after these parties officially unified behind him the 
institutional revolutionary partydominated election commission 
rejected a cardenas request to list him only once 
the institutional revolutionary party is claiming thousands of 
voters marked several party symbols on their ballot to vote for 
cardenas and that each mark was counted as a separate vote 
the opposition and citizen watchdog groups have been accusing 
the governing party of vote fraud since the polls closed on 
wednesday 
the assembly for effective suffrage a watchdog group said it 
found 1100 irregularities ranging from ballotstuffing and 
tampering with voter rolls 
alfonso bravo of the citizens assembly reported 
irregularities in 20 percent of the nearly 28000 voting booths it 
had monitored

michael dukakis staff broke off negotiations 
for an interview on abc news nightline after the shows host 
ted koppel refused to allow the democratic presidential candidate 
to appear on the set with him a newspaper reported 
the massachusetts governors campaign staff wanted to avoid a 
situation like that faced by vice president george bush who 
participated in a onehour interview with koppel last month the 
daily news reported in sundays editions 
during that interview bush the probable republican nominee 
was in houston while koppel anchored the show from washington dc 
the interview included a few slipups on the vice presidents 
part when he called koppel dan apparently referring to cbs 
news anchorman dan rather rather interviewed bush live in january 
and a heated confrontation ensued 
during the nightline interview bushs media adviser roger 
ailes finally had to resort to hanging a sign labeled ted on 
the camera according to the daily news 
with rare exceptions koppel insists that he be separated from 
his guests with each side speaking directly into a camera the 
setup ensures that no guest has an unfair advantage over another 
either through the use of body language or eye contact 
however an abc news source says dukakis press secretary 
leslie dach wants koppel and dukakis to appear together on the 
same set during the interview the news reported 
koppels rule has been broken when nightline wants the 
interview badly enough one notable exception was an interview last 
fall with former democratic presidential contender gary hart in 
which koppel and hart sat together the occasion marked harts 
first interview after withdrawing from the race

as reagan was releasing his statement adm william crowe 
chairman of the joint chiefs of staff told a news conference that 
the airbus had not responded to three warnings by the vincennes on 
a civilian distress network and four warnings on a military 
network and that the plane was descending toward the vincennes and 
accelerating like an attacking aircraft 
it is logical to conclude that while he is firing and they 
the gunboats are approaching him and an aircraft lifts off from 
iran goes toward him steady course high speed decreasing 
altitude will not vary will not contact him its a more logical 
conclusion that he may very well be in jeopardy crowe said 
the captain and others in the vincennes command center had only 
four minutes to make a decision crowe said 
but the version that emerged from the pentagon in those first 
hours soon began to change 
crowe said sunday the aircraft was four or five miles outside 
the civilian air corridor but by weeks end the pentagon 
acknowledged that as the iranians insisted flight 655 may have 
been on its prescribed path 
crowes assertion that the jetliner was descending came into 
question when it was disclosed that another navy ship the uss john 
h sides reported that the a300 was either holding steady or 
ascending the iranians insisted the plane was climbing 
although crowe reported numerous radio warnings by the 
vincennes irans ambassador to the united nations mohammad 
jaafar mahallati asserted there was no warning 
the pentagon also said the target flight 655 was sending 
radio signals on two channels one a military channel identified 
with the f14s a navy spokesman dismissed speculation that the 
military signal emanated from a second military aircraft 
iranian air force chief satari who was trained in the united 
states told reporters in tehran on thursday that the a300 pilot 
was in contact with the control tower at bandar abbas for 21 
minutes speaking in english and he believed us systems could 
have picked up the conversation 
rezaian was an experienced pilot who learned his job the 
american way at a boeing flight school in texas 15 years ago his 
5yearold daughter was born in oklahoma where his sisterinlaw 
and her husband live 
i think he flew that route many times and just like me and you 
going from our homes to work and come back we know our way i 
think its the same way for him said kamran sadeghi his 
brotherinlaw 
however the pilot performed said pentagon spokesman dan howard 
the iranians started the shooting sunday and had a responsibility 
to ensure the safety of their civilian aircraft by not sending 
them into harms way 
satari called the shooting intentional and unprovoked he 
said the us military accepted on purpose the risk of 
attacking civilian planes because it could not control its 
sophisticated systems 
technology and tactics mattered little to the crowds in tehran 
at mass funerals for flight 655s victims ceremonies that erupted 
into antiamerican rallies crowds spilled around the coffins 
shouting death to reagan revenge revenge and 
inevitably death to america

multibilliondollar weapons deal with saudi arabia threatens 
israels security and is a dangerous escalation of the arms race in 
the middle east 
army generals said the deal will enable the saudis to launch a 
preemptive strike against the jewish state 
britain announced friday it signed a 17 billion arms deal with 
saudi arabia supplanting the united states as the major arms 
supplier to the oilrich kingdom the sale includes fighter planes 
and helicopters 
prime minister yitzhak shamirs aide yossi benaharon said the 
sale will allow saudi arabia to hit us in the soft underbelly 
from the south using the long arm it is now acquiring 
the british government is saying it has improved relations 
with israel but we are not seeing it in any way on the ground 
this staggering sale of arms points in a different direction 
altogether benaharon told israel radio 
a statement published by the foreign ministry said the supply of 
weapons of an offensive nature to countries that are in a state 
of war with israel does not contribute to stablity in the region 
british officials said the deal included the sale of 50 to 60 
hawk jet training aircraft six mine sweepers for use in the 
persian gulf 90 helicopters about 50 tornado fighter planes and 
weapons systems about which they did not elaborate 
defense minister yitzhak rabin said the deal was part of an 
escalation of the arms race by most of the arab countries he 
added that it was an offshoot of the nearly 8yearold iraniraq 
war which gave a real push to the arms race in this region 
rabin speaking to 100 american rabbis said israel was also 
concerned about longrange surfacetosurface missiles supplied 
recently to syria as well as nerve gas and other chemical weapons 
he said were in the arsenals of three or four arab countries he 
did not name the countries 
if our deterrents will prove insufficient the defense 
minister said israel would make every effort to confront such 
threats 
maj gen avigdor ben gal a commander of israels forces in the 
1982 lebanon invasion said the new saudi weapons would make the 
kingdom capable of launching a preemptive aerial attack against 
israel in case of war 
other israeli officials charged britain with conducting an 
imbalanced policy in the middle east by selling weapons to saudi 
arabia while refusing to sell arms to israel

a key issue at the 13th congress of the 
governing natonalist party is how to shift political power from the 
old guard conservatives to a new breed of progressive young leader 
if that sounds familiar it is because the partys archrival 
the communist party of mainland china grappled with exactly the 
same question at its own 13th congress in october 
the communists in china last year eased out of power most of the 
aging leaders who fought alongside mao tsetung to defeat the 
nationalists in a civil war that ended in 1949 
nationalist leader chiang kaishek fled to taiwan with about 2 
million followers to set up a government in exile and many of 
those former mainlanders remain at the center of power on this 
island of nearly 20 million 
many old guard nationalist leaders have announced plans to step 
down at the congress but the final lineup remains unclear and is 
the subject of intense speculation on taiwan 
ironically new blood is needed in both china and taiwan to 
follow through with sweeping reforms made by aging leaders from an 
earlier generation 
in china pragamatist deng xiaoping boldly decided that opening 
up to the outside world and introducing marketoriented economic 
reforms was needed to rebuild his country after the ruinous 196676 
cultural revolution 
for his policy to succeed however deng needed to replace his 
conservative contemporaries with a younger generation that was more 
enthusiastic about improving the economy than about marxist 
ideology 
he triumphantly engineered the changing of the guard at the 
october meeting taking with him into retirement a host of 
conservatives who served on the central committee and politburo 
since the meeting chinese communist party leader zhao ziyang 
has continued to seek rapid change of the economic system and now 
is concentrating on marketoriented price reform a controversial 
move that has fueled inflation 
in taiwan the economy had been robust but the political system 
needed an overhaul to avoid serious confrontation with an 
increasingly restive population 
ailing president chiang chingkuo the son of chiang kaishek 
decided to start loosening his partys authoritarian which for 
nearly 40 years tolerated little dissent 
before he died of heart failure in january chiang lifted 38 
years of martial law allowed formation of opposition parties 
scrapped a ban on new newspapers and eased restrictions on travel 
to china to allow family reunions 
he also promised to change taiwans parliamentary system which 
ensures a majority of seats are held by aging nationalists who 
arrived from mainland china with chiang kaishek in 1949 
chiangs successor president lee tenghui has vowed repeatedly 
to continue the political liberalization program 
on sunday he proposed that half the nationalist partys central 
committee step down to make room for younger members and more 
native taiwanese 
lee also wants to reform the statedominated financial system 
and tackle other thorny problems that have largely been neglected 
such as pollution and social security 
lee undoubtedly wants likeminded nationalist members to replace 
the conservatives who still dominate the top levels of party and 
government 
lees task is not as easy as dengs however he is still 
forming a power base and chiang is not around to use his 
unquestioned leadership to convince aging comrades the time for 
change has arrived 
local media reported in june that as many as half of the 
policymaking central standing committee planned to step down but 
in past days some newspapers predicted the turnover would not be 
that great 
premier yu kuohwa 74 widely viewed as the leader of the 
conservative faction was under pressure from younger party members 
to step down 
still there seemed to be little doubt that many of the 
septuagenarians and octogenarians holding top party posts would 
retire and the cabinet overhauled the congress concludes on 
thursday 
lees task will be to make sure enough new blood flows through 
the party and government to proceed with the liberalization 
policies initiated by chiang at a pace brisk enough to keep the 
taiwanese people satisfied

they may have been not ready for prime time in 
1984 but this year the democrats hope to package their convention 
as a fastpaced dramatic program that will prove irresistible to 
tv networks and viewers 
it takes a special kind of viewer to sit through hours and 
hours of cspan said party spokesman mike mccurry referring to 
the cable public affairs network that will be broadcasting 
gaveltogavel coverage of next weeks convention 
with the three television networks scheduling only two to three 
hours of convention coverage each evening organizers are thinking 
more along the lines of the people who watch miami vice 
were trying to capture the mood and the spirit of the party 
in a fairly dramatic and appealing way short of entertainment 
tonight mccurry said 
planners are weighing details ranging from who will sing the 
star spangled banner each night to how to fit the boston pops 
into the convention program michael dukakis the nomineetobe 
asked that the orchestra be included his fatherinlaw is an 
associate conductor 
videotaped visual aids stirring music futuristic decor all 
are being coordinated by a hollywood company determined to produce 
a convention that leavens speeches with entertainment and elicits 
an emotional reaction from viewers 
given the networks short shrift and the average viewers 
attention span most speeches are being limited to two to 10 
minutes its certainly less time than most senators and members 
of congress are used to being asked to speak for mccurry said 
whether the politicians can or will play by the rules is 
unforseeable but organizers are planning a few practical ways to 
keep things moving among the precautionary measures a cadre of 
speechwriters available to trim upcoming speeches if the program 
falls behind schedule 
the objective is to avoid the type of snafu that forced dukakis 
out of prime time in 1984 the first year the three networks passed 
up gaveltogavel coverage in favor of an abbreviated approach 
dukakis as head of the platform committee was tapped to 
deliver the issues document to the convention between speech 
overruns general disorganization and a commitment to put jesse 
jackson in prime time the massachusetts governor ended up on the 
air just as prime time ended at 11 pm eastern time 
speechcutters teleprompter experts and other coaches will be 
located this year in rooms beneath the huge podium a complex 
mccurry described as where we make sausage speakers will be 
able to go over their remarks receive help in honing them and get 
coaching if they need it 
critical to the message communicated by dukakis and the 
democrats are the 13500 news people expected to attend the 
convention nearly three times the number of delegates who will be 
there 
we marry each other for this one week of wildness mccurry 
said of the party and the press but its a marriage of 
convenience only 
typical of the temporary intimacy is a joint venture by the 
democratic national committee and the presidential campaign hotline 
the hotline a daily media operation during the primary season 
plans an hourly update of schedules hot tips news accounts and 
messages from the dukakis and bush campaigns available to 
subscribers with computer modems 
the hotline boasts a wide network of sources among delegates and 
media organizations as well as official campaign and party 
organizations information is power at the convention says bob 
balkin a hotline editor 
the party agrees thats why along with their hotline tips 
subscribers will get the dncs party line a compendium of 
schedule changes speech texts press releases and other 
propaganda as mccurry calls it 
a convention is a crazy merrygoround and its driven by 
the flow of news and events and rumors the spokesman said 
wed rather be on the merrygoround than standing around 
watching it

a study by morgan guaranty trust co 
recommends a partial privatization of social security to avoid the 
temptation of squandering the huge surpluses now piling up in the 
systems trust funds 
it says such a move would give the united states a chance to 
dramatically increase its savings rate 
but the study warns that the nation must strenuously resist 
the temptation to splurge and spend the social security surpluses 
on medicare or other programs 
the study suggests that workers be allowed to divert 2 
percentage points of their payroll tax into individual investment 
accounts starting in 1990 when the tax climbs from 751 to 765 
percentage points 
for the typical taxpayer the diversion would amount to about 
500 to 1000 per year the study suggested with the money 
invested in accounts similar to todays individual retirement 
accounts but subject to tougher tests of investment suitability 
and tighter restraints on early withdrawals 
in exchange for the opportunity to build up private accounts 
the workers would eventually get reduced social security benefits 
but this approach would free up money for private investment and 
ensure that most of the social security reserve is productively 
invested said the study in the july issue of morgans world 
financial markets report the report is published by morgan 
guaranty trust co a subsidiary of jp morgan amp co inc 
after encountering severe deficits in the late 1970s and early 
1980s social securitys trust funds are now growing at a rapid 
pace 20 billion last year alone and an estimated 500 billion a 
year by 2015 the system is expected to have 12 trillion in 
reserve in 2030 or about 25 trillion in todays dollars 
by law all of that money must be invested in treasury 
securities each years social security surplus reduces the overall 
federal debt by an identical amount 
the morgan study said it is possible that by 2005 social 
securitys trust funds could absorb all outstanding federal 
debt 
the social security system expects its outgo to start exceeding 
its income around 2020 and would cash in its federal securities 
over the next three decades to help pay for the retirement of the 
postworld war ii baby boomers 
the morgan report said the temptation to squander the looming 
social security surpluses for immediate gain must be strenuously 
resisted 
with careful husbandry they present an unequaled 
opportunity to boost the us net savings and investment rates 
perhaps to as much as 8 percent of gnp it said 
the national savings rate has averaged 3 percent in the 1980s 
and dipped to just 19 percent in 1987 
wisely handled social security surpluses could make a 
dramatic difference for us economic prospects higher domestic 
savings not only would help eliminate the trade deficits and 
the associated dependence on foreign saving but also would help 
build up the nations productive capital stock it said that 
is the only convincing assurance of retirement security 
it likened social security to a benevolent ponzi pyramid 
scheme each new generation pays for the older generations 
retirement relying on subsequent generations to do the same 
any pyramid scheme will unravel if the pool of contributors 
fails to expand sufficiently fast this could well be the case with 
social security it said 
but it said switching entirely to a private savings system for 
retirement is unfeasible the best solution could be to privatize 
just the surplus portion of social security revenues it said 
when social security started running annual deficits in 2020 
workers would no longer be able to divert part of their payroll 
taxes to private accounts 
the study also suggests the possibility of restraining costs by 
reducing future benefits for middle and upperincome retirees and 
by raising the retirement age to 68 or 69 in the next century it 
is already scheduled to climb to 67 from 65 by the year 2027

investigation of former philippine president ferdinand marcos and 
the pentagon bribery probe are at the top of the justice department 
agenda as attorney general edwin meese iii prepares to leave office 
meese who is not participating in the pentagon investigation 
because his lawyers are representing clients involved in it will 
be gone from the justice department by the time federal prosecutors 
are ready to seek indictments in the pentagon investigation later 
this year 
but meese has said through a spokesman he hopes to wrap up a 
number of other loose ends before leaving in late july or early 
august including the question of whether the detroit free press 
and the detroit news should be allowed to merge their advertising 
circulation and production operations under the newspaper 
preservation act 
meese also may still be in office when the department decides 
whether to seek an indictment of marcos who has been investigated 
by a number of federal grand juries since he was ousted in february 
1986 marcos lives in exile in honolulu

department superiors to seek grand jury indictments against marcos 
and his wife imelda on fraud and other charges law enforcement 
officials have said 
the proposed charges include allegations of a conspiracy to 
steal from the philippine government over two decades and fraud in 
the way money was concealed in the united states behind false 
ownerships said the officials speaking on condition of anonymity

meese leaves 
the justice departments drug testing program which would 
subject 1800 employees in sensitive jobs to mandatory random 
urinalysis the employees many of them lawyers are suing the 
department saying the program that could begin shortly violates

general arnold burns and assistant attorney general william weld 
whose protest resignations march 29 over meeses continued tenure 
brought accusations of a serious leadership gap in the department

democrat william proxmire used to win 
reelection to the us senate while spending pocket change 
14510 in 1982 but now that hes retiring big spending has 
emerged as a major issue in the campaign to replace him 
the money issue ballooned after multimillionaire retailing heir 
herbert kohl entered the democratic primary which takes place 
sept 13 
and while his opponents say kohls spending will insult 
wisconsin voters and go against tradition polls suggest the 
opposite 
kohls primary election rivals including former gov anthony s 
earl and former national football league players union 
representative edward r garvey have denounced his heavy 
investment in television ads claiming he is attempting to buy the 
senate seat 
to suggest the people of wisconsin can be bought is not 
something that i have ever considered said kohl 53 owner of 
the milwaukee bucks of the national basketball association 
proxmire 72 won his seat in a 1957 special election to replace 
rightwing republican sen joseph mccarthy who had died proxmire 
became known as a sharp critic of government waste and won 
reelection with frugal spending 
in 1982 proxmire reported he spent 14510 down from 17775 
in 1976 
kohl has put nearly 500000 into television ads since his june 
1 entry according to a survey of tv stations in five cities 
one of kohls opponents rep jim moody dwis bowed out last 
week saying he couldnt compete and would instead seek reelection 
to the house 
money is now determining this senate race moody said 
kohl who was chairman of the state democratic party in 1977 
said he must invest in television ads to compete effectively 
because it is his first bid for public office unlike his seasoned 
opponents earl garvey and secretary of state douglas la follette 
kohls campaign has provoked complaints from garvey earl and la 
follette who contend he should campaign in the wisconsin 
tradition and join his rivals in debates on the issues earl was 
expected to start running radio ads stressing that argument 
i think what is happening is really insulting to the voters of 
wisconsin said garvey who led the nfl players out on strike 
1982 im trying to run a campaign wisconsinstyle 
but after kohls commercials started a poll conducted in late 
june by the milwaukee journal found him with 28 percent support 
just behind earls 31 percent and well ahead of moody and garvey 
each of whom had 12 percent la follette was last with 8 percent 
the polls margin of error was 6 percent 
kohl was only at 8 percent in an earlier poll before his tv ads 
started 
in my 30 years in the senate i have never seen anything like 
it proxmire said of kohls sudden rise money is important of 
course and herb kohls got it to spend 
garvey who has also served as the states deputy attorney 
general said his campaign has raised about 350000 and he has 
spent all but about 80000 
earl who was governor in 198387 recently asked kohl and 
others to agree to a campaign spending limit of about 1 million a 
proposal kohl rejected 
the democratic primary winner will likely square off against 
either state sen susan engeleiter or stephen b king a 
businessman and former chairman of the republican party of 
wisconsin 
engeleiter 36 first elected to the legislature at age 22 in 
1974 has served as senate minority leader since 1985 
king a former fbi agent was hired by the committee to reelect 
president richard nixon in 1972 to handle security he also served 
as a personal bodyguard for former attorney general john mitchell 
and his wife martha 
mrs mitchell wrote a book in which she accused king of tying 
her down and drugging her in order to keep her quiet when the 
watergate scandal surfaced mitchell said in march that king had 
been given a bum rap and said his wife who died in 1976 had a 
severe drinking problem

vice president george bush may have worked for 
the central intelligence agency in 1963 more than a decade before 
becoming its director according to a magazine article that cites a 
recently discovered fbi memorandum 
bush denied the report through a spokesman 
the nation magazine in its current issue quotes a federal 
bureau of investigation memo of november 29 1963 from 
thendirector j edgar hoover to the state department on the 
subject of the assassination of president john f kennedy 
in the memo according to the magazine hoover stated that the 
bureau had briefed mr george bush of the central intelligence 
agency on the reaction of cuban exiles in miami to the 
assassination 
the magazine article written by joseph mcbride also quoted an 
unidentified source with close connections to the intelligence 
community as saying bush started working for the agency in 1960 
or 1961 using his oil business as a cover for clandestine 
activities 
stephen hart a spokesman for the vice president said 
theres nothing to this 
hart said he had talked to bush about the story and that bush 
denied any involvement with the cia prior to being named director 
by president ford in 1975 
he was an oilman in the early 1960s and in 1963 he was running 
for the senate hart said asked if perhaps another george 
bush might have been the one who worked for the cia hart said 
i dont want to speculate but the story is not correct 
bill devine a cia spokesman declined to comment on the 
possibility that bush or someone else with that name worked for 
the agency in the 1960s 
its our standard policy on allegations that people have 
worked for the cia or that sort of thing we neither confirm nor 
deny devine said we certainly confirm that he worked for the 
cia when he was director 
the magazine said hoovers memo was recently discovered among 
98755 pages of fbi documents released in 1977 and 1978 in 
connection with freedom of information act suits 
hoovers memo relays concerns of an fbi informant in miami that 
anticastro groups might capitalize on the confusion following the 
assassination to undertake an unauthorized raid against cuba the 
magazine said 
the substance of the foregoing information was orally 
furnished to mr george bush of the central intelligence agency 
hoover is quoted as saying 
at the time bush was running the houstonbased zapata offshore 
co which the magazine said gave bush an opportunity to do 
extensive overseas travel including trips throughout the 
caribbean in 1964 bush ran unsuccessfully for the senate against 
the democratic incumbent ralph yarborough 
the nation article quotes the unidentified intelligence source 
as saying of the vice president i know he was involved in the 
caribbean i know he was involved in the suppression of things 
after the kennedy assassination 
in his 1987 autobiography looking forward bush calls his 
appointment to head the cia a real shocker in light of his 
background as a nonprofessional outsider and a politician to 
boot 
however bush also notes in his autobiography that id come to 
the cia with some general knowledge of how it operated 
the nation article cites this line from bushs book and another 
one in which bush refers to his many overseas contacts as a 
businessman as possible veiled references to previous cia 
experience

superpower talks on a treaty to cut us and 
soviet longrange nuclear arsenals have come a long way but 
president reagans star wars program is one of two major 
obstacles remaining moscows chief arms negotiator said sunday 
we do not want to lose momentum said envoy alexei obukhov 
who arrived here for the arms talks which are to resume tuesday 
after a fiveweek recess for the moscow summit 
the united states and the soviet union have agreed to work 
toward a treaty that would reduce by 50 percent their combined 
longrange missiles over seven years with each side limited to 
6000 nuclear warheads 
a long way has already been covered toward the treaty on 50 
percent reductions in strategic offensive arms obukhov said 
the outstanding questions can and should be resolved 
the soviet negotiator called for a constructive approach by 
washington 
obukhov said the two major obstacles to the new arms agreement 
are the longstanding disagreement over reagans strategic defense 
initiative known as star wars and the issue of limiting 
sealaunched cruise missiles 
the soviets link a new treaty to curbs on sdi a spacebased 
missile defense system the soviets say reagans program would 
violate the 1972 ussoviet antiballistic missile treaty which 
limits each side to a missile defense at one site 
they want the united states to limit the scope of sdi but 
reagan repeated at the beginning of the moscow summit that his 
program is not on the bargaining table 
obukhov reiterated a call for both sides to strictly observe the 
abm treaty 
obukhov called sealaunched cruise missiles a dangerous type 
of strategic offensive arms and said reliable limits are a 
prerequisite for an effective treaty he urged that anticheating 
measures include inspections aboard warships a proposal the united 
states has rejected 
obukhov said progress at the geneva negotiations now depends 
mainly on resolving these points which reagan and soviet leader 
mikhail gorbachev failed to do at their may 29june 2 meeting 
however the leaders agreed at the summit that both sides should 
consider all existing longrange airlaunched cruise missiles as 
nuclear weapons and distinguish between bombers that carry them and 
those that do not 
the two sides also agreed to restrict mobile missiles to 
designated territories to simplify counting but the size of the 
areas was not set 
both types of weapons are to be included in the new treaty 
noting the agreements at the summit obukhov said the resumed 
geneva talks have a special dimension 
reagan and gorbachev said after the moscow meeting that a treaty 
on reducing longrange nuclear missiles is possible before reagan 
leaves office in january but no breakthrough appears imminent 
obukhov said the length of the new round of talks in geneva 
which began in march 1985 has not been set 
he will meet chief us delegate max kampelman on monday to 
discuss procedural details kampelman arrived here saturday but did 
not speak to reporters 
at a december summit meeting in washington reagan and gorbachev 
signed a treaty eliminating intermediaterange missiles and both 
countries ratified the pact shortly before the moscow summit

million in industrial production 
radio moscow gave no news of the status of a similar strike in 
nagornokarabakh and it was not immediately possible to contact 
the caucasus mountain region by telephone 
the labor daily trud has said that the strike in stepanakert 
nagornokarabakhs capital has already cost 64 million in lost 
industrial production the newspaper said stepanakert enterprises 
failed to deliver 32 million worth of supplies

the crushing of a protest at yerevans zvartnots airport last week

officials said one was killed by a plastic bullet fired by soviet 
troops who were sent to restore order

killed when soldiers fired on the protesters 
soviet officials denied the allegations 
witnesses to the sunday rally which was held outside moscows 
armenian church said armenians circulated photographs they said 
showed the funerals of two of the people who died in the airport 
protest including one who reportedly had a heart attack while 
arguing with soldiers 
in february ethnic violence between armenians and azerbaijanis 
left at least 32 people dead in the city of sumgait in azerbaijan

when he sets off on foot for belgium from 
warsaw on monday a british peace activist and former roman 
catholic priest will wear a sweatshirt with the phrase one 
world written in five languages 
that is the message bruce kent plans to spread to citizens of 
eastern and western europe during a 45day hike through poland 
east germany west germany and belgium 
my main purpose is to get across the message that europe could 
live without the two military blocs and without confrontation 
said kent 59 
but the arrival of soviet leader mikhail gorbachev in warsaw on 
monday has set kent scouting for alternative departure points in 
case police block warsaw roads for security purposes 
the lawyer says he chose to start his march for a conflictfree 
europe in warsaw and end it in the belgian capital of brussels for 
symbolic reasons 
warsaw was the site of the signing of the warsaw pact treaty in 
1955 and brussels is the administrative center for the north 
atlantic treaty organization 
the united nations association the war on want and the british 
campaign for nuclear disarmanent have sponsored the trip kents 
second long trek 
he walked 500 miles from a nuclear submarine base in scotland to 
a nuclear bomb plant in reading england in 1987 
that march raised 255000 for peace causes he has collected 
27200 this time enough to pay for the trip which will cover 
about 1000 miles 
this time two translators and an assistant will accompany kent 
he plans to walk six days a week and attend church services sunday

the worst drought since the dust bowl of the 1930s is drying up 
rivers that normally churn cheap power at hydroelectric dams and 
some higher light bills already are in the mail 
an associated press survey of electric utilities across the 
united states turned up no forecasts of major shortages this 
summer but some western power agencies dependent on winters snow 
to fill their reservoirs are worried about continuing drought 
its over the long term that you start to see impacts this 
fall and next winter said steven schweitzer deputy area manager 
for western power administration at billings mont 
the american public power association reports that only about 
oneeighth of the 24 trillion kilowatt hours of electricity 
consumed annually in the united states is generated by turbines at 
hydroelectric dams most utilities can survive without 
hydroelectric power but may have to pass higher costs of steam 
plant generation to their customers 
the 1 million customers of alabama power co will find an 
increase of 88 cents per 1000 kilowatt hours in their next bills 
this will push the bill for that amount of energy considered the 
monthly residential average to 6811 
alabama power spokesman chris conway said the state based its 
decision to approve the increase to a certain extent on the 
drought which has forced the utility to shut down its 14 
hydroelectric plants 
idaho power co normally produces half its electricity from 
hydro plants on the snake river now severely low when more 
expensive coalfired generators began taking up the slack the 
state utilities commission allowed the company to add a 96 
million annual surcharge to the bills of its 260000 customers 
elsewhere low rivers could threaten some coalfired or even 
nuclear power plants for want of cooling water several utility 
officials said 
and while utilities across the nation promise to meet demand 
many said there would be less surplus power to help other utilities 
meet peak demands 
the nations largest hydroelectric system bonneville power 
administration in the pacific northwest has no immediate problems 
officials said streams that feed its 30 federally built reservoirs 
depend on runoff from winter snow and are flowing at 70 percent 
their normal rate 
this is far from the driest on record but bob reed a spokesman 
for the agency that serves parts of eight western states said 
officials are looking at the fall and winter 
not all the reservoirs will refill this summer and that will 
mean next year we will have to operate under more constrained 
mode he said 
the tennessee valley authority the nations largest supplier of 
electricity began as a hydroelectric agency but now counts on its 
dams for only about 10 percent of the power it furnishes to seven 
southeastern states 
stream flow in the tennessee river and its tributaries is only 
20 percent of normal cutting hydroelectric generation in half and 
forcing tva to spend 117 million extra to produce power 
this additional cost results from replacing lowcost hydro 
power with higher cost coalfired generation and power purchases 
said jimmy l cross tvas vice president for business operations 
in any case tva has pledged not to increase rates for the next 
three years 
tvas hookup with 15 other utilities through 40 tie lines should 
make summer shortages the exception rather than the rule said hugh 
gardner manager of tvas power branch 
hayden timmons public relations director for big rivers 
electric corp in western kentucky was among those who worried 
about a shortage of water and a possible shortage of surplus power 
big rivers does not generate hydroelectric power but needs 
river water for its coalfired steam plants at three plants 
timmons said the green and ohio rivers are so low that they are 
within one to two feet of the water intakes if the water drops 
below the intake lines the plants would have to close 
tal wright spokesman for georgia power co in atlanta said the 
drought has cut hydroelectric production in half but nuclear power 
plants are producing about half the states needs with coalfired 
plants making up the rest 
beth bosch spokeswoman for the illinois commerce commission 
said that if the drought continues drying of cooling ponds at the 
states 13 nuclear power plants could be damaging commonwealth 
edison operates 12 plants and illinois power co has one

farm bloc strategists are pinning their hopes 
for passage of a drought relief bill this summer on rapid action 
combined with americas renowned soft spot for the family farmer 
we are going to try desperately to get a consensus and avoid a 
lot of bickering within the halls of congress north dakota gov 
george sinner said as farm bloc leaders huddled last thursday to 
map strategy 
within a day chairmen of both house and senate agriculture 
committees declared that they would fashion a bill this week to 
furnish relief for farmers whose crops have been scorched by 
withering heat and lack of rainfall 
aides to senate agriculture committee chairman patrick j leahy 
dvt even refused to rule out the possibility that the bill might 
be whisked through committee and onto the floor for final action 
all in one week 
gone is the waitandsee course adoped by leahy and house 
agriculture chairman e kika de la garza dtexas in recent 
weeks 
instead lawmakers are clearing the decks for an electionyear 
disaster bill that could run into billions of dollars no reliable 
estimate of just how much it might cost has been made public 
as things stand the drought will reduce farm subsidy spending 
by the governments commodity credit corp well below its budgeted 
level of 17 billion how much is unclear but lawmakers are 
talking about recycling the savings and distributing the money 
to farmers as drought relief 
the legislation could wind up with an array of additional costs 
however for example lawmakers are talking about dropping a 
planned 50cent cut in dairy price supports set for jan 1 an idea 
favored by leahys home state dairymen well before drought set in 
the proposal went nowhere in the past but now dairy forces say 
that rising feed costs demand a higher support level 
agriculture secretary richard e lyng chief advocate of the 
waitandsee approach has reversed course and given lawmakers the 
green light to start drafting legislation 
lawmakers give varying reasons for speeding up action for one 
thing the drought has been getting worse rain has not come in 
sufficient quantities to boost hopes in the corn belt which has 
about one week left before much of the alreadyparched crop passes 
the point of no return 
leahy said farmers were worried and therefore we need to 
send them hope de la garza noted the limited amount of time 
remaining in this congressional session 
but de la garza also acknowledged that the bill could actually 
put cash in the hands of farmers before they would get it without 
the drought and that some growers are currently marketing 1987 
crops 
strategists said that thus far talk of a big farm bill has not 
galvanized urban complaints about big government payments such 
criticism did materialize following approval of the subsidyladen 
1985 farm bill and farm lawmakers have been gun shy about it ever 
since 
no one is even talking about general opposition developing on 
the floor rep byron dorgan dnd said he expressed 
confidence that there still is a great reservoir of support among 
urban voters for farmers 
a number of polls taken in the wake of the 1985 farm legislation 
showed that urban voters were deeply sympathetic to the plight of 
family farmers and not for the most part resentful about 
agricultural subsidies that reached a peak of 26 billion in 1986 
lawmakers made clear that they will attempt to tap into that 
reservoir of good will in pushing ahead with their drought bill 
but urban congressmen are not unanimous in their willingness to 
go along with hefty farm spending strategists who asked not to be 
quoted by name indicated at weeks end that there has been talk of 
moving swiftly before such persistent critics as reps charles 
schumer dny and joseph j dioguardi rny become overly 
aroused 
even if it proves impossible to get the bill through both houses 
this week farm lawmakers are shooting for having the measure on 
the presidents desk before they flee washingtons august heat 
were going to get it done this summer leahy said august is 
summer september isnt 
such rapid action also could give the farm bloc a better chance 
of outrunning any colleagues who might want to harness nonfarm 
drought plans to a bill providing benefits to farmers 
any amendment for example designed to force diversion of great 
lakes water to the mississippi a plan under consideration for 
years could easily send drought relief legislation to drydock for 
the rest of the year 
farm lawmakers also are plainly concerned that their coalition 
has been cracking under the twin pressures of drought and 
electionyear politics following lyngs now abandoned waitandsee 
approach the two committee chairmen convened a task force to 
monitor the drought and cautioned their followers not to jump the 
gun by introducing bills 
almost immediately sen donald w riegle jr dmich and rep 
bob traxler dmich proposed a plan to furnish aid to michigan 
apple growers and a wide array of other farmers the two lawmakers 
neither an agriculture committee member scoffed at any notion that 
they might be jeopardizing drought relief by moving too quickly 
ten days ago a senior senate agriculture committee member sen 
john melcher dmont introduced a sweeping drought bill and also 
scoffed at the waitandsee approach relief delayed is relief 
minimized melcher said

sanctuary supporters say the trial of a 
lutheran minister and a freelance journalist could focus attention 
on the issues surrounding people who flee to the united states from 
wartorn central america 
but prosecutors contend the case isnt about sanctuary they say 
its a case of selling babies in an adoptionforprofit scheme 
the rev glen remerthamert 44 and demetria martinez 27 were 
indicted last dec 10 accused of helping two pregnant salvadoran 
women enter the united states illegally in august 1986 both women 
gave birth in the united states and one of the babies was put up 
for adoption 
the trial begins wednesday before us district judge john 
conway 
remerthamert was indicted on nine counts of conspiracy 
transporting and harboring illegal aliens and mail fraud ms 
martinez was charged with four counts of transporting and inducing 
illegal aliens 
remerthamerts case has been embraced by the sanctuary movement 
of clergy and lay people who have been aiding refugees from central 
america since the early 1980s 
for us it is not something that is against the law to give 
sanctuary to someone fleeing for his or her life said patricio 
guerrerortiz a member of the new mexico sanctuary defense 
committee which was set up to help pay legal expenses 
remerthamert has said he is being prosecuted because of his 
outspoken criticism of the reagan administrations policies in 
central america 
ms martinez a freelance writer who covers religion for the 
albuquerque journal and the national catholic reporter has said 
she acted solely as a journalist when she accompanied remerthamert 
and tried to take steps to ensure she would not even travel with 
the women to albuquerque 
she also has said she never wrote a story about the women 
partly out of fear for their safety 
i have researched a number of topics that pertain to religion 
including the sanctuary movement and the role of mainline 
denominations relative to that movement she said at the time of 
her indictment 
a federal court rule prevents attorneys from discussing the 
merits of a case but legal maneuvering over the past few months 
gives some indication of the direction the trial will take 
us attorney william lutz who will prosecute the case said in 
a court document filed in february that remerthamert was selling 
salvadoran babies for adoption not helping political refugees 
as soon as the defendant got his hands on the babies he meant 
to transport the women back to el salvador the document said 
the indictment accused remerthamert of submitting false expense 
documents to rainbow house international an adoption agency and 
of receiving 2900 
remerthamert said after his indictment that he was reimbursed 
for some costs of helping the women but received no fees 
the women cecelia eliasalegria and inez camposanzora remain 
in the united states and are expected to be called as prosecution 
witnesses 
sanctuary supporters were elated last month when conway ruled 
that a march 28 1986 proclamation by former gov toney anaya 
declaring new mexico a sanctuary state could be used by 
remerthamert and ms martinez in their defense 
the proclamation was rescinded by gov garrey carruthers when he 
took office in january 1987 
remerthamert said last week he was dismissed from his social 
services job with the state after the indictment since then he 
said he has been taking care of his two children writing a book 
and raising a garden 
having been indicted for the first time i clearly understand 
how vulnerable a situation it is to be indicted and how necessary 
it is to have supportive friends and family he said 
a salvadoran attorney luis arturo venturarivas was also named 
in the indictment but he will not be on trial because he remains in 
el salvador

the association between drug use and crime 
rose sharply over a 12year span ending in 1986 the government 
reported sunday 
about 35 percent of the nations state prison inmates in 1986 
were under the influence of an illegal drug at the time they 
committed the crime for which they were then incarcerated the 
justice departments bureau of justice statistics said twelve 
years earlier the proportion was about 25 percent while in 1979 
it was 32 percent 
the survey also found that many inmates began to use drugs only 
after their criminal careers had already started 
in the 1986 survey half of the inmates who had ever used a 
major drug such as heroin cocaine methadone pcp or lsd did not 
do so until after their first arrest about 60 percent of those who 
had ever used a major drug regularly did not do so until after 
their first arrest 
in addition about oneseventh of the inmates 13 percent seem 
to fit the pattern of drug addicts who committed crimes to support 
their habits said the bureaus director steven schlesinger 
this group was in prison for such crimes as robbery burglary or 
theft and they were among the 19 percent of the inmates who said 
they were daily users of heroin cocaine methadone pcp or lsd in 
the month before they committed a crime 
about 50 percent of those serving sentences for robbery 
burglary theft or a drug offense were daily users of some illegal 
drug 
in addition the 1986 survey of 13700 inmates reported that 
about 43 percent of them said they were daily users of some illegal 
drug in the month before they committed the crime for which they 
were imprisoned 
other findings 
the greater the use of major drugs by an offender the more 
prior convictions of all types the inmate reported less than 13 
percent of those who had never used a major drug had half a dozen 
or more earlier convictions compared with nearly 30 percent of 
daily users of major drugs 
white inmates and female inmates were somewhat more likely to 
have been regular users of major drugs at some point in their lives 
about onehalf of state inmates who had ever used drugs began 
by the time they were 15 years old

an astrologer has been named to advise one 
of oregons county commissions but she says the controversy 
surrounding her appointment may prevent her from studying the stars 
for union county 
jenny nicholson was named to the newly created post during the 
county commissions regular meeting last week in la grande a 
farming and timber community of about 12000 in northeastern oregon 
what the heck if the reagan administration is rumored as 
using astrology i guess we can try it on the local level as 
well said county judge john howard a member of the commission 
who voted in favor of the appointment 
former white house chief of staff donald regan disclosed last 
month in his book for the record that nancy reagan consulted 
an astrologer for aid in helping to prepare president reagans 
schedule mrs reagan refused to comment on regans assertions 
in a telephone interview over the weekend from her home in la 
grande nicholson said she intended to offer the commissioners 
advice on such things as when to apply for government grants and 
when best to make presentations 
it was just going to be my community service she said of 
the nonpaying position 
but she said the whole idea might be dropped because of 
criticism directed by the local newspaper and others at the two 
commissioners who voted for her 
nicholson 38 said she moved to la grande in 1980 from salem 
where she was a social service worker the single mother of two 
girls aged 11 and 16 said she supports her family with her 
astrology business otter space 
nicholson said she had been practicing astrology for 20 years 
and that her list of clients from around oregon and throughout the 
west coast might surprise some people 
nicholson said she wanted to do her part to help the county pull 
itself out of recent economic doldrums 
no major governmental decision should be made based on an 
astrologers recommendations but there is a place for astrology in 
government she said 
there are cycles she said there are heavenly rhythms 
in la grandes case she said the time is right to build 
bridges with officials in salem the state capital 
la grande is in an extremely high profile to get some help 
from salem she said 
commissioner bill deering who nominated nicholson for the job 
said he didnt think it would do any harm to get some astrological 
advice especially since nicholson is a volunteer 
we need all the help we can with our grants deering said 
i respect jenny greatly and i think her abilities may indeed help 
us 
commissioner marie lester however who abstained from the vote 
said she thought deerings motion was a joke adding that she would 
have voted against it if shed known he was serious 
i will not make a decision based on astrology nor will i 
support the county court making decisions based on that she said 
in union county the county commission is officially known as 
the court the head of the commission is called a judge 
lester said she planned a motion at the commissions next 
meeting on july 20 to rescind the decision 
howard the judge said he doesnt take the whole thing 
seriously but thinks nicholsons abilities could be applied to 
grant applications 
we may want to talk to her about what day to apply for grants 
just for trial and error to see what happens he said

the national transportation safety board convenes 
a fourday hearing this week to try to find out why an 18foot 
chunk ripped away from a boeing 737 jetliner over hawaii and what 
lessons that accident can teach about the airworthiness of older 
aircraft 
the hearings main purpose is to help determine the cause of the 
april 28 accident but ntsb officials say the board also wants to 
look at how well aging planes are maintained and how corrosion and 
fatigue affect their safety 
the fourday public hearing will open tuesday 
a flight attendant was swept to her death and 61 of the 94 other 
people aboard aloha airlines flight 243 were injured when a top 
portion of the cabin peeled away as the plane was at 24000 feet 
on a flight from hilo to honolulu 
although one of the two engines quit the pilot and copilot 
managed to control the crippled jet and land it safely on the 
island of maui 13 minutes later aviation experts marveled a plane 
that badly damaged could land at all 
the accident spurred a debate within the aircraft industry and 
its regulators on the safety of older heavily used passenger jets 
the damaged plane n73711 was built in 1969 and had 89680 
landings it and two other aloha 737200s both later grounded had 
the highest number of landings or cycles of any boeing co 
commercial jets the seattlebased aircraft manufacturer said 
since the acccident the federal aviation administration has 
ordered inspections and repairs of older highcycle 737s and in 
early june held a threeday conference on aging aircraft 
boeing officials have repeatedly said their jets can be flown 
almost indefinitely if properly maintained and aloha officials 
have said they performed all necessary maintenance on their 
aircraft 
but in documents released by the ntsb boeing said that seven 
months before the accident it had urged aloha to make a thorough 
structural inspection of n73711 and three other aging 737s 
boeing said aloha after first agreeing to the inspections in 
early 1988 postponed them until the end of this year only after a 
midapril meeting with boeing did the airline agree to reinstate 
the inspection program for the four planes boeing said 
in separate documents aloha denied it had delayed the 
steppedup inspection and maintenance program 
although the inquiry board will examine discrepancies between 
the two companies accounts the hearing is investigative in nature 
and not adversarial said boeing spokesman jack gamble 
my understanding is that it will be very technical said 
aloha spokesman milton goto adding that the airline will have its 
top maintenance and engineering people on hand to testify 
ntsb spokesman mike benson said witnesses from the faa boeing 
aloha the air transport association and britains civil aviation 
authority are expected to testify along with aerospace experts 
from massachusetts institute of technology and the state university 
of new york 
the fourmember inquiry board is made up of senior safety board 
officials and chaired by ntsb member john k lauber benson said 
the ntsb chose seattle for the hearing because boeing is based 
here and its roughly equidistant from hawaii and ntsb headquarters 
in washington benson said

roger rabbit may live in toon town but 
his creator gary wolf remains attached to his hometown and often 
wears his future farmers of america earlville jacket on 
hollywood movie sets 
wolf says there is no direct link between the lasalle county 
town of 1400 residents and the hit movie who framed roger 
rabbit except perhaps in the optimism he felt throughout his 
youth the movie is based on his 1981 novel who censored roger 
rabbit 
growing up in the midwest in the 1950s was a very optimistic 
happy time recalled wolf 47 who now lives outside boston 
the movie and my book are similarly funloving

a huge tropical air current is 
dominating the central atlantic and could grow into the seasons 
first hurricane if it develops thunderstorms the national 
hurricane center said sunday 
the weather pattern developed off the african coast several days 
ago and is nearly 1000 miles wide hurricane specialist bob case 
said 
at noon sunday it was about midway between africa and the lesser 
antilles the easternmost islands of the caribbean moving west at 
20 to 25 mph 
its a very large and domineering wave and its about a month 
ahead of its time case said it bears watching 
case said the hurricane center arranged for a reconnaissance 
plane to study the pattern tuesday if the air current continues 
to be as impressive as it is now 
but unless it develops large thunderstorms the weather pattern 
has no chance of becoming a hurricane case said its like an 
engine without fuel 
nonetheless he said it bears close watching because of its 
timing 
its a very very welldefined system considering how early it 
is in the season six weeks from now it would be hohum he said

when vermont lawmakers finish their 
business late each spring most members of the parttime citizen 
legislature have to go back to work as teachers lawyers and real 
estate brokers 
but not state sen david deen hes gone fishing 
from the bustling halls of the statehouse in montpelier deen 
heads for a shindeep spot along the big bend of the mettawee 
river changing from the tweed jacket of a lawmaker to the vest and 
rubber boots of a flyfishing guide 
ive been busy since the session ended he said on a recent 
morning as he watched the cast of jose quinones an 
obstetriciangynecologist from queens ny and deens student for 
the day 
the windham county democrat paused for a moment to reflect on 
how he gets to make a living flyfishing while others toil in 
offices and shops or on farms 
i used to chuckle about it he said but hey this is 
work 
deen recently had his first three days off since the legislative 
session ended i went fishing all three days he said i have 
not tired of the sport just because i do it a lot 
originally from pennsylvania deen came to westminster in 1971 
to help his brother build a house 
we camped out for the entire summer it rained from june 7th 
to july 4th 
he landed a job with southeastern vermont community action an 
antipoverty agency in brattleboro and stayed there 10 years 
moving up to executive director 
ronald reagan was elected president in 1980 it was not a good 
year for directors of governmentfunded community action agencies 
i started looking around for something to save my sanity deen 
said 
his brother had given him a flyfishing rod in 1979 and it 
hadnt gotten much use at first eventually though deen gave the 
sport a try and soon was hooked 
by 1983 deen remained at community action but was still 
casting about for something else i kept making lists of what i 
liked to do and fishing kept coming up so i decided to try 
this 
now deen advertises his service which he calls strictly 
trout in the orvis flyfishing catalogues and other publications 
read by enthusiasts in the sport he gets much of his business 
through referrals 
his day rate is 130 for the first person and 30 for each 
additional person 
it wasnt always so easy for the first three years i was 
hungry i was lucky in that my wife has a good job with the state 
health department if either of his two children had decided to 
go to college i would have had to get a straight job somewhere 
despite less than perfect conditions quinones caught his first 
trout early in the day 
deen told him a pointer he shares with his students i throw 
the fish back i had a 16inch rainbow in my hand two nights ago 
it went right back into the connecticut river i want the fish 
to be here

iranian leaders expressed pessimism sunday 
that the un security council will condemn the united states for 
its destruction of an iranian jetliner but they said diplomatic 
channels were still the best way to handle the issue 
the security council faces one of the major tests of its 
political history the outcome of the debate will show how firmly 
it holds to the united nations charter said foreign minister ali 
akbar velayati 
velayati spoke to foreign reporters before traveling to new york 
to attend tuesdays emergency meeting of the council 
iran requested the debate on the july 3 downing of the iranian 
airbus over the persian gulf iran said all 290 people on board 
died in the incident velayati called it the most obvious case of 
violation of basic rights of human beings and countries 
in view of the councils past performance and also due to its 
peculiar composition iran is not too optimistic on the outcome of 
the session velayati said 
the us ambassador to the united nations vernon walters said 
he was going to defend the circumstances under which this 
occurred when the security council meets 
he told abctvs this week with david brinkley that above 
all he would urge that the way to prevent further such incidents 
was to end the iraniraq war 
the sunday times of london reported that a british intelligence 
report based on radio communications monitored in the persian gulf 
is severely critical of the us navy for shooting down the 
airliner 
the report concludes that the iran air flight left bandar abbas 
iran for dubai only three minutes late was on the correct flight 
path and was climbing when it was shot down the newspaper said 
the navy has said the jet was descending and took off an hour 
late it said navy forces mistook it for an iranian f14 jet 
fighter 
deputy foreign minister mohammad jawad larijani said iran 
prefers to settle the issue of the jetliner through diplomatic 
channels 
the minister speaking at a news conference implied that a us 
veto of a possible security council resolution regarding the 
disaster would not necessarily spark off a violent iranian reaction 
the united states as one of the five permanent members of the 
security council has veto power 
asked what irans reaction would be if the united states vetoed 
a resolution he replied then we will pursue all the other 
possibilities and channels we prefer not to be hostile we prefer 
that this case should be settled diplomatically but we are not 
naive not to see the difficulties 
larijani said any direct or indirect contacts with the united 
states would serve no purpose as long as washington was 
consistently pursuing its policy of hostility toward iran 
he said american policy was guided by a genghis khan view of 
iran there is no hope for relations it is absurd even to 
talk 
we are trying to contain the situation in iran larijani 
added i think to advocate a hostile line is not very reasonable 
i hope the situation will not be of such a case that no other way 
will be possible 
larijanis position reflected the policy advocated friday by 
hashemi rafsanjani the speaker of irans parliament and acting 
commande in chief of the armed forces 
rafsanjani one of the most powerful figures in iran declared 
that iran should not seek revenge for the downing of the plane 
contradicting earlier statements by other iranian leaders 
the united states is trying to push us to commit the same 
crime but if we did that the world would turn against us that 
is why we do not push for revenge wise people understand why 
rafsanjani said 
larijani referred repeatedly to the shooting down of the airbus 
as an incident speaking only once of a barbaric act 
he also reiterated earlier statements that settling the incident 
would require the united states to recognize its own responsibility 
and to pay compensation to the families of the victims 
the reagan administration is likely to announce this week that 
it will compensate the families of those who died senior officials 
said sunday we want to do the right thing said michael 
armacost the undersecretary of state 
larijani did not repeat earlier iranian demands that the us 
commanders involved in the incident be courtmartialed

secret intelligencegathering agency which has listening posts in

civic leaders in this financially 
depressed town of 850 want to keep their farming community alive 
even if it means legalizing the consumption of liquor 55 years 
after the end of prohibition 
village officials want to put the idea to a vote in november 
they call it an economic development issue and a way to keep people 
from moving out of town 
economic conditions are getting worse and worse said dwayne 
willems mayor of the town about 60 miles northwest of peoria 
were getting more and more empty buildings on main street we 
want to promote new business and increase traffic into town 
somehow he said 
right now theres nothing to come here for said michael 
mccready owner of credos cafe and a new windsor village 
trusteewe want somebody who will run a nice tavern where couples 
can go maybe get a sandwich and keep the rowdy types out 
new windsor isnt much different from a lot of little farming 
communities which have gone through hard times in the past decade 
many small family farms have disappeared along with factory 
jobs at john deere caterpillar farmall case and international 
harvester in nearby cities the jobs often supplemented farmers 
income 
with its flaglined main street welcome signs and colorful 
flower beds in its city park new windsor looks in many ways like a 
thriving allamerican town 
but there are some alltooobvious signs of decline two banks 
a restaurant gas station a coinoperated laundry and grocery 
store have all closed their doors 
salt and pepper shakers still stand next to napkin holders on 
tables in thurmans ice cream shop which closed about six weeks 
ago 
the biggest loss was the closing of the school district which 
includes nearby viola and was annexed by a neighboring district 
after running into financial trouble 
local leaders are on the verge of launching a petition drive to 
get the referendum on the november ballot they dont expect to 
have any trouble rounding up signatures of 25 percent of registered 
voters willems said sunday 
although residents narrowly rejected a referendum to legalize 
liquor consumption in 1974 willems said that was during good 
times when people just didnt think they needed access to taverns 
at the grain elevator the farmers joke that towns like new 
windsor alpha and viola are dry but the people who live there 
arent they say many people drive the seven miles to woodhull or 
other towns where beer and liquor flow 
not everyone in new windsor agrees that a tavern in town is a 
good idea 
bob sherrard a longtime insurance agent said he believes 
taverns only bring trouble to small towns 
let woodhull keep the trouble he said

president lee tenghui proposed sunday 
that half the central committee of the governing nationalist party 
resign to make room for younger members and more native taiwanese 
on the fourth day of the 13th party congress lee submitted the 
names of 180 candidates for the committee but they did not include 
chiang wego the powerful head of the national security council and 
son of the late chiang kaishek 
the presidents refusal to nominate chiang wego seemed designed 
to end the rule of the family that for six decades led the 
nationalists and whose most politically influential figure 
president chiang chingkuo the eldest son of chiang kaishek 
died in january 
most of lees nominees are expected to be elected tuesday to the 
180member central committee which makes policy proposals and 
assesses party performance lee did not nominate at least 10 older 
nationalists from the current 31member central standing committee 
the exclusion of the 10 older leaders indicated that lee who 
was elected party chairman friday was seeking to reduce the 
influence of conservatives loyal to the chiang family 
the leadership of the nationalist party also known as the 
kuomintang has long been dominated by old guard members who fled 
to taiwan with chiang kaishek in 1949 when they lost a civil war 
to the communists on the chinese mainland 
the new central committee proposed by lee would have an average 
age of 60 a drop from the current average of 70 lee proposed 
that only 74 of 150 incumbents remain 
nationalist party spokesman raymong tai said the president wants 
to combine new blood with half the old panel so the new committee 
can be forwardlooking and can function well 
lee is the first native taiwanese to lead the nationalists 
fortyone percent of his slate is also native taiwanese who 
comprise 85 percent of the islands nearly 20 million people 
however chineseborn nationalists hold a majority of seats in 
taiwans parliament

celebrating 1000 years of christianity in 
what is now the soviet union pope john paul ii on sunday embraced 
the leader of ukrainian catholics and urged freedom of worship for 
that underground church 
thousands of ukrainian catholics from the united states canada 
europe australia and south america joined the pope in st peters 
basilica for a nearly threehour mass said in the elaborate 
byzantineukrainian rite 
the mass was the centerpiece of six days of celebrations in rome 
to mark the advent of christianity a millennium ago in kievan rus 
the ancient name of what is now the ukraine in the western soviet 
union 
john paul recalled how prince vladimir converted to 
christianity leading his people in a mass baptism on the banks of 
the dnieper river in 988 
with all my heart i embrace you as your brother and the first 
pope of slavic origin in the history of the church the 
polishborn pontiff said in italian in his sermon 
but he noted the roman catholic churchs joy at the 
celebration is tinged with sadness in seeing that so many of your 
brothers and sisters do not enjoy religious liberty despite the 
fact that this right has been reaffirmed many times in the 
constitutions of the states and in solemn international documents 
the pope celebrated mass with cardinal myroslav ivan 
lubachivsky who leads the ukrainian catholic community worldwide 
including an estimated 4 million followers in the soviet union and 
about 2 million elsewhere 
the late soviet dictator josef v stalin forced the ukrainian 
church in 1946 to officially join the statesanctioned russian 
orthodox church priests and the unwilling were jailed deported 
or in some cases shot 
lubachivsky a ukrainianborn american citizen addressed the 
pope just before the sermon speaking in ukrainian and then in 
italian 
his voice cracked when he spoke of joy clouded over by the 
fact that our brothers in the country can not freely profess our 
faith and greet the successor of peter referring to the pope 
the cardinal wearing a gold hat studded with precious stones 
then stepped up to the pope who kissed lubachivsky on each cheek 
and then kissed his hand to the applause of the audience which 
included goldrobed bishops of the ukrainian church 
both the pope and the ukrainian cardinal expressed hope for 
unity with the russian orthodox church 
the pope recalled that last month he sent a vatican delegation 
led by the holy sees no 2 official cardinal agostino casaroli 
to moscow to attend millennium ceremonies of the russian orthodox 
church 
the ukrainian church broke with the russian orthodox in the 16th 
century 
ukrainians make up about threefourths of the republics 
population while russians constitute about 17 percent 
the pope has expressed his desire to visit the soviet union but 
vatican officials have said such a pilgrimage could only occur if 
the pontiff can travel freely to meet with his flock including the 
ukrainians

during the past two years the average depth of the lake between 
lakes huron and erie has dropped by 2 feet and this summers 
drought is dropping it even more 
people just got used to the water levels being high said

democrat michael dukakis toured scenic 
rocky mountain parkland sunday to highlight his support for 
environmental issues and said people should pay higher electric 
bills to finance the cleanup of pollution that causes acid rain 
dukakis concluding a hurried western campaign swing turned up 
the pressure on republican george bush over the vice presidents 
notax pledge and brushed aside prospects of potentially 
contentious differences with jesse jackson going into the 
democratic national convention next week 
i think jesse jackson can do anything he wants to do im 
going to the convention and im going to win it said dukakis 
who has enough delegates to assure him the partys presidential 
nomination at the convention in atlanta 
the massachusetts governor traveled to rocky mountain national 
park northwest of denver where he walked around a 9745foot 
elevation alpine lake held a news conference and spoke to a small 
group of supporters 
he called for federal action to stop acid rain a pollution 
problem that has damaged lakes and forests of the northeast and is 
increasingly becoming an environmental concern in the west 
he pointed to a proposal by northeastern governors to collect 
money for cleaning up emissions from electric generating plants 
blamed in part for the problem by assessing a onehalf cent per 
kilowatt charge on electric bills 
he said that amounts to 50cents a month for the average family 
and would not be too much to pay for cleaning up this serious 
problem 
the fact of the matter is if were going to clean up acid rain 
in this country theres going to be a cost he said 
so thats the way were going to solve the acid rain problem 
and if mr bush doesnt understand that he shouldnt be running for 
president of the united states dukakis said 
dukakis hammered anew at bushs promise not to raise taxes 
repeating his contention that the vice president is supporting what 
amounts to higher taxes in the new trade bill and in legislation 
extending catastrophic health coverage for the elderly the health 
bill would increase medicare premiums and add an income tax 
surcharge for covered americans and the trade bill would assess 
certain excise taxes he said 
im for the bill dukakis said but i want the vice 
president to stand up and tell the truth which is that he and the 
president supported a 6 billion tax increase to pay for needed 
health insurance for the elderly in this country 
and when the congress gives him that new trade bill theyre 
going to support another tax increase this time an excise on 
imported goods to pay for a billion dollars worth of training and 
retraining of american workers i happen to be for that too and 
so are they so much for notax pledges 
he assailed the reagan administration for failing to spend what 
he said was 6 billion that has accumulated in a federal 
conservation fund to protect and maintain federal parklands and 
valuable wilderness areas 
dukakis stood in shirtsleeves and an open collar in an 
amphitheater overlooking a valley within the park that has been 
reclaimed from development and returned to its natural state with 
him were gov roy romer and sen timothy wirth dcolo 
i am an ardent conservationist preserving our environment 
is a very conservative policy and im for it dukakis said 
the appearance was his last stop on a fourday tour through 
southwest west coast and rocky mountain regions his last 
scheduled campaign swing before the convention he stopped in 
states that have gone republican in recent presidential elections 
including giants california and texas 
weve made it clear were not only not going to concede one 
single state to the republicans were going to win in the west 
he said 
dukakis was returning to boston for final deliberations on 
selecting a vice presidential candidate and planned a trip to 
washington tuesday night before meetings the next day with house 
democrats the congressional black caucus and the national 
convention of the naacp 
dukakis said he is not frustrated at all by jacksons 
refusal to concede him the nomination or posturing on the vice 
presidency and convention issues

a canadian man who set up a fund in washington 
to aid americans held hostage in lebanon said sunday he is about 
ready to give up after collecting only 20 in six months 
gary selby said he has spent more than 1200 on telephone calls 
communicating with hostages families and trying to drum up 
publicity for the freedom trust at riggs national bank in 
washington selby said he will likely dissolve the fund before the 
end of the month 
money in the fund was to be distributed in equal shares to the 
hostages when they were released selby said 
bank officials confirmed that the trust was formally established 
in january but could not be contacted during the weekend to say how 
much money was in the account 
selby of shawbridge quebec said documents he receives as 
trustee show the account currently holds 20 mostly in 1 checks 
mailed from pennsylvania after a radio station interviewed him no 
money has been withdrawn since the account was opened he said 
selby said he has called scores of radio and television stations 
and has been interviewed by several reporters but contributions 
barely trickled in 
the bank he said apparently has been absorbing the cost of 
keeping the trust a washington lawyer christopher imlay said he 
drew up the trust agreement at selbys request so that money could 
be sent directly to the riggs bank in washington 
imlay said in january that the trust does not allow selby to be 
paid anything not even expenses 
selby 32 said he earns about 160 a week in us dollars 
working on the night cleanup crew at a montreal area mcdonalds 
hamburger restaurant 
he said helping the american hostages has become an obsession 
with him 
i feel like i have to apologize to the families because i got 
their hopes up selby said in a telephone interview 
i have to give it up or ill go bankrupt he said its 
like a drug its like a part of me i used to have terrible dreams 
that i was being held hostage 
selby said he had hoped to collect enough so the freed hostages 
could spend a month in hawaii or visit disney world with their 
families 
selby said he has always loved america and in 1984 gained some 
notoriety with the ballad of america a monologue he wrote that 
was recorded with music by montreal disc jockey ted tevan and 
played at a us governors conference 
among selbys prized possessions is a letter from president 
reagan praising him for writing the piece 
nine americans are among 18 foreign hostages held by groups in 
lebanon the longestheld hostage is terry anderson 40 who was 
chief middle east correspondent for the associated press when he

william crowe jr chairman of the joint chiefs of staff 
demonstrated that american military personnel are competent and 
want peace 
of course the military might of the united states armed 
services and of the us air force in particular is high but i 
knew that before i arrived in the united states akhromeyev said 
but akhromeyev second only to the defense minister in the 
soviet military command said he knew very little about american 
military personnel before his visit 
the impressions im taking home of the armed services 
personnel are most favorable akhromeyev said i also got from 
the interviews i received from your military people you are 
peaceloving people

the recipes

buddhist leaders have overcome 
neighborhood resistance toward building the largest buddhist temple 
in north america and are racing to finish the 15acre complex in 
time for the religions international conference this november 
the complex will be known as the hsi lai buddhist temple the 
temple that came to the west from the east said rev shih yung 
kai abbess of the temple 
it sits on a hill 20 miles east of los angeles in this 
uppermiddleclass neighborhood one of many suburbs swollen by a 
huge influx of asians in recent years 
the taiwanbased fo kuang shan buddhist society is building the 
temple and will be host of the 16th international buddhist general 
conference there in november the first time this gathering will be 
held in the west the conference entitled unity for world 
peace is expected to attract 300 participants from 40 countries 
ms yung kai said 
when plans for the 14 million temple and monastery were 
announced six years ago some neighbors feared it would disrupt 
this quiet residential area 
many people in the community dont know much about buddhism 
and that can bring suspicion she said above all we want 
people to know were not a cult something strange i think people 
here now understand that 
buddhism was founded in india about 500 bc by buddha the 
religions roughly 250 million followers mainly in asia believe 
that correct thinking and selfdenial will enable their souls to 
reach nirvana a state of ultimate enlightenment there are fewer 
than a million buddhists in north america 
the rev paul louie a nowretired presbyterian minister 
organized several public meetings between local residents and 
temple representatives 
there was suspicion about the temple but also resistance due 
to the fact that lots of asians were moving into that 
neighborhood he said 
some residents thought it would be some kind of religious 
cult some kind of hare krishna thing with people chanting and 
parading through the streets with tambourines of course its 
nothing like that 
barbara lee fish of the hacienda heights improvement association 
said those fears are a thing of the past 
were a community thats pulling together she said i 
think the great majority of residents here will welcome the temple 
when they open their doors 
fears that home prices would plunge also have abated according 
to real estate agent wayne grey property values have actually 
skyrocketed in the area he said 
construction and legal problems arose in trying to build a 
chinesestyle complex while accommodating los angeles county 
building codes western construction methods and american ways of 
doing things according to architect anthony yang 
still theres no doubt in my mind that well finish the work 
by the nov 1 deadline said steve frank spokesman for 
technical management services the building contractor 
the 10building complex is a scaleddown replica of the mammoth 
ornate fo kuang shan temple in taipei and will include a main 
shrine a monastery for 50 monks and nuns a library and meeting 
rooms 
at the site last week workers were installing more than 1000 
buddha statues each about a foot tall on the walls of the main 
shrine a cavernous hall that will hold 800 worshipers the 
shrines centerpiece a twoton golden chandelier made of dangling 
goldplated bells will hang 50 feet above the marble floor ms 
yung kai said 
presbyterian minister larry boles whose church is in the long 
shadow cast by the hillside temple said residents have been 
awestruck by the construction over the last three years 
in the beginning it was just a bit of activity on the hill 
he said it went from a few little wooden structures to what it 
is now something that looks like a giant glittering palace

the communist party daily in an 
unprecedented report has detailed two variations for longterm 
economic development and reform to be discussed by the party 
leadership at a meeting this week 
hungarys premier and party leader karoly grosz has been 
quoted as saying the central committee meeting which begins 
wednesday is to be broadcast live on television and radio also an 
firsttime event 
the report saturday in the party daily nepszabadsag marked the 
first time a detailed agenda for a central committee meeting was 
published in advance it outlined a what it called a radical 
marketoriented reform proposal and a more moderate path that would 
introduce reform gradually 
in a separate article in nepszabadsag rezso nyers considered 
the father of hungarys 1968 economic reforms warned the 
disorder which accompanies reform should not lead to a 
rejection of change 
crisis is social acknowledgement that things have to be 
done in a different way said nyers recently reappointed to the 
ruling politburo after having been ousted from that body in 1975 
at the beginning any reform looks like disorder versus an 
orderly state nyers told the daily if this disorder goes 
beyond a certain limit even masses of people might call for 
order 
nyers said the great test of reform policy was keeping the 
disorder limited 
nepszabadsag in its report on the two economic proposals to be 
discussed by the central committee said the first variation up for 
discussion would focus on radical restructuring towards a more 
market oriented economy that could however lead to 80000 to 
100000 unemployed and result in greater social tensions in the 
wake of reduced living standards 
the second variation could be seen as a more consistent 
continuation of the practice followed until now introducing 
reforms more gradually the paper said 
unemployment would remain within the limits of 30000 to 50000 
unemployment was expected to reach about 50000 already this year 
the paper said that although the second option would mean less 
social tensions in the shortterm the danger of falling behind 
international norms would not disappear 
nyers in his interview said he had always been an advocate of 
reformminded communism saying the country must reject the 
1950s my stand is politically and ideologically breaking away 
without any acquittal nyers was quoted as saying 
if the hungarian and other communist parties do not do so 
they would be unable to change the situation as it ought to be 
changed nyers said 
popular revulsion against the repressive communist regime of 
matyas rakosi a protege of soviet dictator josef v stalin 
sparked the 1956 uprising in hungary which was quelled by soviet 
forces

ten opposition lawmakers began a hunger strike 
sunday to force the government to solve a crisis in israels public 
health system plagued by months of labor disputes 
in an unusual show of unity lawmakers from opposite ends of the 
political spectrum gathered in the hallway of prime minister 
yitzhak shamirs office to launch their protest 
they said they would fast for a week unless an agreement was 
reached before then between the finance and health ministries on 
how to meet demands by doctors for drastic salary increases 
we are doing this because there is no other alternative 
legislator yossi sarid of the leftwing citizens rights movement 
told israel radio maybe now the government will listen 
added geula cohen of the rightwing tehiya party the common 
denominator is human suffering which doesnt distinguish between 
leftwingers from rightwingers 
the protest was organized by the leftwing mapam party 
in the past few months doctors in israeli hospitals have 
repeatedly gone on strike and performed only emergency surgery to 
press demands for higher wages doctors make about 750 a month 
as a result of the persistent labor disputes thousands of 
israelis have waited for months to be scheduled for crucial 
operations doctors have acknowledged they expect some patients to 
die because of delays in treatment 
in a scenario typical of the past few months doctors said they 
would strike monday in israels northern hospitals and in other 
regions during the remainder of the week 
the health ministry has agreed in principle to the doctors 
demands but finance minister moshe nissim has refused to allocate 
additional funds to the health ministry to cover salary raises 
the finance ministry is concerned a wage increase would trigger 
acrosstheboard wage hikes in the public health system and fuel 
inflation 
officials from the finance and health ministries were scheduled 
to meet monday with union representatives in another attempt to 
solve the crisis 
israel television quoted shamir as saying if no agreement is 
reached at mondays meeting he would convene a special ministerial 
committee to make a decision this week

michael dukakis on sunday urged rival george bush to tell the 
truth about whether his support for an increase in fees for 
health coverage indicates the vice president favors an increase in 
taxes bush meanwhile called for caution in dealing with the 
soviets 
the vice president spent the weekend at his seaside retreat in 
kennebunkport maine and sought the support of lithuanians at a 
local festival 
bush said last week that he favors higher fees for some 
government services including higher payments for medicare 
recipients under the catastrophic health care coverage of recent 
legislation dukakis said bushs plan amounts to raising taxes 
im for the bill dukakis said as he campaigned in the 
denver area but i want the vice president to stand up and tell 
the truth which is that he and the president supported a 6 
billion tax increase to pay for needed health insurance for the 
elderly in this country 
the allbutcertain democratic nominee turned aside questions 
about a possible clash with opponent jesse jackson at the national 
convention in atlanta next week 
i think jesse jackson can do anything he wants to do 
dukakis said im going to the convention and im going to win 
it 
jackson denied reports on saturday that he and his delegates 
might stage a walkout at the convention the threat is not that 
were going to walk out the threat is that were going to stay and 
expand and build and grow and make a difference jackson said 
he gave no indication of surrendering to dukakis who has 
amassed the number of delegates needed to win the nomination on the 
first ballot 
my name will be in nomination jackson said we will have 
platform planks on the floor those that are not resolved between 
now and that time and that should be a reasonable expectation 
bush putting politics on hold for the summer weekend delivered 
a nonpartisan speech to a lithuanian festival held at a 
40yearold franciscan monastery 
citing reforms in the soviet union under soviet leader mikhail 
gorbachev the vice president said this is a time of change in 
the soviet union and for the lithuanian people it is a time for 
hope 
but he added if this is a time for hope it is not a time 
for complacency or weakness it is a time i believe to test 
whether the reforms are genuine 
the likely republican nominee also spent time on his boat and 
attended sunday church services with his family 
dukakis used a tour of the rocky mountains at estes park colo 
to focus attention on environmental problems including acid rain 
which kills trees and fish its effects have been felt mainly in 
canada and the northeast 
the massachusetts governor suggested an increase in utility 
payments for residential electricity customers amounting to 50 
cents per family per month to help solve the problem 
the fact of the matter is if were going clean up acid rain in 
this country theres going to be a cost dukakis said thats 
why were going to solve the acid rain problem and if mr bush 
doesnt understand that he shouldnt be running for president 
dukakis planned to return to boston to concentrate on the vice 
presidential selection process which entered the final stretch 
with the convention just over a week away 
i love picking people i enjoy this process its an important 
choice and im going to make it dukakis said when asked by 
reporters about a possible running mate im going to make it 
with all the information advice and counsel i can i cant tell 
you when thats going to be

a group called the lithuanian movement for perestroika was 
attented by residents of the republics capital vilnius and 
lithuanian delegates to last weeks national party conference in 
moscow

local authorities

takeover of their areas in 1940 conducted under a secret section 
of a pact between nazi germany and the kremlin the year before the 
united states and several other western countries do not recognize 
the soviet takeover and consider the baltic republics independent

afghan rebels bombarded cities and towns across 
afghanistan with rockets and artillery fire in a wave of attacks 
that killed or wounded more than 150 civilians tass reported 
sunday 
tass said in a report from kabul the afghan capital that the 
raids occurred over the past 48 hours it said caravans carrying 
weapons for the rebels were arriving from pakistan 
the soviet military commander in afghanistan said the kremlin 
might be forced to rethink its schedule for the withdrawal of 
troops if pakistan keeps sending aid to afghan guerrillas a 
newspaper reported 
two caravans of 350 pack animals recently brought a large 
amount of arms and ammunition to the outskirts of the town of 
talukana the official soviet news agency reported 
the rebels used artillery and rockets to shell populated areas 
in more than eight provinces including the capital district of 
kabul and more than 150 civilians were killed or wounded tass 
said in samagan province alone it said 29 people including 16 
children were killed in attacks on villages 
in retaliation the afghan armed forces in a number of 
provinces smashed extremist groups tass said adding that 
several tens were killed it said more than 20 insurgents died 
when armed detachments from rival rebel groups battled among 
themselves 
lt gen boris gromov the top soviet soldier in afghanistan 
stopped short of saying the soviets might slow down or stop the 
pullout of troops 
answering questions from the krasnaya zvezda military daily 
gromov said all soviet troops have now been withdrawn from the 
eastern and southeastern provinces of afghanistan 
in april the soviets signed accords in geneva that committed 
them to begin withdrawing their more than 100000 soldiers from 
afghanistan on may 15 and to complete the pullout within 10 months 
they intervened in afghanistan in 1979 to back the government in 
its war against antimarxist guerrillas 
we are prepared to continue to implement strictly and 
faithfully the provisions of the geneva agreements gromov was 
quoted as saying although i do not rule out that unceasing 
violations of the provisions by pakistan may lead as was pointed 
out in the recent statement of the ussr ministry of foreign 
affairs to a situation when appropriate conclusions will be made 
as regards the timetable of the troop withdrawal 
he did not elaborate 
the foreign ministry on may 28 said if pakistan did not halt 
interference in the internal affairs of afghanistan the soviet 
union would draw pertinent conclusions with respect to the 
timetable of the troop withdrawal and take concrete steps 
the soviet union has repeatedly complained that pakistan is 
violating the geneva accord by sending arms to guerrillas fighting 
the kabul government and by allowing guerrilla training bases in 
its territory 
gromov told the newspaper as our troops are withdrawn from 
provinces that border on pakistan the desire of the opposition to 
give broader scope to fratricidal war becomes increasingly 
noticeable there are numerous facts which confirm that the 
pakistani side does not intend to observe the spirit and the letter 
of the geneva agreements 
the communist party daily pravda also accused pakistan on sunday 
of breaching the accords apparently referring to american arms 
shipments to the afghan guerrillas pravda said us actions 
also ran counter to the spirit of the agreements 
it is clear that the one who violates them assumes grave 
responsibility for the consequences and for the disappointment of 
the afghans hopes for a peaceful life the paper said 
the united states has been supplying the afghan rebels with arms 
and supplies channeled through pakistan it has vowed to continue 
the supplies as long as the soviet union keeps up its military 
support of the afghan government 
the geneva accords prohibit pakistani interference in 
afghanistans affairs but weapons supply from the soviet union is 
not banned a separate agreement signed by moscow and washington 
allows the superpowers to continue supplying their respective 
allies

vice president george bush said 
sunday that recent changes within the soviet union may herald a 
time of hope for those living in eastern europe but cautioned 
against complacency or weakness in dealing with the soviets 
addressing a lithuanian festival bush challenged the soviet 
union to make good on its reforms toward openness by relaxing its 
grip on the nations it occupied after world war ii 
the united states has always condemned the violation of your 
national sovereignity and in the years ahead we will never condone 
the forced occupation of lithuania by the soviet union he said 
bush spoke at a lithuanian franciscan monastery in this small 
seacoast resort town where he has a vacation home 
it was his only public appearance during a weekend of rest and 
his brief remarks were largely nonpartisan 
the certain republican presidential nominee said that despite 
the recent thaw in ussoviet relations full compliance by the 
soviets with international agreements on human rights remains an 
essential element in improving relations between our two 
countries 
still bush told the gathering on the monastery grounds this 
is a time of change in the soviet union and for the lithuanian 
people it is a time for hope 
there is hope because talk of nationalism is no longer merely 
whispered behind closed doors we see it shouted in the streets 
during the demonstrations that grow larger by the day 
bush cited the pullout of soviet troops from afghanistan as 
further cause for hope of a change in soviet policy 
but he added if this is a time for hope it is not a time 
for complacency or weakness it is a time i believe to test 
whether the reforms are genuine 
the monastery where bush spoke was founded by franciscan fathers 
who emigrated to southern maine in 1947 when their country fell to 
invading soviets 
after speaking bush and his wife barbara watched a performance 
by a lithuanianamerican dance troupe from boston 
earlier bush attended a church service with his wife and his 
87yearold mother dorothy walker bush at an episopalian church 
near his summer home 
otherwise his weekend was taken up by fishing boating and 
family events said spokeswoman shelia tate 
he really came up here to relax she said 
bush was to speak to an agricultural group on monday and to 
address an naacp meeting in washington on tuesday he also plans to 
attend the allstar baseball game in cincinnati on tuesday 
bush plans to do some campaigning during next weeks democratic 
national convention although details of his schedule have not yet 
been set said ms tate 
in his speech at the monastery bush told a group of about 
1000 it is 48 years now since the soviet union invaded your 
homeland and the other baltic states tragically many of you were 
forced to flee soviet persecution your children may never know the 
thrill of laughing and playing on lithuanian soil 
he called for the release of lithuanian political prisoners 
restoration of the right of lithuanian catholics to worship freely 
and restoring the birthright of freedom to the lithuanian 
people 
all of us look upon freedom as a gift a gift from god bush 
said accepting the suppression of the most fundamental human 
freedoms would be turning our backs on our own values and 
heritage 
only the united states is strong enough and committed enough 
to stand up for the freedoms of oppressed people all over the 
world he said

michael reagan the older son of president 
reagan said he wants a commercial in which he endorses a diet aid 
to be pulled from television if federal officials determine the 
patches are being marketed illegally 
reagan appears in a 30minute talkshow style commercial for an 
appetitecontrol skin patch that the food and drug administration 
is investigating he said he appeared in the commercial as an 
actor 
the commercial with reagan acting as a talk show host began 
appearing on los angeles cable channel ksci on june 7 and is 
scheduled to run through the end of july 
the fda banned distribution of all such diet patches in midmay 
because they are classified as drugs and require fda approval for 
sale to the public said fda compliance officer greg nelson the 
agency only found out about the brand of patches reagan advertised 
within the past two weeks he said 
reagan the 43yearold adopted son of the president and his 
first wife actress jane wyman told the los angeles daily news he 
wants the advertisement to be taken off the air if the fda 
determines that the patches are being marketed illegally he said 
he was unaware that the fda had banned the patches already 
i dont want my name out there he was quoted as saying 
reagan wears one of the patches during the show which features 
testimonials of doctors and satisfied users but he said he does 
not use the patches 
i auditioned as an actor and was hired to do the job reagan 
was quoted as saying it could have been baby bottles i knew it 
the product from nothing 
the product called eurotrym diet patches is marketed by ameuro 
services international inc 
dr keith kenyon a san fernando valley doctor who said he 
invented the patches about a year ago confirmed the fda 
investigation 
they wanted to know what was going on because there was never 
an application for licensing filed he said 
officials with ameuro which markets the patches out of phoenix 
ariz could not be reached for comment there was no telephone 
listing for the company in phoenix 
the patches contain a mix of natural substances kenyon said 
they are applied to an acupuncture point and stimulate the body he 
claimed 
similar diet patches marketed under the name appetoff by 
meditrend international a san diego company were seized in may by 
the fda 
nelson said it was unlikely reagan would be a target of an 
investigation unless he was involved in distribution or sales of 
the alleged diet aid 
in 1980 and 1981 reagan was investigated for several business 
dealings and was served with two search warrants but the 
investigation was later dropped in 1981 he resigned from his job 
after he used his fathers name in a letter soliciting contracts 
for his employer from military bases

two thousand people gathered at the 
site of what had been a threestory department store sunday night 
to pay tribute to the victims the survivors and the rescuers in 
last weeks building collapse 
workers cleared away the remaining rubble from the site sunday 
the day after the last of the 14 bodies were recovered from the 
debris left when the amigo store fell down during a torrential 
rainstorm thursday 
the crowd gave a standing ovation to denise carrera the 
8yearold miracle child who was found virtually unscathed 
under the debris friday the child dressed in a blue dress 
clutched a candle as she came to the stage as a tribute to the 
communitys accomplishment 
brownsville mayor ygnacio garza said the emergency was over and 
thanked the hundreds of volunteers and authorities who assisted in 
three days of rescue efforts 
i think this community did and proved what all of us already 
knew that we are a great city with great friends garza told 
the audience it now is time to bring this chapter to an end 
many of the volunteers and local officials hugged each other and 
the families of the victims as the ceremony came to an end 
in all at least 47 people were injured in the disaster which 
officials said may have been cause by the buildup of water on the 
stores roof little denise was one of six survivors pulled from 
the rubble friday her mother and 4yearold brother were among 
those killed 
garza who coordinated the rescue effort said investigations 
into the collapse will begin this week another building might 
never be built on the store site he said 
its been suggested that a memorial plaza be erected on this 
site garza said i think this would be an excellent site for a 
plaza the idea strikes me very well but with only six hours sleep 
in the past three days a lot of ideas strike me well 
crews worked throughout the night saturday using heavy 
machinery to remove remaining concrete and steel after they 
determined no more survivors or bodies were in the rubble 
police sgt dean poos said the memorial service was intended to 
thank the rescuers and other volunteers 
a lot of the people will be going back to work monday at 8 
oclock and this is just our way of saying this is over he 
said 
 
poos said most of the cordonedoff streets near the site would 
be opened early monday except for those within a block of the 
collapsed building 
garza said he would speak with officials from the federal 
emergency management agency to discuss emergency aid 
he said concrete and steel trusses and other parts of the 
building have been taken to insurance investigators steel 
manufacturers and city officials for analysis to determine the 
cause of the accident 
officials believe a large pool of water collected on top of the 
roof after more than 2 inches of rain fell in the area thursday 
afternoon 
but garza said there were numerous theories on the collapse 
including that roof drains were not clear he said he would wait 
for the investigation before placing blame 
the insurance adjusters have taken some photographs but their 
job will be more difficult because everything has been 
dismantled garza said 
officials had originally said 16 people died in the collapse 
but near the end of the search saturday they found only one body in 
an area where they had expected to find three 
residents across the rio grande valley gathered in churches to 
pray for the victims and families 
people came from all over the valley from all over the state 
to give their assistance and time the rev warren brown told 
about 500 worshippers at immaculate conception cathedral three 
blocks from the accident site 
there were people who may have never seen one another who came 
to work together to save lives and comfort the bereaved brown 
said 
the mayor said he was thankful to hundreds of local volunteers 
and especialy grateful to experts from across the country who 
helped in the rescue effort 
most outofstate experts including seismic workers and 
underground rescue teams began heading home sunday

combine the sales approaches of the sears 
catalog a tupperware party and the avon lady throw in frozen 
ribs cheesecake and other dishes and you have sundborn ltd 
purveyor of homedelivered meals to timestarved consumers 
secaucusbased sundborn displays its culinary wares in a 
catalog distributed at home foodtasting parties and provides 
delivery within 24 hours of upscale frozen dishes the ribs go 
for 28 and the cheesecake for 11 
gourmet food consultants host the tasting parties and give 
catalogs to their friends and neighbors collecting an average 12 
percent commission on any orders a customers call to a tollfree 
800 number brings dinner to the doorstep 
sundborn is an idea that grew out of my feeling that people 
today had a poverty of time said founder richard lamotta who 
also created the chipwich ice cream sandwich 
lamotta thinks he found a market niche by combining the 
attraction of home delivery and direct catalog sales 
were a substitute for going out to eat or getting pizza or 
chinese food he said 
the 170item catalog features dishes gathered from regions and 
restaurant menus around the nation including cassoulet at 495 
cajun catfish at 795 john willinghams world famous ribs at 28 
and plaza sweets chocolate velvet boule at 15 
lamottas food delivery idea is part of a nationwide trend 
industry experts say 
i would guess that were going to see more of these things 
said julie mautner an associate editor at des plaines illbased 
restaurant amp institutions magazine a foodservice trade 
publication 
she points to other companies emerging in the food delivery 
field such as general mills order inn division which delivers 
frozen dishes to three minneapolis suburbs 
chicagobased room service arranges deliveries from area 
restaurants to customers and will even have tuxedoclad waiters 
set and clear the customers table for an extra charge 
several chicken chains including popeyes and kentucky fried 
chicken have experimented in home delivery said william trainer 
a restaurant analyst at merrill lynch amp co in new york 
people just dont have the time but they want to eat well 
said lamotta well enough for sundborn to sell about 250000 
worth of food in the past two months 
one food industry colleague liked the idea but was skeptical of 
its merit 
john licari jr owner of casa di pizza in bloomfield said he 
liked the idea but was skeptical of its merit 
youre better off ordering a pizza said licari its got 
everything there you need 
nevertheless licari said his wife signed up as a sundborn 
consultant 
i tried the food it was pretty good me myself personally 
id cook it cause im in the business he said 
sundborn a subsidiary of chipwich inc is losing money but 
lamotta hopes to see a profit and 30 million to 60 million in 
sales within three years it began delivery from its totowa 
distribution center in midapril two california franchises are 
expected to open within two months and lamotta said he plans to 
have nationwide distribution within a year 
customers must buy a 50 minimum of the frozen goods which can 
be heated in a conventional or microwave oven the food can be 
delivered in 24 hours within 50 miles of a distribution center or 
in 48 hours outside of that radius 
sundborns distribution centers are stocked by specialty food 
manufacturers that generally supply restaurants lamotta said 
sundborn may sound like a yuppie service but lamotta rejects 
the label however he concedes his clientele is not a 
couponclipping discount supermarket crowd 
it goes beyond yuppies though he said it really is the 
ultimate busy persons food service

the days of a man arriving home and 
having his wife waiting with a homecooked meal went out with 
leave it to beaver says anne reznikoff who is exploiting the 
situation by selling takehome meals to homebound commuters during 
evening rush hours 
reznikoff a new york marketing consultant uses a refrigerated 
van as her base at the stamford train station for selling fresh 
entrees that can be heated up in a microwave or conventional oven 
the business called hi honey im home offers a choice of 
three entrees nightly and has a total menu of 30 entrees ranging 
from grilled salmon steak with vegetables to meat loaf with mashed 
potatoes 
her target consumers are the thousands of metropolitan new york 
commuters who pass through the station daily 
reznikoff says boredom with the typical takeout staples of pizza 
and chinese food helped inspire creation of the business 
my husband and i would get home at 830 pm open the door 
and jokingly say hi honey im home reznikoff said but 
instead of smelling a tasty dinner in the oven wed find an old 
apple and a beer in the refrigerator 
so wed call out for pizza but theres only so much you can 
take of that she said 
reznikoffs diners have a choice of main dishes side dishes 
such as rice pilaf cornbread or stirfried vegetables and salads 
complete meals range in price from 7 to 9 
the truck is parked at the stamford train station from 4 pm to 
830 pm monday through friday to catch commuters coming home 
from new york and those leaving stamford offices to head into the 
city the company also delivers meals to offices in stamford 
leftovers are donated to a stamford shelter for troubled youths 
reznikoff said the business began operating about four weeks 
ago but she has been researching and planning it for a year 
research included the surveying of more than 1000 train commuters 
about their eating habits 
we found there are very few people who dont eat out at least 
once a week she said and people dont want complicated food 
they want meat loaf and mashed potatoes 
reznikoff and her husband stan bratskeir chairman of rand 
public relations inc in new york city are the owners they employ 
an operations manager and a vendor 
the meals are cooked by a kitchen staff of six in norwalk that 
is under contract to hi honey im home and other food services 
reznikoff described reaction to the truck so far as 
astounding 
we have people coming off the train calling their spouse and 
saying here is what they have tonight she said 
reznikoff said that during her first weeks in business the truck 
was selling a maximum of 60 dinners per night it is equipped to 
serve up to 300 dinners nightly she said 
reznikoff plans to open a truck at the greenwich train station 
by midsummer she eventually wants to have 30 trucks around the 
new york metropolitan region and she plans to start a lunch 
service 
there are two kinds of food reznikoff said theres 
homemade that takes a lot of time and is very good and food that 
is takeout that is convenient but not as satisfying 
our mission was to combine both and have convenient food that 
tastes homemade

gtech corp the worlds leading maker 
of computerized lottery systems has its eyes set on the worlds 
biggest market china 
the company is negotiating a contract to set up ticketprinting 
plants in china a deal that executives hope eventually leads to 
the installation of an online lottery network similar to those 
used in the united states 
the winner of the contract to print tickets for chinas handful 
of paper lottery games could have the inside track on any future 
projects said guy b snowden gtech chairman 
one thing that ive found out about asian philosophy and 
chinese culture in particular is that if you get going with them 
the relationships tend to be very long term snowden said 
iit has been known since last fall when chinese representatives 
attended a lottery industry exposition that the nation was 
interested in a more sophisticated lottery 
lottery company executives say chinas 1 billion population and 
its increasingly consumerized society make it a tempting target 
about a year ago china introduced lotteries in a handful of 
provinces buses drive to villages and sell tickets from a window 
tickets that gtech hopes to win the contract to print 
a computerized online lottery system like those in use in the 
united states could follow snowden said we want to provide them 
an electronic bus he said 
china is the largest but not the only country where gtech and 
other lotterysystem makers are seeking to expand 
lottery company executives estimate the world could easily 
support 250000 wagering terminals yet only 60000 have been 
installed in the united states by contrast the competition for 
lottery contracts has dwindled fewer states are starting lotteries 
and most that already have them are under longterm contracts 
gtech reportedly is close to contracts in south korea turkey 
taiwan and west germany and runs online lotteries in australia 
canada iceland ireland mexico new zealand spain singapore 
sweden and venezuela as well as in 10 american states

bally manufacturing corp is getting out of the 
arcade machines business it created 57 years ago selling its 
pinball and video games business to concentrate on more lucrative 
ventures according to a company official 
bally which produced such popular games as pacman ms 
pacman space invaders and 8ball deluxe will sell 
assets from that part of its business for about 8 million to a 
chief competitor wms industries inc of new york said william 
peltier bally vice president for corporate communications 
peltier said saturday that the company probably will begin 
making the bally machines at a chicago factory of its subsidiary 
williams electronics games he said the sale should go through 
within 30 days 
we started the pinball business in 1931 peltier said you 
hate to see it pass but youve got to keep moving 
economic realities prompted bally to make the move peltier 
said at its peak in 1982 ballys amusement game business brought 
in 600 million by 1987 revenue from amusement game manufacturing 
fell to 243 million in face of stiff competition from japanese 
firms 
the company sold more than 100000 pacman machines and 
more than 125000 ms pacman machines peltier said 
bally has made its video and pinball machines at a factory in 
suburban franklin park which employs up to 200 people peltier 
said 
he said employees who do not move to the williams factory in 
chicago probably will be absorbed by ballys growing lifecycle 
liferower and lifecircuit fitness equipment manufacturing 
businesses 
the fitness business thats the growth business for us 
peltier said 
arcade machines helped give bally its name but also almost sank 
the amusement giant 
bally grew out of a company called lion manufacturing co which 
in 1931 introduced a pinball machine called ballyhoo 
popularity of the game led the company to manufacture it under a 
shortened version of the games name and the company went public 
in 1968 as bally manufacturing 
in the late 1970s and until 1982 bally made millions of dollars 
in the video game business in 1982 bally earned a record 91 
million and arcade games provided 75 percent of the companys 
pretax profit 
but one year later ballys profit was only 52 million after a 
steep decline in the games popularity by 1984 bally wrote off 
100 million in losses from its video game business 
in the past two years bally has paid increasing attention to 
its casinos in las vegas reno and atlantic city 
bally will continue to manufacture gambling game machines and 
is keeping its alladins castle chain of video and pinball arcades 
the company also operates 300 fitness centers nationwide including 
chicago health clubs 
in fiscal 1987 williams pinball sales were 765 million
