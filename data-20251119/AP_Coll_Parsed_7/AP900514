a congressional delegation will travel to 
korea later this month to accept the remains of five us soldiers 
killed in the korean war the lawmakers said monday 
the action by the communist government will mark the first time 
north korea has repatriated remains from the war since 1954

have done in vietnam rep gv sonny montgomery dmiss

only about a third of the daughters of poor 
teenage mothers in a 20year study became teenage mothers 
themselves indicating the cycle of teen childbearing is less 
prevalent than thought researchers said monday 
however the new generation of teenager mothers appeared more 
vulnerable to poverty than even their own young mothers were 
meaning the problem remains a serious factor in urban poverty the 
report said 
there isnt a kind of inevitability of the cycle of poverty 
being repeated from generation to generation said frank 
furstenberg jr a university of pennsylvania sociologist thats 
an important finding 
but he said in an interview there are also some sobering 
results that indicate that the minority who do go on to follow in 
their mothers footsteps could have less room for maneuvering their 
way out of poverty 
the study consisted of interviews of 404 pregnant teenagers in 
baltimore from 19661968 then followup interviews with the 
mothers and their children one three five 17 and 20 years later 
of the 118 female children who remained in the sample after 20 
years only 42 or 36 percent had become teenage mothers 
themselves said the study led by furstenberg and published in the 
journal family planning perspectives 
that finding challenges the popular belief that the offspring 
of teenage mothers are themselves destined to become adolescent 
parents the report said it defined teen mothers as those under 
19 
the 404 original mothers mostly poor urban blacks were not 
selected randomly meaning the results cannot be projected to a 
broader population 
however when the researchers examined data gathered from 
19791986 in the ongoing national longitudinal survey of youth 
which is based on a random sample they reached the same finding 
only about a third of the daughters of black teenage mothers 
became teenage mothers themselves 
the study apparently marked the first time the national survey 
results were examined this way furstenberg said he said his group 
checked for the confirmatory data because it was startled by its 
baltimore finding 
while the percentage of secondgeneration teenage mothers was 
lower than expected it was much higher than the teen pregnancy 
rate among daughters of adult mothers among urban blacks in that 
group surveys indicate that only about a fifth become teen 
mothers furstenberg said 
the current study did not focus on why the children of teen 
mothers are more likely to become teen mothers he speculated that 
the rate is lower than expected because researchers have 
underestimated the strength of urban black teenagers feelings 
against having children 
the most troubling finding furstenberg said was that 
secondgeneration teen mothers in the baltimore survey were more 
likely than their mothers to remain unmarried collect welfare and 
fail a grade in school 
this trend could portend the growth of an urban underclass 
even though only a minority of the offspring of urban teenage 
mothers go on to become adolescent parents the report said 
it addition to furstenberg it was written by research assistant 
judith levine of the university of pennsylvania and senior research 
scientist jeanne brooksgunn of the educational testing service in 
princeton nj

dozens of folks from this mountain hamlet 
jammed into a tiny church last week to find out why the grundy 
county courthouse had burned down 
when district attorney general bill pope jr announced it was 
arson the crowd of men in baseball caps and women carrying babies 
heaved a long sad sigh 
their worst fears had been confirmed the destruction of the 
105yearold courthouse added one more chapter to the countys 
embarrassing history of arson 
its just another happening that puts grundy county in the 
news media something bad happening said sheriff aubrey harper 
a pair of brothers fresh from a brush with the law were charged 
in the may 3 courthouse blaze 
the case seems part of a history of suspicious fires and 
explosions stretching nearly from the turn of the century in this 
old mining county on the cumberland plateau northwest of 
chattanooga 
an arson blaze on april 27 1935 leveled 10 buildings in tracy 
city causing more than 100000 in damage and nearly wiping out 
the business district 
on aug 24 1971 when the 100yearold lampn depot in tracy city 
burned down thensheriff henry morrison said it was the countys 
22nd fire of the year most were blamed on arson 
in may 1976 two men were charged with torching the towns james 
k shook school a massive 86yearold building that boasted a 
turret and a clock tower 
newspaper offices have been a favorite target the grundy county 
times office was set afire in september 1915 and the grundy county 
herald was destroyed by arson in 1978 11 years after an explosion 
damaged that papers old office 
sometimes revenge seems to be the motive other times its just 
plain vandalism 
law enforcement authorities hesitate to label grundy county a 
hotbed of suspicious fires 
im not going to say that grundy county is any different than 
any other rural county said bill thompson special agent in 
charge of the tennessee bureau of investigations eastern district 
there are a ton of good people there 
still the rugged county of 14500 people has a certain 
notoriety 
beyond arson vandals seem especially fond of dynamite probably 
because of the areas coalfield history 
in 1965 67 and 70 dynamite blasts destroyed or damaged water 
tanks in various parts of the county also in 1967 about 800 
people lost water service after somebody blew up the tracy city 
pumping station 
a tracy city lumber yard was dynamited in 1969 and the next 
year a similar blast leveled a doctors clinic there 
fires and bombings were so common at abandoned county schools in 
the 70s that officials had a hard time getting insurance 
said thensuperintendent glenn bonner just as soon as a 
building becomes vacant boom 
in recent years the county has become notorious as a hub for 
chop shops places where stolen cars are stripped for parts that 
are resold 
folks are still rankled by a 1988 newspaper story in which a 
davidson county police officer said if you dont cut wood or 
steal trucks in grundy county youre in bad shape 
the chop shops sprang up in the 1960s after the coal mines 
closed and they flourished despite major police raids in 1965 
1971 and 1979 that sent dozens of people to jail 
harper contends steppedup enforcement has put the business in 
decline in 1987 he said deputies recovered about 400 stolen 
cars last year the number had shrunk to under 50 
but grundy countys roughandtumble image lingers 
in many respects i think it is unfair said harper but 
at the same time i know that many things have happened here over 
the years that are still in peoples minds 
the brothers charged in the courthouse fire brian ellege 23 
and steve ellege 21 had been released on bond on burglary charges 
the day before the fire they were arrested may 8 and charged with 
arson and felony vandalism the brothers deny setting the fire 
authorities allege the two burned the building either out of 
revenge or in an effort to destroy their criminal records 
as much as anything say some observers that kind of attitude 
may explain why many buildings in grundy county come to an 
incendiary end 
is there an attempt by wronged persons to administer justice 
more so in a rural county than in an urban county possibly yes 
said thompson 
said harper i think rural people probably take matters into 
their own hands a little faster

a team of six people is toiling in a small suite 
of offices unlocking the secrets of three decades of governmental 
paranoia 
the quasilibrarians have begun what promises to be months of 
scrutinizing the disorganized files of the detroit police 
departments red squad a product of the mccarthyera hunts for 
suspected communist sympathizers 
the files containing about 15 million names were released after 
the city and a group of plaintiffs settled a 16yearold lawsuit 
the plaintiffs argued that they were subject to illegal police 
surveillance between the mid1940s and the mid70s 
the surveillance stopped in 1974 when mayor coleman a young 
first took office and ordered it halted 
the red squad notification and distribution compliance program 
was set up as part of a settlement approved last week by wayne 
county circuit judge lucile a watts 
since then the program has received 300 to 500 requests for 
applications to receive files contained in boxes and file cabinets 
in the offices said its director dorian paster 
the requests are coming relatively thickly he said monday 
we are in the file room and getting acquainted 
the task may take months paster said the files will not be 
available to the general public but people who were spied on may 
receive copies of their dossiers before releasing any information 
paster said names of police officers informants and any 
unsubstantiated information from a third party will be deleted 
the workers are plunging into a haphazard filing system of 
reports newspaper stories photographs and other information 
assembled by the red squad 
the lack of organization of many of the files has raised 
pasters eyebrows 
it was a very thorough operation he said of the early days 
of the squad i have a suspicion that that broke down in later 
years it seems that some material was moved 
but paster wont know if thats the case until the files are 
sorted it is at best a difficult task he added 
some of the people helping paster sift through the files were 
themselves onetime targets of the squad 
by having people like that involved it would go toward 
assuaging some of the fears of the people who are applying he 
said the applications will not be seen by the police 
the primary focus of the squad was to gather information about 
people suspected of having ties to the communist party the number 
of names in the squad poses a considerable problem 
its amazing how many small people are the subject of a 
file he said 
one of things i ran across in a couple of cases now is address 
books or other books that were either lost or stolen they started 
a file on every name in that book 
also hampering his teams work is the nature of the program 
itself 
part of the problem is that i cant name any names or 
organizations and bring that information to the public paster 
said anybody who has the least suspicion that they may be 
covered by this should make an application

in a case of symbol vs slumber a 
jury agreed with a couple that the hourly ringing of an 1800pound 
town bell next to their house is a nuisance at night 
a judge wont rule until friday whether the bell should be 
silenced from 9 pm to 6 am but richard and pamela carnall 
newcomers to the pretty new england town of hatfield said they 
were happy with mondays verdict 
we understood it was a tradition and we never tried to take it 
away from them carnall said 
the jury found that the bell was a nuisance at night and caused 
mrs carnall injury by depriving her of sleep but the panel found 
no evidence her husband was harmed by the ringing and it awarded 
no damages to the couple 
after the verdict the carnalls asked superior court judge john 
f murphy to order the bell silenced at night 
hatfield selectmen chairman george zgrodnick jr said he was 
unsure what the towns next step would be town hall was not a 
happy place after the verdict he said everybody seems kind of 
downhearted and disgusted 
the bell regarded by oldtimers as a comforting fixture has 
called the 320yearold farming community to work and rest for 
generations ninetyone years ago the town clock was installed and 
the bell began its hourly chiming 
zgrodnick and other longtime residents had testified to their 
fond memories of the bell 
how did the people of hatfield how did their values get so 
twisted so distorted that they can put this symbol this empty 
symbol ahead of peoples feelings the carnalls attorney w 
michael ryan said in closing arguments 
this is a historic old new england village of which the clock 
and bell tower are a very significant part said william oneil 
hatfield town counsel 
the bell belongs to the town but is housed in the whitesteepled 
first congregational church which many years ago doubled as the 
town hall 
in 1988 the carnalls moved next door to the town clock which 
was broken six months later the clock was fixed and the carnalls 
began to complain they were being awakened at all hours 
the carnalls had asked that the ringing be declared a nuisance 
and that a jury award damages jurors deliberated for about two 
hours 
i am comfortable that having convinced a jury well also 
convince the judge ryan said

it wasnt long after the 
first tourists appeared in the valley carved amid granite peaks 
that conservationists mourned the impact of humans here 
frederick law olmsted a member of the first yosemite 
commission wrote in 1865 of picturesque rocks stenciled over 
with advertisements of patent medicines naturalist john muir 
complained the valley looked like a frowsy backwoods pasture 
after a visit in 1889 the year before yosemite became a national 
park 
yosemite national park turns 100 this year so do its problems 
in muirs day no more than a couple of thousand hardy folk each 
year trekked through the wilderness to refresh themselves in the 
mists of yosemite falls and marvel at the parks granite monolith 
el capitan 
last year 34 million people came through the valley bringing 
with them some of the very problems they were trying to escape in 
the city park officials are struggling with the best way to deal 
with the crowding pollution development and traffic that threaten 
its natural beauty and serenity 
yosemite for a number of reasons really just ranks very 
highly in peoples level of care said allan bedwell national 
park service spokesman it goes back to yosemite playing a major 
role in this country as a symbol of wilderness or nature or 
primeval heritage 
i think a lot of it has to do with the fact that its 
accessible to people those cliffs those waterfalls represent 
wilderness even though you have to view that wilderness in a 
fairly urban setting 
visitors can order anything from pizza to prime rib in 
yosemites snack bars and restaurants or buy tshirts tennis 
balls and mugs in park gift shops then get extra cash from an 
automatic teller machine a beauty shop and video rental cater to 
park service and concession employees who live in the valley 
law enforcement officers booked 500 people into the jail last 
year 
it was anticipated a decade ago that yosemites 100th birthday 
on oct 1 1990 also would be a celebration of the ambitious 1980 
general management plan that promised to balance convenience with 
conservation 
but 10 years proved too short a time to meet such grandiose 
goals as eliminating cars from the valley and removing nonessential 
businesses offices and personnel to locations outside the park 
boundaries 
the park service has acknowledged the failure to fully implement 
the plan and is cataloging nearly 4500 letters of comment from 
park enthusiasts as it decides how to plan realistically for 
yosemites next 100 years 
the plan was formulated at a time when there was a different 
administration and different political climate park 
superintendent michael finley said 
its implementation was hindered in part by a lack of money 
and in some instances by proposals that proved unrealistic 
finley said 
for example a landscape architect has found there is not enough 
suitable land to expand employee housing in the community of el 
portal outside the park as the plan proposes finley said 
the park service did succeed in eliminating 650 parking spaces 
as planned but a parking garage that was supposed to replace some 
of the lost spaces never materialized 
pressure to remove facilities from the park has remained 
constant from environmentalists who complain many of the services 
interfere with the mandate to preserve yosemite 
we want to make it accessible to people but do you need to be 
able to buy mugs and tshirts and a badminton racquet in order to 
enjoy yosemite national park asked patricia schifferle regional 
director of the wilderness society 
superintendent finley argues that visitors who soothe their 
muscles in a swimming pool after hiking to the top of yosemite 
falls or spend a night in a 180 room at the ahwahnee hotel also 
gain an appreciation of the park 
if you look at it one way you could be shocked and say in 
john muirs holy temple there are swimming pools finley said 
but if john muir could keep 200000 people from churning up the 
merced river would he do it by putting in three swimming pools 
at the heart of the controversy over what services are 
appropriate for a national park is the yosemite park and curry co 
a subsidiary of mca which provides guest services in the park 
critics argue that curry wields too much influence over the 
park schifferle cites currys proposal to remove some existing 
employee housing and replace it with dormitories near yosemite 
lodge schifferle says the plan is contrary to the goal of removing 
unnecessary employee housing from the valley 
a lot of whats been said critical of the curry company is 
flat erroneous theyve said we want to build more facilities here 
not true said curry spokesman john poimiroo he defended the 
dormitory plan saying it would decrease traffic between el portal 
where it was proposed employees would be moved and the valley 
floor 
critics also say the company profits from a 30year contract 
that requires it to pay the government only 75 percent of its 
annual sales while not contributing to the goals of the general 
management plan 
the national park service revealed that in 1989 curry paid 
635000 to provide without competition most guest services 
poimiroo admits the fee is low he points out however that 
currys financial commitment to the park does not end with the 
concessions fee 
curry also has invested 100 million in the park since 1973 
when mca bought the concessionaire in maintenance and capital 
improvements which included 8 million to repair and restore the 
ahwahnee hotel poimiroo said 
but claims that the money represents an investment in the park 
are met with skepticism by environmentalists who say curry 
ultimately makes money on that type of spending 
are they spending money on the park or are they spending 
money to do business in the park schifferle said thats why i 
find the 100 million is probably more pr hype than reality as far 
as actual benefit to the park its probably benefiting curry 
company enormously 
attempts to renegotiate the concessions fee before the contract 
expires in 1993 have failed but many expect the new contract to 
include clauses requiring curry to invest some profits in specific 
programs 
finley points out that even successfully raising the fee would 
not necessarily mean more money for yosemite itself the 
concessions fee is deposited in the us treasury where it is 
reappropriated by congress leaving the park service to compete 
with other interests finley said 
the lively debate on how to protect yosemites natural beauty 
inevitably leads to the park services conflicting missions 
preserving the park while making it accessible to the public 
yosemite always has been on the political hot seat because 
probably more than any other park it mirrors that tension every 
day of every year said jim snyder park historian the issues 
have become national because they symbolize what could happen to 
the national parks

thurgood marshalls place in history was 
assured before he became a member of the supreme court in 1967 now 
his conservative critics long distressed by marshalls liberal 
record say its time for the first black justice to step aside for 
a more youthful energetic successor 
marshall a civil rights pioneer who as a lawyer helped changed 
the nation will be 82 in july he shrugs off questions about 
retirement with customary curmudgeonly humor 
i have a lifetime appointment and i intend to serve it he 
has said numerous times he once told the washington post i 
expect to die at 110 shot by a jealous husband 
for decades before president johnson named him to the high 
court marshall had traveled the nation as the recognized legal 
champion of the poor and the powerless some say he ranks with the 
rev martin luther king jr as a leader in the battle for racial 
equality 
over 23 years as legal director of the national association for 
the advancement of colored people and then as the federal 
governments solicitor general marshall argued 32 cases before the 
supreme court he won 29 
his biggest naacp victory came in the 1954 ruling that declared 
racially segregated public schools unconstitutional 
he changed america said erwin griswold the onetime harvard 
university law school dean and himself a former solicitor general 
when i think of great american lawyers i think of thurgood 
marshall abe lincoln and daniel webster said georgetown 
university law school dean thomas g krattenmaker 
experts agree marshalls legal accomplishments before joining 
the high court far surpass those of any fellow justice it is his 
stature as a justice that has been questioned of late by 
conservative critics 
they say he is losing interest in much of the courts daytoday 
work and delegates too much responsibility to his young law clerks 
former clerks deny it marshall declined to be interviewed for 
this article 
one of the harshest attacks on marshall was penned by terry 
eastland onetime aide to former attorney general edwin k meese 
iii eastland last year wrote in the conservative national review 
one joke has it that if marshall retired at least he wouldnt be 
paid for watching television 
the reference apparently was prompted by earlier reports that 
marshall is a fan of the peoples court and watches the tv show 
in his court office the justice has denied the reports saying 
thats an awful program 
criticism of marshalls supposed work habits are often 
accompanied by questions of his health 
standing 6 feet 2 and overweight marshall shuns exercise he 
had a heart attack in 1976 has suffered from bouts of pneumonia 
and bronchitis he was hospitalized in 1987 with a potentially 
dangerous blood clot in his right foot 
marshall walks slowly and with apparent difficulty family 
members reportedly convinced him a few years ago to stop driving 
he now gets to work in a chauffeurdriven limousine 
former clerks however insist his health is not deteriorating 
georgetown law professor mark tushnet a marshall clerk in 1972 
said he did not look in good health then he doesnt look any 
different now 
tushnet who is writing a biography of marshall also dismissed 
the idea that the increasing dominance of the courts conservatives 
has soured marshall 
he seemed grumpy when i worked with him and he seems grumpy 
now tushnet said 
legal scholars say a succession of conservative court 
appointments has denied the old civil rights fighter the chance 
that was briefly his to shape the law within two years of 
marshalls appointment to a predominantly liberal court chief 
justice warren burger replaced earl warren and the courts 
evolution toward conservatism had begun 
but marshall has been very important in providing visions of 
where the law should go said krattenmaker he has written 
several dissenting opinions that may prove to be persuasive 
marshall and justice william j brennan are the courts most 
consistent liberals and most frequent dissenters 
they stand alone in opposing capital punishment in all 
circumstances press for broader protection for criminal defendants 
and lead the way in supporting affirmative action for minorities 
and women 
marshalls former law clerks call him the courts conscience and 
say his role is one of making sure the other justices realize their 
decisions are affecting real fleshandblood people 
marshall suffers from glaucoma at times it seems he has 
trouble reading summaries of his opinions from the bench at a 
celebration of his 80th birthday he insisted that television 
camera lights be turned off because the glare bothered his eyes 
rumors of declining alertness were fed by an incident last fall 
during an oral argument session before the court 
marshall posed several questions to a lawyer he seemingly 
believed was representing the government when in fact the lawyer 
was representing the other side 
if i appear confused i am marshall said at one point when 
another justice noted whom the lawyer represented marshall 
recovered by telling the lawyer well there is no bar to you 
giving me some help 
marshalls public appearances away from the bench are rare but 
when he does appear he doesnt mince words 
in televised interviews in 1987 he said president reagans 
civil rights record ranks at the bottom and accused meeses 
justice department of trying to undermine the supreme court 
itself 
in a speech to a conference of lawyers and judges that year he 
said he was not about to quit fighting rightwingers 
dont worry im going to outlive those bastards he said

for more than a decade doppler radar has been 
the weather technology of the future at the national weather 
service the future finally is now 
the first next generation weather radar nexrad is being 
installed in oklahoma city 
a second will go to melbourne fla in late summer and the 
third near washington after the first of next year 
nexrad will bring substantial improvement to the forecasting of 
severe storms and floods predicted commerce secretary robert a 
mosbacher 
that already has begun says national weather service director 
elbert w friday jr 
during a 5month test in oklahoma nexrad was used in preparing 
warnings for 450 severe weather events friday said 
it was a beautiful season to test a system but it was a 
terrible season for the residents of oklahoma he said in a 
recent interview this was one of the most active seasons they 
had had in a long time 
during that period weather offices accurately warned of storms 
about 59 percent of the time the nexrad results were 91 percent 
friday said and the false alarm rate was cut from about 60 percent 
to 21 percent at the doppler radar site 
friday pointing to the hazy sky outside his 18th floor office 
in silver spring md said current radars would see nothing there 
but nexrad he said would see air movement in that sky telling 
forecasters wind speed and direction to help make predictions 
radars send out a short radio pulse and listen for it to bounce 
back the time it takes tells the distance from whatever the signal 
bounced off the direction can be seen from where the radar faces 
the current wsr57 and wsr74 radars some 30 years old can 
detect things like rain airplanes and buildings 
nexrad can also see the invisible moisture and dust in 
apparently clear air and it can sense movement telling which way 
the wind is blowing at different levels by measuring the change in 
frequency of the signal bouncing back 
just as an ambulance siren has a higher pitch coming toward you 
than one going away radar waves change depending on the movement 
and speed of the object reflecting them back 
being able to see where the direction of the wind changes 
abruptly can help a forecaster determine where a storm is likely to 
develop and can tell a pilot where his plane may encounter 
dangerous turbulence 
this allowed meteorologists to give an hour and a half warning 
of a tornado developing in the denver area last year friday said 
by seeing those finescale details in the atmosphere you can 
identify factors that will be triggering the development of the 
storm instead of waiting to spot the twister friday explained 
in combination with satellites and other new systems nexrad 
is going to generate much more of a detailed look at the 
atmosphere than weve ever had before he said 
this should help meteorologists understand what drives all of 
the very smallscale features that really do cause most of the 
problems for the flash floods and the heavy snows and the 
tornadoes and the thunderstorms 
the radars and associated computerized work stations are being 
built by the unisys corp 
in addition to the national weather service the price tag of 
more than 400 million for the 175 radars is being shared by the 
departments of defense and transportation 
an air force test analysis of the nexrad found some serious 
shortcomings friday acknowledged but that was the idea he said 
maintenance problems with the machinery not operating for long 
periods were the biggest troubles according to the air force 
some operators rated the radars not acceptable 
many involved construction problems and those have been taken 
care of friday said 
another problem cited by the air force technicians was range 
folding which also occurs with current radars 
sometimes the bounceback signal received by a radar is not from 
the most recent pulse but an earlier one coming back from a more 
distant object 
the computer cant tell the difference assuming all signals are 
from the most recent pulse that results in a distant storm showing 
up on radar as nearby 
computers now have been programmed to show purple on the screen 
when two signals come back from the same spot an indication to the 
meteorologist that range folding is occurring the radar operator 
then can change the frequency of the signals to separate them on 
the screen 
installation of the new radars is part of an overall 
reorganization of the national weather service the agency will go 
from about 300 weather offices to 115

a fouryear drought and a mysterious fungus 
are killing the chaparral the dense brush that blankets the hills 
of southern california leaving it tinderdry with a potential for 
fires with the energy of hiroshima 
officials fear this summer could be the worst wildfire season in 
decades 
fire season was declared weeks early in santa barbara and san 
luis obispo counties and will be declared monday for the rest of 
southern california said doug allen of the california department 
of forestry rainfall in the region so far this year measures about 
38 percent of normal which is about 155 inches 
it is as bad as i have seen in my 33 years in the fire 
service said los angeles deputy fire chief donald f anthony he 
has ordered firefighters to stockpile plastic pipe so they can pump 
water from home swimming pools 
especially alarming is a fungus that preys on droughtweakened 
brush killing as much as 60 percent of it in parts of the suburban 
santa monica and san gabriel mountains said philip j riggan a 
us forest service scientist 
mountain lilac manzanita sumac california holly and even oak 
trees all have been afflicted leaving gray blotches of dead wood 
on mountains and canyons 
a pound of chaparral has about the same energy as a cup of 
gasoline said los angeles county fire capt scott franklin in 
areas of dense growth fire officials estimate the chaparral at 
more than 60 tons per acre he said 
were talking about the energy of hiroshima he added 
the fungus botryosphaeria ribis appears to act like an 
opportunistic disease on alreadystressed brush at some 
elevations the dead bushes look like a bathtub ring around the 
los angeles basin suggesting a link to air pollution which is 
held to certain altitudes by warm desert air over cooler marine 
air riggan said 
if people saw this kind of mortality in forests theyd be 
quite upset riggan added the area is just ripe for a huge 
fire 
but then the forests are dying too droughtstressed trees are 
plagued by bark beetles with most of the pines dead in some 
stands riggan said 
a worstcase scenario that anthony and other fire officials 
often use is the 1961 belair wildfire which destroyed 484 homes 
and injured 185 firefighters 
damage was estimated at 30 million but anthony noted most 
of those homes were valued between 35000 and 70000 at that 
time i seriously doubt that there are many homes there now valued 
at less than 850000 that same fire today could certainly run 
into the billions of dollars 
conditions this year are worse fire officials said and many 
residential developments in southern california have tempted fate 
by pushing deep into scenic canyons and brushy hills 
every spring homeowners are ordered to clear the brush 
surrounding their home for at least 100 feet but that wont help 
much in the face of a major fire officials said 
on a recent trip through the san gabriel mountains above la 
canada flintridge franklin looked down from a fire road to 
multimilliondollar homes snuggled amid the dense foliage of winery 
canyon 
thats the threat right there he said weve got whole 
communities that are at risk weve got to start educating people 
that weve got a serious problem 
its just something that people are not very interested in 
said joan feehan a la canada flintridge city council member who 
has a 15 million mountain home nestled at the citys border with 
the angeles national forest 
of course youre aware of it when you pay your fire 
insurance feehan said the premium for her 5000squarefoot 
home is 3200 a year 
controlled burning of chaparral is the only solution riggan and 
franklin said but most prescribed burning programs have been 
curtailed by state and federal budget cuts 
if were ever going to slow down these major fires weve got 
to go in and remove the fuel riggan said if we dont do this 
prescribed burning its going to be business as usual with one 
catastrophic fire after another

us tour operators are planning to send a 
record 4000 or more travelers to antarctica prompting calls for 
strict government regulation to protect penguins other wildlife 
and the very fate of the frozen continent 
the number of tourists visiting antarctica has more than 
tripled in the past five years said bruce manheim a washington 
activist of the environmental defense fund who calls existing 
controls inadequate 
antarctica has become a hot travel destination for the 
1990s beckoning older americans seeking more adventure than europe 
and hoping to see a fragile frontierland visited by only a 
privileged few in their youth 
they are fueling fresh growth in the adventure travel industry 
an estimated 13 billionayear phenomenon 
about 800 american tourists traveled to antarctica in 1988 
3000 in 1989 and tour operators expect at least 4000 in the 
decemberfebruary summer season manheim says it could reach 5000 
theres clearly a trend toward these type of expeditionary 
visits to remote places in the world said manheim 
he filed an appeal tuesday with the government urging more 
regulation 
we are not trying to prohibit tourists from going to 
antarctica we just think tourism is something that has to be 
regulated carefully he said 
concern began mounting after the january 1989 grounding of the 
argentine naval ship bahia paraiso in which an estimated 175000 
gallons leaked into marine habitats killing seals penguins and 
other marine life the vessel remains at the site off palmer 
station with some oil in its tanks 
particularly worrisome to critics are the plans of ocean cruise 
lines of fort lauderdale to send the largest cruise ship in years 
to antarctica the 460passenger ocean princess 
rates begin at 3895 per person for a doubleoccupancy cabin on 
its three wineandcaviar cruises which are selling briskly the 
first round trip from buenos aires argentina begins dec 22 
manheims appeal is urging the government to place strict 
controls on helicopter flights near wildlife sites guidelines on 
tourist observation of penguins and seals and coordination of 
cruise ship visits to breeding grounds 
he said ships had made repeated tourist visits to the same 
wildlife sites disrupting the breeding of seals penguins and 
other birds 
a year after antarcticas most significant environmental 
disaster we still dont have regulations to prevent similar 
catastrophes said manheim 
the us government responds that effective regulations are 
already in place 
we have tried and we believed we have dealt succesfully with 
the explosion of antarctica tourism said jack talmadge of the 
national science foundation which regulates us activities in 
antarctica 
talmadge said the nsf has issued tourist regulations 
established a mechanism for assessing fines for violations and 
taken steps to limit visits to us research stations 
he said the tour operators are also cooperating with the nsf to 
minimize the impact of tourism including giving advance notice of 
ship visits 
although 16 nations fly flags in antactica and seven claim 
slices of it no nation holds title to the continent which is 
larger than the united states and mexico combined 
military flights and small ships carrying about 100 tourists 
have been frequent modes of travel to antarctica since the first 
tourists visited in 1958 
now the chilean government has opened a spartan hotel at its 
teniente marsh station on king george island and lanchile airlines 
began commercial flights to that antarctic stop last year 
australian entrepreneurs have proposed a fivestory hotel 
airstrip and hovercraft dock the canadabased adventure network 
currently flies tourists to one south pole station 
but the bulk of the tourists are americans brought in by 
usbased operators conservationists say the united states should 
therefore take the lead in adopting a model regulatory policy 
antarctica tourism originates almost exclusively in the united 
states and therefore we have the responsibility to regulate our 
tourism if we are to push for regulation at an international 
level said manheim 
operators of the ocean cruise lines said there is no cause for 
alarm 
the tourist visiting antarctica is a determined 
environmentalist an avid lover of wildlife and i can assure you 
that no tourist not one has hurt or killed a bird or animal 
said lars eric lindblad an antarctic travel pioneer who will 
lecture aboard the ocean princess 
james barnes with friends of the earth in washington concludes 
that the travelers may leave their footprints but they often 
return home more committed environmentalists ambassadors of 
antarctica 
nonetheless he said the scale of these activities is growing 
at such a pace that it does provide cause for concern

signs of renewed inflation and 
financial speculation have created fears in brazil that a drastic 
economic austerity plan launched in midmarch is running into 
trouble 
the full economic picture is not clear but one thing is 
things are getting worse said alexandre barros a political 
consultant 
economy minister zelia cardoso de mello met all weekend with key 
advisers and rumors abounded that new austerity measures would 
soon be announced including tightening credit and increasing 
interest rates to hold down the money supply 
the government will have to take immediate action now or the 
situation could spin out of control said economist jose marcio 
camargo of rios pontifical catholic university we may soon be 
facing a recession with inflation the worst of both worlds 
the main concern is inflation which seemed under control after 
president fernando collor de mello imposed his austerity plan on 
march 16 a day after he took office 
the measures which included an 18month freeze on 115 billion 
in savings accounts and money market deposits drastically reduced 
record annual inflation of almost 5000 percent 
the plan also led to a dramatic economic downturn with unions 
estimating 300000 people fired and businesses reporting 
drastically reduced sales the government has said the slowdown is 
needed to put the economy in order 
but after predicting just 10 days ago that inflation was dead 
and beaten cardoso de mello said on friday the cost of living 
rose more than 3 percent in april 
several private institutions say the government is seriously 
underestimating inflation and that the real rate for april was 
between 10 percent and 20 percent 
whatever the true figure the cost of living is creeping back 
up again said camargo 
also troubling observers was the return of financial 
speculation which forced the government to sell gold last week to 
keep down the price of the metal 
and the dollar has already recovered its early march value of 80 
cruzeiros the currency on the illegal but widely tolerated black 
market had fallen by more than 50 percent after collor announced 
the austerity plan 
last week federal police raided the offices of black market 
operators in sao paulo to try to slow the dollars rise 
those sorts of actions are effective for only a few days the 
government will have to find better ways to end speculation said 
david fleischer a political science professor at the university of 
brasilia 
the new round of speculation seemed tied in part to the publics 
diminished faith in the economic program 
a survey released last week by the brazilian association of 
credit and savings companies said 4 million has been pulled from 
savings deposits that would represent 36 percent of all money in 
accounts not blocked by the freeze 
another sign of the publics lack of confidence is a recent boom 
in sales of residential safes brazils biggest safe manufacturer 
the bernardini company said home safe sales were almost double 
levels prior to march 
weve always had a credible financial sector but people are 
skeptical now and would rather spend or buy dollars camargo said 
a final problem is that many companies skirted the bank freeze 
the prominent rio daily o globo reported last week that firms 
had managed to unfreeze almost 50 billion mostly by paying 
off debts and taxes as rules allowed 
jean daniel peter the president of the brazilian subsidiary of 
union carbide told the paper the company used all of its 18 
million caught in the bank freeze 
others resorted to illegal methods blocked funds could be 
donated to charities and some companies made deals whereby they 
made large contributions but received part of the money back 
the money injected into the economy by such methods is believed 
in part responsible for the rise in inflation

mikhail s gorbachev imposed tough sanctions on 
lithuania in hopes of frightening other republics away from 
pressing for independence but merely made them more cautious 
an embargo on shipments of fuel manufactured goods and raw 
materials to lithuania prompted the other two baltic states latvia 
and estonia to rephrase their demands for independence 
they declared their firm intention to leave the soviet union 
but provided for transition periods of unspecified length on 
saturday the three republics announced they had forged a united 
front to negotiate with the kremlin 
in other republics activists are following in the early steps 
of the baltic republics on many issues from opposing the military 
draft to rejecting the orders of moscow ministries on the economy 
i think in half a year well see that not only the baltic 
republics but some other republics first of all the caucasus 
republics will say they want real independence said 
sociologist peteris lakis a leader of the latvian peoples front 
political movement 
on may 6 representatives of peoples fronts from eight 
republics and several reform movements from russia met in kiev to 
organize a union of democratic forces to help republics quit the 
ussr and to ensure the empire disbands peacefully said a 
statement from the ukrainian peoples front called rukh 
gorbachev has said he believes splitting up the soviet union 
would bring more violence than chinas cultural revolution of 
196676 he has pledged to prevent that but indicated he wants to 
avoid using force 
in sverdlovsk two weeks ago he told citizens some say let 
this empire fall apart while others say we need to restore 
order with an iron fist neither has any connection to serious 
policy 
regions across the lessthanunified soviet union are rejecting 
kremlin authority 
georgias parliament has demanded negotiations on independence 
proindependence parties are campaigning for seats in the 
republics parliament in hopes of duplicating the baltic activists 
twothirds majorities 
neighboring azerbaijan exploded into virtual armed revolt in 
january and remains under military control 
the armenian parliament has defied the kremlin and ordered 
local draftees to remain in armenia to work on rebuilding areas 
wrecked by the 1988 earthquake 
a proindependence political party has formed in the ukrainian 
agricultural and industrial heartland where nationalism is most 
feared by moscow activists in lvov won control of the city council 
in a recent election and raised the yellow and skyblue ukrainian 
national flag over city hall 
in moldavia mircha snegur won the presidency from communist 
party chief pyotr luchinsky with the backing of those who favor 
greater autonomy or independence he opposes gorbachevs blockade 
of lithuania 
on the opposite end of the country sakhalin island is planning 
economic reforms including selling land to farmers according to 
moscow news 
even the russian republics legislature will consider a 
sovereignty resolution at the session beginning may 16 the extent 
of support for it is not clear but the baltic republics started 
their moves toward independence with constitutional amendments 
claiming sovereignty and the right to reject national laws in their 
territory 
gorbachev has not indicated willingness to abandon his demand 
that lithuania withdraw its march 11 declaration of independence 
before any negotiations begin 
he is calling for a new soviet federation in which all republics 
would have greater autonomy new legislation provides a mechanism 
for republics to secede but only after a long waiting period 
in several difficult periods of his five years in power 
gorbachev has taken unexpected steps that not only solved the 
immediate problem but carried him well beyond it 
until december he rejected the idea of multiparty politics he 
suddenly threw his support behind the idea in january and by 
midfebruary had pushed the reform through 
baltic leaders and western experts on soviet nationalities say a 
new leap by gorbachev could ease the mounting pressure on moscow 
from the republics 
last month he was said to have offered estonia and latvia 
special status in a confederative soviet union if they 
would drop their demands for independence exactly what he meant is 
not clear 
lakis the latvian activist predicted gorbachev would be forced 
to negotiate and accept transformation of the country into a 
confederation of independent nations 
asked whether that meant the end of the soviet union he 
replied i think thats a necessity of history

snowy peaks of the pir panjal look 
down on dusty bazaars and winding alleys where young moslems speak 
of a holy war for kashmir 
voices muffled by brightly colored bandannas that cover their 
faces they pledge themselves to a freedomordeath struggle 
against a mighty indian army in what they call their homeland 
their goal is independence for jammukashmir the only 
predominantly moslem state in the overwhelmingly hindu nation of 
india 
leaders of the movement plan a governmentinexile as refugees 
fleeing across the mountains pitch tents on the pakistan side of 
the border the focus of periodic skirmishes and two wars 
the plotters of kashmirs jihad or holy war are short on 
weapons money and guerrilla training so they turn for help to 
their moslem brethren on another battlefield afghanistan 
there is no difference between the afghan jihad and the 
kashmir jihad said sheik rashid a rightwing opposition leader 
who has asked religious leaders in islams holiest cities to 
declare jihad in kashmir 
such a declaration would oblige all moslems to support a holy 
war 
both india and pakistan have claimed the former princely state 
of kashmir since independence from britain in 1947 they fought 
wars over the region in 1948 and 1965 and fears of another have 
arisen 
india accuses pakistan of arming training and harboring 
separatists in dozens of guerrilla camps along the border pakistan 
denies it and accuses india of using violent tactics against 
selfdetermination 
pakistani officials and militant leaders estimate up to 8000 
people have slipped across the border to what pakistan calls azad 
free kashmir since india cracked down on the jammukashmir 
separatist movement in january 
the militants said they were inspired by prime minister benazir 
bhuttos emotional pledge your blood is our blood and had 
expected to receive weapons money and training in guerrilla 
warfare in pakistan 
all they got the men said was food shelter and the right to 
speak their minds 
the cause we are fighting for is selfdetermination said 
ghulam mohammad safi our cause is a just cause a holy war but 
pakistan is doing nothing 
safi leads hezbulmujahedeen or party of islamic holy 
warriors the most militarily organized of six kashmiri groups 
based in muzaffarabad capital of azad kashmir 
pakistan supported the afghan resistance we expect something 
more said safi a 40yearold former schoolteacher who left 
jammukashmir in march the pakistan army didnt intervene in 
afghanistan we expect pakistan to wage war against india 
ms bhuttos government says it does not want another war with 
india and has called for negotiations the leader of the 
jammukashmir liberation front leader of the independence 
movement said any agreement reached without the consent of the 
kashmiris would be doomed 
we have our own agenda said raja muzaffar khan we are 
determined to win our freedom any way possible by any means 
possible 
he showed invoices for the purchase of 70000 worth of weapons 
and ammunition from tribal areas on the pakistanafghanistan border 
included was 1675 paid a smuggler to carry eight frenchmade 
machine guns to srinagar the jammukashmir summer capital and 
center of the separatist movement 
muzaffar khan said the weapons were bought with money from 
kashmiris living in the united states and europe and from arab 
countries 
well buy more as the need arises he said 
the militants have not been able to establish training camps 
but muzaffar khan said men were being taken into the dense mountain 
forests for instruction in small arms 
there are a lot of places where we can operate without the 
knowledge of either government he said muzaffar khan said his 
group was distributing instruction pamphlets on how to fire weapons 
and had made a demonstration videotape 
nearly 1500 men have gone to afghanistan for combat training 
with guerrillas who have spent 12 years trying to overthrow the 
sovietbacked government in kabul militant leaders said 
abdul qayyum president of azad kashmir said the leaders of 
afghan guerrilla groups had offered help but the offers were 
declined 
young men who wait in makeshift camps however are looking for 
support from gulbuddin hekmatyar the fundamentalist afghan 
guerrilla leader 
despite his fervent antiwest rhetoric hekmatyar has received 
most of the us and saudi weapons channeled to the guerrillas 
he said he had been in contact with all kashmiri groups but 
would not be specific 
many pakistanis fear muzaffarabad will become like peshawar the 
wild frontier town that serves as the staging area for afghan 
guerrillas 
slogans demanding give us freedom or we will take it are 
painted on nearly every wall and posters of slain militant leaders 
are plastered on buildings throughout the provincial capital 
qayyum said his government planned to shut down the 
jammukashmir liberation front which he called a nuisance 
engaged in terrorist acts but said that would be difficult because 
the government had only half the security forces it needed 
leaders of the militants are trying to draft a constitution 
form a common strategy and set up military planning and recruiting 
committees but appear as divided as the afgha resistance 
its one thing to sit in air conditioned offices and make 
lofty plans qayyum said they have no responsibility no code 
for the lives of other people 
you can teach an afghan how to handle a gun in an hour he 
said afghans are born militants its their nature its in 
their blood kashmiris have been pacificists over the centuries we 
dont know how to fight

the knights of columbus has pledged 3 million 
to help underwrite an antiabortion campaign by the nations roman 
catholic bishops 
the 15 millionmember roman catholic fraternal group announced 
its backing of the public relations campaign on sunday 
this effort is needed to set out the facts about abortion as a 
violation of human rights and counter the barrage of prochoice 
propaganda being generated by supporters of legalized abortion 
said supreme knight virgil c dechant 
the bishops decided months ago to hire the public relations firm 
hill amp knowlton and the wirthlin group a polling concern for help 
in presenting their stand against abortion the program is 
estimated to cost 5 million 
the bishops had said the program would be funded by outside 
sources the knights were the first group to announce they would 
cover part of the cost 
the gift will allow the program to begin in earnest said 
archbishop daniel c pilarczyk of cincinnati president of the 
national conference of catholic bishops 
the campaign will start with a public opinion poll then proceed 
with a public information effort said john berard a hill amp 
knowlton spokesman 
at their annual meeting in november the first since a supreme 
court ruling in a missouri case gave states greater leeway to 
restrict abortion the bishops declared abortion was the 
fundamental human rights issue of the day 
the public relations program was unanimously approved in march 
by the 50member administrative committee of the national 
conference of catholic bishops

to paraphrase those harried parents in 
the 1960 musical bye bye birdie whats the matter with college 
kids today 
how about fear of fatal sex soaring inflation debt anxiety 
and vague notions of the real world and thats just the start say 
college administrators who are trying to help by offering courses 
that ease graduating seniors into adulthood 
one such program the last six weeks is offered at 
assumption college a catholic school of 2000 students set amid 
rolling lawns and quiet woods until he signed on senior paul 
irish stared into the abyss of lifeaftergraduation and worried 
money was a big thing how you make ends meet getting a car 
getting an apartment said the 22yearold from auburn he knew 
he wanted to be a history teacher but he was sketchy on the 
details of adult survival 
i thought willpower was everything he said now he knows 
better 
the last six weeks is an optional noncredit course of 
structured latenight chat and pizza that gets into the 
nittygritty of the necessities like shelter and transportation 
such as how much they cost and how to avoid scams 
students learn about picking a career and shopping the job 
market from writing a resume to dealing with sexual harassment and 
learning about corporate culture the last class is about getting 
the most out of saying goodbye to college friends 
why college students these days need such help isnt clear 
members of the me generation may have become so 
selfabsorbed they forgot to look around suggested brian mccoy 
assistant director of residential life at assumption he helped 
design the program 
students dont explore as much as they used to mccoy said 
schools also feel pressure to do better said john n gardner a 
vice chancellor at the university of south carolina in columbia 
a number of corporate leaders are very unhappy about what 
were producing he said this year were spending 110 billion 
on higher education for 132 million people thats about onethird 
of what we spend on national defense 
there is a tremendous increased public pressure for 
accountability in colleges and universities 
one result is that gardner has focused his attention on the 
transitions into and out of college in march he organized a 
national conference in atlanta called the senior year 
experience to look at what schools are doing about it 
regis college in weston offers a course in leadership for 
students planning management careers carroll college in waukesha 
wis sends its seniors to work as consultants to businesses to get 
them past job shock seniors at the university of hartford can 
take a course called pluralism revisited to expose them to the 
diverse world they are about to enter 
unlike college kids in the days of bye bye birdie graduates 
these days have a harder world to take on gardner said 
sex can kill he said it costs more money to buy a home 
there are far fewer barriers for women and minorities but on the 
other hand there are more personal threats to your health and more 
violence 
students are graduating with staggering debt you add that all 
up and college graduates are a lot more anxious and they count on a 
lot fewer certainties than their parents 
marianne tavares works in human resources at waters 
chromatography in nearby of milford and encounters naive college 
grads all the time the ones who make her chuckle say they intend 
to be managers making 40000 in 18 months 
more troubling are those who when asked how they would solve a 
conflict with a coworker say they would take it to the boss 
thats where we see the negative side tavares said they 
mistakenly believe the company is going to take care of them 
youre going to be their parent

the booming metropolitan area is getting 
tired of latenight carousers drunken boaters and people who stand 
in traffic collecting donations for what they say is charity 
mayor bill frederick and the city council have scheduled public 
hearings in the next two weeks to deal with some of the residents 
gripes 
city officials are particularly concerned about the growing 
number of people approaching drivers for money complaints have 
come from motorists shopkeepers police and homeowners 
some officials want to ban the practice contending it is 
dangerous and looks bad to visitors to this tourist area where 
disney world is situated 
weve got no clue as to what some of these charities are 
the mayor said at a council meeting last week we dont know 
where the money goes 
some of the solicitors are hired out of unemployment lines 
others answer classified ads and make 4 to 6 an hour still 
others are volunteers 
in nearby apopka police chief tom collins said he thinks some 
of the tshirted solicitors are merely panhandling 
theyre standing in the middle of the road he said i 
think its too dangerous what would be the liability if one of 
these people got hit 
orlando and other communities in orange seminole and osceola 
counties issue hundreds of permits to nonprofit groups and 
charities but only to a few that collect at intersections 
in most of central florida police can stop collecting only if 
it poses a danger or impedes traffic 
some officials and collectors for charitable groups such as 
easter seals and drugeducation foundations say a large portion of 
their money comes from such activities 
margaret fowler director of the lighthouse mission a shelter 
for homeless men said she opposes a ban 
also high on orlandos list of gripes are people carousing 
downtown after 2 am and those driving boats too fast on lakes 
frederick and several commissioners said they have heard complaints 
about reckless and drunken boating 
the city council wants to ban drinking on board boats and bar 
boaters from going faster than 35 mph during the day and 20 mph at 
night some lakes in orlando have speed limits but there is no 
citywide limit 
some patrons of downtown bars repeatedly break the law 
especially early in the morning police said 
they come out and they drink they buy dope they urinate on 
cars there is a massive problem said city attorney bob hamilton 
a proposed ordinance would force bars to close down at 2 am 
when they stop serving liquor instead of one or two hours later 
police chief danny wilson said the carousers do not project 
the kind of image we want to have for downtown 
the orlando metropolitan area largely undeveloped a few decades 
ago tripled in population from 1960 to nearly 1 million in 1988

the politically charged issue of flag burning 
is again before the supreme court as the justices hold an 
extraordinary session to study a federal law intended to protect 
old glorys physical integrity 
todays oral arguments on the constitutionality of the flag 
protection act of 1989 marked the first time in nine years the 
justices held such a session after april 
they are reviewing rulings by federal judges in washington and 
seattle who said the law violates the freedom of expression 
protection granted by the first amendment the law was challenged 
by demonstrators who burned american flags in the two cities 
the political stakes are high 
the court is expected to rule before the end of its current 
term probably in late june or early july if the law is struck 
down a proposed constitutional amendment to protect the flag 
almost certainly would become a leading issue in congressional and 
state legislative races this fall 
while the bush administration is defending the law president 
bush and republican leaders have said they would prefer a 
constitutional amendment to ban flag burning which would be 
unnecessary if the justices uphold the law 
the justice department in a written brief to the court said 
it is the physical assault and accompanying violation of the 
flags physical integrity not robust and uninhibited debate 
that occasion the injury that our society should not be called upon 
to bear 
department lawyers said the court owes congress special 
deference in this case because an equal branch of government has 
determined that flag burning can be outlawed without violating 
freedom of speech 
lawyers for the demonstrators challenging the law said their 
clients consider flag burning an essential element of their 
political expression because for them the flag represents not 
glory but oppression 
they also said flag desecration is an american tradition the 
united states flag was born of a desecration the lawyers said 
george washington in 1776 defaced a british flag by 
ordering sewn upon it 13 red and white stripes 
and the attorneys added the united states should make it clear 
the worlds leading democracy stands with those who want more 
freedom last year when the people of eastern europe rose up to 
protest oppressive communist regimes they carried national flags 
desecrated by excised centers the lawyers said 
democratic congressional leaders hoping to head off a battle 
over amending the constitution were the prime sponsors of the flag 
protection act 
the law was passed after the supreme court touched off a 
political firestorm in june 1989 by striking down a texas statute 
that banned flag desecration 
the 54 ruling said burning the flag as a form of political 
protest is protected by the constitutions free speech guarantees 
supporters of the federal law say it differs from the texas law 
because the federal act does not single out flag burning as a means 
of expression the federal law forbids defiling or destruction of 
the flag for any purpose except to destroy a soiled or tattered 
flag 
the texas law specifically banned flag burning that seriously 
offends others

prosecutors consider dorothea montalvo 
puente a rare breed a female serial killer but theyll first have 
to show that the nine boarders the landlady allegedly poisoned were 
victims of foul play 
a judge is deciding whether there is sufficient evidence to hold 
the 61yearold woman for trial on charges of murdering seven 
tenants found buried in her boardinghouse yard and two others whose 
bodies turned up elsewhere 
the preliminary hearing began in municipal court on april 27 a 
year and a half after her arrest 
in eight of the cases a cause of death was never determined 
whether the nine people were even homicides has not been 
established the boarders dead for weeks to years were too 
decomposed for autopsies to tell what killed them 
assistant district attorney george williamson is trying to show 
that puente who has a record of administering stupefying drugs to 
people she intended to rob poisoned the nine people over a 
sixyear period for their social security and other benefit checks 
she could face the death penalty if convicted 
but her lawyers contend the tenants ranging in age from 52 to 
80 and most poor and alcoholic could have died from a variety of 
medical problems among their ailments were a brain tumor lung 
disease heart disease and diabetes 
those people all died a natural death defense attorney 
peter vlautin said recently 
more than 100 witnesses are expected to testify by the time the 
hearing ends in three to four weeks 
i have not killed anyone the checks i cashed yes puente 
said in a tv interview after her arrest 
on thursday a jailhouse informant testified that puente 
admitted she poisoned her tenants because she had gotten a little 
greedy 
michelle crowl whose cell was two doors from puentes said the 
landlady told her in late 1988 or early 1989 that she killed her 
tenants by giving them an overdose of prescription drugs mixed with 
alcohol 
defense attorneys accused crowl of lying to buy her freedom in 
exchange for her testimony prosecutors agreed to release her from 
jail on probation and not seek a prison term for a parole violation 
on a drug conviction 
other testimony by an exconvict and a doctor portrays puente as 
a woman who had extensive knowledge about medications and used 
deception to obtain them 
former tenants described puente alternately as a devoted 
motherly caretaker and a hottempered woman who had a penchant for 
swearing and sought control of some boarders money 
in only one death was a cause ever listed the 1982 death of a 
61yearold man from an apparent codeine overdose was considered 
accidental until investigators began digging up seven bodies from 
puentes yard 
a prescription tranquilizer flurazepam sold under the trade 
name dalmane was detected in all seven bodies doctors have 
testified that it can be toxic if taken in large enough doses in 
combination with other drugs or alcohol 
a total of nine other drugs were found in the boardinghouse 
bodies 
their doctors and fellow boarders have testified most of them 
were heavy drinkers and many took prescription drugs one tenant 
according to her doctor was a prescription drug abuser who 
preferred valium

a presidential commission on terrorism is 
expected to call for changes in federal aviation security 
operations without laying blame for the bombing of pan am flight 
103 
the sevenmember commission headed by former labor secretary ann 
mclaughlin is giving its report to president bush on tuesday 
followed by a briefing at the white house for relatives of some of 
the 270 people killed in the dec 21 1988 bombing over lockerbie 
scotland 
bush appointed the panel after family members demanded a 
congressional investigation into government actions before and 
after the attack the relatives withdrew the demand pending outcome 
of the ninemonth presidential inquiry 
investigators in britain say the boeing 747 was downed by a 
plastic explosive concealed in a radio cassette player by still 
unidentified terrorists 
the terrorism commission which includes four members of 
congress and three former government figures steered away from 
criminal investigation of the lockerbie bombing it has tried to 
determine whether errors by any federal agency the airline or 
others might have allowed it to occur 
federal aviation administration officials speaking on condition 
of anonymity said they expect the report to be critical of the 
agency which has worldwide responsibility for the security of us 
airlines 
aides to the commission have said investigators found no 
smoking gun that would allow the report to lay blame for the 
bombing but during hearings commission members strongly 
criticized the faa and pan am for security flaws and the state 
department for poor handling of victims relatives after the 
incident 
ms mclaughlin met with transportation secretary samuel skinner 
last week to brief him on the report but a department spokesman 
said there was no indepth discussion and that skinner did not get 
a copy of the report 
a congressional source said the panel recommends a revamp of the 
faas security office to give it higher visibility 
its pretty hard on the faa and calls for some changes in faa 
operations said the source who characterized the report in 
advance only on condition of anonymity 
the faa said thursday it had removed raymond salazar as civil 
aviation security chief putting the office under his superior 
monte belger associate administrator for aviation standards 
salazar who will take over an faa management training facility 
in florida was criticized by commission members for lapses in 
security before and after the pan am bombing 
victims relatives who had called for his resignation 
applauded his removal but faa administrator james busey said 
salazars departure was not connected with the imminent release of 
the report 
commission members have raised concerns about the governments 
policy of not informing passengers of most terrorist threats 
victims relatives claim government employees avoided the flight 
because of warnings posted at the us embassy in moscow but 
commission investigators said last month they found no evidence of 
cancellations by such passengers 
some family members have braced themselves for disappointment 
based on early indications of the reports contents 
one family member said there were rumors that the report would 
call for a halt to installation of sophisticated thermal neutron 
analysis tna bomb detection devices ordered by the federal 
aviation administration 
halting the installation of tna bombdetection units in 
airports would send the right signal to terrorists and the wrong 
signal to the traveling public said ted reina whose daughter 
jocelyn was a flight attendant on flight 103 
chairwoman mclaughlin at the commissions last hearing in 
april criticized the faa for ordering carriers to buy the 1 
million machines which airlines say have not been sufficiently 
tested but commission member rep james oberstar dminn has 
welcomed installation of the detectors although he says the 
government should pay for them 
the panel held five public hearings in washington and traveled 
to europe for interviews with aviation and airline officials in 
france germany and britain flight 103 originated in frankfurt and 
switched to a different airliner in london before leaving for new 
york on a path over lockerbie 
other commission members besides ms mclaughlin and oberstar 
include sens frank lautenberg dnj and alfonse damato 
rny rep john paul hammerschmidt dark retired air force 
gen thomas c richards and edward hidalgo an attorney and former 
assistant navy secretary 
at least two other airliner bombings have occurred since the 
lockerbie disaster killing 171 people aboard a french uta jetliner 
in september and 107 on a colombian jet in november

the collapse of the massachusetts miracle 
touted by michael dukakis in his failed 1988 presidential campaign 
is giving republicans their best hope in years to take the 
governors office 
but democrats are far from doomed and a democratic former 
attorney general who served with dukakis now appears to be the 
favorite to succeed him after three terms as governor dukakis is 
not seeking reelection 
republicans who have been locked out of the governors office 
for 16 years are fighting to end what they call oneparty rule 
in the state 
the gops prospects rose as a slump in the state economy and a 
slowdown in tax collections led to burgeoning deficits dukakis and 
his fellow democrats got the blame for mismanaging the states 
finances 
dukakis and his presidential bid remain central issues in the 
governors race this was apparent last week as the state house 
debated and sent to the senate a 12 billion tax bill designed to 
improve the states shaky finances 
in 1988 this legislature was in the process of mortgaging the 
future of massachusetts said house minority leader steven 
pierce the republican partys endorsed candidate for governor 
political observers say with dukakis absent from the race 
republicans must campaign against his policies and link them to the 
democratic party as a whole 
his name wont be on the ballot but thats the name people 
will see when they look at these candidates said todd domke a 
republican political consultant the only way they can vote 
against dukakis is to vote against the democratic slate 
the democratic gubernatorial hopefuls too have distanced 
themselves from dukakis as they prepare for next months state 
convention which will determine the candidates who will appear on 
septembers primary ballot 
former attorney general francis x bellotti who leads in public 
opinion polls has been a frequent critic of current policies even 
though he was a past dukakis supporter 
bellottis main democratic rival lt gov evelyn murphy has 
been a loyal deputy to dukakis but also has pointed out 
disagreements 
the other two democratic candidates have not worried about 
tactful breaks 
john silber on leave as boston university president is a 
sharptongued conservative whose support has grown recently 
improving his chances to make the primary ballot political 
analysts say he might be drawing support away from republicans 
state rep john flood who is considered a long shot warned 
about excessive state spending at the height of the miracle 
years 
on the republican side pierce will face former us attorney 
william weld in september pierce won the partys endorsement at 
the state gop convention in march 
some political observers say that as november approaches an 
antidukakis campaign will become less viable 
michael dukakis is continuing to fade from public view fade 
as a target said dan payne a democratic consultant hes not 
accommodating them 
pretty soon they will realize the democratic candidates in the 
race now are the ones they have to take shots at he said 
republicans however saw the debate over the tax increase as 
another opportunity to boost their chances and knock democrats for 
the states financial slide 
i think this is going to be the dominant issue of the 
campaign pierce said of the tax package 
of the major democratic gubernatorial contenders however only 
murphy reacted favorably to the tax proposal that didnt stop 
republicans from seizing the chance to criticize democratic 
policies 
they have to show momentum now payne said

thousands of young muscovites suffer from head 
lice and a shortage of disinfectants leaves no remedy except 
combing their hair with vinegar and taking a shower a newspaper 
reported 
last year in the soviet capital sanitation clinics reported 
that only 4000 children sought treatment for lice moskovskaya 
pravda the city communist party newspaper said sunday 
and how many more did not seek help it asked saying 
parents embarrassment and ignorance about the pests make that 
number only the tip of the iceberg 
statistics on the problem were not published until 1986 leaving 
health authorities unarmed in the battle against lice the 
newspaper said 
moscow does not have enough sanitary stations medicinal baths 
or public health instructors to battle the lice said a frolova a 
senior scientific worker of the allunion scientific research 
institute of preventative toxicology and disinfection 
the government recalled soaps containing the pesticide ddt 
which is harmful to the environment and banned in the united 
states and did not offer any adequate substitutes she said 
civilized countries have all kinds of methods shampoos 
aerosols lotions she said noting that moscow pharmacies dont 
have the effective treatments that are available in the west or 
even in hungary 
our pharmaceutical industry is in the stone age said t 
borisenko deputy chief of the supply and sales department of the 
pharmatsia concern that distributes drugs to the citys 
pharmacies and clinics 
one effective medication that is available in hungary is being 
supplied for the first time to some city clinics and childrens 
hospitals he said two years ago there was a demand for 8000 
bottles of the medication and this year at least 50000 bottles 
will be needed borisenko said 
the problem becomes acute after children are sent off to summer 
camps and return to the city carrying the parasites 
until more medication is available moskovskaya pravda advised 
its readers to use combs with cotton wads soaked in vinegar then 
take a shower and put on a change of clothes 
see how simple it is the newspaper added sarcastically 
noting general shortages of goods if of course you can find 
combs cotton vinegar and soap

kansas has enacted a law to punish 
animalrights activists for entering and damaging farms and 
research laboratories 
a humane society official however said the law will hamper 
investigations into abuses 
gov mike hayden signed the measure over the weekend calling it 
one of the first of its kind in the nation it properly provides 
increased penalties for damage to research facilities and 
agriculture operations he said 
the law was prompted by militant actions around the nation 
including vandalism and theft of animals 
under the law entering farms ranches or research operations 
and damaging property are punishable by up to 10 years in prison 
and a 10000 fine 
wendell maddox regional director for the humane society of the 
united states said an amendment barring individuals from entering 
an animal operation to take photos will make it difficult for his 
group to document abuses 
its more than obvious their intention is to keep us out of 
puppy mills he said the socalled puppy mills which raise 
puppies for sale have been criticized by animalrights groups for 
unhealthy conditions 
hayden said the law does not conflict with humane societies 
authority to deal with abuse the republican signed a law two years 
ago aimed at stopping puppy mills and said he supports efforts to 
close down these disgraceful operations 
but maddox said the act will make organizations such as his more 
dependent on assistance from law enforcement agencies 
law enforcement historically doesnt consider animal abuse a 
priority he said unless we gather evidence nothing gets 
done

base in south korea 
nine days earlier gunmen killed marine gunnery sgt john 
fredette near subic bay naval base 50 miles west of the capital 
fredette 34 was on temporary duty from the marine air station at 
el toro calif 
although no one has claimed responsibility for the three 
killings us and many filipino officials believe the rebels were 
responsible 
all three killings were believed timed to todays start of talks 
on the future of us military bases which the guerrillas want 
closed 
although the rebels have repeatedly threatened to kill 
americans us officials expected them to try to assassinate a 
senior diplomat or military officer 
they cited the april 1989 assassination of us army col james 
nick rowe a decorated vietnam war veteran who was ambushed and 
slain by the rebels on his way to work at the joint us military 
assistance group in suburban quezon city 
rowe was a quality target said one us official speaking 
on condition of anonymity they dont get the same propaganda 
value from killing an enlisted man 
in october 1987 rebels killed two enlisted us airmen and a 
retired us air force sergeant near clark that triggered a 
backlash among the filipino population in the area after the us 
military temporarily banned americans from leaving post to shop in 
local stores 
the quality target theory was also based on recent statements 
from the rebels indicating they would be selective in deciding whom 
to kill 
in march rebel commander romulo kintanar said the guerrillas 
would be highly selective in launching military operations in the 
cities 
but all three recent victims were lowranking enlisted men who 
were not even permanently assigned in the philippines it appeared 
they were selected at random simply because of nationality 
after fredettes slaying us officials suggested he may have 
been killed by mistake because the rebels thought he was an 
officer fredettes nickname was the colonel because of his 
maturity and bearing 
it is unlikely sundays victims were mistaken for officers 
the rebels have been fighting the philippine government for more 
than 21 years if they now are willing to kill any us service 
member the security implications are serious both for american 
and filipino authorities 
the united states maintains about 40000 troops defense 
department civilians and military dependents at the six bases some 
in rebel strongholds 
thousands more come temporarily for training at clark or aboard 
american warships that call at subic 
in addition the us embassy estimates 80000 to 100000 
american civilians live in the philippines protecting all of them 
is impossible 
we can provide good security for senior diplomats ranking 
officers people like that said one american official speaking 
on condition of anonymity but how do you protect every private 
faced with security threats the state department is considering 
increasing hazardous duty pay for embassy personnel diplomatic 
sources say the proposal is opposed by the defense department 
because it would not automatically cover service personnel 
the only way military personnel could receive extra compensation 
would be through awarding combat pay but that would mean most 
dependents would have to return to the united states 
a sizeable reduction in the american military community would 
undermine filipino support for the bases at a time when a new 
agreement on the installations is in doubt 
many filipinos who support the bases do so because of the 
estimated 1 billion they pump into the economy every year without 
large numbers of dependents many of whom live and shop on the 
local economy that figure would decline dramatically

is a 51star flag in americas future puerto 
rico could vote to become a state in two years under legislation 
pending in the house and backed by president bush 
the target date would be columbus day 1992 nearly 500 years 
since christopher columbus claimed the island for spain and almost 
100 years since the united states claimed it in the 
spanishamerican war 
i want it to become the 51st state bush said last week in a 
letter to rep robert lagomarsino ranking republican member on the 
interior subcommittee overseeing puerto rican affairs 
lagomarsino and subcommittee chairman ron de lugo the 
nonvoting delegate from the virgin islands introduced a bill 
thursday that calls for puerto ricans to hold a referendum in 1991 
to choose among statehood independence or continued commonwealth 
status with added authority 
similar legislation is pending in the senate 
de lugo says he will hold hearings in june in new york to 
determine whether puerto ricans living in the united states should 
be allowed to vote with the islanders in the referendum 
if statehood wins the 33 million puerto ricans would comprise 
the 26th most populous state and send six or seven house members to 
congress in addition to two senators 
in a poll published in february 43 percent of puerto ricans 
favored statehood 36 percent favored enhanced commonwealth status 
5 percent called for independence and 9 percent said they did not 
know a similar poll six months earlier had found 41 percent 
favored statehood 
both recent polls showed a switch from a year earlier when 
enhanced commonwealth was the single most popular choice 
status has been an obsession on the island since spain ruled 
after more 400 years as a colony puerto rico won autonomy and full 
representation in the spanish parliament in 1897 
the next year it lost all selfgovernance when the united 
states took possession through the treaty of paris 
the people were in political limbo until 1917 when they were 
made us citizens 
while that meant they could be drafted into the us armed 
forces and send delegates to the political conventions they never 
have voted in presidential elections and do not have voting 
representation in congress 
how can we applaud the exciting and momentous movements toward 
freedom in eastern europe latin america and elsewhere while 
refusing to grant our own citizens the right to 
selfdetermination bush asked in his letter 
until last week it looked as if congress was trying to avoid 
the issue 
the legislation was approved by the senate energy and natural 
resources committee but had to go to the senate finance committee 
as well because of tax issues involved hearings have been held 
there but no vote has been scheduled 
de lugo said that under a previous arrangement he was waiting 
for the bill to clear the senate before taking it up in the house 
but with time running out on the congressional session he said 
the house decided to go forward with its own bill 
the issue is complicated by financial considerations including 
special federal tax exemptions for businesses on the island that 
would have to change with statehood some people believe the change 
would cause business to leave hurting puerto ricans financially 
the senate bill states the steps that would be taken to make 
puerto rico a state enhanced commonwealth or independent 
our bill would require the development of legislation to 
implement winning status next year said de lugo final federal 
action could not take effect without another vote by puerto rico 
which would be in july 1992 
the status development would then be effective in october 
1992 de lugo said

last weeks agriculture department forecast of 
a bumper 1990 winter wheat crop has a pretty good chance of being 
correct 
based on surveys just before may 1 the departments 
agricultural statistics board estimated production at slightly more 
than 209 billion bushels a 44 percent increase from the 
weatherdamaged 1989 harvest 
and since winter wheat makes up about threefourths of the us 
allwheat total a fairly normal yield of springplanted wheat 
should put the nations relatively skimpy supply back into shape 
the board a part of the departments national agricultural 
statistics service takes pains to explain the crop surveys and 
their accuracy 
revised estimates are published each month during the growing 
season of specific crops by august or so it should be fairly 
clear what the total us wheat output will be this year 
the may 1 forecast has been below the final estimate seven 
times and above three times last weeks report said this does 
not imply that the may 1 winter wheat forecast this year is likely 
to understate or overstate final production 
a year ago the may estimate of 1989 winter wheat production was 
slightly more than 143 billion bushels the final 1989 figure 
included in last weeks report was a bit more than 145 billion 
bushels 
in a related supplyanddemand report issued by the departments 
world agricultural outlook board analysts projected based on 
yield trends an assumption of normal weather and other factors a 
total us wheat harvest this year of more than 269 billion 
bushels 
that would be the thirdlargest us wheat crop on record 
exceeded by the 1981 and 1982 harvests of 279 billion and 277 
billion bushels respectively 
a year ago the same outlook board which represents the 
departments economic research service and the foreign agricultural 
service projected a 1989 total wheat production of 205 billion 
bushels the final was less than 204 billion 
the usda winter wheat estimate announced last thursday afternoon 
was substantially higher than most private forecasters and 
commodity traders expected many of those believed the departments 
allwheat projection would be in the range of 23 billion to 25 
billion bushels 
one maverick however was sparks commodities inc of memphis 
tenn which the week before forecast the 1990 wheat crop at 27 
billion bushels almost exactly matching the usda projection 
announced on may 10

the 1988 drought did more than ravage crops 
send commodity prices upward and put livestock on expensive diets 
drought also chewed into farm productivity says the agriculture 
department as the economists say that happens when output drops 
faster than input 
overall said the departments economic research service farm 
production output dropped 77 percent in 1988 the total 
quantity of labor machinery and land used in 1988 inputs 
declined 16 percent 
there are other inputs too but the three basic groups 
accounted for almost 69 percent of the total in 1988 others 
include feed seed livestock taxes and interest and chemicals 
when all the factors are compared and expressed as units in an 
index the report showed that 1988 farm production per unit of 
input productivity dropped 62 percent 
expressed another way us farm productivity in 1988 averaged 
120 percent of a 1977 base used for comparison that was down from 
128 percent in 1987 
this decline reflected drought conditions rather than 
technical deterioration the report said 
regionally the figures showed farm productivity in 1988 dropped 
168 percent in the corn belt 152 percent in the northern plains 
and lake states 28 percent in the northeast and 22 percent in 
the mountain states 
productivity rose 136 percent in the mississippi delta 10 
percent in the southeast 71 percent in appalachia 18 percent in 
the southern plains and 07 percent in the pacific region

potted plants and other floriculture crops rose 6 percent in 1989

agriculture department 
all major groups except foliage plants had increased wholesale 
values the report said cut flowers increased 2 percent in 
value to 469 million potted flowering plants valued at 522 
million increased 3 percent 
but foliage plants dropped 1 percent in 1989 to 476 million 
the report said sales of bedding plants were estimated at a 
wholesale value of 867 million up 9 percent from 1988 the value 
of cut cultivated greens rose 9 percent to 988 million

one more step remains before uschilean 
relations can be normalized now that chile has agreed to pay 
compensation for the 1976 slaying in washington of a chilean 
opposition figure and his aide a us negotiator says 
the agreement in principle was concluded last week following 
talks between chilean and us negotiators in washington state 
department legal adviser abraham d sofaer said sunday 
he said the second step toward normalizing relations is to see 
that the killers of chilean exile leader orlando letelier and his 
aide ronni moffitt are brought to justice letelier and moffitt 
died in a car bombing in washington 
once we have both those things done relations between both 
these two countries can be completely normalized sofaer said 
so it is very significant it has taken us years to get here 
the agreement with the new government of chilean president 
patricio aylwin marks a reversal of the stance taken by aylwins 
predecessor rightwing gen augusto pinochet who seized power in 
the 1973 overthrow 
aylwin who defeated a pinochetbacked candidate in elections to 
replace the military government has promised full cooperation with 
us officials in the case aylwin took power in march 
sofaer underscored that chile would make payments without 
conceding any government liability for the death of letelier who 
served in the government of salvador allende a marxist president 
who died in a 1973 coup in chile 
we have agreed in principle to arbitration in effect to set 
an amount of compensation to be paid to those people damaged by the 
bombing he said the amount would be set by an international 
tribunal 
at the time of the sept 21 1976 bombing letelier and ms 
moffitt were working for the institute for policy studies the 
survivors include leteliers widow and ms moffitts husband 
a federal judge in 1980 concluded that the pinochet government 
and its agents were responsible for the deaths of letelier and 
moffitt and ordered the chilean government to pay 29 million in 
compensation to the survivors 
but the relatives have been unable to collect and the united 
states is expected to ask the tribunal to award at least the 29 
million and 10 years interest the new york times reported sunday 
in chile the issue of reparations has been seen as key battle 
between aylwin and pinochet who remains as army commander and has 
promised to block human rights investigations of the military 
letelier served as ambassador to washington and was foreign 
minister during the allende rule in exile after the coup he 
became a severe critic of pinochets rule 
sofaer said the issue of civil payments is wholly separate from 
criminal cases in the united states against former officials of the 
chilean secret police indicted in the killings

tom porter wears his 
hair in a ponytail refuses to send his children to school and 
disdains running water electricity and democracy 
porter whose friends know him by his tribal name 
sakowkenonkwas is a mohawk chief the 46yearold carpenter has 
built a house on the reservation and his family lives off produce 
from a large garden they speak iroquois 
but modern practices have intruded 
a 9monthold dispute over casino gambling has torn apart the 
9000member reservation culminating in two slayings may 1 
porter his choctaw indian wife and their six children were among 
more than 500 people driven from their homes to a refugee center in 
cornwall ontario 
ive never seen this in my life porter said i never 
dreamed people would do this to other people a true mohawk doesnt 
carry a shotgun he doesnt bring dissension he tries to remove 
turmoil 
since the killings canadian and new york police have sealed off 
the reservation with roadblocks keeping nonresidents out and 
effectively closing the casinos along with many other businesses 
on mohawk land 
four mohawks were arrested by canadian police sunday in an 
investigation of one of the slayings but no charges were 
immediately filed 
supporters of gambling say the six casinos and bingo parlors on 
the american side of the reservation produce jobs and revenue 
busloads of visitors are lured to the gaming houses by slot 
machines roulette and craps 
but opponents such as porter say gambling has brought drugs 
guns and prostitution and is destroying an old and valued lifestyle 
porter was appointed by the tribes elders to the council of 
traditional chiefs one of three fractious councils governing the 
reserve straddling the canadian border 
he wants the casinos closed elected tribal leaders have said 
they will hold a referendum on the gambling issue sometime in june 
but porter is disdainful of democracy believing people should 
be led by those chosen for their character and goodness 
i was raised with the old mohawk values and ive always 
embraced those teachings in life he said 
his house lacks running water electricity a television or a 
telephone many mohawks in contrast have factory jobs off the 
reservation tv sets in their homes and satellite dishes in their 
yards 
when i was a child i cherished serenity porter said i 
dont want electricity and phones because i dont want to bring the 
trappings of the fast life into my life 
such modern comforts also have brought alcoholism drug abuse 
and other social ills porter said

an education researcher says the problem in 
american schools is waste not a shortage of cash 
american schools actually are shortchanging the nation by 
wasting some 100 billion a year through sprawling bureaucracy and 
outmoded technology lewis j perelman of the hudson institute 
said sunday 
in a rebuttal to those who claim increased education spending 
will improve student achievement he said more spending on more 
of the same education will waste resources weaken the us economy 
and undermine the nations global competitiveness 
in a report released sunday the acanemia deception 
perelman said the united states spent 3310 to educate each 
student from preschool to grade 12 in 1985 the expenditure is 
second only to switzerland which spent 3683 the figures are 
based on a special 1985 index of purchasing power of industrial 
nations 
the statistics contradict a recent analysis by the economic 
policy institute that said the united states trailed 13 other 
industrial nations in spending on elementary and secondary 
education 
the epi recommended adding at least 20 billion per year to the 
nations kindergarten through 12th grade spending 
among perelmens recommendations were 
every education and training institution organization and 
program in the united states should set aside at least 1 percent of 
its gross revenues for investment in research and development the 
funds could be pooled in a common fund administered by a new 
national institute for learning technology 
the goal of the new investment in educational initiative should 
be to double the productivity of us education 
every student in america should have access to a distance 
learning network by the year 2001 he explained that teachers can 
instruct students across the state or country at the same time with

north korea today said it will release 
the remains of some us soldiers killed in the korean war and a 
south korean newspaper reported washington plans to upgrade 
contacts with the communist north 
chosun ilbo a leading newspaper quoted anonymous sources as 
saying washington wants to include diplomats up to the 
ambassadorial level and will carry on such contacts in new 
unspecified locations 
north koreas official korean central news agency monitored in 
tokyo said the pyongyang government will return some unearthed 
remains of us soldiers to the united states through us 
congressmen at the border village of panmunjom may 28 
there was no immediate comment from washington on the reports 
north korean officials meeting last month with us diplomats in 
beijing offered to return the remains of five us soldiers killed 
in the korean war japans jiji news agency reported saturday 
united states diplomats reportedly have met north korean 
officials in beijing eight times since early last year in efforts 
to persuade the north to open its doors and improve relations with 
capitalist south korea 
washington and north korean leaders have no diplomatic 
relations and the united states maintains 43000 troops in rival 
south korea to deter an attack from the north 
according to us defense department figures about 8200 us 
soldiers were unaccounted for at the end of the war with 345 of 
those listed as possible prisoners of war 
north korea is one of the last hardline communist states and 
one of the most isolated countries in the world it has not 
instituted political and economic reforms such as those in eastern 
europe 
foreign minister choi hojoong has made a personal appeal that 
washington be prudent in its contacts with north korea 
according to yonhap south koreas the national news agency 
choi met last week with richard solomon the us assistant 
secretary of state for asian and pacific affairs yonhap said the 
two discussed north koreas return of the remains of us soldiers 
killed in the 195053 korean war 
choi reaffirmed the governments stance that prudence should 
prevail in that such contacts would contribute to easing tension on 
the korean peninsula yonhap said quoting an anonymous 
government official 
it said solomon reaffirmed washington would not positively 
respond to north koreas call for improved ties unless it met a 
set of conditions 
it said solomon reaffirmed washington would not positively 
respond to north koreas call for improved ties unless it met a

these conditions included agreement for more confidence building 
measures in the demilitarized zone dividing north and south korea 
abandonment of terrorism and adherence to the safeguards clause in 
the nuclear nonproliferation treaty 
the united states imposed sanctions against north korea after 
the november 1987 bombing of a south korean airliner off burma 
allegedly by north korean agents the sanctions which included a 
ban on meetings between us and north korean officials were 
lifted just before the 1988 olympic games in seoul

share prices surged on the tokyo stock market 
monday and the dollar arrested an early fall against the japanese 
yen to close moderately lower 
the 225issue nikkei stock average rose 53051 points or 168 
percent to reach 3204265 points at the market close tokyos 
main barometer rose 53188 points friday 
the dollar closed the afternoon session at 15335 yen down 080 
yen from its finish friday at 15415 yen after starting at 15245 
the currency fluctuated between 15245 yen and 15390 yen 
the price of the benchmark 10year japanese government bonds 
rose 8769 points by 300 pm 2 am edt monday up from its 
friday close at 8740 percent their yield dropped to 7020 percent 
from 7080 percent 
exchange dealers attributed the dollars early retreat monday to 
its downswing in new york friday due partly to us government 
reports indicating the nations economy remains slow and 
inflationary pressures had been curbed 
a us labor department report released friday showed an 
unexpected 03 percent decline in april us wholesale prices 
coupled with a 06 percent decline in retail sales during the 
month both figures accelerated the dollars decline 
but in subsequent morning trading buy orders for the dollar 
appeared and it rebounded into the 153 yen range said toru kanai 
exchange analyst for new japan securities co 
despite the dollars continuous fall at the end of last week 
the demand for the us currency remained unexpectedly high kanai 
commented 
it is not so much that we are seeing a real decline in the 
dollar but rather a longterm adjustment he said 
an analyst for japans largest securities company nomura 
securities said the decline in interest rates abroad the rise in 
domestic bond prices and the rapid fall of the dollar led to the 
recent rises in stock prices 
stock prices were increasing all across the board monday 
morning though shares keyed to local demand attracted particular 
buyer interest the analyst said speaking on condition of 
anonymity 
the main reason for the bullishess of the tokyo market was that 
fears of inflation in the united states and europe have faded 
into the distance he said

in a mexico city airport address that the church was celebrating 
the feast of the virgin of fatima on may 13 
it is a very significant date for me because on a day like 
today nine years ago i felt in a particular way the maternal 
protection of mary the pope told hundreds of people seeing him 
off at the end of his second trip to mexico 
in curacao he urged residents to set a christian example to the 
thousands of tourists who visit every year and warned against 
materialism

if they limit their aspirations just to possessing consuming and 
enjoying the pontiff said

standards of living in the caribbean with a population of 147000 
it is the most populous of the five islands that make up the 
autonomous netherlands antilles chain

nine years ago at this precise moment there occurred one of 
the most incredible manifestations of hate against he who only 
preached love he said over the airplanes intercom at 917 am 
1117 am edt 
but at the same time there occurred a manifestation of the 
intervention of providence casaroli said providence not only

a navy computer expert ran a vast 39state 
male prostitution ring that recruited wellbuilt guys through 
an electronic network authorities said 
the ring advertising in gay magazines drew clients that 
included a priest and a policeman authorities said sunday police 
estimate at least 50 prostitutes and 300 patrons are involved but 
no identities were disclosed and no arrests made 
the ring was organized by james william dayton 44 a computer 
scientist at the naval avionics center in indianapolis who died of 
march 16 after suffering a heart attack at a tiffin ohio bed and 
breakfast authorities said he had been having sex with a man who 
wanted to join the network as a prostitute police said 
diana hogue spokeswoman for the naval avionics center said 
there is no indication dayton used computers at his job for the 
prostitution ring or that anyone else at the center was involved 
the center acquires and produces advanced electronics systems 
for the naval air systems command dayton did not have access to 
classified data she said 
daytons setup began to unravel after a sheriffs detective who 
investigated his death searched his car and found 140 pages of 
computergenerated job applications and photos of nude men 
authorities said 
investigators found evidence of an intricate computerized 
system for matching clients with prostitutes across the country in 
two canadian provinces in guam and in korea 
don smith a computer expert at indiana universitypurdue 
university at indianapolis helped police break the codes to gain 
access to that network 
smith determined that dayton had used the computer signon blue 
boy and was the owneroperator of muscles usa and muscles midwest 
ive asked police to go after the most prolific prostitutes as 
targets now were going to start with the most active ones and we 
will ask the patrons to cooperate said marion county prosecutor 
stephen goldsmith 
he said authorities will try to arrange for aids testing of the 
patrons 
the investigation began in 1985 but hit many deadends said 
andrew stoner a police spokesman it had builtin barriers that 
prevented undercover officers from infiltrating the system he

your highway dollars are at work in 
washington but theyre not necessarily building roads and bridges 
more people are complaining that the dollars coming from the 
91centagallon federal gasoline tax and other user fees are 
maintaining a rickety budget machine instead 
on capitol hill the bush administration and congressional 
analysts are trying to explain why more available highway money 
isnt being spent for its intended purposes 
our roads and highways are victims of a highway mistrust 
fund sen harry reid dnev charged at a hearing last week 
fellow senate nevadan democrat richard h bryan has introduced 
legislation that would require 3 billion extra in projects to be 
approved in each of the next three years 
the highway account of the federal highway trust fund takes in 
between 13 billion and 14 billion a year from the gasoline tax a 
15centpergallon diesel fuel tax and other user fees part of the 
fund is used for mass transit projects 
spending from the highway or similar funds such as for 
aviation counts in figuring the federal deficit likewise 
revenues count against it 
rep bob mcewen rohio has introduced a bill that would remove 
the highway fund from overall budget calculations 
the fund began with the federalaid highway act of 1956 which 
created the nations interstate highways the law specified that 
the 75 percent to 90 percent federal share of the staterun 
projects be financed by the socalled highway user fees 
congressional public works committees and the department of 
transportation authorizes projects dots federal highway 
administration apportions the socalled contract authority yearly 
under a formula this authority has a dollar amount 
but at the same time the spending committees grant obligation 
authority which tells the states how much they can really commit 
themselves to spend states pay the bills for projects then ask the 
federal government for reimbursement so there is a lag between 
when a project is authorized and when the federal check comes in 
the mail 
as a result of efforts to regulate outlays the administration 
and then later congress put ceilings on obligations an unused cash 
balance of 11 billion built up and has remained at that level for 
years 
both the general accounting office and the congressional budget 
office say about 7 billion to 8 billion of that balance could be 
committed this year based on projected income to the account 
gao the auditing arm of congress adds that 34 billion would 
be a more reasonable amount with the remainder set aside for a 
rainy day 
but a real problem is interest 
the unspent balances earn about 1 billion a year in interest 
the result of the treasury borrowing against the account the fund 
has accumulated 156 billion in interest since 1956 the 
transportation department says 47 billion of that interest has 
been spent the remaining 11 billion equals the cash balance 
if spending is increased to use more of the interest that is 
accruing the treasury will have to pay the resulting bills kate 
l moore an assistant transportation secretary testified last 
week 
the administrations 1991 budget proposal calls for spending 
300 million of the 900 million in interest credited to the 
highway account future interest spending has yet to be proposed

the rubble has been swept away from a 
workingclass neighborhood after a car bomb killed 15 people but 
the anger remains among residents who blame both drug traffickers 
and the united states for the carnage wracking their country 
stunned residents coul not understand why their neighborhood had 
suddenly become a target 
its an evil group of people who would attack poor people for 
no reason said luis benavides a glass worker whose small 
twostory house in the quirigua neighborhood was severely damaged 
by the bomb 
how can we try to understand such madness whoever they are 
they are attacking our families and our children in the middle of 
the street said benavides who shares the house with several of 
his 11 children and 12 grandchildren 
police blamed drug traffickers for the quirigua car bomb attack 
and two others on saturday that killed 27 people including six 
children and wounded some 200 
the death toll was the highest this year for a single day of 
terrorist attacks police said 
two of the attacks came in the capital of bogota in quirigua 
and the uppermiddleclass enclave of niza and the third in the 
southern city of cali police said the cars were packed with 
dynamite and the explosions triggered by remote control 
on sunday scores of police officers stood guard in quirigua 
against looters hundreds of curious onlookers stood behind ropes 
stretched across both ends of a commercial street by police to 
cordon off the bomb scene 
martha lucia sanchez a 19yearold student and neighbor of 
benavides said the car bomb exploded when the streets were full of 
people shopping for mothers day 
the terrorists did not just want to cause damage to 
property she said they wanted to kill as many of the innocent 
as they could they were very determined 
police said 15 people were killed in the quirigua bomb attack 
two more people died in niza and 10 were killed in cali 
benavides 26yearold son jose luis said he was standing by a 
front window of his familys home when the bomb exploded 
on sunday he stood by the empty frame of the same window still 
dazed and wearing a bloodstained bandage around his head 
jose luis said he didnt want to stay in a damaged house without 
windows but had no choice 
if we dont stay here we will be robbed he said 
his wife carmen rosa shuddered and cried as she told how the 
family was planning to celebrate its 18th anniversary of living in 
the house at the end of may 
we have been humble persons all our lives she said the 
fight between politicians and criminals has nothing to do with us 
but many quirigua residents were more precise in singling out 
targets for their rage 
this is the fault of the united states for forcing colombia to 
fight its war against drug traffickers said 34yearold miguel 
angel ayure 
he angrily blasted president virgilio barco and other colombian 
government officials as cowards for not resisting the pressure of 
the gringos to extradite drug suspects to the united states 
i want the death penalty for the drug terrorists who did 
this he said but i want them to die in colombia 
ernesto aguacida 34 said colombia was not only at the mercy of 
drug traffickers but also of foreign governments 
he noted that drug traffickers are using weapons made in the 
united states and israel 
those countries profit from this violence he said 
aguacida and others predicted that regardless of who wins the 
may 27 presidential election and succeeds barco the violence will 
continue 
in august the government announced an offensive against the 
drug traffickers following the assassination of presidential 
candidate sen luis carlos galan 
the drug cartels responded with an offensive of their own 
police blame them for hundreds of bobings and other attacks that 
have left nearly 300 people dead

albanian communist leaders say their 
country will continue its cautious course of reform but they still 
reject westernstyle politics 
i think it would be absurd to recommend the french or english 
model of democracy in another country albanian communist party 
leader ramiz alia said in comments made available sunday 
the english parliament is hundreds of years old ours not even 
50 albanias state ata news agency quoted alia as telling un 
secretary general javier perez de cuellar 
the visit by perez de cuellar who arrived friday was the 
latest sign that eastern europes last hardline communist nation 
is emerging from its decadeslong policy of isolation 
at last weeks parliament session albanian officials eased 
restrictions on travel abroad difficult if not impossible for 
decades for ordinary albanians and abolished the death penalty for 
those caught trying to flee the country 
they also said penalties would be lifted for spreading religious 
or antisocialist propaganda 
but these reforms fall far short of the sweeping changes being 
introduced elsewhere in eastern europe where multiparty 
democracies are being established 
the albanian communist party continues to exert its control in a 
manner reminiscent of the repressive stalinist era of the 1940s and 
1950s in the soviet bloc 
perez de cuellar who has attempted to emphasize the positive 
aspects of what remains a restrictive society on sunday praised 
the cautious changes being introduced in albania 
i am convinced that this process will be further promoted and 
it will lead the country towards a modern society he said at a 
reception given in his honor by alia 
albanian officials have suggested that the changes have been 
made possible by the relaxation off eastwest tensions 
prime minister adil carcani touched on that theme at a meeting 
saturday with perez de cuellar who is the first un 
secretarygeneral to visit albania 
in the future too the albanian government will make other 
changes in accordance with the conditions of the countrys 
development and with the international circumstances ata quoted 
carcani as saying

managers handled operatorassistance calls and 
took over other duties after 3000 union members went on strike 
against cincinnati bell 
the union representing operators clerical workers and 
installers walked out on mothers day one of the busiest calling 
days of the year after a 14hour bargaining session broke down 
early sunday no new talks were scheduled 
company spokeswoman cyndy cantoni said direct calls are 
automated and werent affected and people making long distance 
calls on mothers day saw no difference because cincinnati bell is 
not a long distance carrier 
ms cantoni said 1000 management workers were called in to fill 
in for the strikers and some will put in 12hour shifts for the 
duration of the strike 
the company serves more than 500000 customers in the cincinnati 
area and portions of northern kentucky and southeastern indiana 
i dont think customers will see a big difference in most 
services but they can expect slower response time from repair and 
installation she said 
union leaders said workers went on strike over health benefits 
and a plan that would require workers to pay part of their health 
premiums 
cincinnati bell workers last struck in 1983 managers replaced 
union workers during the twoweek walkout

few romanians knew who petre roman was 
before the december revolution now tens of thousands mob him like 
a rock star on his swings around the country campaigning for the 
may 20 elections 
thousands of people protest daily in bucharest and some other 
cities accusing the governing national salvation front of planning 
to install a new communist government the front took over when 
dictator nicolae ceausescu was overthrown and executed 
in the towns and countryside the government and its leaders are 
much more popular 
at birlad 160 miles northeast of bucharest the crowd of 20000 
pressed so close that roman ordered his driver to speed away his 
spokesman was spreadeagled on the back of the vehicle desperately 
clutching the antenna 
after the campaign tour last week the 43yearold premier 
predicted the front would win romanias first free elections in 50 
years 
he interim president ion iliescu and many other front members 
are former officials of the ceausescu regime who fell out with the 
dictator roman said in an interview that critics were partly 
justified in suspecting them of being neocommunists 
we lived 50 years under dictatorship so the suspicion for 
some of them may be sincere the premier said in an interview 
aboart his campaign plane 
opposition claims that the front seeks to restore marxiststyle 
government should not be taken seriously he said 
if you assume that the 4 million members of the party were 
really communists you are wrong roman said of communist party 
membership under ceausescu many even at the middle level were in 
reality fighting to preserve human rights at risk to themselves 
international attention has focused on mass protest against the 
front and romans government that began april 22 in downtown 
bucharest and on opposition accusations that the front is using 
unfair tactics in the campaign 
the united states recalled its ambassador for consultations may 
10 
at times 10000 people have been involved in the bucharest 
protest similar demonstrations have been reported in brasov 
romanias secondlargest city and timisoara where the uprising 
against ceausescu began 
roman a professor of hydraulic engineering before the 
revolution said he expects the front to win a majority in the new 
parliament and iliescu to be chosen as president 
tens of thousands of people have attended campaign rallies for 
the two men outside bucharest chanting slogans for the front 
whether to accept people with communist backgrounds into the new 
governments being debated throughout the former soviet bloc the 
debate has all but paralyzed society in romania where many in the 
opposition feel the ideals of the revolution are being betrayed 
the front a loose assocation of technocrats intellectuals and 
communists opposed to ceausescu seized power by proclamation just 
after the dictator tried to flee dec 22 he was executed three 
days later 
under pressure from opposition parties and street demonstrators 
the front agreed in january to share power in a provisional 
legislature whose enactments included a new election law 
opponents accuse the front of failing to dismiss former members 
of ceausescus dreaded securitate secret police from key positions 
in ministerial bureaucracies 
roman said there were no more than 1000 communists in the 
country at the time of the revolution communism is dead in all 
of eastern europe he said it brought no benefits not 
economic not social not even moral 
the prime ministers father walter roman was among the few 
genuine communists in romania before world war ii and fought in the 
spanish civil war where he met and married petres mother 
hortensia 
petre romans relative obscurity before becoming premier his 
communist background and reluctance to endorse freemarket 
economics have contributed to suspicions about his plans 
in the interview roman said choices are limited in romanias 
shattered economy which has little chance of providing better 
living standards soon 
i am not for savage liberalism he said i favor a 
transition to a market with an important social protection 
program such as in france sweden but within the limits of an 
economy that is profitable for a free market point of view

a female midshipman was dragged from her 
dormitory room handcuffed to a urinal and taunted by male 
midshipmen in what naval academy officials said was a 
goodnatured exchange that got out of hand 
gwen marie dreyer resigned after the december incident and the 
midshipmen involved were punished with demerits and a loss of leave 
time 
we still dont believe that they understand that it was in 
fact an assault said carolyn a dreyer her stepmother an 
assault and it would have been treated that way in any other 
school in any other situation 
but academy officials ruled that the incident began as a 
friendly encounter that got out of hand after a snowball fight and 
therefore couldnt be considered premeditated hazing which can 
lead to dismissal 
we take this kind of thing extremely seriously said academy 
superintendent virgil l hill jr admittedly the incident grew 
out of a goodnatured exchange between friends none of that takes 
away from the fact that they overstepped bounds and her end feeling 
was humiliation thats sexual harassment we dont allow that 
dreyer who was photographed while handcuffed to the urinal was 
eventually freed by her roommates 
in her letter of resignation last month dreyer said resentment 
expressed toward women at the academy crushes their spirits 
i understand that steps are now being taken to correct some 
very serious human relations problems she wrote however 
after what ive been through and have seen not only because of 
what has happened to me personally i have decided to leave 
she plans to study engineering at california state polytechnic 
institute in san luis obispo 
two midshipmen were punished with demerits and loss of leave 
time six other midshipmen received written warnings for lesser 
roles in the incident 
hill said the incident was an isolated one but dreyers father 
and another academy graduate said it shows the academy still has 
not resolved resentment of women at the academy which first 
allowed women in 1976 
about 10 percent of the 4000 midshipmen at the academy are 
women 
something needs to be done to change the attitudes of the 
macho guys who just dont want women at that school said gregory 
dreyer a 1967 academy graduate 
hill said attitudes take a long time to change but his 
administration has made strides toward complete assimilation of 
women there are problems i wont deny that hill said but 
in the overall the system works 
lt barbette lowndes a 1980 academy graduate polling women in 
the military disagreed 
there still are large cliques of men who want to make it a 
mens school again she said they ignore you keep you 
isolated just let you know that youre not wanted its more 
mental abuse 
gregory dreyer said his daughter was intimidated by classmates 
who warned her not to testify at a disciplinary hearing she was 
told her life would be made miserable he said 
a 1987 study found that about 35 percent of the women enrolled 
at annapolis eventually left compared with 22 percent for men the 
gap was the widest of any at the three major military academies

blacks and whites mingled at peach 
county high schools first integrated prom and many of the nearly 
200 students said the change was long overdue 
somebody is going to come along every time and break some 
tradition thats really stupid some tradition you dont really 
think about because youve always done it said hope bickley a 
white 17yearold at the dance saturday im glad it was our 
class that broke it 
ato crumbly a black student agreed we go to school 
together play football together run track together so why cant 
we socialize together crumbly said saturday at the formal dance 
in the school gym 
all school dances and parties were canceled by the school board 
in the early 1960s when a student apparently was injured during a 
prom board members also said planning the dances took time away 
from schoolwork 
nearly 20 years ago the school was desegregated but without a 
schoolsponsored prom parents began organizing their own one for 
blacks one for whites 
i go out of town a lot in the summer to las vegas and 
california crumbly said id tell about the prom and theyd 
say what and theyd ask do yall still have to drink out of 
separate fountains 
three years ago peach countys parentteacher group tried to 
change the boards policy the board rejected the groups request 
for a schoolsponsored prom 
last year the board changed its position and saturdays 
integrated prom was held without incident 
susan jordan president of the parentteacher group said the 
students set an example for the community 
a child shall lead them she said well in this case a 
group of children shall perhaps lead the community and wont that 
be great and isnt it about time

the united states and iran have 
signed a 105 million settlement of some 3000 financial claims 
bringing the two countries one step closer to reestablishing 
economic relations a us official said today 
the settlement deals primarily with socalled small claims 
for under 250000 that stem from the 1979 islamic revolution said 
the official speaking on condition of anonymity 
it clears the way for the iranunited states claims tribunal to 
deal with about 16 billion in major claims whose resolution in 
turn could open the way to normalizing economic ties between the 
two nations the official said 
the settlement accord was signed late sunday night or early this 
morning by timothy ramish us agent to the tribunal and iranian 
agent ali nobari according to the american official at the 
tribunal 
the most recent settlement talks between us and iranian 
officials occurred shortly after the release of american hostages 
frank reed and robert polhill by proiranian kidnappers in lebanon 
but us and iranian representatives to the tribunal have 
repeatedly stated the talks dealt only with financial arbitration 
and not with the six remaining americans still in captivity in 
lebanon 
last week a us state department official in washington who 
commented on condition of anonymity said he could not predict 
whether resolving its financial disputes will result in the release 
of remaining hostages or was in any way related to the release of 
polhill and reed 
the small claims package dealt primarily with americans who left 
behind personal possessions or were owed salaries by iranian 
companies when they fled iran during the revolution they were 
settled for a total of 50 million 
the settlement also provided 55 million for repayment of a loan 
from the us agency for international development 
the tribunal was set up as part of the algiers accord of 1980 
which resulted in freedom for the american hostages held by iranian 
militants at the us embassy in tehran for 444 days the tribunal 
has three iranian three american and three thirdnation 
arbitrators 
the biggest claim still before the tribunal valued at up to 11 
billion by iran is for military equipment which iran ordered but

the governments top troubleshooter 
handling the moslem secessionist movement came to kashmir over the 
weekend offering jobs but his audience demanded nothing less than 
freedom from indian rule 
the chasm between the people of kashmir and the central 
government in new delhi cannot be easily bridged today 
now four decades of pentup feelings among kashmirs moslem 
majority have finally exploded into a bloody separatist movement 
for an islamic state 
george fernandes minister for kashmiri affairs in the 
6monthold government of prime minister vp singh spoke 
earnestly of the need to right economic wrongs to pacify a people 
whose sentiments he says have been hijacked by a few radical 
separatists 
but the men and women who crowded around him saturday in the 
city of anantnag werent interested in economics 
sometimes angrily sometimes tearfully they demanded the 
release of sons and husbands detained by indian security forces on 
suspicion of belonging to militant groups that kill government 
employees military men and suspected informers 
the deployment of tens of thousands of security troops and the 
arrests of hundreds of people have galvanized the public as never 
before against what kashmiri moslems now routinely describe as 
indian occupation 
in anantnag and srinagar summer capital of jammukashmir state 
and heart of the secessionist movement men and women without 
bidding pull up sleeves and tunics to reveal deep bruises gashes 
and sometimes bullet wounds they say were inflicted by indian 
security forces 
when fernandes arrived in anantnag 34 miles southeast of 
srinagar saturday about 100 men women and children greeted him 
with a chant what do we want we want freedom 
fernandes a silverhaired socialist and former labor leader 
settled into a chair in front of the government guesthouse and 
began hearing grievances in an effort to persuade kashmiris that 
the indian government cares about them 
a young woman concealed by a black islamic veil from the top of 
her head to the knees of her baggy pantaloons said one of her 
brothers had been taken away by security troops and a second had 
gone into hiding for fear he too would be arrested we will 
take up guns here she cried 
stories tumbled over each other in a cacophony of complaints 
against the indian army and the paramilitary central reserve police 
force which have been deployed in kashmir since the governments 
latest and harshest crackdown started jan 20 at least 368 
people have been killed so far 
at midnight they came and my son was taken naked said raja 
begum his was the only earning hand in my family i have had 
four operations and cannot even work in the fields 
she said her son kurshid ahmad was detained 10 days ago and 
she still had no word of his whereabouts 
it is impossible to say which accounts are accurate anantnag 
has long been a bulwark of support for the separatists and is the 
home of one of their top leaders shabir shah jailed since march 
fernandes who has made a halfdozen trips to kashmir in the 
past four months said he believed that by offering jobs the 
government could regain the support of the majority of people in 
this scenic valley 
tourism has long been the economic mainstay of kashmir but the 
tourist trade has all but vanished due to the unrest 
asked about allegations of brutality fernandes said i dont 
blame the security forces in this sort of situation many things 
can happen 
the kashmir conflict stems from the regions division along a 
stilldisputed frontier between india and predominantly moslem 
pakistan after the two countries were partitioned along religious 
lines in gaining independence from britain in 1947 
kashmir was mainly moslem but its hindu ruler opted to join 
india instead of pakistan the two countries went to war over 
kashmir in 1948 and 1965 
today the indiangoverned part of kashmir is incorporated into 
the state of jammukashmir the only one in india with a moslem 
majority sixtyfour percent of jammukashmirs 6 million people 
are moslems but nationwide moslems account for only 12 percent of 
indias 880 million population

negotiators began talks today on the 
future of us military bases in this country a day after 
suspected communist guerrillas shot and killed two american 
servicemen near one of the installations 
truncheonwielding police fired tear gas at hundreds of 
antibase protesters during running confrontations through the 
streets of the capital 
at least 42 people were arrested and five hospitalized 
witnesses and police said protesters mostly students retaliated 
by throwing small homemade bombs at police 
rallies were held throughout the day and security was tight for 
the talks which opened at the central bank building with about 500 
police on hand five truckloads of riot police were deployed before 
the gate at clark air base as about 400 base opponents rallied in 
nearby angeles city 
us and philippine officials had expressed fears that the 
communist new peoples army would try to kill americans before the 
talks on extending the lease on clark and subic bay naval base as 
well as four smaller facilities the lease is set to expire sept 
16 1991 
as the talks opened the chief us negotiator condemned the 
killings of two us airmen near clark on sunday and assailed the 
banditry of communist rebels blamed by authorities for the 
attack 
this brutal and clumsy attempt to drive a wedge between the 
united states and the philippines will fail said richard 
armitage a former assistant secretary of defense 
police capt gener manguni said it appeared the rebels were 
responsible for the killings because of the style of the attack 
two or three filipinos approached the americans and shot them in 
the back of their heads with 45caliber pistols the rebels 
favored weapon in street killings 
the dead servicemen were identified by air force officials as 
airman john h raven 19 of delta junction alaska and airman 
james c green 20 of craig colo a companion airman 1st class 
randall moore 23 managed to escape 
they were among 280 airmen and support personnel assigned to the 
8th aircraft generation squadron on temporary duty from kunsan air 
base 110 miles south of seoul south korea 
police rounded up more than 200 people for questioning in the 
attack but no charges were filed 
the navy banned offpost leave for the 40000 troops defense 
department civilians and military dependents at us installations 
in the philippines 
eight americans have died in politically motivated slayings in 
the phillipines since april 1989 
the rebels made no claim of responsibility for sundays 
killings but in a media statement the new peoples army denounced 
the bases talks 
the npa pledges that all its territorial and unit commands 
all officers and men will carry out their mission to the last man 
if necessary of expelling us imperialism out of our country 
the statement said 
in manila about 3000 militant workers gathered in a city 
square as speakers denounced the bases americans must be driven 
away crispin beltran chairman of the may first movement a 
labor federation told the crowd and those who refuse must be 
buried here 
later the group tried to march to the us embassy but was 
blocked by police the protesters placed a plywood placard bearing 
a base eviction notice on a traffic island in front of the 
embassy 
president corazon aquino told reporters the government was 
taking all necessary measures to protect americans but we 
cannot guarantee a 100 percent failsafe protection no government 
can 
she has refused to say whether she will agree to extend the 
lease for the bases among the largest outside the united states 
armitage said the bases help provide stability in the far east 
but that the united states would leave if filipinos wanted the 
installations closed 
if you ask us to leave leave we shall as expeditiously as 
possible and with our pride fully intact armitage said if we 
do not truly believe that there exists a compelling mutual interest 
between the philippines and the united states then we have 
precious little to discuss other than the terms of an amicable 
separation 
stanley schrager spokesman for the us panel said security 
for americans would also be high on the agenda during the first 
round of talks 
the municipal mayors league of the philippines today presented 
mrs aquino with a copy of a resolution approved last march 
endorsing retention of the bases 
the league said the installations contributed to the nations 
economy as well as regional security 
but opposition to the bases has been increasing because a 
growing number of filipinos believe they infringe on national 
sovereignty criticism intensified after congress cut 96 million 
from the bush administrations request for aid to manila 
in 1988 the reagan administration pledged 962 million over two 
years to keep the bases through 1991 philippine officials consider 
the congressional cutbacks a breach of that agreement 
foreign secretary raul manglapus chief philippine delegate 
cited the shortfall and urged washington to provide more aid 
the talks are considered exploratory afterward the two sides 
will decide whether to enter formal negotiations any agreement 
must be ratified by twothirds of the 23member philippine senate 
where opposition to the bases is strong

millions more americans are exposed to 
hurricanes as the population grows in the southeast and gulf 
states and meteorologists worry that these new residents may 
underestimate the dangers they could face 
the entire region from texas to north carolina has experienced 
sharp growth in recent years a period that has averaged 
relatively few hurricanes 
that means many coastal residents have never experienced a major 
storm 
emergency management officials say they fear that when a major 
storm does threaten people will underestimate the danger and delay 
evacuation or fail to leave at all 
we are more vulnerable to hurricanes in the united states now 
than we have ever been in our history said the american 
meteorological society in a special statement of concern adopted a 
couple of years ago 
it is imperative that coastal residents and visitors alike 
take the threat seriously acquaint themselves with hurricane 
safety rules and evacuate immediately if advised to do so said 
robert sheets director of the national hurricane center in coral 
gables fla 
as it is the population in many regions such as the new 
orleans area now exceeds the number that could be safely 
evacuated in the time available officials said 
some evacuation times for highdensity coastal populations are 
much larger than the amount of time that we can reasonably give a 
decent warning said meteorologist miles lawrence of the 
hurricane center 
floridas atlantic coast tops the region with 2075 people per 
shoreline mile up from 824 per mile in 1960 according to a new 
study from the national oceanic and atmospheric administration 
about onethird of the residents in the southeast region from 
texas to north carolina are considered coastal in the noaa study 
including the entire population of florida 
june 1 marks the official start of hurricane season for the 
southeast and the danger period extends to autumn 
overall there have been less hurricanes in the last 20 years 
than prior to that noted lawrence adding that southeast 
florida has not had a direct hit by a category 3 or higher storm 
since 1965 
strong storms have struck in recent years in south carolina and 
texas however he said hurricanes are graded on a scale of 1 to 
5 with 5 the strongest 
last years hurricane hugo killed 29 people and did an estimated 
59 billion in damage in south carolina the storm also inflicted 
serious damage on adjacent states as well as the virgin islands and 
puerto rico advance warning however allowed people to be 
evacuated from many coastal islands and lowlying regions 
while hugo is reportedly the most expensive hurricane in us 
history it is far from the deadliest that occurred in 1900 when a 
storm arriving with little warning drove a wall of water over 
galveston texas killing an estimated 6000 people 
while floridas east coast is the most densely populated area 
where hurricanes post the greatest threat all areas seem to be 
growing rapidly 
texas coastal counties average 1517 people per shore mile up 
from 798 in 1960 third is floridas west coast where the coastal 
population has risen from 433 per mile in 1960 to 1064 currently 
according to noaa 
here is a rundown of the population in coastal states most 
threatened by hurricanes it includes the percentage of the states 
population considered coastal and the estimated number of people 
per shoreline mile in 1988 compared with 1960 and the projected 
population in the year 2010 
florida east coast 100 percent coastal 2075 people per 
shoreline mile up from 824 in 1960 headed for 2689 in 2010 
florida gulf coast 100 percent coastal 1064 per mile up 
from 433 headed for 1411 
texas 31 percent coastal 1517 per shoreline mile up from 
798 headed for 1956 
mississippi 13 percent coastal 928 per mile up from 527 
headed for 1102 
alabama 12 percent coastal 800 per mile up from 599 headed 
for 886 
louisiana 62 percent coastal 352 per mile up from 248 
headed for 420 
south carolina 25 percent coastal 303 per mile up from 176 
headed for 365 
north carolina 11 percent coastal 202 per mile up from 140 
headed for 234 
georgia 6 percent coastal 158 per mile up from 114 headed 
for 179

count of armed robbery said james fruin at the grand central

the supreme court today refused to let 30 
states sue 26 manufacturers in the nations highest court over 
removal of asbestos from public schools and other government 
buildings 
the court without comment refused to hear arguments that the 
manufacturers should pay for such removal 
todays action does not preclude the 30 states from suing 
asbestos manufacturers in their respective state courts 
but the states first went to the justices hoping to head off a 
competition among themselves for monetary damages from the asbestos 
makers 
in an unsual move the states asked the court to invoke its 
original jurisdiction so this bigstakes dispute could be 
consolidated and resolved before any lower court considers it 
the request was denied 
asbestos has been used for decades in the construction of 
buildings and ships the inhalation of asbestos fibers has been 
linked to various diseases 
tens of thousands of personalinjury lawsuits have been filed 
against asbestos manufacturers by shipyard workers hundreds of 
asbestosinbuildings suits also have been filed 
the justices were told that eight states have sued asbestos 
makers in their state courts seeking to have them pay the costs of 
removing the substance from public buildings 
the eight states are kentucky maryland minnesota mississippi 
pennsylvania south carolina virginia and west virginia 
in response to the request acted on today lawyers for one 
asbestos maker wr grace amp co said there is no national or 
even interstate issue involved here plaintiffs may turn at any 
time to their own state courts as have their eight sister states 
lawyers for the company said the suggestion that only this 
court can equitably apportion defendants assets and spare the 
states a race to judgment wrongly implies a preordained finding 
of liability 
they quoted environmental protection agency reports indicating 
that the presence of asbestos in a building does not mean the 
health of occupants is endangered if the asbestoscontaining 
material remains in good condition and is unlikely to be disturbed 
the states request was prepared by attorney general kenneth 
eikenberry of washington state 
the states were washington alabama arizona arkansas 
california connecticut delaware florida illinois indiana 
iowa louisiana maine missouri montana nebraska new hampshire 
new york north carolina north dakota ohio oklahoma rhode 
island south dakota tennessee texas utah vermont and wyoming 
new jersey subsequently asked the court to join the other states 
as a plaintiff 
in addition to wr grace the named defendants were national

the trial judges who convicted retired ohio 
autoworker john demjanjuk of killing jews at a world war ii death 
camp were biased his attorney said today in court arguments 
appealing the war crimes conviction 
in april 1988 a threejudge panel found that demjanjuk was a 
brutal guard known as ivan the terrible who operated gas 
chambers at the treblinka death camp in poland from 1942 to 1943 
more than 850000 jews died there 
demjanjuk 70 was sentenced to death under a 1950 israeli law 
allowing prosecution of nazis and their collaborators 
the ukrainianborn demjanjuk has maintained he is a victim of 
mistaken identity and that he was incarcerated in german pow camps 
during the period in question 
speaking before a fivejustice supreme court panel demjanjuks 
israeli attorney yoram sheftel said he disputed the conviction on 
10 points the most significant sheftel said was the bias of 
the court 
it should lead to the clear conclusion that the conviction 
should be canceled and especially in a case where the sentence is 
capital punishment he said 
sheftel argued at length about what he said was a hostile 
atmosphere created by news reports and the judges treatment of the 
defense during the 17month trial 
he claimed the trial judges dov levine dalia dorner and 
shmuel tal subscribed to a clipping service that twice daily 
delivered reports from newspapers he also asserted the judges 
briefed reporters on occasion 
he said biased reporting clearly had a great deal of influence 
on the court sometimes i thought i wasnt sitting in a court but 
at bloomfield a football stadium near tel aviv said sheftel 
he said there were frequent shouts and interruptions from the 
audience at the trial which was held in a converted movie theater 
not only was an appearance of justice lacking but justice in 
fact was not done said sheftel 
he said the judges repeatedly interrupted defense 
crossexaminations and intervened frequently in the proceedings 
throughout the proceedings demjanjuk wearing a dark brown 
prison uniform listened impassively from a witness stand guarded 
by two policemen he muttered good morning in hebrew as he 
entered the courtroom wearing handcuffs and then embraced his son 
john jr 
demjanjuks wife vera also was present and refused to speak to 
reporters 
prosecutor yonah blattman interrupted sheftel once in the first 
five hours of arguments blattman said sheftels bases for claiming 
bias are not legal or factual arguments and are not worthy of 
being brought before the court 
chief justice meir shamgar overruled the objection 
sheftel also challenged israels jurisdiction to try demjanjuk 
as a war criminal 
he noted israels extradition treaty with the united states and 
that the warrant under which demjanjuk was deported allowed for 
trying a suspect on murder charges but not genocide or mass murder 
demjanjuk was extradited from his home in cleveland ohio in 
february 1986 after an ohio court stripped him of his citizenship 
for lying about his nazi past on immigration forms 
sheftel said he will argue eight other points in the coming five 
weeks of court sessions

the supreme court today refused to revive a 
lawsuit accusing the reagan administration of unlawfully bombing 
libya in 1986 with help from great britain 
the court without comment let stand a ruling that threw out 
the suit and also ordered the libyans and their lawyers including 
former attorney general ramsey clark to pay penalties and the 
british governments legal costs 
the suit first was dismissed by us district judge thomas 
penfield jackson who said it had no hope whatsoever of 
success but jackson did not assess penalties or court costs 
because he said the suit was not frivolous so much as it is 
audacious 
the government of british prime minister margaret thatcher then 
asked that it be reimbursed for legal fees and court costs and the 
us circuit court of appeals here agreed 
the appeals court last september said the libyans lawyers must 
have known the suit was hopeless but went through with it as a 
public statement of protest 
the appeals court said since the case lacks legal merit the 
libyans and their attorneys must be penalized under court rules 
barring frivolous suits 
the appeals court ordered them to pay 16852 in legal fees and 
court costs and sent the case back to jackson to determine 
additional sanctions reagan administration officials including 
former president reagan previously had dropped an appeal for such 
reimbursement and penalties 
the libyans suit charged that the april 15 1986 bombing raid 
violated principles of international law and numerous treaties and 
declarations 
mrs thatcher was sued for approving the use of us military 
bases in britain to launch the attacks 
the suit said the reagan administrations real purpose was to 
kill libyan leader moammar gadhafi and to terrorize libyans by 
inflicting injury upon the civilian population to undermine 
support for gadhafi 
reagan said the raid was in retaliation for antiamerican 
attacks authorized by gadhafi including the bombing of a west 
berlin discotheque frequented by us servicemen that killed two 
and injured 150 others 
among the victims of the bombing raid was a 3monthold girl who 
died when hit by shrapnel while asleep in her home in benghazi the 
childs 38yearold father was also killed by shrapnel according 
to the suit 
clark attorney general under president johnson has been 
criticized in the past for dealing with nations hostile to the 
united states 
in 1980 he attended a crimes of america conference in iran 
while american hostages were being held in tehran in 1972 he went 
to hanoi to investigate the effects of us bombing during the 
vietnam war 
the case is saltany vs reagan 891497

the supreme court today rejected appeals by 13 
men convicted in the socalled pizza connection drugtrafficking 
conspiracy 
the court without comment let stand a ruling that the mens 
rights were not violated in one of the longest and costliest trials 
in us history 
the 13 were convicted in new york city three years ago after a 
17month trial they received sentences ranging from four to 45 
years in prison 
the government said the drug ring brought 16 billion worth of 
heroin and cocaine into the country from turkey sicily and brazil 
through a network of pizza parlors 
the 2nd us circuit court of appeals upheld the convictions 
last october although it expressed misgivings about the length and 
complexity of the trial 
all told there were 21 defendants in the case and numerous 
charges of conspiracy racketeering money laundering and other 
offenses on three continents dating back to the 1970s 
not all those convicted appealed to the 2nd circuit court the 
supreme court last february rejected a separate appeal by a 14th 
defendant filippo casamento who had been sentenced to 30 years 
the main defendants included gaetano badalamenti reputed former 
head of the mafia in sicily and salvatore catalano the mobs 
reputed new york boss each received a 45year sentence 
also convicted were giuseppe lamberti 30 years salvatore 
greco salvatore lamberti frank castronovo and salvatore mazzurco 
20 years each giovanni ligammari 15 years giovanni cangialosi 
and emanuele palazzolo 12 years each salvatore salamone and 
giuseppe vitale five years each and lorenzo devardo four years 
a 15th defendant francesco polizzi was sentenced to 20 years 
in prison but was not involved in the appeal acted on today 
in their appeal the 13 said their jury did not represent a fair 
crosssection of the community because it was drawn from people who 
were unemployed retired or who held lowlevel jobs they could 
afford to leave for a long time 
moreover the defendants lawyers said no jury given this 
trials length complexity and subject matter could have rendered 
a reliable verdict 
the appeal also argued that the jurors were prejudiced by 
violent events outside the courtroom during the trial 
one defendant was murdered during the proceedings another was 
shot one juror was excused after her daughter received a 
threatening telephone call 
the case is palazzolo vs us 891565

business inventories were unchanged in march 
after advancing during the two previous three months the 
government reported today while sales rose 06 percent for their 
third consecutive gain 
the commerce department said inventories on shelves and backlots 
totaled a seasonally adjusted 7940 billion after rising a revised 
04 percent in february and 03 percent in january inventories in 
february originally were reported to have fallen 04 percent 
sales totaled a seasonally adjusted 5391 billion following 
gains of 14 percent in february and 04 percent in january the 
february increase first was reported to have been 13 percent 
the march business activity produced a 147 ratio of inventories 
to sales matching a 147 ratio in january 1989 which was the 
lowest since the current economic expansion began after the 198182 
recession the ratio means that it would take 147 months to 
exhaust inventories at the march pace 
rising sales and falling inventories is a sign of economic 
strength if inventories were to rise excessively it could mean 
cutbacks in production and a loss of jobs for instance the ratio 
peaked at 170 in october 1982 during the last recession 
the inventory decline was centered in the manufacturing sector 
where it fell 03 percent inventories edged up 03 percent at the 
retail level and 02 percent at the wholesale level 
sales on the other hand dropped 02 percent at the retail 
level the commerce department reported last friday that retail 
sales fell another 06 percent in april the biggest plunge in six 
months 
manufacturing sales rose 11 percent and wholesale sales 
advanced 08 percent

police and troops backed by tanks 
hurled tear gas and fired in the air today to disperse thousands of 
demonstrators who tried to enter the israelioccupied west bank 
during a propalestinian march 
many teenagers threw stones at the tanks and police and 
hospital sources said at least 103 people were injured in the 
90minute clash later however interior minister salem masadeh 
said 52 were injured 
there was no immediate explanation for the discrepancy 
many of the participants in the march collapsed on the ground as 
tear gas canisters exploded in the middle of the crowd estimated 
at more than 20000 people 
the army and police had told the crowd to stop 700 yards from 
the bridge over the jordan river that leads to the west bank but 
when the demonstrators arrived after a onehour walk from hajjaj 
city three miles to the north about 2500 demonstrators tried to 
run toward the wooden bridge 
some protesters were only two yards away from the bridge when 
the policemen began firing their guns into the air and hurling tear 
gas 
there was nothing else for us to do said a riot policeman 
we had to stop them by force otherwise they would have 
penetrated into the israeli side 
some of those injured appeared to have broken limbs and a few 
were bleeding after being trampled in the stampede as hysterical 
crowds ran in all directions 
shuna hospital sources speaking on condition of anonymity said 
most of casualties were unconscious from inhaling tear gas but 
they said there were no gunshot wounds 
it was not clear if any of the estimated 700 policemen and 300 
army soldiers was injured 
israel seized the west bank from jordan during the 1967 middle 
east war and a palestinian uprising against the occupation has 
been simmering for 29 months 
palestinian flags portraits of palestinian figures and 
antiamerican and antiisraeli banners the demonstrators had waved 
during the march were left lying on the ground

associations to mark the 42nd anniversary of the un partition 
plan that sliced britishmandated palestine into jewish and arab 
states

jordanian parliament members and scores of palestinians who had 
been deported after israel seized the west bank 
roughly half of jordans 31 million population come from 
palestinian families who fled or were driven out during the 1948 
and 1967 arabisraeli wars

of the snake other slogans read american is the number one 
enemy of the arabs as it is the strategic ally of the cancerous 
zionist entity 
the crowd chanted we want an independent palestine state amd 
homes to shelter our childrens as well as palestinian songs

khalil alwazir deputy commander of the palestine liberation 
organization who was killed by an israeli commando unit in tunis on 
april 16 1988

pricecutting schemes that hurt a competitors 
business do not necessarily violate federal antitrust laws the 
supreme court ruled today 
by a 72 vote the justices killed a lawsuit against atlantic 
richfield co arco by independent gas stations in california and 
washington state 
the court said that only when a companys pricecutting can be 
proved to be predatory and harmful does it violate the sherman 
act a major antitrust law 
usa petroleum co an independent oil dealer accused arco of 
conspiring with arco gas station dealers to fix prices illegally to 
drive the smaller independents out of business 
arco contended that its plan lower gasoline prices to attract 
more customers and discontinuing credit card sales to save money 
is legitimate 
arco lawyers said the major companys share of the retail gas 
market in california and washington was 10 to 12 percent in 1981 
and increased to 14 to 16 percent in 1983 because of lower prices 
a federal judge threw out the lawsuit but the 9th us circuit 
court of appeals reinstated it in 1988 
the appeals court said that even though there was no proof that 
arco engaged in predatory pricing it still may have injured usa 
petroleum in violation of federal antitrust law 
predatory pricing is defined as setting prices below the level 
necessary to sell a product at a profit or below an appropriate 
measure of the cost of producing the product 
writing for the high court today justice william j brennan 
said usa petroleum had not suffered any antitrust injury 
when a firm or even a group of firms lowers prices but 
maintains them above predatory levels the business lost by rivals 
cannot be viewed as an anticompetitive consequence brennan said 
this is not an antitrust injury 
justices john paul stevens and byron r white dissented 
the case is atlantic richfield vs usa petroleum 881668

hospitals reported at least three people died and 15 were 
wounded by bullets and grenades in sundays fighting government

the rebels seized the station early sunday and announced that 
ratsirakas government had been overthrown loyalist troops

the supreme court today refused to consider 
increasing a 5 million judgment that the justices were told 
already threatens to destroy the hare krishna religion 
the court without comment rejected an appeal in which a 
california woman sought to have restored millions of dollars in 
damages a jury awarded her 
the award was reduced by appeals courts and now with interest 
totals about 5 million 
the justices today took no definitive action on the religious 
sects stillpending appeal of rulings that if left standing 
could force the sale of five hare krishna temples across the 
country and in canada 
lawyers for the krishnas argue among other things that the 
california court judgment violates the churchs religious freedom 
various corporate entities of the international society of 
krishna consciousness and two krishna officials were sued 
successfully by a mother and daughter marcia and robin george of 
cypress calif 
their 1977 lawsuit alleged that robin had been brainwashed by 
the krishnas when she was 14 and that krishna leaders conspired to 
keep her away from her parents 
a california jury in 1983 awarded the georges 325 million in 
damages against the krishnas but the award was reduced on appeal 
to 29 million with interest the judgment today is estimated to 
be in excess of 5 million 
a state judge has ordered that five krishna temples already 
placed under court supervision including the religions 
headquarters in los angeles be sold and the proceeds be paid to 
the georges 
the other temples are located in southern california and the new 
york city area according to david liberman a los angeles lawyer 
for the krishnas 
the sales presumably would be unnecessary if the judgment is 
paid before they occur 
the state supreme court refused last november to review the 
award 
miss george and a friend 16yearold caron dempsey visited a 
hare krishna temple in laguna beach calif for the first time in 
1974 at miss dempseys suggestion 
miss dempsey later decided to join the religious sect and 
persuaded miss george to attend meetings at the temple 
by the fall of 1974 miss george was wearing a sari while 
attending school and chanting and praying at a hindustyle altar in 
her bedroom 
according to court documents a krishna official told miss 
george to leave her home and live at a temple she did spending 
time with hare krishnas in laguna beach san diego new orleans 
buffalo ny and ottawa canada 
the georges lawsuit alleged that krishna officials conspired to 
keep miss george from her parents who learned of her whereabouts 
in late 1975 only after miss dempsey left the religion and told 
them 
lawyers for the krishnas say the award won by the georges 
amounts to religious bigotry 
for the first time in this country since the antimormon 
frenzy of the 19th century an entire religion stands subject to 
destruction and the confiscation of its property at the hands of 
the state the sects stillpending appeal says 
it adds the proceeding below turned into a trial of what the 
georges counsel called the pernicious evil of the krishna 
consciousness religion and the jury awarded damages 
calculated to bring the religion in this country to an end 
the case acted on today is robin george vs international 
society of krishna consciousness 891398

a new york city psychologist who says author 
shana alexanders 1985 book nutcracker falsely accused him of 
having sexual intimacy with a patient failed today in supreme court 
bid to reinstate his libel lawsuit 
the justices without comment let stand state court rulings 
that dismissed herman weiners suit 
ms alexanders nonfiction book explored the salt lake city 
murder of mormon millionaire franklin bradshaw a crime for which 
bradshaws 17yearold grandson marc schreuder was convicted 
based on the youths trial testimony his mother frances 
bradshaw schreuder was convicted of masterminding her fathers 
murder both are imprisoned 
as described in court documents the book delves into the 
bradshaw familys history of emotional disturbance it purportedly 
portrays mrs schreuder as a person whose deep emotional 
disturbances were manifested in child abuse persistent lying and 
two stormy broken marriages 
mrs schreuder was a patient of weiners for about three years 
in the 1960s and in 1982 he testified on her behalf during a 
divorce and child custody proceeding in the mid1960s many other 
psychologists and pyschiatrists treated mrs schreuder 
weiner is mentioned in two paragraphs of nutcracker the 
second paragraph concludes by quoting someone who claimed 
frances always slept with her shrinks and stating that others 
suspected hanky panky 
new yorks highest court tossed out weiners suit against ms 
alexander and the books publisher doubleday amp co last dec 14 
the state court relied on a previous ruling in which it placed 
the burden on some libel plaintiffs to prove those sued acted in 
a grossly irresponsible manner without due consideration for the 
standards of information gathering and dissemination ordinarily 
followed by responsible parties 
the state court said weiner had not raised a triable issue 
as to gross irresponsibility

a braindead womans heart stopped beating 
this morning hours before a hospital planned to disconnect her 
from a respirator over the objections of her husband 
isabel mcfall 56 had been unconscious since april 17 when a 
blood vessel burst in her brain officials at st john medical 
center said declared her brain dead a week later 
her husband bill mcfall had picketed the hospital sunday in 
protest of the hospitals plans to disconnect the lifesupport 
system this morning he said he wanted his wife to remain on the 
respirator to give god time to work a miracle 
doctors said she met oklahomas criteria to be declared legally 
dead no electrical or chemical activity was detectable in her 
brain 
mcfall said the hospital called him about 230 am today and 
told him that his wifes heart had failed 
god took her home god knew there was just such a burden 
on the family i was satisfied there was no chicanery and that god 
had performed his will mcfall said 
hospital spokesman stephen reynolds said her heart stopped 
beating spontaneously reynolds said mcfall came to the hospital 
and agreed to disconnect the respirator 
mcfall had picketed the hospital on sunday for about 45 minutes 
carrying a sign reading execution may 9th 1990 the date 
apparently referred to the original deadline he believes doctors 
set for turning off the machine that circulated his wifes blood 
hospital officials contended oklahoma statutes didnt require 
them to obtain mcfalls consent to disconnect the machine though 
reynolds said doctors would have liked the familys approval 
reynolds said the only reason mrs mcfall was not disconnected 
from lifesupport machines sooner was compassion for the family 
after mcfall requested time to adjust

william j bennett the bush 
administrations drug policy director said today he believes the 
nation is beginning to see a peaking of the addiction problem 
bennett told state and local drug control officials however 
that any reduction in drug use will not be automatic but if it 
happens it will be by the pressure that we bring to bear 
bennett spoke at the opening of a twoday conference on state 
and local drug policy sponsored by his office 
we may now be seeing a levelling off of addiction bennett 
said my sense is that we are now beginning to see a peaking of 
the addiction problem 
bennett also said that in the next three to six months he 
believes that we will at least have some indications of the 
success of the administrations strategy to reduce the supply of 
cocaine from andean nations 
asked about his remarks at a news conference bennett said 
what happens in the next three to six months is that the 
agreement at cartagena begins to take effect funds from the united 
states will begin to flow 
he said actions by the bolivian peruvian and colombian 
governments would also be moving forward there is encouraging 
news out of bolivia in evidence of many farmers selling off coca 
cultivation plots and using them for other purposes he said 
bennett also said in his speech that there is a tendency by 
critics of the administrations drug policy to overstate civil 
liberties violations by police 
this is a tough business he said we do not need to 
abrogate the constitution or any of its protections but we are 
going to have to be both tough and lawabiding 
secretary of education lauro cavazos also addressed the 
conference saying he believes that education is the only 
longterm solution to the problem of substance abuse in america

maj harry kretschmer strolls through a 
hallway in an east german army barracks filled with squalling 
children and milling adults 
every day there are more the come here see the free food and 
the free housing and call home then more come he says we do 
not know what to do with them we are filled to capacity 
about 700 romanians and a few hundred bulgarians have been 
packed into two barracks at an east german army base on the 
outskirts of berlin hundreds more are housed in a building once 
used by east germanys feared secret police 
east germany reeling from a creaky economy and its own exodus 
of citizens to west germany suddenly finds itself luring other 
east europeans whose countries do not have a wealthy neighbor to 
help them emerge from four decades of stalinist oppression 
the government said it decided last week to begin housing and 
feeding the romanians and bulgarians who show up daily in train 
stations with battered bags of belongings but no money 
many see east germany now as the new threshhold of the west a 
passageway to prosperity 
i came here for work and to escape the communists says 
taian neascu 19 from bucharest i want to go to west germany 
and go to america 
about 3000 romanians already have flooded into east berlin in 
the last two weeks and another 15000 have crossed the border into 
east germany said joachim krabs a city social services official 
he said 650 arrived today alone and that about 20000 poles also 
have arrived in recent weeks 
krabs said the situation was a social powder keg and called 
for new laws to limit the flood 
matthias jahr a member of the east berlin foreigners 
commission said his office has received numerous requests for 
asylum from soviet jews who want to flee a new wave of 
antisemitism 
the flood of romanians began in late april about the time 
political strife intensified in the country 
some romanians believe the revolutionary interim government of 
acting president ion iliescu will not differ substantially from the 
communist regime that was overthrown in december 
scores of romanians began sleeping and wandering the large train 
station in lichtenberg the huge foreign quarter of east berlin 
at first we were ignorant of the problem then we found all of 
these people sleeping in the train station said hannelora 
gensch an east berlin housing official who runs the complex at the 
army base in the beisdorf district of east berlin 
children typically roam subway and train stations sent by their 
parents with cards printed in german we are romanian please 
help us with money 
many are sick when they arrive and most are afraid mrs gensch 
said 
we have had to put people in the hospital because of their 
fear she said the government has to make a decision on what 
to do with these people 
the stream comes just as a wave of resentment of foreigners is 
sweeping east germany fueled mainly by fears that the country will 
face widespread joblessness as it merges with west germany and 
converts to a free market 
violent street clashes between foreigners and east german youth 
gangs broke out in lichtenberg a week ago 
one romanian in the barracks a 36yearold man who said he 
drove a taxi in constanza said he left behind three young children 
when he came to east berlin five days ago he said he has no plans 
to return 
i cannot tell you my name because it would be bad for my 
family he said 
kretschmer said he believes the motives are more economic than 
political 
some romanians at the barracks said they fled because they 
believed a new crackdown on travel would be imposed after may 20 
when iliescu is widely expected to win the romanian elections 
most came here on tourist visas and some said they still 
planned to go home but a bearded coalminer from the city of 
resita who refuses to give his name says he has no plans to 
return 
iliescu and and ceausescu are the same he says referring 
to the hardline romanian leader nicolae ceausescu who was 
toppled and executed in december 
jahr said the government should discuss visa requirements with 
other east european countries as a way of limiting the flow 
we dont want to build a new wall he said

a deeply divided supreme court today refused 
to lift a georgia judges injunction barring an antiabortion group 
from blocking access to abortion clinics in atlanta 
the court by a 54 vote rejected an emergency request by five 
members of the group operation rescue who said the injunction is 
violating their freespeech rights 
the march 29 injunction permanently bars antiabortion 
demonstrators within 50 feet of the property line of any atlanta 
facility where abortions are performed 
since july 1988 when atlanta hosted the national democratic 
convention city police have arrested 1320 demonstrators at 
operation rescue sitins many of the protesters barricaded 
abortion clinics blocking patients and employees from entering or 
leaving 
city officials sought and obtained the state court injunction 
the georgia supreme court refused on april 25 to set it aside 
five members of operation rescue then sought emergency help from 
justice anthony m kennedy who referred the request to the full 
court 
in other action the court 
refused to let 30 states sue 26 manufacturers in the nations 
highest court over removal of asbestos from public schools and 
other government buildings 
the court without comment refused to hear arguments that the 
manufacturers should pay for such removal 
ruled that pricecutting schemes that hurt a competitors 
business do not necessarily violate antitrust laws 
by a 72 vote the justices killed a lawsuit against atlantic 
richfield co arco by independent gas stations in california and 
washington state 
the court said that only when a companys pricecutting can be 
proved to be predatory and harmful does it violate the sherman 
act a major antitrust law 
squelched a lawsuit charging the united steelworkers union 
with negligence in a 1972 idaho silver mine disaster that killed 91 
miners 
the justices by a 63 vote said the state court suit was 
preempted by federal labor law 
refused to revive a lawsuit accusing the reagan administration 
of unlawfully bombing libya in 1986 with help from great britain 
the court without comment let stand a ruling that threw out 
the suit and also ordered the libyans and their lawyers including 
former attorney general ramsey clark to pay penalties and the 
british governments legal costs 
rejected appeals by 13 men convicted in the socalled pizza 
connection drugtrafficking conspiracy 
the court without comment let stand a ruling that the mens 
rights were not violated in what was one of the longest and 
costliest trials in us history 
refused to consider increasing a 5 million judgment that the 
justices were told already threatens to destroy the hare krishna 
religion 
the court without comment rejected an appeal in which a 
california woman sought to have restored millions of dollars in 
damages a jury awarded her 
the award was reduced by appeals courts and now with interest 
totals about 5 million 
the courts 54 vote in the operation rescue case produced 
strange judicial bedfellows 
joining to deny the emergency request and thus leave the 
injunction intact were chief justice william h rehnquist and 
justices byron r white harry a blackmun john paul stevens and 
sandra day oconnor 
blackmun and stevens often are characterized as liberals on 
issues such as abortion and free speech rehnquist white and 
oconnor are most often referred to as conservatives on those 
points 
voting in dissent to lift the injunction were the courts two 
most consistent liberals justices william j brennan and thurgood 
marshall and two conservatives kennedy and justice antonin 
scalia 
writing for the dissenters kennedy cited a 1977 decision 
involving nazis demonstrating in the heavily jewish community of 
skokie ill 
kennedy said that decision does not distinguish among speakers 
based on the content of their speech 
operation rescue members michael hirsch gina robertson william 
haynes steve britt and pamela sekulow said the atlanta injunction 
deters them from engaging in prayer picketing leafleting and 
other forms of peaceful expression on public forum streets and 
sidewalks 
legal challenges to operation rescue demonstrations at abortion 
clinics have left the organization so far in debt it has closed 
down its national headquarters in binghamton ny

president abdou diouf of senegal concerned 
that iraq may be building a missile test site in his backyard met 
with president bush at the white house today 
senegalese officials said diouf was seeking information about 
reports based on us intelligence information that iraq wants to 
install a testing site for its longrange missiles in mauritania 
taking advantage of beautiful spring weather bush posed for 
pictures with diouf in the sunsplashed rose garden rather than in 
the oval office where they held talks 
although dioufs weeklong visit to washington is being billed 
as a private one he has a full schedule of meetings including 
the white house call on bush talks with treasury and commerce 
department leaders and with the heads of the imf and world bank 
mauritania and senegal broke diplomatic relations in august 
after a minor border dispute flared into violence in both countries 
in which hundreds of people were killed 
the organization of african unity has been unsuccessful in 
efforts to mediate between the two west african neighbors although 
it has averted an immediate threat of war the united states has 
supported the mediation and tried to maintain its ties with both 
countries 
privately however us officials asked mauritania whether it 
had agreed to let iraq build a missile range on its territory 
assistant secretary of state john kelly said last month mauritania 
denied the reports but iraq has refused to confirm or deny them 
the united states is worried about iraqs efforts to develop 
missiles that could carry lethal chemical weapons to israel or 
iran two countries with which iraq is technically at war 
in recent weeks us and british agents have intercepted 
several shipments of devices allegedly intended for iraqs missile 
and nuclear weapons programs iraq has denied it is building atomic 
weapons but announced it has developed a missile with a 1200mile 
range 
iraq does not have enough land to test the new missile but 
mauritania does the arid moslem land bordering the atlantic ocean 
has an area of about 400000 square miles and is sparsely populated 
both iraq and mauritania are members of the arab league and iraq 
has been supplying weapons to mauritania said a us official who 
spoke on condition of anonymity iraq enjoys good ties with senegal 
too 
senegal is one of the staunchest us allies in africa 
receiving an average of 40 million annually and having strong 
cultural ties to american organizations 
us officials hold up senegal as an example that multiparty 
democracy can work in africa where tribal divisions have hampered 
the evolution of westernstyle political systems 
diouf took office in january 1981 in 1988 his socialist party 
won 73 percent of the vote and although observers agree there was 
some election fraud there was little doubt diouf won 
diouf has accepted demands by senegals creditors including the 
united states for economic changes that would make his government 
and the private sector more efficient but he plans to ask us 
officials as well as leaders of the international monetary fund 
and the world bank for a more relaxed pace of reform 
senegal owes about 36 billion most of it to other 
governments but it has a good repayment record

massachusetts state supreme judicial court ruled 
today that gov michael s dukakis had no authority to withhold 
210 million in local aid payments to municipalities 
the unanimous decision added more uncertainty to the states 
attempts to solve its fiscal crisis 
dukakis made the cut from the current years budget to help 
resolve the states deficit now pegged at 1 billion but cities 
and towns sued the state led by the town of brookline dukakis 
hometown 
dukakis also has threatened to withhold an additional 500 
million from local aid payments at the end of the current fiscal 
year 
municipalities argued that the cuts in funding jeopardize local 
budgets threatening schools and other services 
were thrilled and hopefully this will help as we go through 
these troubled times in local government said paul moran 
spokesman for the massachusetts municipalities association 
the high court noted that state law allows the governor to 
reduce certain allotments when revenues are insufficient to meet 
expenditures state law further describes what funds are subject to 
control by the governor 
but the court ruled that the local aid funds are not made 
available to any state agency under the control of the governor 
or a secretary 
dukakis the unsuccessful democratic candidate for president in 
1988 has battled a state budget crunch almost continuously since 
that election he has said he wont seek another term

york city organizers announced today 
mandela head of the african national congress will visit 
washington and five other us cities toward the end of june said 
a news release by fenton communications which represents the anc 
an anc source in new york said mandela would arrive in the 
united states on june 20 a news conference to announce the exact 
schedule of the visit is scheduled here on tuesday

call last february as soon as mandela was released from prison 
where he had been serving a life sentence for plotting to overthrow 
the south african government 
the white house has not yet announced when mandela will meet 
with the president but administration sources have said the visit 
would be in late june

to ease some of the limitations following some lifting of 
restrictions on the black population adopted by the government of 
fw de klerk in recent months 
bush has also invited de klerk to visit washington and 
officials on both sides are trying to arrange the dates

the debate over whether the lyrics 
of a recording by the millionselling rap group 2 live crew are 
obscene moved to a higher level today with the issues first airing 
in federal court 
us district judge jose gonzalez was asked to determine if as 
nasty as they wanna be which has been removed from store shelves 
in several florida counties should also be banned in broward 
county 
the county ordered the ban lawyers for the miamibased group 
then asked gonzalez to lift the ban 
the first witness to testify today broward detective sgt mark 
wichner said he found the recording extremely explicit and 
degrading to the female sex 
the detective sought and received a ruling from a circuit judge 
that it was probably obscene then he said he visited fort 
lauderdalearea record stores warning personnel they could be 
prosecuted on obscenity charges for selling the recording 
on crossexamination 2 live crew lawyer bruce rogow said the 
sheriffs office file on the recording contained not one 
complaint from a citizen of broward county about it he argued 
that the police investigation had revealed nothing indicating the 
recording violated community standards of obscenity 
three of the groups four members david hobbs whose stage 
name is mr mixx chris wongwon known as fresh kid ice and mark 
ross who performs as brother marquis were present for the 
trials start 
leader luther campbell was expected later said debbie bennett 
a spokeswoman for the groups record company campbell has used the 
name luke skyywalker but is currently prohibited from doing so 
pending settlement of a lawsuit by the creators of the star 
wars movies 
john jolly attorney for the broward sheriffs office said 
before the trial that the purpose of the case is to tell us if it 
is protected first amendment speech or disposable unprotected 
smut 
the tape speaks for itself jolly said 
but theres merit to what it says according to rogow 
put in its historical context it is a novel and creative use 
of sound and lyrics he said he plans to call music critics to 
testify about the artistic value of the recording 
the trouble is you have a bunch of white folks who dont 
understand the culture rogow said the primary reason for 
writing these songs was humor to make people think and reflect the 
kind of talk that occurs in the community where the four people who 
make up 2 live crew have lived all their lives 
the album as nasty as they wanna be has sold nearly 2 
million copies while a toneddown version of the album has sold 
about 300000 copies

rnment in its civil war despite claims 
by vietnam that it withdrew the last of its troops in september a 
us official said monday 
richard solomon assistant secretary of state for asian affairs 
said statements by east european diplomats some vietnamese 
officials and other sources indicate vietnamese troops either 
remained behind or have returned to cambodia since september 
such reports began surfacing early this year vietnam denies the 
allegations 
solomon spoke at a news conference in bangkok where he was 
visiting as part of a regional tour 
there apparently are at least advisers operating in combat 
support roles intelligence command and control functions and 
actively participating in combat operations going on inside 
cambodia he said 
as far as numbers are concerned frankly we dont have a clear 
fix on that it is probably in the low thousands 
he said the significant issue was not the exact number of 
soldiers but rather that their presence showed the cambodian 
government remained weak and required vietnamese support the 
government installed by a vietnamese invasion in late 1978 has 
been fighting three guerrilla groups backed by the united states 
and other countries 
current peace efforts center on a proposal for the united 
nations to administer the country on an interim basis and supervise 
elections but the cambodian government and the guerrillas disagree 
over the extent of un participation

a satellite that began orbiting the moon march 18 
has been unable to transmit leaving japanese scientists uncertain 
of its exact position officials said monday 
scientists have confirmed with telescopes that the tiny 
satellite named hagoromo is orbiting the moon as planned but 
they have not received any signals from it said kuninori uesugi of 
the institute of space and astronautical science 
a bad transistor was probably responsible for the failure of the 
satellites transmitter uesugi said 
the satellite was to have sent regular data about its 
temperature and electrical status which also would have been used 
to determine its exact location 
otherwise uesugi said the mission has been successful its 
primary goal was to give scientists experience in successfully 
targeting orbits 
the satellite separated march 18 from a larger satellite named

the iranianbacked moslem faction 
hezbollah sponsored a womens sitin today and urged kidnappers to 
hold on to their western hostages until arab prisoners are released 
by israel 
we ask the hostageholders not to release any more of the 
foreign captives until all our loved ones are released from the 
zionist jails chanted umm ahmed who refused to give her full 
name 
about 50 other women echoed her chant during the onehour 
demonstration at a house in beiruts southern suburb of bir hassan 
used for guests of the united nations peacekeeping force in 
southern lebanon 
umm ahmed said tearfully that her son ahmed 21 was captured by 
israeli troops in beirut during the 1982 invasion and that she had 
heard nothing about him since 
the leader of an israelibacked militia that holds 300 moslems 
in southern lebanon said sunday he would be willing to trade a 
large number for 16 western hostages held by proiranian 
shiites 
gen antoine lahd the commander of the south lebanon army 
militia said he would include in the trade three israeli 
servicemen and several of his men held by shiite factions 
im not only prepared to facilitate such a package deal but i 
also hope it could happen lahd said in an interview with the 
associated press at his house in marjayoun in southern lebanon 
lahd 61 a retired lebanese army officer commands the 
3000strong militia that is backed by about 1000 israeli troops 
and patrols israels selfproclaimed six to 10milewide security 
zone in southern lebanon 
the south lebanon army holds the 300 shiites in khiam a small 
village in the zone which was created in 1985 after israel ended a 
threeyear occupation 
in jerusalem a senior government spokesman asked about lahds 
offer said i dont think it depends on lahd or on us but on the 
other side 
asked if there was any sign of movement from the other side the 
spokesman said on condition of anonymity none that i know of 
most of the 16 western hostages missing in lebanon are held by 
proiranian shiite factions operating under the fundamentalist 
hezbollah or party of god the longest held is terry anderson 42 
chief middle east correspondent for the ap who was kidnapped in 
march 1985 
two american hostages robert polhill and frank reed were 
released by their proiranian captors last month as a goodwill 
gesture 
since then however there have been contradictory statements 
from iran on any further releases president bush has refused to 
deal for freedom for the hostages who include six americans 
there was no immediate reaction to lahds offer from proiranian 
factions in lebanon or from iran 
iranian leaders hoping to improve ties with the west have said 
all hostages should be freed this year but radicals argue that 
holding hostages is a means of confronting the west which the

prime minister yitzhak shamir today ordered a 
gradual reopening of six palestinian universities in the occupied 
west bank and gaza strip 
the move is likely to improve israels relation with the united 
states which has been strained in recent weeks over shamirs 
stepped up settlement activity in the occupied lands and his 
refusal to accept us middle east peace proposals 
the army closed palestinian institutions of higher learning 
shortly after the palestinian uprising erupted in december 1987 
arguing they were hotbeds of antiisraeli violence 
but the united states and western europe sharply criticized the 
measure as collective punishment and the european parliament at 
one point recommended that scientific cooperation with israel be 
halted until the universities and colleges were reopened 
shamir spokesman avi pazner said the prime minister instructed 
his adviser for the occupied lands shmuel goren to meet today 
with the heads of the six universities to discuss the gradual 
reopening 
pazner said that we will open the first one university in 
the next few days but would not say which one there are five 
universities in the west bank and one in the gaza strip with a 
total of 18000 students 
pazner said that if the reopening of the first university passed 
without violence other institutions of higher learning would also 
reopen 
our aim is to restore normal life this will test whether we 
can get life back to normal as much as possible pazner told the 
associated press 
he denied that the decision was aimed at appeasing the 
administration of president bush but if it is wellreceived in 
the united states we will be very pleased he said 
sari nusseibeh considered by israel to be one of the leaders of 
the uprising said israel finally was responding to pressure from 
the united states and europe to reopen the universities 
he cited as an example the recent visit by czech president 
vaclav havelwho brought up the issue in talks with israeli leaders 
throughout the closure instruction has continued in socalled 
underground classes but attendance has been sporadic and the 
education they provide has been far below normal standards 
nothing is irreparable people were able to manage and so 
they will be able to pick up as soon as schools will reopen 
nusseibeh said 
sixteen colleges that also were closed shortly after the 
beginning of the uprising were reopened gradually over the past few 
months

civilization had come to an end with most of the places under 
complete darkness after the cyclone cut power supplies

adolescents with personality disturbances 
serious enough to be considered disorders usually are just going 
through a phase and outgrow them in a couple years a study 
presented to psychiatrists suggests 
another researcher called the findings a hopeful statement 
for exasperated parents of teenagers 
the study was presented monday to the annual meeting of the 
american psychiatric association by david bernstein a psychologist 
at the bronx veterans administration medical center and the mount 
sinai school of medicine 
he cautioned that for other youths with personality 
disturbances the troubles can be an early warning of longstanding 
difficulties so he said parents should consider getting the 
adolescent evaluated by a mental health professional if personality 
problems appear persistent 
the researchers focused on 10 types of personality disorder 
paranoid a tendency to view the actions of others as 
deliberately demeaning or threatening 
schizoid in which a person neither wants nor enjoys close 
relationships and often appears cold and aloof 
schizotypal a pervasive pattern of peculiarities in thoughts 
and behavior such as superstitiousness bizarre fantasies and 
preoccupations 
histrionic which involves excessive emotionality and 
attentionseeking 
narcissistic which includes a grandiose sense of 
selfimportance extreme sensitivity to criticism and inability to 
recognize how other people feel 
borderline an instability in selfimage mood and 
relationships with others 
avoidant a pervasive pattern of discomfort in social 
settings timidity and extreme fear of disapproval 
dependent which involves submissive behavior in a variety of 
contexts 
obsessivecompulsive a pattern of perfectionism and 
inflexibility in a variety of contexts 
passiveaggressive a pervasive tendency to resist meeting 
social and business obligations by such indirect means as 
procrastination or claiming to forget do to things 
such traits appear in many healthy people but can become a 
disorder if they form an inflexible pattern that significantly 
interferes with social or occupational functioning or causes the 
person distress 
the study included 776 participants drawn from two new york 
counties they were interviewed initially at ages 9 to 19 and 
again two years later 
researchers found that 17 percent could be diagnosed with at 
least one disorder including about onethird of 13yearolds 
but of the diagnosable participants 59 percent were free of any 
personality diagnosis two years later 
only 39 percent of participants diagnosable for 
passiveaggressive disorder in the initial interview met criteria 
for that disorder two years later and the other disorders were 
even less persistent 
bernstein did the research with colleague dr larry siever and 
patricia cohen and her colleagues at the new york state psychiatric 
institute 
the studys results do not mean that adolescent problems can be 
ignored cautioned dr daniel offer director of the center for the 
study of adolescence at michael reese hospital and medical center 
in chicago 
you have to take adolescent problems seriously some do grow 
out of it and some dont and you never know who will and who 
wont he said 
if the troubles are serious and affecting more than one area of 
an adolescents life a mental health professional should be 
consulted he said 
offer also said he thinks two years is too brief to be sure the 
problems are truly gone 
but he said the findings constitute a hopeful statement 
so many parents have so many negative experiences with 
teenage children and theyre so pessimistic that i think its nice 
to have that kind of statement he said

chancellor helmut kohl indicated today 
that elections for a united german government could be held as soon 
as december 
on sunday however he suffered a devastating loss in state 
elections and lost control of the upper house of parliament to the 
opposition social democrats eroding his power to dictate the terms 
and timing of german unification 
kohl suffered another setback over the weekend when experts from 
both germanys failed to agree on key aspects of unification 
the chancellor flew to west berlin later today for talks with 
east german premiere lothar de maiziere the two men were expected 
to discuss the pace of unification 
asked whether there could be allgerman elections this year 
kohl said today he was standing by west german federal 
elections on dec 2 but he also said there are discussions in 
east germany about holding allgerman elections this year 
kohl said he thought is was important to discuss the issue if 
that is whats desired 
government sources speaking on condition of anonymity said 
kohl was signaling that he did not exclude the possibility of 
allgerman elections before years end 
kohl was scheduled to meet this evening with de maiziere for 
their first formal talks on the increasingly tense unification 
process 
on sunday his christian democrats suffered defeats in two key 
states north rhinewestphalia and lower saxony 
the victories by the social democratic party gave kohls 
opponents control of the bundesrat the upper house of west 
germanys parliament 
the lower house the bundestag is the main lawmaking body the 
bundesrat acts only as a ratifying body for laws passed by the 
bundestag 
but kohls loss of seats could cause complications for his goal 
of quick unification the upper house no longer will be expected to 
rubber stamp legislation needed for quick unification 
the leftleaning social democrats have been trying to put the 
brakes on kohls push for swift unification which they say 
threatens the jobs and pocketbooks of germans in both countries 
by capturing the upper house of parliament the social democrats 
will have more influence over the pace of unification the vote 
also strengthens their bid to unseat kohl in national elections in 
december 
the east german social democrats said in a statement today the 
election outcome means the influence of social democratic 
policies on the unity process has become distinctly greater because 
of the election outcome 
the social fears of people in both parts of germany may no 
longer be ignored the statement said 
hansjochen vogel head of west germanys social democrats said 
late sunday the governing partys losses were a sign kohl was 
suffering for not taking into account west german concerns over 
unification 
many west germans fear they will pay for the hundreds of 
billions of marks needed to bail out the east german economy 
kohl called the results a disappointing defeat and 
acknowledged it may have been generated in part by uncertainty 
over unification costs 
he accused the leftists of waging a fear campaign 
the election losses came amid another jolt for kohl the 
failure of a team of experts from both germanys to agree on key 
aspects of unification 
late saturday delegations from both germanys completed the 
draft of a treaty that is to serve as the basis for the economic 
currency and social union of the countries by july 2 
dieter vogel spokesman for kohl said one of the touchiest 
unification issues whether to allow west germans to buy up east 
german property has been put on the back burner 
negotiations will be continued this week on a political 
level he said in bonn sunday 
the failure to agree on how to transfer east germanys 
stateowned property and industries to the private sector indicates 
de maiziere is reluctant to allow west german interests to buy up 
east germanys vast stateowned holdings 
de maiziere like kohl favors a quick shift to a free market 
and fast unification 
but he has been under pressure from east germanys social 
democrats who are part of his governing coalition to seek more 
social guarantees for east germans and slow the pace of talks 
west german social democrats have warned that unification has 
not been properly thought out and could lead to unemployment 
weakening of the west german mark and inflation 
specifics of the economic agreement reached this past weekend 
were not released but they likely will flesh out details of how 
west germanys currency will become the currency of east germany 
this summer 
west germany had agreed earlier to trade east german marks for 
west german marks at a 1to1 rate for salaries pensions and small 
savings accounts 
the west german newspaper welt am sonntag also reported on 
sunday that west germany agreed to provide more social guarantees 
to students and elderly people

president bush is still concerned about what 
he regards as hiring quotas in a major civil rights bill pending in 
congress but hopes for changes that will make the measure 
acceptable his spokesman said today 
the president would like to sign a civil rights bill we 
will be working toward that end white house spokesman marlin 
fitzwater said 
he made the comments shortly before bush sat down with black 
civil rights leaders at the first of a series of three meetings 
this week on the kennedyhawkins civil rights act of 1990 awaiting 
floor action in both the house and senate 
the justice department last month raised the threat of a veto 
over the quota issue the bill would undo a series of supreme court 
rulings last year that narrowed protections against job 
discrimination that minorities had enjoyed since the 1970s it also 
would expand protection for women 
house sponsors earlier this month adopted compromise language to 
meet employers concerns about having to defend their hiring 
patterns 
fitzwater said there have been changes in the right direction 
it appears to be moving closer to being acceptable 
the problem was that many of the provisions in the bill ended 
up mandating quotas in one way or another fitzwater said 
he said he would not repeat the veto threat at this juncture 
but said we had a very serious problem with the legal assumption 
that people were guilty until proven innocent the very basic kind 
of legal philosophy in this country is the opposite that youre 
innocent until proven guilty 
arthur a fletcher chairman of the civil rights commission 
said in an interview sunday that conservatives and the civil rights 
establishment were fighting a battle for the presidents mind 
bush in april urged congress to take less sweeping action to 
undo two of the supreme court rulings that narrowed protection 
against job discrimination 
the civil rights measures pose a critical test for the bush 
administration which has sought to improve relations with civil 
rights organizations that were frayed during the reagan years 
julius chambers directorcounsel of the naacp legal defense fund 
said sunday 
the course of action being urged by the justice department 
will drown out all the lofty rhetoric and finesounding speeches 
that we have heard from the oval office chambers warned in a 
speech at the university of north carolina law school 
the toxin of veto will poison all the wells of good feeling 
towards the president that have sprung up in the black 
community he said the leadership conference on civil rights 
which is spearheading the lobbying effort for passage of the bill 
provided a copy of chambers text 
fletcher in a telephone interview from norfolk va where he 
was attending a college commencement said the white house has 
arranged a series of meetings this week with outside groups 
including prominent black conservatives as well as the leadership 
of mainstream civil rights organizations 
bush also has a rose garden ceremony planned for thursday to 
honor fletcher and other members of the recently reconstituted 
civil rights commission mired in controversy for much of the 
reagan administration and nearly killed off by congress last year 
fletcher a moderate republican and former assistant secretary 
of labor in the nixon administration said the kennedyhawkins 
bill is more comprehensive in my view than the administration 
bill he emphasized that he was speaking only for himself not 
for the civil rights commission 
he said the conservatives do not want to authorize anything 
that smacks of quotas in hiring fletcher said he does not regard 
the kennedyhawkins bill as requiring quotas 
the bill would undo the supreme courts patterson vs mclean 
credit union ruling which narrowed the ability of minorities to 
win monetary damages for job discrimination 
it would also restore the burden of proof to defendants in cases 
where employers hiring practices had a discriminatory impact 
under a 1971 ruling in the case griggs vs duke power co the 
employers had the burden of proving their hiring practices were 
required by business necessity the high court in a case called 
wards cove packing co vs atonio undid that last year 
ralph g neas executive director of the leadership conference 
on civil rights claimed that the recent adoption of compromise

jordanian troops and riot police 
monday tossed tear gas and smoke bombs at demonstrators to stop 
them from crossing into the israelioccupied west bank during a 
propalestinian march 
there was nothing else for us to do a riot policeman on the 
scene said we had to stop them by force 
the 2500 protesters included scores of palestinians deported 
after israel seized the west bank from jordan in the 1967 war they 
broke away from a larger group of more than 20000 marchers 
hospital sources said at least 103 people were injured when the 
march called to promote arabisraeli peace and an independent 
palestinian state turned violent 
interior minister salem masadeh put the injury toll at only 52 
there no immediate explanation for the difference in figures given 
by the government and hospitals 
some elements probably due to ignorance have succeeded in 
ruining this march and its peaceful image for the good cause of the 
palestinians masadeh said in a telephone interview 
police fired machine guns in the air to disperse the 
demonstrators while the army tossed tear gas canisters from six 
tanks 
ambulances raced to the scene amid exploding smoke bombs and 
tear gas to evacuate the casualties to shuna hospital five miles 
north of the king husseinallenby bridge 
some of the injured appeared to have broken limbs a few were 
bleeding after being trampled when hysterical crowds ran in all 
directions 
most of casualties were unconscious after inhaling too much gas 
said shuna hospital sources insisting on anonymity they reported 
no gunshot wounds 
the barrage lasted about 1 hours and many teenagers were seen 
throwing stones at the tanks and the policemen 
it was not clear if any of the estimated 700 policemen or 300 
soldiers were injured 
the army and police had instructed the crowd to stop 700 yards 
from the bridge over the jordan river to avoid antagonizing the 
israelis on the other side 
but when the demonstrators arrived at that point after a 
onehour walk from hajjaj city three miles to the north some 
2500 demonstrators broke away and tried to run toward the wooden 
bridge 
the ground was scattered with palestinian flags portraits of 
palestinian figures and antiamerican and antiisraeli banners 
waved during the march 
the march was organized by 120 arab unions and professional 
associations to mark the 42nd anniversary of the united nations 
partition plan that sliced britishmandated palestine into jewish 
and arab states 
the participants included jordanian citizens arab trade 
unionists jordanian parliament members as well as palestinians 
roughly half of jordans 31 million people come from 
palestinian families who fled or were driven out during the 1948 
and 1967 arabisraeli wars 
the demonstrators waved banners saying america is the head of 
the snake other slogans read america is the number one enemy 
of the arabs as it is the strategic ally of the cancerous zionist 
entity 
the crowd chanted we want an independent palestine state amd 
homes to shelter our childrens as well as palestinian songs 
many waved the palestinian flag and portraits of khalil 
alwazir who was deputy commander of the palestine liberation 
organization he was killed by a commando unit widely believed to 
be israeli in april 1988

taiwan will send fighter planes and naval 
ships to patrol local waters when the radio ship goddess of 
democracy leaves port to beam prodemocracy messages to china 
local media reported monday 
military officials quoted by the liberal independence morning 
post and other newspapers reiterated pledges to protect the ship in 
taiwan waters but defense minister hau peitsun said there would 
be no escort once the vessel reaches international waters to begin 
the broadcasts 
the reports appeared one day after china again accused taiwan of 
supporting the illegal activities of the ship beijing has 
refused to rule out the use of force to stop the broadcasts 
organizers of the goddess of democracys trip said it would head 
for international waters thursday it is three days behind schedule 
because of difficulty obtaining taiwan customs approval to bring 
broadcasting equipment on board 
the ship sponsored by a coalition of french news organizations 
docked at the northern port of keelung on sunday it remained in 
the harbor monday to refuel and take on water and other supplies 
the goddess of democracy is named after the statue erected by 
prodemocracy demonstrators in tiananmen square in beijing last 
may it was destroyed during the june 4 military crackdown that 
left hundreds perhaps thousands of demonstrators dead 
the broadcasts are to include a taped message from chai ling 
one of the student leaders wanted by chinese authorities for 
leading the prodemocracy protests in beijing 
ms chai who escaped to france this year after 10 months in 
hiding in china will appeal to the beijing leadership not to 
suppress the peoples desire for democracy said hong kong 
journalist nancy li 
chinas paramount leader deng xiaoping thought we wanted him 
to be killed ms li quoted ms chai as saying but all we 
wanted was to live a better life we just wanted to ask him 
arent you interested in letting people have a better life 
ms li who plans to board the ship to help broadcast said the 
programs also will tell chinese people about the protests that have 
toppled communist regimes in eastern europe 
it will be good for the chinese people to know there were 
other ways to handle protests she said 
project organizers have expressed concern that authorities will 
refuse to let prominent chinese dissident yan jiaqi who arrived in 
taiwan last week board the ship to make broadcasts local 
newspapers also said the government will not allow broadcasters 
recruited in taiwan to participate 
taiwans nationalist government has refused to support the 
vessel saying its plan to make unauthorized broadcasts is a 
violation of international law taiwan officials say the ship will 
not be allowed to return to refuel in taiwan if it goes ahead with 
its plans 
the nationalists retreated to taiwan in 1949 after losing a 
civil war to communist forces in mainland china while the two 
sides remain technically at war indirect trade and civilian 
contacts have increased greatly in recent years

the white house said today that efforts to 
strike a budget deal with congress a pact that chief of staff john 
sununu says could include tax increases will take weeks if not 
months 
i look for this to be a longer process rather than a shorter 
process presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater said on the eve 
of the first budget summit session 
fitzwater said that bush will kick off tuesdays 2 pm meeting 
in the white house with opening remarks certainly welcoming the 
group and applauding their coming together to help solve this 
important problem 
after that the fun starts fitzwater added 
he said bush has points he wants to make at the opening 
meeting hell have general goals about getting the deficit 
down 
however fitzwater said bush would not lay down an opening 
proposal as such 
bush planned to meet today with budget direct richard g darman 
and defense secretary dick cheney to help prepare himself for the 
budget talks meanwhile darman was to meet with house majority 
leader richard gephardt dmo to work out meeting procedures 
fitzwater said 
fitzwater said that budget negotiators would meet as frequently 
as daily until agreement was reached but he added it will go 
on probably weeks if not months it is not the kind of thing where 
anybody expects to run in and throw a proposal on the table and 
vote on it 
its going to be painstakingly worked out sentence by sentence 
and debate by debate over a longer period of time 
fitzwater would not discuss the possibility that the budget 
summit might result in tax increases even though sununu said on 
sunday that tax increases were a possibility but no certainty 
but while not commenting on sununus words fitzwater said i 
can assure you that president bush has the highest confidence in 
john sununu and is delighted with the quality of his work 
it is a budget summit not a tax summit sununu said sunday 
as he sought to calm the storm over his earlier remarks indicating 
that president bush had no intention of deviating from his 
nonewtaxes campaign pledge 
the chairmen of the house and senate budget committees indicated 
sunday that gunshy democrats will insist that bush take the lead 
in proposing any tax increases 
rep leon e panetta chairman of the house budget committee 
said if there are any tax increases in the final package it will 
be because bush wants them there 
i can assure you that the issue of taxes are not going to be 
raised or discussed or approved unless the president thinks that 
theyre necessary for deficit reduction panetta said on cbs 
face the nation 
sen james sasser dtenn chairman of the senate budget 
committee said he did not intend to be the first to suggest 
raising taxes and i dont think the democrats will 
bush would have to propose revenues and the president 
would have to help sell those revenues to the congress and to the 
american people sasser said on abcs this week with david 
brinkley 
sununu who appeared on nbcs meet the press told reporters 
last week that it was the democrats prerogative to put tax 
increases on the bargaining table and its our prerogative to say 
no 
sununu said sunday that reporters had mistakenly assumed that 
there would be taxes in a final budget the fact is theres no 
preconditions means theres a possibility but no certainty 
richard darman the white house budget director said we 
shouldnt consider a tax increase independently of major budget 
process reform 
darman speaking on the brinkley show said bush would like to 
emerge from the summit with lineitem veto authority the ability 
to kill spending on specific projects or programs without striking 
down an entire appropriations bill 
darman said a realistic goal for the negotiators is finding 
budget savings of 45 billion to 55 billion in the first year 
darman warned last week the deficit for fiscal 1991 could run as 
much as 100 billion over the 64 billion allowed by grammrudman 
its not going to be sensible to try to contract that much in 
one year said darman but lets say 50 billion

the superpowers are about to commit an act 
theyve tried mightily to avoid throughout 45 years of cold war an 
intercontinental nuclear exchange 
this one though will be friendly 
nuclear missiles of the type the united states and the soviet 
union had aimed across the eastwest divide but are now 
withdrawing are to be propped up painted and polished side by 
side in museums in washington and moscow 
its a small sign of fastchanging times in which military 
competition is lessening and new symbols of superpower cooperation 
are replacing cold war confrontation 
a soviet ss20 and an american pershing 2 minus their nuclear 
warheads will be displayed at the smithsonian institutions 
national air and space museum theyll stand in the milestones of 
flight gallery amid such aviation icons as the 1903 wright 
brothers original flier the spirit of st louis and a replica of 
sputnik 1 the soviet satellite that was the first manmade object 
placed in earths orbit 
a separate exhibit in the museums space hall will display 
pictures of the missiles copies of the intermediaterange nuclear 
forces or inf treaty which governs destruction of the missiles 
and their launchers and chunks of destroyed inf missiles 
the space hall exhibit will be titled do veri no pro veri 
the russian proverb meaning trust but verify was 
thenpresident reagans favorite way of describing the central 
message of the inf treaty he signed dec 7 1987 
the exhibit opens june 20 a similar display is due to open at 
moscows central armed forces museum the citys main military 
museum sometime this summer 
on thursday a team of american officials will arrive in moscow 
to swap a disarmed pershing 2 for the ss20 that will be shipped in 
five pieces to the smithsonian later this month soviet 
technicians are to fly to washington to assemble the ss20 whose 
54foot length will barely fit inside the museum the slimmer 
lighter faster and more modern pershing 2 is 34 feet long 
smithsonian officials had wanted the missiles in place by the 
time soviet president mikhail s gorbachev arrived in washington 
may 30 for a summit meeting with president bush said gregg herken 
chairman of the museums space history department 
but bureaucratic obstacles set back the original schedule and 
herken said it was not certain whether the exhibit would be 
finished before gorbachev leaves june 3 
its possible well be assembling the ss20 here while the 
summit is going on he said adding that it will be the first 
soviet missile ever displayed at the smithsonian 
herken acknowledged that the exhibit is a departure from the air 
and space museums usual practice of showcasing peaceful advances 
in technology and human accomplishment he said the museum wanted 
to commemorate not the missiles themselves but the landmark 
agreement that brought about their destruction 
that is an icon of human achievement he said 
the ss20 is the main soviet missile being destroyed under terms 
of the inf treaty which banned all us and soviet landbased 
nuclear missiles with ranges of 310 to 3410 miles the american 
missiles in this category are the pershing 2 and tomahawk 
groundlaunched cruise missiles deployed in five european nato 
countries 
the ss20 which moscow began deploying in 1979 carries three 
nuclear warheads with a total destructive power of 750 kilotons 
the equivalent of 750000 tons of tnt that is about 50 times more 
powerful than the atomic bomb that destroyed hiroshima in 1945 
the singlewarhead pershing 2 carried a 50kiloton warhead and 
was deployed in west germany starting in 1983 
the idea for exchanging inf missiles and putting them on public 
display began with two air and space museumcurators frank winter 
and paul ceruzzi who noticed a 1988 newspaper article on the inf 
treaty that said both sides would be allowed to keep up to 15 
disarmed missiles for static display 
herken said that before the slippage in the exhibit schedule he 
had tried to interest the bush administration in using the missile 
display during the summit as a backdrop for a joint appearance by 
the leaders herken said the white house seemed willing but 
unofficial word was that the kremlin wouldnt go along 
we understand privately that gorbachev doesnt want to be 
photographed next to a missile he said

mayor david dinkins condemned eye for an eye 
violence after a gang of blacks attacked three vietnamese they 
mistook for koreans fracturing one mans skull blocks from a black 
boycott of two korean stores 
the attack in brooklyn early sunday was the latest in a string 
of incidents that have heightened racial tensions in the city 
an eye for an eye a tooth for a tooth will leave us all 
toothless and blind the mayor said in his second appeal for 
racial calm since friday 
the vietnamese men were set upon by 10 to 15 blacks shouting 
antikorean slurs authorities said tuan ana cao 36 was hit with 
a baseball bat and was in guarded condition today with a skull 
fracture at kings county hospital 
police announced early this afternoon that there had been one 
arrest but gave no details pending a news conference later 
initially authorities said it appeared the attack began as a 
robbery attempt and escalated into racial violence but cao said no 
robbery attempt occurred before the attack police said there 
apparently had been a misunderstanding 
a few blocks from the site of the attack two koreanamerican 
grocery stores have been boycotted by blacks since jan 18 when a 
black woman allegedly was roughed up by personnel in one of the 
stores after she refused to let them look in her purse 
as the mayor spoke sunday two juries in brooklyn were 
deliberating charges against two young white men accused of 
murdering a black 16yearold who had entered the mostly white 
bensonhurst section to look at a used car aug 23 
the juries resumed deliberations this morning 
cao told police someone threw a bottle through a window and that 
he and two other vietnamese went outside to see what was going on 
and saw 10 to 15 blacks one of them yelling antikorean slurs and 
shouting get out of america 
the gang attacked the men and fled before police arrived 
cao interviewed by new york newsday at the hospital sunday 
said he heard shouts of kill him kill the koreans kill the 
chinese go back home he said he was shocked by the brutality of 
the attack adding in halting english i dont understand 
cao said he was unable to see much because his glasses were 
broken during the beating 
the mayor visited cao at the hospital and called for legislation 
to increase penalties for mob violence he also asked business 
religious and civic leaders to help quell the unrest 
cao said he had been mugged four times in the neighborhood but 
there was no robbery preceding the attack as police initially 
reported police said the erroneous report may have come about 
because cao was disoriented because of his injuries or had been 
misunderstood by an interpreter 
officers plan to reinterview cao as his condition improves said 
officer kim royster a police spokeswoman

tens of thousands of people including president 
francois mitterrand and survivors of the holocaust marched 
silently through paris tonight protesting the recent desecrations 
of jewish cemeteries 
many wore yellow stars of david 
the march initially was organized in response to vandalism last 
week at a cemetery in the southern town of carpentras where tombs 
were smashed and a recently buried body dug up and mutilated 
another desecration was discovered early today at a cemetery near 
paris where obscenities and swastikas were painted in red on more 
than 30 tombs 
mitterrands presence not announced in advance was believed 
to mark the first time since world war ii that a french president 
had joined a public demonstration 
premier michel rocard chief rabbi joseph sitruk and roman 
catholic cardinal albery decourtray were among the throng of 
marchers who left from the the place de la republique rocard said 
he wanted to help show the world that frances true image was 
one of tolerance 
at the request of jewish leaders the countrys six largest tv 
networks agreed to broadcast tonight night and fog a 
documentary about nazi death camps 
the coalition of jewish groups organizing the procession asked 
that marchers display only authorized banners and posters with the 
slogan no to racism no to antisemitism 
leaders of every major political party except the extremeright 
national front urged supporters to participate as did human rights 
groups and many major labor unions 
police meanwhile appealed for witnesses to assist in their 
investigation of the desecration in carpentras five skinheads were 
released after being questioned about the crime 
the desecration there provoked outrage across france 
in haifa israel over the weekend about 300 graves were 
spraypainted with antijewish slogans and police said a jew from 
a nearby town had been arrested as a suspect thousands of people 
went to the cemetery sunday and relatives wept at the graves of 
their dead 
in lund sweden 15 tombstones marking the graves of world war 
ii refugees were toppled at a churchyard cemetery during the 
weekend a church official said today the graves were not of jews 
but that the vandalism may have been inspired by the other 
desecrations 
police sealed off the carpentras cemetery today without 
explanation and the widow of the man whose body was dug up 
reportedly left carpentras after having received telephoned death 
threats 
interior minister pierre joxe along with other political and 
human rights leaders has accused farright politician jeanmarie 
le pen of implicit responsibility in the desecration by creating an 
atmosphere of racial hatred

the buildup of carbon dioxide and other 
gases in the atmosphere will disrupt agriculture even if it doesnt 
produce a significant temperature rise a researcher said monday 
many researchers believe that the carbon dioxide buildup from 
use of fossil fuels and destruction of forests will raise 
temperatures at least several degrees during the next few decades 
some researchers dispute that however their view has been used 
by the bush administration to justify a waitandsee response to 
the socalled greenhouse effect 
fakhri bazzaz a harvard university biologist argued at a 
rockefeller foundation symposium on agricultural research that the 
carbon dioxide buildup will have a direct effect on farms and 
forests even if it doesnt raise temperatures 
the cornfields in illinois are not independent of the fate of 
the tropical forests he said 
while researchers might disagree over the temperature effects of 
the carbon dioxide buildup no one disagrees about the carbon 
dioxide buildup itself 
several decades of research have shown that carbon dioxide 
already has increased substantially and is continuing to increase 
researchers say 
bazzaz who has grown plants in enclosures with air rich in 
carbon dioxide has found that the plants grow faster but that 
their leaves may be less nutritious 
leafy vegetables eaten by humans may change their chemistry so 
much that they will become unpalatable he said 
the accelerated growth of plants in response to increased carbon 
dioxide might seem beneficial but that means increases in weed 
growth as well as crop growth he said 
plants will grow faster only if they get more nutrients from the 
soil along with the increased carbon dioxide in the atmosphere he 
said 
in some circumstances weeds may be more easily able to overcome 
crops because the weeds will respond better to the increased carbon 
dioxide 
because the plants leaves will contain less nitrogen insects 
will have to eat more of the leaves to get the nutrients they need 
thus crop losses to insects may increase bazzaz said 
plants will decompose more slowly his experiments show so it 
will take longer for nutrients to be replaced in the soil 
these observations mean that it might be necessary to increase 
the use of fertilizers and pesticides he said 
in natural areas such as tropical rain forests the complex 
relationships among different species will change leading some to 
dominate and others to become extinct he said 
one possibly beneficial effect is that plants may be able to 
survive with less watering or less rainfall 
the point of all these findings he said is that there are a 
lot of uncertainties here there is a great need for more 
research 
simple predictions that increased carbon dioxide will lead to 
more rapid plant growth and thus benefit agriculture are naive he 
said much more must be learned about the response of individual 
plants and entire ecosystems to the changes he said 
however that does not justify government inaction he said 
the notion that we dont know enough lets wait for more 
research is not a good one we need immediate action

soviet president mikhail s gorbachev today 
rejected independence moves by latvia and estonia declaring the 
measures illegal 
in presidential decrees read on the nightly news program 
vremya gorbachev said latvias may 4 declaration of 
independence and estonias march 30 declaration that it was an 
occupied country violated soviet law and the constitution 
he did not indicate what he would do to counter the independence 
measures 
the baltic states of latvia lithuania and estonia were forcibly 
annexed by the soviet union in 1940 
lithuania declared its independence march 11 and the kremlin 
responded by imposing an economic blockade on the republic 
latvia and estonia passed more cautious measures allowing for 
an unspecified transition period to independence but gorbachevs 
response showed their moves were equally unacceptable 
the presidential decrees in legal language and read by an 
announcer listed which points of the law and constitution the 
estonian and latvian measures violated 
gorbachev rebuked the republics saying estonia had acted 
without having consulted with the people of the republic 
ignoring its existing economic political cultural and legal 
ties with the soviet union he latvia also had gone against 
the rights and interests of other subjects of the soviet 
federation 
gorbachev said latvias decree was invalid from the moment of 
its passage and issued a similar ruling about the estonian 
measure 
his announcement came a day after lithuanian president vytautas 
landsbergis said the three baltic leaders had sent a letter to 
gorbachev and president bush asking them to take our problem 
into their hearts 
he declined to release the text of what he called a diplomatic 
communication but said the baltic leaders also asked gorbachev to 
meet with them 
the presidents of the three republics met saturday to 
reestablish a 56yearold political bloc and form a united front 
in their bid for secession from the soviet union 
lithuanian prime minister kazimiera prunskiene returning from a 
16day tour of western capitals told reporters in moscow sunday 
that she would propose that the republics parliament suspend laws 
implementing its march 11 declaration of independence 
mrs prunskiene also said she believed she had gained de facto 
recognition of her breakaway republic from western governments 
during her trip abroad traveling as a private citizen she met in 
the united states with bush and with leaders in canada france 
britain and west germany 
although she was warmly received the west in general has 
adopted a cautious attitude toward the situation in lithuania not 
wanting to cause more problems for gorbachev as he wrestles with 
domestic reform 
mrs prunskiene said lithuania was prepared to suspend those of 
its new laws that concern moscow most as a precondition for talks 
and expected the kremlin to lift its economic blockade of the 
republic of 38 million 
the kremlins economic sanctions have caused an energy shortage 
and resulted in the layoffs of 12000 workers according to 
official reports

the staff at the west overton museum 
didnt think people would miss it when they retired one of the 
oddities on display a twoheaded calf 
the heads mounted on a board after the calf was born in 1922 
had been displayed from 1930 to 1987 at the museum which 
specializes in exhibits of farm and industrial implements used in 
southwestern pennsylvania 
over the years the relic was popular with museumgoers 
especially children who passed by other industrial and agricultural 
artifacts to gape 
still the staff didnt think anyone would notice when the head 
was taken down and stored because it was deteriorating said 
kimberly bringe the museums director 
they were wrong parents who had seen the calf as children 
repeatedly asked about it and several people offered to buy the 
piece 
i think people are naturally attracted to oddities ms 
bringe said she had the display reconditioned by a taxidermist 
and it was put up for the museums summer season opening tuesday 
its like a shrine said ms bringe i call it the divine 
bovine

howard ross hale who as a western 
union telegrapher relayed reporter hl menckens stories of the 
1925 scopes monkey trial has died at age 85 
hale who died saturday was among eight telegraphers who 
transmitted stories on the trial in which school teacher john t 
scopes was charged with illegally teaching darwins theory of 
evolution 
hale estimated the telegraphers sent about 175000 words daily 
until the 11day trial in the sweltering rhea county courthouse 
ended july 21 1925 
it wasnt until later that hale realized he had been assigned to 
handle the copy of the most famous reporter at the trial mencken 
of the evening sun of baltimore 
i think i transmitted every dispatch he wrote for the sun 
hale said in a 1985 intervew but i didnt pay much attention to 
what was in the stories 
i do remember that he was critical of defense attorney 
clarence darrow for popping his suspenders and that was a little 
surprising because most of his comments about darrow were favorable 
and i remember that mencken strutted around like a big gobbler 
turkey and demanded that his stories be given first priority 
hale is survived by his wife elsie parker hale four sisters 
and a brother a service is scheduled for tuesday

relatives of persons killed in the 1988 
bombing of pan am flight 103 said monday they hope to see tough 
proposals for preventing terrorism when a presidential commission 
issues its findings tuesday 
the report to president bush is expected to recommend changes in 
the federal aviation administrations security operations and to 
criticize the faa the state department and pan american world 
airways 
the sevenmember commission investigated government and airline 
actions before and after the bombing which killed all 259 people 
aboard the boeing 747 and 11 people on the ground in lockerbie 
scotland 
investigators have said the jet was downed by a plastic 
explosive concealed in a cassette tape player 
the ninemonth inquiry did not address criminal aspects of the 
dec 21 1988 bombing or attempt to evaluate us participation in 
the british investigation which has yet to produce any charges 
bush created the commission after relatives called for a full 
congressional inquiry 
some relatives already have been critical of what they fear the 
report will contain others have said they are cautiously 
optimistic 
ted reina whose daughter jocelyn was a flight attendant on the 
jetliner said he was concerned the commission could send the 
right signal to terrorists and the wrong signal to the traveling 
public if it slows faamandated installation of sophisticated 
bomb detectors at highrisk airports 
commission members have said the faa has not adequately 
encouraged other technologies 
paul hudson of albany ny whose daughter melina died in the 
bombing said he hopes the commission will ask for tough security 
reforms 
hudson who heads one of two victims groups said he expects 
the commissions work to lead to changes in state department 
consular affairs which already has acknowledged mistakes in its 
dealings with victims relatives 
aphrodite tsairis of franklin lakes nj representing the 
other victims group said we are looking for a strong 
indictment that says the pan am bombing was clearly preventable 
the commission which includes four members of congress and is 
headed by former labor secretary ann mclaughlin has tried to 
determine whether errors by any federal agency the airline or 
others might have allowed the bombing to occur 
commission investigators have said however that they found no 
smoking gun that would lead them to assess blame 
commission members did during hearings strongly criticize the 
faa and pan am for security flaws and the state department for 
falldowns in the notification of next of kin and return of personal 
belongings to relatives 
the commission has no enforcement powers but has drawn up about 
60 recommendations into a report of more than 150 pages according 
to staff members 
faa officials speaking on condition of anonymity said they 
expect the report to be critical of the agency which has worldwide 
responsibility for the security of us airlines 
chairwoman mclaughlin met with transportation secretary samuel 
skinner last week to brief him on the report but a department 
spokesman said there was no indepth discussion and that skinner 
did not get a copy 
a congressional source said the panel recommends a revamp of the 
faas security office to give it higher visibility 
the commission held five public hearings in washington and 
traveled to europe for interviews with aviation and airline 
officials in france germany and britain flight 103 originated in 
frankfurt and switched to a different airliner in london before 
leaving for new york 
other commission members besides mclaughlin include sens frank 
lautenberg dnj and alfonse damato rny reps james 
oberstar dminn and john paul hammerschmidt dark retired air 
force gen thomas c richards and edward hidalgo an attorney and 
former assistant navy secretary

a swedish news magazine was ordered 
monday to pay 12500 to retired tennis star bjorn borg for 
defaming him by reporting allegations that he used cocaine 
the verdict and unusually stiff sentence followed the 
nonbinding recommendation last week of a jury to convict the 
magazine z for printing the allegations 
the allegations were from borgs former girlfriend jannicke 
bjorling who is involved in a custody dispute with him over the 
couples son robin 
a special press court also fined the monthlys editor in chief 
830 and ordered the magazine to publish an apology borg was to 
receive 25000 in court costs 
borg a fivetime wimbledon champion is still a sports hero in 
sweden though he retired from professional tennis in 1983 and 
remains aloof from the public he has been involved in four other 
court cases this year related to his troubled fashion business or 
gossip magazine 
the verdict is extremely important for borg now he can feel 
that the swedish people look up to him as the silent but strong 
person he is borgs lawyer henning sjostrom told the national 
news agency tt 
the jury was instructed to ignore the issue of whether ms 
bjorlings accusations might be true and to rule only on whether 
the magazine should have published her unsubstantiated charges 
borg denied that he ever used drugs 
the magazine said it had several other sources to confirm that 
borg used drugs but their identities were never disclosed

a scandal over the shipment of 
israeli arms to a colombian drug lord has become a political 
bombshell in this tourist haven where the ruling family has 
weathered previous scandals 
the island gained international notoriety in the late 1970s for 
allowing the testing of weapons for south africa it was in the 
news again in the early 1980s for harboring fugitive american 
financier robert vesco 
now israel has accused prime minister vere birds eldest son 
vere jr 54 of ordering weapons for antiguas 80man army that 
mysteriously ended up in the hands of colombias medellin drug 
cartel 
vere jr a cabinet minister has denied wrongdoing but resigned 
his cabinet post pending the outcome of a judicial inquiry the 
equivalent of a us grand jury investigation 
another son of the prime minister lester 52 deputy prime 
minister and sometime rival of his older brother is spearheading 
the local investigation shrugging off any possible conflict of 
interest 
the bird family which has dominated the islands politics for 
more than three decades and grown wealthy while doing it has long 
been accused of corruption in connection with developing the 
islands booming tourist industry but this affair with its 
suggestion of a government link with the sinister world of 
international drug trafficking and gunrunning is a bombshell by 
comparison 
this latest one shocked us to the core said anglican 
archbishop orland lindsay 
tim hector a leftist opposition leader said he thought the 
nation could be in danger of a coup if the prime ministers son 
were charged 
i believe we are teetering on the brink of a possible 
military seizure of power and control by vere bird jr he 
said vere jr is said to command the armys loyalty 
last month israel said it had shipped weapons to the caribbean 
island in april 1989 on the understanding they would be used 
exclusively by the antigua defense force 
israel said the arms were ordered by vere jr who identified 
himself as the minister of national security there is no such 
ministry but vere jr does act informally as his fathers national 
security adviser 
the antiguan investigation determined that the weapons arrived 
here on april 24 1989 and were shipped the same day to santa 
marta colombia 
colombian officials say soldiers found 232 israelimade weapons 
in february during a search of ranches seized from gonzalo 
rodrigues gacha a reputed kingpin of the medellin cartel who was 
killed in a gunbattle with police last december 
the weapons included machine guns submachine guns assault 
rifles pistols shoulderfired rockets and infrared night scopes 
the outlet a weekly newspaper published by hectors antigua 
caribbean liberation movement said the weapons deal was arranged 
by two israelis maurice sarfati and col yair klein 
sarfati a former israeli army officer once operated a melon 
farm in antigua but went bankrupt and reportedly is being sought by 
us authorities for defaulting on 13 million in loans 
colombian officials have accused klein a reserve officer in the 
israeli army of organizing training and equipping paramilitary 
groups and declared him a fugitive from justice 
klein said in israel that the arms shipment was originally 
intended for a training school he wanted to set up in antigua for 
panamanian rebels opposed to gen manuel antonio noriega who was 
ousted by us forces last december 
when plans for the school fell through klein said the 
panamanians wanted the weapons shipped to panama but somehow they 
were diverted to colombia 
many questions remain among them whether anyone in the antiguan 
government was aware the arms shipment was headed for colombia 
in antigua a former british colony of 80000 only nine miles 
wide and 12 miles long the government is largely a function of one 
family the birds 
vere bird sr the 80yearold prime minister first rose to 
prominence in the 1930s as a union organizer in the days of 
colonial sugar plantations and has led the nation all but five of 
the past 34 years his antigua labor party controls 15 of the 17 
seats in parliament 
vere jr is the minister of public works and communication 
lester the deputy prime minister is also leader of the ruling 
party and minister of foreign affairs economic development 
tourism and energy 
antiguans take it for granted that either lester or vere jr 
will succeed their father who is in declining health and many 
believe the outcome of this scandal could help settle the matter 
the brothers both britishtrained lawyers have both weathered 
previous scandals 
in 1987 vere jr was implicated but never charged in an 
investigation of a government project to repave the runway of the 
islands airport he had formed a private company to carry out the 
project which was supposed to cost no more than 35 million but 
ended up costing 115 million 
it was lester who helped vesco when the fugitive surfaced in 
antigua in 1982 with a bizarre plan to buy half of barbuda 
antiguas small sister island and establish a principality called 
the sovereign order of new aragon 
vere jr is widely regarded as his fathers favorite lester 
who was an allamerican long jumper at the university of michigan 
in 1960 is seen as the brighter of the two 
in separate interviews the brothers played down their rivalry 
and the possible impact of the scandal on their political futures 
i clearly had no intention of reducing this matter to a 
question of a fight for power within the domestic situation 
lester said after all he is still my brother 
vere jr would not discuss specifics of the case but said 
ive never been associated with anything of the kind and would 
never be 
about his relationship with his brother he said whenever i 
meet him its a most amicable relationship when we leave i 
dont know what transpires 
the antigua government has hired a washington dc attorney 
e lawrence barcella jr to head a team that has flown to israel 
to get evidence a british jurist louis blomcooper has been 
named to conduct a judicial inquiry which is expected to open 
hearings in june

a woman who has been charged with drunken 
driving 18 times was sentenced monday to a maximum five years in 
prison drawing an outraged reaction from the prosecutor 
its just disgusting said assistant state attorney lisa 
porter its an insult to society this case is just 
incredible 
dollie louise fazekas is to begin serving the sentence after 
completing a oneyear term imposed last month in another county for 
violating probation on a previous dui charge prosecutors expected 
the 46yearold defendant to serve about 18 months of the new 
sentence counting credit for good behavior and time routinely 
deducted from sentences because of prison crowding 
during the past 15 years she has used 14 aliases nine social 
security numbers and six dates of birth according to authorities 
last month her drivers license was revoked for life 
ms porter concedes there is no record of anyone being injured 
in three accidents listed on a sixpage printout of ms fazekas 
traffic record but the relatively short prison term for such a 
repeat offender shows the need for legislative reform the 
prosecutor argued 
its a problem for the people of the state of florida ms 
porter said when youve got the dollie fazekases running around 
in cars and no way to punish them

communist rebels warned americans 
monday to go home and police clashed with protesters as us 
and philippine negotiators began talks on the future of six 
american military bases in the country 
at least 42 people were arrested and five hospitalized in manila 
as police clashed with antibases protesters during daylong rallies 
the bases talks opened one day after assailants believed to be 
communist guerrillas killed two us airmen near clark air base 50 
miles north of manila 
no one claimed responsibility for the killings but us and 
philippine officials suspect the rebels the state department said 
monday the united states was shocked and saddened by the 
murders which it said were aimed at disrupting the talks 
the negotiations will determine whether the united states can 
retain clark air base the subic bay naval base and four smaller 
installations after the lease expires sept 16 1991 
president corazon aquino has refused to say whether she supports 
an extension of the lease in december us jets from clark helped 
suppress a military revolt that nearly toppled her fouryear 
administration 
during the opening session monday chief us negotiator richard 
armitage said the united states will remain a power in the pacific 
regardless of the outcome of the talks they are expected to last 
until the end of the year 
armitage a former assistant secretary of defense urged the 
philippines to decide whether the bases serve its defense interests 
armitage said that if the philippines wants the bases closed 
leave we shall as expeditiously as possible and with our pride 
fully intact 
in a sometimes caustic opening statement foreign secretary raul 
manglapus chief philippine negotiator said the united states has 
often fallen short of its financial commitments to the philippines 
he said tens of thousands of filipinos died fighting the 
japanese in world war ii not to save the philippines but to 
keep the war from reaching australia and eventually the american 
mainland 
even before the filipino soldier had finished fighting and 
dying for america he was judged by the american congress to be 
worth only half of the pay of the american soldier manglapus 
said 
us and philippine officials had expressed fears that the 
communist new peoples army would try to kill americans to disrupt 
the talks 
late sunday assailants shot and killed airman john h raven 
19 of delta junction alaska and airman james c green 20 of 
craig colo outside a hotel near clark a companion airman 1c 
randall moore 23 escaped 
they were among 280 airmen and support personnel assigned to the 
8th aircraft generation squadron on temporary duty from kunsan air 
base 110 miles south of seoul south korea 
police capt gener manguni said it appeared the rebels were 
responsible for the killings because of the style of the attack 
two or three filipinos approached the americans and shot them in 
the back of their heads with 45caliber pistols the rebels 
favored weapon in street killings 
on monday us officials canceled offpost leaves for the 
40000 troops military dependents and defense department civilians 
at all six bases 
in a statement to news organizations the new peoples army 
denounced the bases talks 
go home immediately or suffer the agony of attrition the 
rebels said the npa pledges that all its territorial and unit 
commands all officers and men will carry out their mission to 
the last man if necessary of expelling us imperialism out of 
our country 
the rebels are believed to have killed eight americans since 
april 1989 
most surveys show that supporters of the bases outnumber 
opponents but opposition is growing because of filipino 
nationalism and congress decision to cut aid to the country

congress however cut 96 million from the bush administration 
aid request for the philippines filipino officials see that as a 
breach of the agreement

at issue manglapus said the bilateral relations of any two 
nations can look forward to no significant future if no one can 
count on the others word 
manglapus said the philippines appreciated washingtons 
budgetary problems but suggested the united states reduce military 
spending to provide more money for aid

nicaraguan president violeta chamorro sent an 
urgent plea to president bush for the 300 million in aid pending 
in congress the white house said monday 
presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater said bush in response 
to mrs chamorros cable called the speaker of the house rep 
thomas s foley dwash earlier monday to reiterate his 
unhappiness with congress pace on the bill 
the president expressed to the speaker his strong feelings 
that congress has toyed with this bill and has ignored the real 
problems in panama and nicaragua fitzwater said 
he said foley told bush he would do his best to move the 
legislation 
the aid for nicaragua which includes money to help disband and 
repatriate the contra rebels along with bushs companion 500 
million request for panama has been snarled in congress for two 
months 
other measures added to the legislation ranging from space 
research to grasshopper control have increased its total price tag 
to 3 billion 
and the senate added to the bill a vetothreatened provision to 
allow the district of columbia to pay for poor womens abortions 
fitzwater called congressional delay on the measure 
outrageous and accused congress of turning its back on people 
with a real crying need 
lets get it down here and get on with the task fitzwater 
said 
in her cable to bush mrs chamorro lays out a very 
humanitarian plea fitzwater said 
she expressed a sense of emergency to bush fitzwater said 
this democracy is having enough troubles taking over from a 
communist regime making all the adjustments in management policy 
and philosophy without having to also face the fact that the 
people are very much in need of this support and aid in terms of 
everything from food clothing housing all sorts of things 
fitzwater said 
the request also includes money for farm equipment seed and 
fertilizer for health and education programs for energy 
purchases and for manufacturing equipment and spare parts 
fitzwater said that mrs chamorro also mentioned that strikes in 
her country by civil servants loyal to the old sandinista regime 
were posing a very serious problem to her twoweek old 
government 
the spokesman while renewing the administrations appeal for 
congressional action on the bill said that bush will still veto 
the measure if it arrives on his desk with the senate abortion 
provision

supreme court justices setting the stage for 
a decision with major political implications joined lawyers in 
spirited arguments monday over flag burning patriotism and freedom 
of expression 
in arguments before the justices the bush administrations top 
courtroom lawyer solicitor general kenneth starr argued that a 
new federal law to protect old glory does not violate free speech 
any more than a regulation limiting an outdoor loudspeakers volume 
congress can protect those things that are special to us as a 
people starr said nothing prohibits the legislature from 
protecting symbols against physical attack 
but civil rights attorney william kunstler said respect for 
the flag must be voluntary once people are compelled to respect a 
symbol they are no longer free 
the law the flag protection act of 1989 was congress response 
to the high courts 54 ruling last june that struck down a texas 
law banning flag burning and desecration 
the court is expected to rule by late june or early july if the 
law is struck down a proposed constitutional amendment to protect 
the flag likely would become a leading issue in congressional and 
state legislative races this fall 
outside the court monday demonstrators exchanged taunts and 
slogans 
shawn eichman arrested last year for burning a flag here said 
im just one of the thousands of women who is taking a cold hard 
look at the system defending us women have less protection 
than a flag 
six opposing demonstrators carried a sign saying flag burning 
is a hate crime the two groups stood just feet apart as they 
chanted and shouted at each other but there was no violence 
justice harry a blackmun seen by sponsors of the federal law 
as a potential swing vote was silent throughout mondays arguments 
blackmun voted last year to strike down the texas law but in a 
1974 ruling he indicated he might go along with some laws to 
protect the flags physical integrity 
justice antonin scalia who last june voted to invalidate the 
texas law pounced on starrs argument that the federal law is not 
aimed at a particular viewpoint 
in fact there is only one viewpoint expressed by flag 
burners scalia interjected i hate america 
you do not deface defile or trample the flag to show your 
love for the country scalia added as laughter filled the crowded 
courtroom 
justice anthony m kennedy who also voted last year to strike 
down the texas law noted demonstrators in eastern europe defaced 
their countries flags to protest communist regimes 
would you be concerned if eastern european countries punished 
people for demonstrating with a defaced flag kennedy asked 
starr its almost an internationally recognized form of 
protest 
starr said the us law is acceptable because it does not single 
out any particular protesters 
justice john paul stevens asked kunstler whether it would 
violate the constitution to ban car dealers from using the flag in 
advertisements to promote the american economy 
kunstler said that would be a form of commercial speech 
unworthy of constitutional protection 
outside the court sen joseph biden ddel who supported the 
new law as an alternative to a constitutional amendment said the 
issue may be blunted regardless of how the court rules 
the majority of the members of congress want to protect the 
flag he said 
by contrast rep don edwards dcalif said the issue is so 
divisive that the house probably would reject a proposed 
constitutional amendment 
amending the constitution requires approval by twothirds of the 
members of the house and senate and then ratification by 38 state 
legislatures 
while the bush administration is defending the law president 
bush and republican leaders have said they would prefer a 
constitutional amendment to ban flag burning there would be no 
need for such an amendment if the justices uphold the law 
democratic congressional leaders were the prime sponsors of the 
flag protection act 
starr told the justices monday that the law does not violate 
freedomofexpression protections in the constitutions first 
amendment 
justice byron r white said starr appeared to be comparing flag 
burning to using a loudspeaker to get public attention this is 
like an overloud loudspeaker white said 
that is an apt analogy said starr adding that the law is 
content neutral and is not aimed at limiting the flag burner 
from getting across any message 
but kunstler said the laws intent is obvious to limit free 
speech by those who oppose us policies 
quoting thomas jefferson kunstler added its as if congress 
ordered us to fall down and worship a golden image 
mondays oral arguments marked the first time in nine years the 
justices held such a session after april 
they are reviewing rulings by federal judges in the district of 
columbia and seattle who said the law violates first amendment 
rights the law was challenged by demonstrators who burned american 
flags in the two cities

east germans cut off from the world by four 
decades of stalinist rule now find the world rushing to them and 
the deluge is severely straining the nation officials said monday 
east berlin and east german officials held a news conference to 
outline what they said has been a flood of impoverished foreigners 
lured to east germany because of its imminent economic unification 
with west germany 
east europeans are flooding east germany at a rate of 500 a day 
and tens of thousands have arrived in recent weeks to seek work in 
a land of rising joblessness the officials said 
if quick regulations for the integration of foreigners are not 
created the problem will become a social powderkeg said joachim 
krabs an east berlin social services official 
about 18000 east europeans most of them romanians and 
bulgarians have entered the country since late april about 20000 
poles also have applied for citizenship in recent weeks and 
several thousand italians have entered the country 
about 650 east europeans arrived on monday morning alone at the 
train station in the east berlin district of lichetenberg 
we no longer know how we can control this enormous influx 
said gerhard kielmann a foreign ministry official most of them 
are fleeing their poor economic situation in their homeland 
lichetenberg has become a way station for east europeans 
entering the country on tourist visas hundreds wander the area 
with their belongings children beg for money and scores of 
families often sleep in the station 
krabs said about 600 romanians and other east europeans live in 
the train station 
the hygiene situation has taken on catastrophic proportions 
he said he said many are carrying infectious diseases 
about 1100 other east europeans most of them romanians and 
some bulgarians have been housed for the last week at an army 
barracks on a base on the outskirts of berlin another 300 are 
housed in another building 
an estimated 15000 have crossed the border and were believed 
heading for east berlin the officials said 
they said about 80 percent of the newcomers from eastern europe 
are gypsies the number of refugees is now averaging about 500 a 
day 
east germanys sudden attraction is in a way a result of the 
mass flight of 500000 east germans to west germany in the past 
year 
many were fleeing the former socialist government that was 
toppled in october but the exodus continued after the countrys 
borders were opened in november 
the flight of east germans contributed to east germanys 
economic problems and the push to unify the nation with west 
germany 
the west german currency is to be circulated in east germany on 
july 2 as part of a merger of the nations economies and social 
systems 
east germany however is expected to face widespread 
unemployment as scores of factories are closed down when they are 
forced to compete in a free market 
unemployment already has begun rising as east german consumers 
get more access to better western goods 
the tensions over joblessness have led to clashes between 
foreigners and east germans in factories and on the streets in 
recent weeks 
a melee broke out in lichtenberg a week ago when gangs of 
foreigners and young east germans squared off outside a discotheque 
east germany is home to tens of thousands of vietnamese cubans 
and mozambicans brought in by the former communist government to 
fill menial jobs 
east germany has no system for dealing with asylum seekers a 
government working group has been trying to arrange lodging and 
other aid for foreigners 
mario sander the federal governments deputy commissioner for 
foreigner questions said that within days a charitable 
structure must be created for dealing with the foreigners 
housing and food needs

forget oil spills factory pollution and toxic 
waste you too can destroy the earth 
and the federal government will even tell you how 
the environmental protection agency has launched a 
reversepsychology campaign dubbed how to destroy the earth 
through public service announcements provided to radio and 
television stations magazines and newspapers 
the advertisements explain how to waste electricity overuse 
paper products and release toxic chemicals into the air and water 
the epa hopes the offbeat campaign will encourage consumers to 
adopt household and work habits that will aid environmental 
cleanup said julie belaga regional epa administrator at a news 
conference monday 
the tv spots for example feature a smirking announcer want 
to destroy the earth with your car no problem drive everywhere 
hey want to kill a few trees he inquires tossing up 
sheets of photocopy paper or pulling down a stream of paper towels 
lights leave them on especially when youre not there 
the print ads are minilessons in destruction under bold 
letters declaiming how to destroy the earth they suggest 
use phosphate detergents or pour used motor oil into the 
ground 
the campaign is starting in new england and epa officials plan 
to take it nationwide 
the campaign includes billboards bumper stickers buttons and a 
booklet slightly larger than a matchbook with 38 tips on 
destroying the earth all the ads come with a disclaimer the 
earth if you want to save it find out what youre doing to 
destroy it and a tollfree information number 
the ads were designed to answer questions the public asks us 
over and over and over again what can i do to help belaga 
said 
what the epa wanted to avoid was the tooearnest approach of 
public service announcements especially with a public saturated by 
recent earth day publicity according to agency officials 
the new campaign is shall we say subtly aggressive belaga 
said this certainly isnt the bureaucratic traditional 
approach 
the ads may grab attention but will they actually encourage 
people to turn off lights avoid plastic foam products use 
clotheslines instead of dryers and recycle paper at the office 
stavros cosmopulos thinks so hes the chairman and creative 
director of the bostonbased advertising agency that created the 
ads 
these suggestions or suggestions in reverse if you will 
are doable things he said im doing it we dont use 
styrofoam cups any more 
his firm cosmopulos crowley and daly and several other 
private companies donated their services for the campaign 
paul g keough epa deputy regional administrator said the 
yearlong campaign uses an individual rather than a global 
approach to environmental problems he said businesses may feel an 
impact however if consumers start pressuring companies through 
their buying habits

cocainerelated medical emergencies in the 
united states showed a 20 percent drop in the fourth quarter of 
1989 secretary of health and human services louis sullivan 
reported monday 
we are making significant headway in our efforts to establish 
a drugfree america sullivan told state and local officials at a 
conference called by the office of national drug control policy 
sullivans announcement came in the wake of a congressional 
report that said the number of hardcore cocaine addicts in the 
country was more than twice what had been estimated earlier 
the report released last thursday by the senate judiciary 
committee set the figure at 22 million compared with an estimate 
of 862000 made earlier by the national institute of drug abuse 
sen joseph biden ddel committee chairman said the report 
was as alarming as it is tragic and showed that the 
administrations strategy for dealing with the drug crisis was 
faulty 
william j bennett the national drug control policy director 
asked about bidens remarks at mondays conference said if the 
strategy is flawed he needs to tell us how he needs to make his 
case 
the republican governor of delaware michael n castle said the 
judiciary committee report shows that neither the supply of cocaine 
nor the demand for it have been diminished sufficiently 
just last week we heard that one person out of every 100 in 
this country is a hardcore cocaine user one of every 40 in new 
york city castle said if we couple this with a 1989 survey of 
high school seniors in which many of them said that crack and 
cocaine were more available now than in the past we know that we 
have neither stemmed the flow nor sufficiently stifled demand 
sullivan told his audience the fourth quarter data from the 
drug abuse warning network or dawn which reports drugrelated 
emergency visits shows a significant decrease indeed a drop of 
nearly 20 percent in the number of cocainerelated cases 
he said the data was particularly welcome after several years 
of increases in reported incidents followed by the steady levels 
of incidents found in last years quarterly reports 
the secretary said the decrease was noted in virtually all 
metropolitan areas of the dawn system and was also reflected in 
preliminary fourth quarter figures from reports of cocainerelated 
deaths by medical examiners 
the reports sullivan said are not smokeandmirrors 
projections assumptions extrapolations or hunches like some 
youve heard recently 
todays results are hardandfast data reflecting actual 
reported incidents of cocainerelated medical emergencies as such 
they confirm what several surveys have indicated over the past 
year that we are making significant headway in our efforts to 
establish a drugfree america 
bennett speaking earlier said we may now be seeing a 
levelling off of addiction my sense is that we are now beginning 
to see a peaking of the addiction problem 
the drug control director also told the state and local 
officials that stemming drug usage would not come automatically 
but if it happens it will be by the pressure that we bring to 
bear

the supreme court refused monday to let an 
antiabortion group protest at abortion clinics in atlanta voting 
54 to leave intact a georgia judges injunction 
the vote focused on freespeech rights more than abortion and 
crossed ideological lines 
the court rejected an emergency request by five members of 
operation rescue who said the injunction is violating their 
freespeech rights 
in atlanta operation rescue spokesman bob jewitt called 
mondays action a little stumble along the way adding we 
feel well be victorious in the long run 
lynne randall who operates a clinic that has been a frequent 
target of the protests welcomed the action we have to balance 
womens right to privacy with peoples right to protest she said 
the controversy is still alive in the georgia courts but 
mondays action means operation rescue protesters for now cannot go 
within 50 feet of the property line of any atlanta facility where 
abortions are performed 
in other matters the court 
heard a spirited debate over flag burning an issue with big 
political stakes and clashing views over patriotism and freedom of 
expression 
the court must decide by july whether a federal law protecting 
old glory from desecration is constitutional 
killed a lawsuit against atlantic richfield co by independent 
gasoline dealers in california and washington state the court by 
a 72 vote said pricecutting schemes that hurt a competitors 
business do not necessarily violate federal antitrust laws 
voted 63 to squelch a lawsuit that charged the united 
steelworkers union with negligence in a 1972 idaho silver mine 
disaster that killed 91 miners the court said such state court 
action is preempted by federal labor law 
refused to referee an attack by 30 states against 26 
manufacturers over the removal of asbestos from public schools and 
other government buildings 
the courts vote in the operation rescue case from atlanta 
yielded strange judicial bedfellows 
voting to lift the march 29 injunction were the courts two most 
consistent liberals justices william j brennan and thurgood 
marshall and two of its most conservative members justices 
anthony m kennedy and antonin scalia 
brennan and marshall are strong supporters of abortion rights 
but also are strong supporters of freespeech rights kennedy and 
scalia oppose broad abortion rights but have more moderate track 
records on freespeech issues 
writing for the four kennedy cited the courts 1977 decision 
that refused to block nazis from marching in the heavily jewish 
community of skokie ill 
kennedy said the 1977 ruling does not distinguish among 
speakers based on the content of their speech 
but justice john paul stevens who cast a decisive vote to leave 
intact the atlanta injunction said the court was not drawing any 
contentofspeech distinctions 
stevens noted that in 1977 the american nazi party did not 
have a similar history of illegal conduct in the jurisdiction where 
the march was scheduled and he called operation rescue members 
a class of persons who have persistently and repeatedly engaged 
in unlawful conduct 
also voting to leave the injunction intact were chief justice 
william h rehnquist and justices byron r white harry a blackmun 
and sandra day oconnor 
stevens and blackmun are strong supporters of abortion rights 
rehnquist white and oconnor are not 
since july 1988 when atlanta hosted the national democratic 
convention city police have arrested 1320 demonstrators at 
operation rescue sitins many of the protesters barricaded 
abortion clinics blocking patients and employees from entering or 
leaving 
operation rescue members michael hirsch gina robertson william 
haynes steve britt and pamela sekulow said the atlanta injunction 
deters them from engaging in prayer picketing leafleting and 
other forms of peaceful expression on public forum streets and 
sidewalks 
the state judge who issued the injunction is considering a 
request to modify it and a formal challenge to the injunction is 
before the georgia supreme court 
similar legal challenges to operation rescue demonstrations at 
abortion clinics in other states have left the organization in deep 
debt 
operation rescue founder randall terry who spent time in jail 
until a contemptofcourt fine for violating a similar injunction 
in new york was paid called mondays action an outrage 
our rights are being denied because were prolife christians 
if we were homosexuals does anyone really think that we would be 
denied access to a public sidewalk he said

congressional republicans said monday they 
hope to use budget negotiations to force domestic spending cuts 
while all sides insisted they would not be the first to broach a 
possible tax hike 
at the white house where the talks open tuesday spokesman 
marlin fitzwater said president bush would not make specific 
proposals to lawmakers instead he said the president would lay 
down his goals for the talks 
the budget summit is designed to find 50 billion or more in 
deficit savings either through spending cuts tax increases or a 
combination of the two 
democrats expressed lingering distrust toward the 
administrations motives in convening the sessions they cited 
white house chief of staff john sununus comments last week that 
higher taxes would not be considered by the president despite 
white house assurances that everything including tax increases 
is negotiable 
there is a lot of unease among democrats said senate 
majority leader george mitchell dmaine 
republicans countered that partisan remarks such as sununus 
were inevitable 
i dont see how you can start one of these summits without 
political rhetoric or polarization said sen pete domenici of 
new mexico ranking republican on the senate budget committee and 
one of the negotiators 
the talks are aimed at finding enough savings to hold next 
years federal deficit to no more than 64 billion the target set 
by the grammrudman balancedbudget law fiscal 1991 begins oct 1 
white house budget chief richard darman has said that 60 
billion to 100 billion in deficit reduction might be necessary 
but he and gop lawmakers have said that a 50 billion package 
might be a more realistic goal for the negotiators whatever budget 
cuts emerge will have to be enacted in the heat of an election year 
in which the entire house and onethird of the senate is up for 
grabs 
bush did not plan to begin the bargaining by laying down a 
specific budget proposal said fitzwater 
he said bush has points he wants to make at the opening 
meeting hell have general goals about getting the deficit 
down 
an administration official speaking on the condition he not be 
identified said that it could take a week and a half for opening 
statements to be completed and real work to begin besides bush 
four top administration officials and 21 congressional leaders are 
scheduled to attend the sessions 
participants have said the bargaining could take weeks or months 
republicans said monday that they are especially eager to 
control the growth of benefits such as medicare farm price 
supports and federal employee retirement programs 
such programs together account for about half of all government 
spending by law these programs expand automatically each year as 
inflation cuts purchasing power and the number of recipients grows 
as a result gop lawmakers want the talks to produce changes 
that will rein in the growth of these benefits in the future they 
also want budget changes that will ensure that the cuts are saved 
rather than simply transferred to other forms of spending 
you have to be able to say the money isnt spent but it has 
to go as designed to deficit reduction said domenici there is 
no way we can do that under current processes 
bush proposed limiting the growth of these programs by 139 
billion an amount supported by sen phil gramm rtexas and 
another negotiator 
we ought to begin with the presidents number said gramm 
let congress decide exactly how to save the money 
democrats said the reason for the 150 billion annual deficits 
of recent years was insufficient revenues and excessive defense 
spending not deficiencies in the budget process 
thats akin to oiling the crank shaft on the titanic 1 hours 
after it hit the iceberg the senate budget committee chairman 
sen james sasser dtenn said of the gop call for tightened 
budget procedures 
mitchell said that after a weekend in maine meeting constituents 
and talking by telephone with fellow democrats he found that many 
in his party believe bush was never serious about his no new 
taxes campaign promise 
a great many democrats expressed the view to me that the 
presidents campaign pledge was phony that everybody knew it and 
now will have to be broken he said

a new study shows that some aidsinfected 
people without symptoms may be helped by the drug azt even if 
certain key immune cells appear normal 
the findings by scientists at the university of california los 
angeles will be published tuesday in the proceedings of the 
national academy of sciences 
people who are infected by the aids virus but have no outward 
symptoms often display reduced levels of certain immune system 
white blood cells known as tcells 
doctors generally determine how badly the aids virus has hurt 
the bodys diseasefighting immune system by measuring tcells 
thats because tcells activate many parts of the bodys defense 
system including other white blood cells called monocytes and 
macrophages 
macrophages are grownup versions of monocytes both types of 
cells are found in various body tissues where they act as 
scavengers that gobble up debris and invading microbes to help 
combat disease 
a low tcell count often is the justification used by doctors in 
deciding whether the antiviral drug azt should be prescribed for 
aidsinfected people who havent yet developed overt symptoms 
the new study found that in the test tube the virus can 
directly cause defects in monocytes and macrophages regardless of 
whether tcells are damaged or not said dr david golde chief of 
blood diseases and cancer at ucla 
the researchers also showed that azt significantly reduced the 
aidsinduced damage to macrophages and monocytes 
both findings suggest aidsinfected people might benefit from 
azt therapy even if their tcell levels are not abnormally low 
golde said 
but he emphasized that he wasnt advocating azt treatment for 
all aidsinfected people with normal tcell levels only those who 
are tested and found to have damaged macrophages 
the study was conducted in goldes laboratory by research 
biologist gayle cocita baldwin golde and others 
azt has been used for three years to treat patients severely ill 
with aids symptoms 
in march the food and drug administration recommended that 
adults infected with the deadly virus be treated with azt even if 
they do not yet have symptoms of the disease the recommendation 
stemmed from federally sponsored studies showing that azt slowed 
the progression of aids in infected patients with early symptoms or 
without any symptoms 
but the recommendation also was based on the work of a 
scientific advisory panel that said azt should be used only on 
symptomfree patients with reduced tcell counts 
the new study suggests the drug might help even aidsinfected 
people with normal tcell counts 
researchers have known for some time that monocytes and 
macrophages are defective in people infected by the aids virus 
but they didnt know if the virus directly attacked macrophages 
and monocytes to make them defective or if they were defective 
simply as a secondary result of the viral attack on tcells golde 
said 
to perform the study baldwin and her colleagues took monocytes 
from human blood infected them with the aids virus then let them 
grow into macrophages they found the infected macrophages were 
defective in their diseasefighting ability 
what we found is that in pure cultures of monocytes and 
macrophages the aids virus itself causes the function of these 
cells to be defective golde said 
certain strains of the aids virus are more likely to damage 
monocytes and macrophages while other strains seem to attack 
mainly the tcells golde said 
it may be that certain patients are infected with strains that 
would have their major impact on macrophages and monocytes and in 
those patients antiviral therapy would appear to be useful even 
if tcell counts werent dramatically reduced he added

the dow jones industrial average on monday 
soared to a record high closing 
the widely followed average of 30 bluechip industrial stocks 
finished up 1995 at 282153 topping the record close of 281015 
set on jan 2 
broader market indicators also advanced strongly and about two 
issues rose in price for every one that declined on the new york 
stock exchange 
the recent rally which has seen the dow industrials rise more 
than 176 points since april 27 has been attributed to a sudden 
favorable swing in economic indicators the swing has reduced 
worries that inflation and interest rates were heading higher 
interest rates kept falling monday after dropping sharply on 
friday yields on longterm government bonds which topped 9 
percent a few weeks ago had dropped to the 858 percent860 
percent range by late monday 
falling rates are seen not only as stimulating business 
activity which would be good for corporate profits but also as 
reducing the returns on interestbearing investments such as bonds 
which prompts some investors to switch funds to the stock market 
brokers say the drop in rates touched off a rush to buy stocks 
among money managers at investing institutions who had been sitting 
on large cash reserves

a bomb hidden in a flowerbed outside an army 
office exploded before dawn monday and injured seven people 
officials said the irish republican army claimed responsibility 
scotland yard said the time bomb containing plastic explosives 
was buried outside the front entrance of the directorate of army 
education in eltham southeast london 
commander george churchill coleman head of scotland yards 
antiterrorist branch said the bomb could have had a timer set a 
couple of hours or many days before the explosion 
its important to warn everyone particularly military 
personnel and those involved in irish affairs about this fairly 
new development he said this device was buried and was not 
visible to the naked eye 
four men and three women were treated for minor injuries said a 
spokesman for brook hospital in greenwich one of the men trevor 
hills was blown across a room in the blast and suffered two broken 
ribs hills is responsible for resettling soldiers into civilian 
life 
all of the injured were civilian employees of the directorate 
the directorate commander lt col john simmonds said the 
explosion overturned a car in the parking lot and shattered several 
windshields 
theres no doubt about it we were lucky simmonds said 
fortunately nobody was in the car park everyone was in the 
building 
there was a very loud explosion said lucy hawker a nearby 
resident my first thought was that a bomb had gone off and it 
could only be at the army institute 
the building is the headquarters for the royal army education 
corps authorities said the approximately 50 army and civilian 
employees at the center were evacuated and were all accounted for 
defense minister archie hamilton said increased security 
measures such as plastic film laminated to windows prevented more 
serious injuries the film prevents the glass from shattering 
it is extremely difficult to ever get 100 percent security in 
any establishment hamilton said were talking about a 
predominance of civilians here and there are no markers to 
indicate that it is a ministry of defense establishment 
in a statement signed by the irish republican publicity bureau 
in dublin the irish republican army said an active service unit 
planted a device containing over 10 pounds of plastic explosives 
after penetrating security procedures 
this institute is a facility for the training of british army 
officers to a high level in maintaining military and colonial 
domination in our country the statement said 
in its campaign to create a unified socialist state in ireland 
the ira has claimed responsibility for attacking other army 
installations in britain and europe 
in the worst of the attacks an ira bomb killed 11 bandsmen at 
the royal marine school of music in deal kent last september

retired ohio autoworker john demjanjuk who is 
under a death sentence appealed a war crimes conviction to 
israels supreme court on monday and his attorneys key argument 
was that the trial judges were biased 
a threejudge panel ruled in april 1988 that ukrainianborn 
demjanjuk 70 was ivan the terrible a cruel guard who 
operated gas chambers at the nazis treblinka death camp in poland 
in 194243 more than 850000 jews perished there 
demjanjuk was sentenced to die under a 1950 israeli law allowing 
prosecution of nazis and collaborators 
he was extradited from his home in cleveland in february 1986 
after an ohio court stripped him of his citizenship for lying about 
a nazi past on immigration forms demjanjuk says he is a victim of 
mistaken identity and was held in german pow camps during the time 
in question 
demjanjuks israeli attorney yoram sheftel told the 
fivejustice supreme court panel he challenged the conviction on 10 
separate points the most significant is the bias of the court 
he said 
sheftel said it should lead to the clear conclusion that the 
conviction should be canceled and especially in a case where the 
sentence is capital punishment 
demjanjuk clad in a dark brown prison uniform listened 
impassively from a witness stand throughout the proceedings 
guarded by two policemen he muttered good morning in hebrew as 
he came into the courtroom handcuffed and then embraced his son 
john demjanjuk jr 
the defendants wife vera also attended she refused to speak to 
reporters 
sheftel also accused the justice departments office of special 
investigations of failing to provide all evidence in demjanjuks 
case to the defense and said conducting the defense was like a 
boxing match with one contestant standing with his hands tied 
behind his back 
the office hunts suspected nazis in the united states 
the osi claimed we got all the documents although many 
werent forwarded sheftel complained 
the lawyer said a hostile atmosphere was created by news reports 
and the judges treatment of the defense during the 17month trial 
he claimed trial judges dov levine dalia dorner and shmuel tal 
subscribed to a clipping service that delivered twice daily reports 
from newspapers which carried biased reports he said the judges 
briefed reporters on occasion 
he said frequent shouts and interruptions came from the audience 
at the trial which was held in a converted movie theater 
not only was an appearance of justice lacking but justice in 
fact was not done said sheftel 
he said the judges interrupted defense crossexaminations and 
intervened in the proceedings 
he also argued that the judges dismissed conflicting testimony 
from one of five treblinka survivors whose testimony was crucial to 
demjanjuks conviction 
he said the survivor missed picking out demjanjuk in a 1980 
photo lineup this is 20 percent of the evidence one of five 
key witnesses it raises a significant question 
sheftel claimed the prosecutors inflamed emotions unnecessarily 
by dwelling on the history of the holocaust in which 6 million 
jews died 
prosecutor yonah blattman interrupted sheftel once in the first 
five hours of arguments saying sheftels grounds for claiming bias 
are not legal or factual arguments and are not worthy of being 
brought before the court 
chief justice meir shamgar overruled the objection 
the defense lawyer also challenged israels jurisdiction to try 
demjanjuk as a war criminal 
he said israels extradition treaty with the united states and 
the warrant under which demjanjuk was deported allowed for trying a 
suspect on murder charges but not genocide or mass murder 
sheftel outlined other points challenging the verdict that he 
said he would detail in the coming five weeks of court sessions 
a major point is the defense claim that a key piece of 
prosecution evidence the socalled trawniki card is a forgery 
the card supplied by the soviet union says demjanjuk was trained 
at an elite nazi ss camp to be a concentration camp guard

it was a call for a domestic disturbance one of 
more than one million that the chicago police respond to every 
year for 20year veterans gregory a hauser and raymond c kilroy 
it was to be their last call 
the partners and friends were shot to death outside a house 
where they answered a report of a disturbance between a grandmother 
and her grandson on mothers day night 
it happened just two days before national police memorial day 
held annually on may 15 to honor officers killed in the line of 
duty 
domestic violence is probably the most common call the police 
get and probably results in the greatest number of injuries to 
police because one number correlates to the other said john 
dineen president of the fraternal order of police chicago lodge 
dineen canceled his trip to washington dc to join 
observations of the national holiday for our officers he 
said to make sure they get the proper burial the memorial they 
deserve here 
police did not know monday afternoon when the funerals would be 
when off work hauser and kilroy were business partners who ran 
a locksmith business out of a truck on their days off to supplement 
their police salaries said fellow officer harold brown 
hauser was 43 married and the father of two boys and a girl 
ages 7 to 15 kilroy 46 was single both patrolmen had spent 
mothers day with their families before reporting for duty said 
chicago police department spokeswoman tina vicini 
both of them are hardworking guys said brown they were 
both nice guys just super nice guys 
on sunday night the officers went to the workingclass 
northwest neighborhood and later called for backups police said 
hauser and kilroy were found with gunshot wounds to the head and 
body 
more than 100 officers working with dogs poured into the 
neighborhood after a severalhour manhunt the suspect was 
cornered under a porch 
roman chavez 23 was charged monday with two counts of 
firstdegree murder and one count of armed robbery the latter 
because authorities said he took one of the officers guns 
anthony calabrese supervisor of the homicide division of the 
states attorneys office said it was too early to say whether 
that gun was used to kill the officers he also declined to discuss 
a motive for the slaying 
calabrese said chavez was arrested eight times as a juvenile and 
four times as an adult the most recent arrest in suburban 
elmhurst in february for battery and eluding of a police officer 
chavez had lived with his grandmother for six or seven years 
ago after his parents divorced said nickie carsello who lives 
next door 
he was fine when he first moved in she said he used to 
help out he put our air conditioner in the window he would cut 
our lawn he was a real nice kid 
but four years ago chavezs stepgrandfather was killed by a 
train he didnt see as he stepped across railroad tracks near the 
home after that there was a transformation in sammy as 
chavez was known to the carsellos 
ms carsello said the home shared by chavez and his grandmother 
probably in her 70s was a blight on the neighborhood consisting 
otherwise of neatly kept singlefamily homes 
she recalled asking the grandmother why dont you have him 
cut your lawn she said im afraid to talk to him he might 
hurt me 
chavez was being held without bail in cook county jail and has 
been assigned a public defender a preliminary hearing was 
scheduled for june 1 
now well go through the process of the wakes and the 
funerals said dineen 
then comes the trial the offender thats when you begin to 
wonder if theres any justice in the world after the trial comes 
the appeals where the offender does his best to stay out of jail 
and you have two police officers who are dead they have no trial 
no appeal just execution

neither time nor distance wipe out 
child support obligations the florida supreme court told a 
virginia woman who was abandoned nearly 22 years ago while pregnant 
with her third child 
the result of the womans long draining legal battle is 
expected to affect family courts in other states some attorneys 
said monday 
the biggest thing i feel is a sense of satisfaction 
patricia bennett 44 of springfield va said it was a 
tremendous amount of work but this will affect thousands 
bennett a nonlawyer who represented herself in oral arguments 
before floridas high court more than two years ago said she 
thinks last weeks decision could be followed by courts in other 
states she listed california texas ohio and west virginia as 
states that remain havens for delinquent parents 
in its ruling the supreme court said that florida judges can 
jail for contempt parents who have not paid outofstate child 
support awards and that back child support awards must be paid 
even after children become adults 
attorneys who filed friends of the court briefs supporting 
bennetts case agreed with her monday that the ruling was 
significant both legally and symbolically 
legally of course this decision is only binding in the state 
of florida said sally goldfarb of new york a staff attorney for 
the now legal defense and education fund but frequently in 
family law matters courts look to the decisions of other states in 
order to get insights 
because so many outofstate cases are mentioned we suspect it 
will have national prominence said joe boyd of tallahassee who 
represents the state department of health and rehabilitative 
services 
but also important is the message the ruling sends to delinquent 
parents the two attorneys said 
the court forcefully and eloquently stated that child support 
obligations become stronger with time and that no parent should be 
permitted to turn his back on the children whom he abandoned 
goldfarb said 
i guess read my lips is what the florida supreme court has 
said boyd said 
bennett and her exhusband oscar gibson were married in 1964 
five years later he disappeared in 1985 bennett found him living 
with a different name and a different wife in rural lutz fla and 
her legal struggle to get back child support from him resumed 
bennetts daughters now are 21 22 and 23 the eldest has a 
16monthold son a cbs movie called runaway father based on 
her story is being made 
once children reach 18 parents who raised them are not 
magically reimbursed for personal funds spent nor debts incurred 
due to nonpayment of child support justice gerald kogan wrote in 
thursdays majority opinion 
hardships suffered by a family do not disappear kogan said 
a familys feelings of indignation from abandonment by the 
nonpaying parent or from past reliance on public assistance are not 
forgotten 
bennett received welfare for two years after gibson left her 
but since then however she has earned a bachelors degree and a 
masters degree in business adminstration she works now as a 
financial analyst for the internal revenue service and has applied 
to law school 
bennetts exhusband now known as james parker has been making 
100 payments every week since 1987 but the insurance claims 
adjuster said hed have to make payments to wipe out 148536 in 
back payments interest and expenses a virginia court said he owes 
probably until im dead parker said 
mark kelly who represented parker said he thought the ruling 
really gives the party trying to collect twice as much leverage 
as they had before

a lawyer for a cuban exile said monday hell 
seek to question two former leaders of chiles secret police who 
allegedly ordered the assassination of exchilean ambassador 
orlando letelier 
attorney paul goldbergers client dionisio suarez esquivel was 
ordered monday by us district court judge aubrey robinson to 
stand trial beginning sept 10 on charges that he helped carry out 
the letelier killing 
suarez was arrested april 11 in st petersburg fla after 12 
years as a fugitive he is charged with conspiracy murdering a 
foreign official two counts of murder and using explosives that 
result in death 
letelier and an aide ronni moffitt died when a bomb attached 
to the car in which they rode was detonated in washington on sept 
21 1976 
the chilean government has refused to extradite the two former 
chilean secret police offials 
juan manuel contreras sepulveda and pedro espinoza bravo were 
indicted along with suarez and five other people in 1978 it will 
be up to the judge to decide whether to order depositions from 
contreras and espinoza for the suarez case 
a chilean official did say saturday that chile has agreed to pay 
compensation to the families of letelier and moffitt but the 
announcement by acting interior minister belisario velasco was not 
expected to affect the criminal cases 
an outspoken critic of the chilean regime of augusto pinochet 
letelier had been the ambassador to the united states under the 
marxist government of salvador allende 
the governments chief witness against suarez is expected to be 
michael townley a us citizen who worked for the chilean 
intelligence service dina 
in court goldberger said us officials had refused to 
extradite townley who apparently is in the us governments 
witness protection program townley had been implicated in a murder 
case in argentina involving an exiled chilean general carlos 
pratz pratz died in a bomb blast 
prosecutors did not comment on goldbergers assertion that the 
us had turned down an argentine request to turn over townley who 
admitted planting the bomb in the letelier killing and served a 
40month prison term 
goldberger also represented another defendant in the letelier 
case guillermo novo sampol sampol now living in the miami area 
was convicted of perjury appearing in court novo said he had no 
objection to goldberger representing suarez prosecutors have said 
they might call novo as a witness against suarez 
outside the courtroom novo said he is involved in fund raising 
for suarezs legal defense 
on april 24 the chilean suprme court ordered the reopening of 
an investigation in chile into the letelier assassination the 
ruling came after a woman named liliana walker a chilean security 
agent said in newspaper interviews that she had helped in the 
preparations for the assassination 
she said she accompanied another agent armando fernandez 
larios to washington in 1976 to helped in the groundwork 
fernandez left chile secretly in 1987 and surrendered in the united 
states where he admitted participating in the preparations 
goldberger said he wants to question walker as well as the two 
former dina officers

the university of south carolinas 
president has spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on gifts for 
donors office artwork and teaching salaries for celebrities such 
as robby benson and jihan sadat 
now james b holdermans lavish spending which has given him 
trouble for years has once again raised the ire of state 
lawmakers who have warned him to spend public funds more wisely if 
he wants to keep his job 
people are tired of it rep herb kirsh said monday i 
feel things will be different from here on out the public is 
demanding it south carolinians dont like that kind of spending 
legislators earlier this month blasted holderman after local 
newspapers revealed he spent 533898 in the past year on items 
such as 800anight hotel rooms for himself 6400 on sculptures 
for his office and 163000 for meals and receptions for potential 
donors 
many of the expenses were charged to holdermans 500000 
discretionary account which is funded with receipts from vending 
machines and concessions and his stateissued american express 
card by comparison clemson university president max lennon has a 
discretionary account of 18000 
holderman has defended his spending as a vital part of 
fundraising for the statesupported university of 40000 students 
saying his efforts have helped raise 25 million for usc in the 
last year but he promised to keep his expenses down following 
public criticism 
he said the fallout from the latest revelations has taught me 
the difficulty of taking a macro view of things 
some people tend to take a micro view of things and thats 
where there seems to be a misunderstanding he said last week 
but if holderman wants to remain at the helm of the states 
flagship university state lawmakers and his own board of trustees 
have insisted that he curb his spending 
kirsh said holderman has set a bad example for students if he 
does not follow spending guidelines being set by the newly elected 
board of trustees the legislator said he would favor holdermans 
dismissal 
hes only doing it now because of the public outcry kirsh 
said 
board of trustees chairman michael mungo has also made it clear 
that holderman must control his spending according to the 
guidelines or face dismissal 
holderman who has presided over the university since 1977 
first drew criticism in 1986 when it was revealed he ran up 
generous hotel bills during fundraising trips and bought expensive 
gifts for donors 
he then came under fire for spending huge amounts of money to 
recruit celebrities such as benson an actor and director who has 
taught filmmaking as an artistinresidence since 1988 
the school has paid benson 158367 in salary and expenses and 
15600 for rent while holderman has kicked in 10000 from his 
discretionary account for moving and travel expenses 
in addition the university still holds about 23000 in unpaid 
bills from the production of bensons latest movie modern 
love which was filmed in south carolina benson has said the 
bills will be paid and the school will receive 2 percent of the 
movies profits 
bensons twoyear contract expires tuesday and no new contract 
offer has been made school spokeswoman debra allen said monday 
benson did not return calls left at his office monday seeking 
comment but he has said he would leave if his work was not 
appreciated 
other prominent personalities hired by holderman for fat 
contracts include jihan sadat widow of the late egyptian president 
anwar sadat who was paid 200000 to teach a course in egyptian 
culture for three semesters in 1985 and 1986 
in contrast deliverance author james dickey was hired in 
1969 before holderman came aboard and receives an 80000 annual 
salary to teach four writing courses he pays his secretarys 
salary and his expenses out of his own pocket 
the university under holdermans leadership also has been 
criticized by lawmakers for sloppy bookkeeping and using public 
funds employees and equipment to operate the schools 10 private 
fundraising foundations

the united states and iran have signed a 105 
million lumpsum settlement of small us claims rising out of the 
islamic revolution the state department announced monday 
department officials said that the talks leading to the 
settlement of more than 2300 us claims of up to 250000 each 
were not linked to the recent release of two us hostages held by 
proiranian kidnappers in lebanon or to the fate of the six 
americans still held there 
negotiations still are underway on about 400000 worth of small 
iranian claims against the united states most of them filed by 
iranian soldiers in training in the united states who were ordered 
expelled after the 1979 iranian revolution 
the settlement of the us claims must now be approved by the 
iranunited states claims tribunal established in the dutch city 
of the hague under the 1981 algiers accords 
the accords set the terms for the release of the americans held 
hostage at the us embassy in tehran for 444 days 
although the agreement represents a step toward repairing badly 
frayed usiranian relations officials noted there are still deep 
divisions over larger claims made by iran as well as over the 
hostage question 
margaret tutwiler the state department spokeswoman noted that 
president bush has said repeatedly that a good place to start the 
normalization of relations would be the release of all american 
hostages 
the settlement signed sunday does clear the way for the tribunal 
to deal with about 16 billion in major contested claims 
as to the outstanding iranian small claims a senior us 
official who briefed reporters on the settlement on the condition 
he not be identified said the claims include some 10 billion for 
military properties 
he said that while the united states believes there is value to 
some of the iranian claims for others running into the billions of 
dollars our view and the iranian view of what these totals are 
are far apart 
once the tribunal approves the settlement of the us small 
claims the 105 million will be paid to the united states in one 
lump sum 
final distribution to a large variety of claimants including 
many americans who lost their personal possessions when they fled 
tehran after the revolution against the government of shah mohammad 
reza pahlavi will be made by the justice departments foreign 
claims settlement commission 
the us official said that there is no way to predict how long 
that might take but past experience indicates it could take two to 
four years 
us officials said that payments will be made far faster than 
if the tribunal were to attempt to settle the cases one by one 
the settlement accord was signed late sunday night by timothy 
ramish us agent to the tribunal and ali nobari the iranian 
agent according to an american official at the tribunal the 
negotiations were conducted for the united states by judge abraham 
sofaer the state departments chief legal adviser

president mikhail s gorbachev on monday declared 
independence moves by latvia and estonia illegal and invalid 
but gave no hint whether he would retaliate with sanctions as he 
has with lithuania 
in two presidential decrees read monday on the nightly tv news 
program vremya gorbachev clearly rejected a weekend appeal by 
the three baltic presidents to recognize their statehood 
the decrees said latvias may 4 declaration of independence and 
estonias march 30 declaration that it was an occupied country 
violated soviet law and the constitution 
in latvia officials said they awaited an antiindependence 
protest outside the parliament building and a republicwide 
political strike tuesday helicopters dropped leaflets on the 
latvian capital of riga on monday calling for the strike and 
protest 
the soviet union forcibly annexed latvia lithuania and estonia 
in 1940 lithuania declared its independence march 11 and began 
passing laws toward that end enraging moscow and bringing on an 
embargo of oil natural gas and other raw materials 
gorbachevs initial response to lithuanias declaration 
paralleled mondays decrees he declared it illegal and invalid 
and asked lithuania to rescind it 
latvia and estonia passed more cautious measures allowing for 
an unspecified transition period to independence but their moves 
proved equally unacceptable 
the presidential decrees in dry legal language listed the 
points of the law and constitution violated by the estonian and 
latvian measures 
gorbachev rebuked the two republics saying estonia acted 
without having consulted with the people of the republic 
ignoring its existing economic political cultural and legal 
ties with moscow he said latvia had gone against the rights 
and interests of other subjects of the soviet federation 
gorbachev called latvias decree invalid from the moment of 
its passage and the same went for estonias measure 
on saturday the three baltic presidents revived a 1934 council 
of baltic states pledging cooperation and asking gorbachev and 
president bush to discuss their independence at the ussoviet 
summit opening may 30 
in lithuania prime minister kazimiera prunskiene said monday 
her government still wants to compromise with moscow 
we are ready to compromise on isues that are vital to the 
soviet union defense borders customs military presence she 
said 
she declined to go into specifics but said she would make 
definite proposals before gorbachev meets bush so he could make 
serious decisions before going to washington 
in latvia the helicopter leaflets urged citizens to take to 
the streets tuesday and demand the restoration of soviet 
power said aris jansons chief aide to latvias president 
the leaflets called for a strike at 10 am tuesday and told 
workers to converge on parliament where a handful of traitors 
and political adventurers who are deciding our fate instead of us 
should tremble at the voice of the working class 
earlier monday more than 100 soviet army officers tried to 
enter the latvian supreme soviet parliament leading to a scuffle 
in which a latvian radio reporter and several women were slightly 
injured reports said 
the scuffle which involved mothers of latvian soldiers who were 
killed ended when latvian president anatoly gorbunov invited in 
some officers to air their complaints jansons said in a telephone 
interview 
soviet officers repeatedly have demonstrated against 
independence in front of the parliament 
latvias declaration of independence has stirred protests from 
among the 46 percent of the population that is nonlatvian and from 
many army officers stationed there 
latvia has 28 million people 
on friday latvias police force said it would submit to orders 
only from moscow and ignore commands from the latvian government 
jansons said 
he said this made the government concerned for the security of 
the parliament building tuesday and many people feared the 
lawmakers would be blocked from entering 
members of various grassroots organizations plan to try to 
defend the supreme soviet building and the parliaments 
independence move tuesday said anda anspoka a spokeswoman for the 
latvian peoples front 
they are going to stand there and do their best picketing and 
expressing their opinions she said 
the building was guarded previously by police and peoples front 
volunteers 
jansons said groups dominated by ethnic russians in all three 
republics appeared to be coordinating a regional antiindependence 
action for tuesday and sources in vilnius confirmed plans for a 
balticwide protest 
pavelas gilis said russiandominated communist parties planned 
to stage political meetings throughout lithuania latvia and 
estonia on tuesday gilis is a secretary of the lithuanian 
communist party that broke with its moscow parent party in december 
and backs independence 
since annexation 50 years ago the nonnative population has 
swelled to almost 50 percent in latvia and estonia where 
antiindependence movements are stronger than in nativedominated 
lithuania 
a soviet colonel told a vilnius news conference monday the 
lithuanian government was denying medical care to officers and 
their families and hostility was running so high that soviet 
officers changed into civilian clothes before going onto the 
streets 
col konstantin golubeyev political commissar for soviet armed 
forces in lithuania also said unidentified assailants fired into a 
soviet officers apartment

sen edward kennedy turned actor monday 
portraying a harvard square train station in an algebra lesson that 
helped turn a us senate hearing into a lively variety show for 
300 children 
the young audience also met 4foot robot a harvard scientist 
who showed them a telescope that can be made for less than 1 and a 
fifthgrade teacher who borrowed a real dinosaur skull for a 
makebelieve trip to the western desert to study paleontology 
the setting was a hearing to take testimony for a senate bill 
aimed at boosting education in math science and technology 
in a departure from the customary decorous exchange of testimony 
and questions the hearing was held in a theater at the museum of 
science and included middle school youngsters from the boston area 
teachers with novel methods and program instructors deploying high 
technology showed how they inspire enthusiasm among children in 
science and math 
the need for enthusiasm is dire 
according to figures gathered by the labor and human resources 
committee about the 24000 us high schools 7000 offer no 
physics course 4000 offer no chemistry and 2000 offer not a 
single biology course 
among the nations elementary and high school science teachers a 
full 60000 are unqualified to teach that subject 
half the faculty jobs in us graduate schools of engineering 
are held by foreigners because of a dearth of american engineering 
teachers 
yet it is projected that by the year 2006 america will be short 
675000 scientists and engineers and by 2000 industry will be 
short 2 million technicians 
just 10 years from now the country will need 300000 more 
science teachers 
kennedy and sen mark hatfield rutah are cosponsors of the 
excellence in math science and engineering education act which is 
now before kennedys senate labor and human resources committee 
the bill sets out a 10year schedule of appropriations starting 
with 125 million for improving and monitoring science and math 
education it would direct more attention as well to technological 
training in industry and to bringing more women and minorities into 
the field 
the labor committee is expected to vote on the bill soon and if 
it passes muster send it to the senate floor this summer 
among the presentations at the hearing was the algebra lesson 
invented by boston teacher robert moses it translates the 
abstractions of a plus b equals c into reality 
moses enlisted kennedy along with nine students to stand in 
front of the auditorium to represent train stops on the red line 
subway route connecting boston and cambridge 
three children played the train chugchugging between the 
stations such lessons conducted over time and interspersed with 
trips on real trains are used to teach children the concept that a 
variable like x or y can in algebra stand for a real 
number the also help relate math to real life 
the problem may go even deeper than the need to make math and 
science more relevant however 
jane holdsworth of the thames science center in new london 
conn told kennedy that while wheeling in her robot to make her 
presentation a little girl asked her if the robot bites 
i hope were getting to the day when we know that robots dont 
bite holdsworth said and that math and science dont bite 
theyre fun

attorney general dick thornburgh reassigned 
two top aides monday in what appeared to be an attempt to dispel 
the perception he is surrounded by a tight circle of loyal aides 
robert s ross jr thornburghs chief of staff will spend the 
next two to three months organizing a new office of international 
affairs then return to private legal practice said senior 
department officials 
david runkel thornburghs press secretary who has endured 
stormy relations with reporters has been reassigned to be director 
of communications said the officials who spoke on the condition 
of anonymity 
the changes took effect monday thornburgh was in the process of 
selecting a new director of the office of public affairs who will 
serve as the departments chief spokesman the officials said 
the changes were disclosed by officials close to thornburgh just 
three days after deputy attorney general donald b ayer announced 
after just six months in office that he would resign on may 25 
the same day that ayer disclosed his plans to leave the white 
house announced its intention to nominate assistant attorney 
general william barr to be the new deputy attorney general 
ayer decided to leave because he felt he lacked the traditional 
authority usually given a deputy attorney general to oversee the 
daytoday operations of the department according to 
administration sources 
one source said ayer was kept out of the decisionmaking process 
by thornburghs top aides 
ross who functioned as thornburghs chief of staff retained 
many of the responsibilities normally given to the deputy attorney 
general one official said 
officials said that barr would be given the authority that ayer 
sought but was never given as part of thornburghs effort to turn 
management of the department over to the deputy and the assistant 
attorneys general 
thornburgh has run an extremely tight ship holding 
decisionmaking power among a small circle of aides who worked for 
him when he was governor of pennsylvania 
both ross and runkel members of a trio that includes longtime 
aide murray dickman served as top aides to thornburgh in 
harrisburg 
dickman is expected to remain on the attorney generals staff 
which is expected to play a more lowkey role in department 
operations officials said 
it was never his thornburghs intention to have a small 
personal staff attempting to run the department said one 
official 
when the dust settles you are going to see a washington team 
in place said another official 
ayer was given the unpleasant and difficult assignments of 
defending the bush administrations opposition to undoing a series 
of supreme court decisions on civil rights that democrats in 
congress are anxious to blunt 
ayers resignation was announced two weeks after the disclosure 
that he had been ordered to withdraw a letter expressing justice 
department support for sentencing guidelines for corporations 
convicted of crimes 
runkel said the letter was unauthorized because thornburgh had 
not seen it before ayer sent it to the us sentencing commission 
which is considering whether to implement the guidelines 
runkel has been accused by reporters of giving them misleading 
or incomplete information 
an fbi investigation ordered by thornburgh of unauthorized leaks 
of information about a criminal probe involving the office of rep 
william h gray iii dpa named runkel as a secondary source 
of the story thornburgh defended runkels conduct but the 
disclosure of his close aides role proved politically embarrassing

prime minister yitzhak shamir on monday ordered 
a gradual reopening of six palestinian universities in the west 
bank and gaza strip which were closed shortly after the 
palestinian uprising began 2 years ago 
the move is likely to improve israels relations with the united 
states they have been strained in recent weeks over shamirs 
increased settlement activity in the occupied lands and his refusal 
to accept us middle east peace proposals 
the army closed palestinian institutions of higher learning 
shortly after the antiisraeli uprising broke out in december 1987 
the government said the universities were hotbeds of antiisraeli 
violence 
the united states and western europe sharply criticized the 
measure as collective punishment the european parliament at one 
stage recommended scientific cooperation with israel be frozen 
until the universities and colleges were reopened 
in the occupied gaza strip meanwhile paramilitary border 
police fatally wounded a 19yearold palestinian after masked 
youths attacked the patrol with knives and axes the army and arab 
reports said 
hospital officials identified the slain youth as hamis abdel 
rahman abu husah from the shati refugee camp 
his death raised to 657 the number of palestinians killed by 
soldiers during the 29monthold rebellion at least 212 
palestinians have been slain by their arab brethern on suspicion of 
cooperating with israeli authorities fortythree israelis have 
also died in the violence 
also monday rabbi moshe levinger a founder of the jewish 
settlement movement began serving a fivemonth sentence for 
killing a palestinian during a stonethrowing incident 
levinger is the second settler sentenced to prison for killing 
an arab since the uprising began the israeli information center 
for human rights in the occupied territories reported that in that 
time 29 palestinians were killed by settler gunfire 
shamir spokesman avi pazner said the prime minister instructed 
his adviser for the occupied lands shmuel goren to meet with the 
heads of the six universities to discuss conditions of the 
reopening 
goren said the first university would open within two days 
there are five universities in the west bank and one in the gaza 
strip with a total of 18000 students 
goren said authorities were encouraged by the declining 
bloodshed in recent months but also warned the heads of 
universities that if violence recurs the facilities would be 
closed immediately 
im not sure they can control their students but at least 
they promised that they can do it if they the students use these 
institutions as a base for violence we will not be able to 
continue goren told the associated press 
underground leaders of the uprising have said in recent leaflets 
resumption of studies was a top priority and that students should 
not give the army an excuse to close facilities 
pazner and goren denied the decision to reopen schools was aimed 
at appeasing the bush administration 
we hope it will bring us a good reaction from the united 
states and europe but our main consideration was security goren 
said 
sari nusseibeh considered by israel to be one of the leaders of 
uprising said israel was responding to pressure from the united 
states and europe to reopen the universities 
it means that they the israelis are beginning to yield to 
pressure nusseibeh said he noted czech president vaclav havel 
brought up the issue in talks with israeli leaders during a recent 
visit 
throughout the closure instruction has continued in socalled 
underground classes but attendance of the makeshift classes was 
sporadic and the education they provided was far below the normal 
standards especially hardhit were science students who had to do 
without lab facilities 
the six universities are bethlehem university islamic 
university bir zeit university hebron university annajah 
university and jerusalem university it has two branches abu dis 
college of science and technology and the ramallah community 
college

a partially blind man was charged monday 
with firstdegree murder and sexual assault in attacks on three of 
four children he had been babysitting 
authorities were still gathering evidence in the case involving 
the fourth child a 7yearold girl and other charges might be 
filed later against lenard johnson 37 said montgomery county 
states attorney kathryn dobrinic 
the prosecutor said she planned to seek the death penalty if 
johnson is convicted of murder in the stabbing death of 11yearold 
donald l buske of nearby litchfield 
three girls ages 7 11 and 13 were taken to a litchfield 
hospital for treatment and observation and later released 
johnson was released from a springfield hospital where he was 
treated for an apparently selfinflicted knife wound to the stomach 
and cuts to his wrist shortly before a court hearing in hillsboro 
he faces two counts of firstdegree murder one accusing him of 
killing the boy with intent the other of committing the murder in 
the course of another felony home invasion he also is charged 
with two counts of aggravated criminal sexual assault 
i think the evidence will show that he had cared for the 
children earlier in the evening and he was taken home and then 
returned to the home later and broke in and committed the crime 
ms dobrinic said in a telephone interview 
circuit judge ec eberstacher read the charges to johnson and 
told him he could expect a minimum sentence of six years in prison 
if found guilty of any of them 
johnson displayed no emotion he only nodded yes or no in reply 
to the judges questions 
eberstacher scheduled a bond hearing for tuesday and appointed a 
lawyer for johnson 
neighbors described johnson who lived alone as a familiar 
figure often seen walking they said he collected disability 
payments because of his impaired vision 
one neighbor dave belt said johnson told him he had moved from 
the chicago area several years ago to get away from the crime and 
violence of the city 
authorities said the boy and the 7yearold girl were siblings 
and the two other girls had been visiting them for the night 
the childrens ordeal began friday night after the boys mother 
susan emerson got off work about 1030 she and her husband 
james went out leaving the children with johnson 
when the parents returned home they found everything apparently 
normal and emerson took johnson back to his own home 
but while he was out authorities said mrs emersons 
7yearold daughter told her mother she had been assaulted when 
emerson returned the couple took the girl to the hospital telling 
the other children to lock the house and let no one inside 
according to police and neighbors 
the hospital advised police of the assault 
after the parents left johnson sneaked back to the house 
tearing open a screen and lifting a front window to enter 
authorities said 
once inside authorities contend johnson killed the boy then 
assaulted the two girls isolating himself in the bathroom with 
them briefly after police arrived the standoff ended about 15 
minutes later and police said they found johnson suffering from 
stab wounds

the white house rejecting complaints by 
interior secretary manuel lujan said monday that president bush 
does not want to weaken the nations primary law protecting 
endangered animals and plants 
we have no plans to change the act at this time white house 
press secretary marlin fitzwater said 
later in the day senate majority leader george mitchell also 
assured there would be no such move 
lujan expressed concern last week that the 17yearold 
endangered species act was threatening jobs and economic 
development 
its just too tough an act i think lujan told the denver 
post weve got to change it 
asked if lujan was at odds with bush on the matter fitzwater 
said it means he lujan gave his views and theyre important 
but theres been no decision to make any change 
bush has said he wants to be known as the environmental 
president 
in a speech in the senate mitchell said lujan was mistaken when 
he claimed the endangered species act was used to block development 
or threaten jobs 
he said only three projects in every 10000 were withdrawn or 
canceled between 1979 and 1986 because of concerns about the 
welfare of a species 
in 1987 the general accounting office reviewed over 3000 
consultations related to the effects of water projects in the west 
on species and found that none was canceled as a result said 
mitchell 
the endangered species act also provides an exemption process 
to balance economic and conservation interests when an 
irreconcilable conflict exists between the needs of the species and 
the necessary federal action said mitchell it has only been 
used twice in the acts history 
mitchell said mankind benefits from the enormous diversity of 
plant and animal life on our planet for instance 40 percent of 
all medicines have components derived from plants 
who among us secretary lujan or anyone else can now predict 
which of the obscure plants and insects or animals now being 
decimated may hold the genetic key to the next medical miracle 
he said

the cabinet on monday approved an emergency 
plan to spend an additional 125 billion to absorb the 150000 
soviet jews expected to arrive this fiscal year 
the funds if approved by parliament would be an increase to 
the 1990 budget that earmarked 900 million to help resettle an 
estimated 40000 soviet jewish immigrants no date has been set for 
the vote in parliament 
the new immigration package includes 50 million for housing 
56 million for education and 8 million for job training 
david boaz the director of the finance ministrys budget 
division said that under the emergency spending plan the 
government would build 45000 units of public housing up from 
3000 last year 
boaz said most of the units would be built in israels central 
region from the cities of ashkelon to haifa to east jerusalem 
this appeared to be in contradiction to statements by housing 
ministry officials that no construction would take place on 
occupied territory 
arab east jerusalem was captured along with the west bank from 
jordan in the 1967 middle east war israel annexed east jerusalem 
and declared the united city the nations capital the united 
states has said the status of jerusalem should be negotiated in 
peace talks with the arabs and opposes jewish settlements on 
captured land 
boaz said the most difficult problem in resettling the soviet 
jews was in providing jobs for the immigrants many of whom are 
academics and technicians and face stiff competition from a highly 
skilled israeli labor force 
israel has a 9 percent unemployment rate and labor ministry 
officials have said it was well above that for university 
graduates 
the 13member cabinet of prime minister yitzhak shamirs 
transition government voted on each item of the plan each section 
won the approval of at least 10 ministers 
we succeeded in getting across the sense of emergency that 
israel is not prepared for this flood of immigrants boaz said

andrei p kirilenko a former politburo member who 
once was believed in line to succeed leonid i brezhnev as soviet 
leader has died the official news agency tass reported monday he 
was 84 
cause of his death saturday was given by tass only as a grave 
illness reports of kirilenkos ill health surfaced when he 
dropped from sight in september 1982 and his retirement from the 
communist partys ruling politburo where he had been a full member 
since 1962 became known a month later 
after kirilenko retired yuri andropov and konstantin chernenko 
became leading candidates to succeed brezhnev andropov was named 
soviet leader upon brezhnevs death on nov 10 1982 and chernenko 
succeeded andropov when he died in 1984 
kirilenko who had close ties to brezhnev dating to the 1930s 
when both shared regional party duties in the ukraine served for 
seven years as party leader in the industrial city of sverdlovsk 
when brezhnev succeeded nikita s khrushchev kirilenkos 
stature also rose and in 1966 he was named central committee 
secretary for internal political questions and party work taking 
charge of daytoday party activities 
he also was given overall supervision of heavy industry giving 
him important connections with the soviet defense establishment 
as brezhnevs health worsened kirilenko stood in for him at 
important party functions 
although kirilenkos sudden fall from power in 1982 officially 
was attributed to ill health he appeared in public to show his 
respects when brezhnev lay in state standing far from other 
members of the politburo 
reports circulated that his demise actually occurred because his 
son defected to the west 
tass did not mention any survivors in keeping with the 
traditional soviet practice of not reporting on the personal lives 
of officials 
it said only that the memory of andrei pavlovich kirilenko 
will be held dear to those who knew him

late next year rather than this year 
kohl noted monday that in east germany there are discussions 
about having allgerman elections this year 
the chancellor had conceded a bitter defeat in sundays vote 
as he spoke to reporters in bonn after a strategy session with 
other christian democratic leaders the opposition social democrats 
won control of the upper house of parliament the bundesrat 
through election victories in the states of north rhinewestphalia 
and lower saxony 
this could strengthen social democratic chances of defeating 
kohl in december federal elections 
the lower house the bundestag is the actual lawmaking body 
but bundesrat approval is needed for legislation that has direct 
consequences for the finances of west germanys 11 states that 
could give kohl weighty problems as he tries to push through his 
unification plans 
the election setback came amid another jolt for kohl failure 
of a team of experts from both germanys to agree on key aspects of 
unification 
the leftleaning social democrats have been trying to put the 
brakes on kohls push for rapid unification which they say 
threatens the jobs and pocketbooks of germans in both countries 
east german social democrats said in a statement monday that the 
election outcome means the influence of social democratic 
policies on the unity process has become distinctly greater because 
of the election outcome 
the social fears of people in both parts of germany may no 
longer be ignored 
expert delegations from both germanys late saturday completed 
the draft of a state treaty that is to serve as a basis for an 
economic currency and social union of the countries by july 2 
but west german government spokesman dieter vogel conceded a 
touchy issue whether to let west germans buy up east german 
property was tabled 
negotiations will be continued this week on a political 
level vogel said sunday 
failure to agree on how to transfer east germanys stateowned 
property and industries to the private sector indicates de maiziere 
is reluctant to allow west german interests to buy up east 
germanys vast stateowned holdings 
de maiziere like kohl favors a quick shift to a free market 
and fast unification 
but he has been under pressure from east german social 
democrats who are part of his governing coalition to seek more 
social guarantees for east germans and slow the talks

police on monday arrested two members of a group 
of blacks who allegedly cracked the skull of a vietnamese man 
during a confrontation punctuated by racial slurs 
the crime was classified as a bias assault but police 
commissioner lee brown stressed that it was not a premeditated 
attack having grown out of a chance encounter 
the fight also wasnt related to a blackled boycott of two 
nearby koreanamerican grocery stores brown said 
sundays attack exacerbated tensions in a city where race 
relations are under such strain that mayor david dinkins the first 
black ever to hold the office made a televised appeal friday for 
an end to bigotry and hate 
also monday two juries continued deliberating in the 
bensonhurst racial attack case two white youths are charged with 
murder in the death of a black teenager killed by a mob he 
encountered in the predominantly white bensonhurst neighborhood 
the grocery boycott began jan 18 after a black woman allegedly 
was roughed up by workers in one of the stores because she had 
refused to let them look in her purse though boycott organizers 
insist it isnt racially motivated pickets outside the stores have 
shouted antikorean slurs 
the two teenagers arrested monday live near the scene of 
blackvietnamese melee in the flatbush neighborhood of brooklyn 
ulner alsaint 18 was charged with felonious assault and 
possession of a dangerous instrument a claw hammer brown told 
reporters a 13yearold girl whose name was withheld was charged 
as a juvenile with criminal mischief 
alsaint is accused of hitting tuan ana cao over the head 
fracturing his skull cao was listed in guarded and stable 
condition at kings county hospital where he was interviewed by 
detectives from the police bias squad

teenagers leaving parties gathered in front of an apartment 
building 
the 13yearold girl threw a beer bottle shattering a window in 
the groundfloor apartment 
six vietnamese men were eating at a table close to the 
window brown said some of the vietnamese men left the 
apartment to find out what happened and a dispute erupted 
each side accused the other of starting the trouble and each 
accused the other of having at least one knife though no knives 
were found 
the blacks screamed koreans get out of america and other 
slurs against koreans chinese and japanese because of that the 
crime was classified as biasrelated 
theres absolutely nothing to suggest that they went to that 
location because of asians being in that apartment brown said 
there also was no indication the teenagers had taken part in the 
grocery boycott he added 
alsaint who told police he carried the hammer for selfdefense 
said he struck cao while defending himself

judges in two notorious human 
rights cases have absolved all but three of 17 defendants most of 
them military men 
only two of those still facing charges monday one in each case 
are in custody and subject to trial a third is at large 
the cases involve the 1988 massacre of 10 peasants and the 
kidnapforprofit of several businessmen 
while attention has been focused on the six jesuit priests slain 
by soldiers last november developments in these two cases have 
gone virtually unreported each however at one time was 
considered a crucial test of a judiciary supposedly reformed to 
foster respect for human rights in a society chararacterized by 
widespread violation of such rights 
the main motive for vice president dan quayles visit to el 
salvador in february 1989 was to impress on the goverment and 
military washingtons expectations regarding prosecution of the 
case known as the san francisco massacre 
on sept 21 1988 soldiers of the jiboa battalion rounded up 
suspected collaborators of leftist guerrillas in the hamlet of san 
francisco 25 miles east of san salvador 
according to extensive testimony from soldiers a detail 
blindfolded seven men and three women tied their hands behind 
their backs and marched them off 
about a mile down the trail the soldiers halted their prisoners 
and bunched them together witnesses said sgt rafael villalobos 
detonated a mine he had placed next to the campesinos then joined 
other soldiers in spraying the dead and wounded with assault rifle 
fire 
the army first reported the 10 deaths as guerrillas killed in 
combat then it said the peasants were killed by guerrillas in an 
ambush of the army column escorting them 
but a week after quayles visit the military faced with a 
mountain of evidence said maj mauricio beltran was responsible 
after 20 months of compiling evidence and taking testimony 
judge alcides guandique dropped charges against seven defendants 
but ruled beltran and villalobos had to stand trial for murder 
an appeals court absolved villalobos on the ground he limited 
himself to carrying out beltrans order 
the higher court also noted what it called technical errors in 
reporting investigation results 
beltrans trial by jury is not expected for at least two months 
according to us officials closely following the case his 
conviction is far from assured 
those same officials reacted with disgust to the appeals court 
ruling but would not be quoted for the record 
late last month authorities dismissed charges against six of 
eight men charged with participation in a ring that kidnapped at 
least five wealthy businessmen between march 1982 and february 1986 
an army major and three lieutenants were among the eight men 
indicted those four and the four civilians charged were friends or 
associates of cashiered army maj roberto daubuisson 
only three of the eight defendants were captured and one of 
them escaped last year 
along with daubuisson founder of the governing arena party 
the defendants were linked to rightist death squads that killed 
thousands of suspected leftists in the early 1980s daubuisson has 
denied such involvement 
judge jorge serrano who was handling the case and who 
reportedly turned down offers of bribes to dismiss charges was 
killed by a death squad on may 11 1988 
san salvadors 3rd criminal court cited lack of evidence in 
dismissing charges last month against six defendants including 
three current or former army officers 
the court ordered a trial for former army lt isidro lopez 
sibrian who is in jail and businessman orlando llovera ballete 
who escaped 
the national association of private enterprise to which several 
kidnap victims belonged reacted angrily to dismissal of charges 
the decision demonstrates a lack of responsibility of some 
judges who allow themselves to be influenced by those who wield 
pressure of individuals or of groups said the association and 
asked the supreme court to investigate 
the court in fullpage newspaper ads responded that the 
judiciary was independent and that the association should mind its 
own business

the federal election commission voting along 
partisan lines has rejected allegations that a political action 
committee for foreign car dealers made illegal contributions to two 
republican senate campaigns in 1988 
the commission did allege a lesser violation against one of 
those campaigns that of florida gop sen connie mack saying it 
failed to disclose information about its donors in the final days 
of the campaign 
the mack campaign agreed to settle the case by paying a 3500 
fine according to commission records released monday 
the agencys decisions on the major allegations were made in a 
closed meeting six months ago but they were not made public until 
monday because of the confidential negotiations with the mack 
campaign on the lesser allegation 
the case involved the auto dealers and drivers for free trade 
pac which spent more than 3 million to influence 1988 
congressional elections relying heavily on socalled independent 
expenditure campaigns 
the commissions general counsel had urged the commission to 
open an enforcement action by accusing the auto dealers pac and the 
mack campaign of violating election laws that recommendation 
alleged a 326000 advertising campaign by the pac supporting mack 
did not meet the standards for independent expenditures and 
therefore was an illegal contribution to mack 
but the sixmember commissions three republican appointees 
refused to accept the recommendation four votes are needed for the 
panel to begin an enforcement action two democrats voted to accept 
the recommendation one was absent 
in the case of the second campaign the unsuccessful 1988 
reelection bid of nevada sen chic hecht the commission voted 50 
to accept the general counsels recommendation to dismiss the 
allegations made by the democratic senatorial campaign committee 
that groups electioneve complaint alleged the spending by the 
auto dealers pac on behalf of mack was illegal because there was 
coordination between the pac and the campaign 
mack was in a close race with democratic rep buddy mckay and 
the democratic senatorial campaign committee unsucessfully sought a 
preelection ruling from the commission ordering the pacs florida 
spots off the air mack ultimately won by just 35000 votes of more 
than 4 million cast 
pacs and other groups are allowed to pay for ads and other 
materials supporting or opposing candidates but such efforts 
qualify as independent expenditures only if there is no contact or 
coordination with the campaigns 
if there is coordination the ads would be considered 
contributions and subject to limits the dealers pac already had 
donated the maximum amounts to mack and hecht before launching the 
advertising campaigns 
in its complaint the democratic senatorial campaign committee 
said that the pac and mack campaigns both had hired the same 
advertising firm multimedia and a texasbased political 
consultant karl rove and it said the auto dealers pacs 521000 
effort to support hecht used ads virtually identical to official 
hecht ads suggesting collaboration 
in response the dealers pac said it retained multimedia and 
rove for 1988 campaign activities but hired a separate firm for the 
florida ads still the fec general counsel said the pac failed to 
prove there was no coordination and recommeded the commission open 
an enforcement case 
the commissions reasons for rejecting the recommendation were 
unclear the panel traditionally includes in the public record a 
statement explaining its vote but has yet to do so 
in recommending dismissal of the portions of the democratic 
senatorial campaign committee dealing with hecht the fecs general 
counsel said the pacs ads were similar to official campaign ads 
but not of a likeness which would indicate cooperation or 
coordination

a synthetic version of an aids virus fragment 
may be tested later this year to determine if it can protect unborn 
babies from developing aids a new york researcher announced monday 
dr arye rubinstein professor at the albert einstein college of 
medicine in new york said studies in his lab have shown that 
mothers infected with human immunodefiency virus hiv which 
causes aids will not pass the disease to their unborn if their 
immune system develops a particular type of antibody 
rubinstein said the bodys immune system makes this antibody in 
response to a specific protein found in the gp120 molecule which 
is part of the surface of the hiv virus that specific protein is 
called the principle neutralizing domain or pnd 
in a paper published in the may issue of the proceedings of the 
national academy of sciences rubinstein said his laboratory was 
able to correctly identify infants who would become hivinfected by 
assessing the level of this pnd antibody in their blood of their 
mothers 
rubinstein said that blood samples from 15 women all at high 
risk for hiv infection were analyzed for the presence of the pnd 
antibody later babies born to these women were given blood tests 
at regular intervals for a year 
all of the mothers tested positive for the hiv virus but only 
11 of the 15 babies born to these women developed the disease and 
each of the four babies that remained diseasefree was born to a 
mother whose prenatal blood tests showed a high level of the pnd 
antibody 
this study provides evidence that protective antibodies 
might prevent infection by hiv in the developing fetus 
rubinstein reports in the paper 
in a talk monday at the town forum on aids sponsored by the 
institute for advanced studies in immunology and aging rubinstein 
said his group plans to conduct trials later this year of a vaccine 
that uses a synthetic version of the pnd protein 
rubinstein said his group would use the synthetic pnd protein in 
a vaccination of pregnant women who test positive for hiv it is 
hoped he said that the protein would stimulate the womens immune 
systems to produce the antibodies 
this approach could provide immunity to fetuses of women who 
are infected with the hiv virus said rubinstein 
the study will be conducted in a clinic in south bronx but no 
date has been set for the vaccine trial to begin

for a super cannon destined for iraq west german television 
reported monday 
the brief report on the ard television network said 17 cases 
containing various equipment were seized by customs officials 
the shipment originated in belgium and arrived in frankfurt via 
switzerland the cases were slated to be picked up by iraqi airways 
in frankfurt ard said 
the report said authrities suspect the seized equipment could be 
parts for iraqs socalled super cannon 
according to the report the machinery was declared as oil 
industry equipment the ard report monday night gave no other 
details 
spokesmen for the frankfurt prosecutors office could not be 
reached late monday to comment on the report border police and 
customs officials at frankfurt airport declined to comment 
authorities in britain italy and other european countries have 
made similiar seizures of iraqibound equipment in recent weeks 
italian investigators are probing whether steel parts seized in 
italy could be parts of the super cannon that is allegedly 
capable of firing nuclear or chemical warheads into israel and iran 
after meeting with italian officials iraqi foreign minister 
tariq aziz on monday said the steel parts were needed for 
petrochemical projects 
authorities last week announced the seizure of nearly 100 tons 
of steel tubing and other parts about to be shipped out of italy to 
jordan to be transported overland from there presumably to an 
assembly point near baghdad 
the italian foreign ministry said only that italian foreign 
minister gianni de michelis met with his iraqi counterpart aziz but 
did not say what they discussed 
aziz was in rome to meet with un secretarygeneral javier 
perez de cuellar 
nearly all the seized components came from a foundry in the 
umbrian city of terni that is part of ilva spa a stateowned 
company that is the worlds fifthlargest steelmaker 
police officials on saturday said it appeared the terni foundry 
was making pieces that would make up the rear end of a giant 
artillery gun they theorized that the section was to have been 
assembled in iraq and joined to the front end alleged pieces of 
which were seized in britain several weeks ago 
on monday prosecutors in terni said an italian is being 
questioned on suspicion of illegal arms trafficking in the case 
they said interrogation of foundry technicians and managers was 
continuing 
aziz on monday called reports about an iraqi super gun a big 
lie which originated from london 
iraq said monday it would take legal action against britain 
italy turkey greece and any other countries that take illegal 
measures to stop imports of equipment purchased by iraq 
the official iraqi news agency monitored in cyprus quoted an 
unidentified industry ministry spokesman as saying the parts were 
purchased from european companies and paid for 
also on monday british broadcasting corp television reported 
in london that an iraqi government official has acknowledged that 
executed journalist farzad bazoft informed iraqi authorities of his 
plans to visit a weapons plant 
the londonbased journalist for the observer weekly newspaper 
was arrested in september while investigating reports of a major 
explosion at the aliskandaria military complex south of baghdad 
bazoft confessed to spying on iraqi tv but retracted the 
confession at his trial he was hanged march 15 
the bbc quoted an unidentified iraqi minister as saying bazoft 
applied for official permission to visit the complex the bbc said 
it was the first such iraqi acknowledgment 
bazoft was a stateless iranian who traveled on british papers

the government on monday decreed 
strikes by public workers illegal urged an immediate return to 
work and threatened to fire anyone who does not comply 
unemployed nicaraguans said they would be glad to take the jobs 
of the striking public workers 
labor minister francisco rosales accused the recently ousted 
sandinistas of fomenting the strikes to hobble the 19dayold 
government of president violeta barrios de chamorro and gave 
workers until tuesday to return to work 
sandinista labor leaders said they would widen the strikes on 
tuesday shutting down telephone service public transportation 
schools and banks if the government did not back off from its 
threats 
there will be an escalation of the strikes and we hope we 
dont have to paralyze the country because we have the capacity to 
do it lucio jimenez of the sandinista workers central told 
reporters 
he also said an attorney was petitioning the supreme court 
asking that the labor ministry decree declaring the strikes illegal 
be revoked 
were still not calling a general strike were giving 
dialogue and negotiation an opportunity jimenez said 
but he added as long as there is no solution we cant 
disarm the strike is our weapon 
rosales in a news conference broadcast live on national tv 
said the government made the decision after efforts to negotiate an 
end to the strike failed 
he said negotiations in progress since last friday had been 
blocked several times by hotheads 
its a matter of them sandinistas trying to torpedo the 
negotiations he said adding it is very clear to us that this 
is a political problem not a labor one 
now the way out of this problem is in the hands of the 
sandinista workers central and the national union of employees 
rosales said 
presidential spokesman danilo lacayo said about 10000 public 
workers out of 150000 nationwide were on strike 
workers are demanding either a 200 percent raise or a minimum 
monthly salary equivalent to 150 they also want a law 
guaranteeing their rights reinstated and guarantees that there 
will be no retaliation against the strikers 
nicaraguas currency the cordoba has been devalued four times 
in less than a month and retail prices have soared the workers 
earlier rejected a government offer of an acrosstheboard 60 
percent pay raise 
airport workers have also threatened to join the strike 
since thursday airport employees have been on a partial strike 
handling only passenger flights all other duties diplomatic 
pouches air freight mail and customs have been put on hold 
a complete strike could close managuas international airport 
on monday morning workers at the finance ministry were holed up 
inside the building and about 200 people waited outside to pay 
their taxes or start work 
some people in the crowd shouted to the strikers bums go 
back to work 
six antiriot police vehicles including one with a teargas 
grenade launcher arrived and an officer with a loudspeaker told 
the crowd to disperse 
judicial workers also were on strike monday 
with nicaraguas high unemployment it is unlikely the strikers 
could shut down the system estimates of the unemployment rate run 
as high as 45 percent 
if they dont want to work we want to work why dont they 
give us those jobs said alba yeni mendoza an unemployed typist 
with two children whose husband is in jail 
mrs mendoza was in a group of about 25 women standing in front 
of the presidential building demanding to speak with mrs chamorro 
about their imprisoned relatives 
mrs chamorro decreed an amnesty when she took office april 25 
carlos lopez president of the regional committee of the 
unemployed said his group had 3000 members and were willing to 
fill those jobs 
he also attributed the strikes to the sandinista front which 
mrs chamorros 14party coalition defeated in the feb 25 
elections

a free trade agreement with mexico could take 
less time to negotiate than the one with canada the mexican 
ambassador said monday 
we can go faster i think the key issues are going to be 
fewer gustavo petricioli mexicos ambassador to the united 
states told the border trade alliance 
if we can agree on the fundamentals the basis of our 
positions on both sides we can move very very fast 
members of the alliance a looseknit group of business leaders 
and government officials from texas new mexico arizona and 
california said petriciolis message was another sign mexico is 
serious about doing away with trade barriers 
its happening you can see the countries cooperating said 
gene gibbs chairman of a brownsville texas bank 
the two countries are informally negotiating free trade 
commerce secretary robert mosbacher has said 
its not going to be like some member of congress makes a 
speech were going to have free trade manana thats not going to 
happen said rep kika de la garza dtexas 
some trace the beginning of the uscanadian agreement which 
took effect last year to a 1965 agreement largely freeing trade in 
automobiles and their components between the two countries others 
say the two countries worked on free trade for about 10 years 
serious negotiating did not begin until after prime minister brian 
mulroney made an agreement a major policy goal in 1986 
mexico and the united states have not made a similar commitment 
to negotiate an agreement 
despite greater cultural differences petricioli said a free 
trade agreement between the united states and mexico could be 
achieved much more quickly because the canadian agreement would 
provide a model 
but he said we are looking for a good deal for mexico not 
any deal

alexander dubcek on monday rejected the idea 
that he might have averted the 1968 sovietled invasion of 
czechoslovakia with more caution or adroitness in pursuing prague 
spring reforms 
the short answer is that i wouldnt have done it differently 
it would have been against the needs of our people dubcek 
czechoslovak communist party chief at the time of the invasion 
told a news conference at the us capitol 
i must say i am very pleased that i have kept my principles 
because if i hadnt i would be in the shoes of other people who 
just cant face their people any more he added referring to 
ousted leaders in poland and hungary 
dubcek was restored in pragues peaceful revolution last winter 
as federal assembly president after living for two decades in 
political disgrace and isolation he said his efforts a generation 
earlier to create socialism with a human face were 
indispensable 
the proof he said is that today i can face the people in the 
public squares unlike nowdiscredited orthodox communists in 
other eastern european countries 
commenting on the new democratic governments probes of the past 
two decades of hardline rule he said he is against collective 
guilt meaning communists should be judged by specific actions 
not party membership he said he did not know the details of recent 
prague demonstrations calling for exleaders to be punished and 
noted that measures are being taken to recover wronglydiverted 
stolen public assets 
while efforts are being made to identify those former comrades 
who signed the letter inviting warsaw pact armies to intervene in 
czechoslovakia dubcek said it doesnt really matter how many 
signatures there were nothing can justify the invasion which was 
the doing of the respective countries a decision of the 
governments of the participating countries 
czechoslovakia was invaded by units from poland hungary east 
germany and bulgaria in addition to the soviet union 
lithuania and the other baltic republics seeking independence 
from soviet rule need should engage moscow in prolonged 
negotiations and take pains to avoid provoking the soviet military 
dubcek told vice president dan quayle according to quayles 
spokesman 
the meeting with quayle concluded dubceks first trip to north 
america for talks with us and canadian government legislative 
and business leaders the czechosovak official was flying home 
aboard a government plane during the night aides said 
vice presidential spokesman david beckwith described as a good 
meeting the quayledubcek talk of more than 30 minutes citing 
long delay for congressional approval of urgent us aid for 
nicaragua and panama the vice president asked czechoslovakia to be 
patient for clearing of final congressional action to allow its 
goods to gain us tariff concessions on its goods known as most 
favored nation treatment the spokesman said 
at the time of the prague spring dubcek said czechoslovakias 
traditions of democracy and scientific and industrial skills made 
it ripe for changes even though we attempted something not 
possible for us to reach at that time 
dubcek a backer of soviet president mikhail gorbachevs reform 
movement appealed for understanding of gorbachevs difficult 
legacy of economic domestic and foreign relations problems 
it is necessary to alter views about the soviet union and not 
be against everything there he said 
the soviet union needs help in many fields diplomatic 
economic and political first of all dubcek added 
czechoslovak and soviet conditions are very different he said 
but the two countries today share aims of democratization 
decentralizing their economies and easing divisions between the 
people and the state

salaberrydevalleyfield quebec ap an opponent of gambling 
on the st regis indian reservation was charged with seconddegree 
murder monday in the death of a fellow mohawk two weeks after gun 
battles triggered a police intervention 
doug george 35 pleaded innocent to the charge in quebec 
provincial court and was returned to custody george one of five 
mohawks arrested in the may 1 killing of 31yearold harold 
junior edwards surrendered to quebec provincial police on 
sunday night 
his brother david george 42 pleaded innocent to dangerous use 
of a firearm and was released on his own recognizance 
authorities have yet to file charges against the other three 
mohawks arrested sunday roger mitchell steve lazore and ken 
lazore all from the antigambling faction 
their attorney philip schneider noted that in quebec people 
must be arraigned in court within 24 hours of their arrest 
the fact that there is no sworn information after 36 hours in 
detention against these three people to me is an indication they 
dont have a strong case against them schneider said 
the strifetorn reservation straddles the uscanadian border 
reaching into quebec and new york state 
the mohawks are bitterly divided over whether to allow gambling 
on the reservation casinos provide jobs and income but attract 
outside influences 
members of the progambling warriors society a selfappointed 
reservation security force said edwards was neutral on the 
gambling issue he was working in a yard near the scene of a 
gunbattle between the warriors and the antigambling faction 
according to those who found his body 
police estimate 5000 rounds were fired in the fight 
the bitter divisions that have ripped the reservation since 
casinos first mushroomed on a strip of a new york state highway in 
late 1988 were reflected at the packed courthouse mohawks on both 
sides of the issue avoided speaking to each other 
four of the five suspects were arrested early sunday 
they were taken from their homes in the quebec section of the 
reservation and brought to provincial police headquarters in 
montreal police spokesman robert poeti said 
poeti said an investigation also continued into the shooting of 
matthew pyke 22 who was killed the same day in the same section 
of the reservation in snye quebec pyke was opposed to gambling 
since the slayings canadian and new york state police have 
sealed off the reservation with numerous roadblocks keeping 
nonresidents out and effectively closing down the casinos along 
with many of the other businesses on mohawk land 
the reservation has been peaceful since the police moved in 
with the exception of a drug raid last week by canadian officials 
who arrested 21 people and seized marijuana and cocaine worth 
800000 in us currency

members of the general agreement on tariffs and 
trade are expected to approve the soviet unions application for 
observer status with the international trade forum trade sources 
said monday 
the sources who declined to be further identified said gatts 
council on wednesday was likely to agree to moscows request to 
become an observer at the marketoriented trade body 
such a decision would take immediate effect enabling soviet 
representatives to attend the 96nation council gatts top 
decisionmaking body that deliberates on trade disputes and other 
mainstream issues affecting global commerce 
firsthand knowledge of changes in the world trading system are 
regarded as important to back up the soviet economic and trade 
reforms being championed by president mikhail s gorbachev 
even if the application for observer status is approved this 
week the soviet union would not be privy to the socalled uruguay 
round of talks intended to draw up comprehensive new agreements to 
liberalize trade in areas such as agriculture and textiles 
nor would the soviet union automatically qualify for 
multilateral trading benefits enjoyed by many of gatts full 
members 
about 30 countries are currently classed as observers including 
china which is seeking full membership 
president bush last december dropped washingtons longstanding 
opposition to a soviet presence in gatt but the united states 
argued that moscow should wait until the end of the uruguay round 
in december before being admitted 
gatts council in april deferred decision pending further 
informal consultations 
the genevabased forum acts as a rulebook for international 
trade and sponsors tradeliberalizing accords its members account 
for more than fourfifths of world trade

the fbi has identified about a dozen suspects in 
the 200 million theft of artworks by rembrandt vermeer and others 
from the isabella stewart gardner museum a newspaper reported 
monday 
the suspects are in various countries and federal agents are 
closely watching their movements the boston globe reported 
quoting unidentified sources one suspect in the march 18 heist was 
spotted recently at bostons logan international airport the paper 
said 
the fbi didnt respond monday to a request for confirmation 
some suspects reportedly were named by informants others are 
individuals who have used methods similar to those of the two men 
who disguised themselves as police to fool museum guards 
they took two paintings and an etching by rembrandt three 
prints and two charcoals by edgar degas one painting each by 
edouard manet jan vermeer and govaert flinck and a bronze dating 
to the chinese shang dynasty 12001100 bc 
the thieves got into the museum about 115 am by telling a 
guard they were investigating a disturbance they lured one guard 
away from alarms by asking for his identification after saying 
there might be a warrant for his arrest 
the thieves bound and gagged the two guards and partly disabled 
the museums security system 
investigators said the theft may have been done under contract 
because the thieves left behind works more valuable than some they 
stole 
the fbi said agents in several us cities and foreign capitals 
have been checking hundreds of leads the paper said a 1 million 
reward offered by two art auction houses has encouraged tips

the steadily rising red river forced more louisiana families to 
evacuate monday and may have contributed to a murdersuicide by a 
farmer evacuations also continued along texas trinity river 
where 7000 were urged to head for high ground 
the red river had started to recede in parts of arkansas but 
100 national guardsmen reinforced by two helicopters hauling 
sandbags labored to prevent the collapse of a levee guarding the 
town of garland 
since april 15 13 deaths have been blamed on flooding 12 in 
texas and one in oklahoma 
damage to texas agriculture alone has been estimated at between 
500 million and 700 million during the past two weeks since 
heavy rain fell in oklahoma and northern texas in the watersheds 
of the trinity and red rivers 
the red river is expected to flood 600 square miles of 
louisiana including 200 square miles of cropland said maj jack 
scherer of the army corps of engineers 
a tornado brought more misery monday night injuring three 
people and destroying several homes near the west texas city of 
abilene several buildings in the communities of radium and tuxedo 
were destroyed said tracy daniel of the jones county sheriffs 
department who was unable to provide further details 
three people injured by the storm were treated at hamlin 
memorial hospital but only one was hurt badly enough to be 
hospitalized officials said 
the flooding may have led a farmer in northwestern louisiana to 
kill his wife and himself a neighbor said desoto parish farmer 
james mcmullen 58 shot his 58yearold wife billie and then 
himself sunday said sheriffs capt marvin melton 
the threat of losing all of his crops may have been too much for 
mcmullen said neighbor and close friend tommy dugan mcmullens 
300 to 400 acres of wheat and 800 to 900 acres in cotton were 
threatened by flooding 
i dont think its flooded yet but they must of been 
depressed about something melton said the couple left a note 
but it did little more than detail funeral arrangements he said 
an estimated 250 families have or may have to flee their 
shreveport and bossier city homes as the red river was expected to 
rise to its highest level in 45 years 
in texas operators of the lake livingston dam on the trinity 
river increased the release of water from the dam to make way for 
the rivers approaching flood crest augmented by heavy rain 
saturday upstream at crockett the flood gates were opened wider 
monday to let water roar through at a rate of about 71500 cubic 
feet per second and the dams record of 75000 cfs set in 1973 
likely would be topped by tuesday officials said normal flow is 
20000 cfs and anything over that causes flooding 
this is the largest slug of water weve ever seen come down 
the trinity river to lake livingston were going to have to make 
the largest releases weve ever made said john jadrosich 
spokesman for the trinity river authority 
the rivers crest which started in the dallas area is expected 
to reach lake livingston in a week and the dam then may have to 
release up to 100000 cubic feet per second he said 
below the dam an estimated 7000 people were urged to evacuate 
whats scary is what we know is coming said alanna shaver 
whose family left their hardin home in favor of a trailer next to a 
red cross shelter where 50 people had already taken refuge 
texas agriculture commissioner jim hightower said flooded 
regions combine to produce 33 percent of the states wheat crop 66 
percent of the oats and 49 percent of the hay 
hightower said damage also includes 
in houston county 50000 acres including 20000 acres of crop 
land are under water 
the majority of the 13 million wheat crop in henderson and 
anderson counties has been destroyed 
the texas prison system largest single farm operator in the 
midtrinity river basin expects to lose 500000 from flooding of 
corn cotton grain sorghum and other crops they expect 27000 
acres of crop and pasture land to be under water and 5000 head of 
cattle to be evacuated 
in southwestern arkansas about 100 national guardsmen 
sandbagged both sides of the levee at garland working to patch 
leaks boiling up underneath the dam said gary talley of the state 
office of emergency services 
garland is in a serious situation and will remain so for the 
next several days he said if the levee breaks 250 to 300 
houses would be affected in the town of 660 he said 
although the river crested sunday he said its going to be 
the end of the week before were really out danger down there 
and thats provided we get no more really heavy rain 
almost 1000 people have been evacuated in arkansas talley said 
his agency estimates damage to roads and other public property 
will be at least 10 million damage to private property cant be 
assessed until the water recedes the agency also estimates 300000 
to 450000 acres of farmland has been damaged 
flooding was mostly over in oklahoma except for spots like lake 
texoma on the texasoklahoma border which rose to about 27 feet 
above normal the army corps of engineers says it may be five to 
six weeks before it is near normal again 
oklahoma gov henry bellmon requested federal disaster aid 
friday for 36 of the states 77 counties saying more than 5

soviet president mikhail s gorbachev may 
visit california and minnesota after concluding summit talks with 
president bush early next month at the white house and at camp 
david us officials said monday 
gorbachev wants to meet with businessmen in both states and 
perhaps speak at stanford university near palo alto calif 
officials said 
an affiliate of stanford is the hoover institution on war 
revolution and peace which has the worlds largest collection of 
material on the 1917 communist revolution in russia and houses 
noted scholars of the soviet union 
they expressed a desire to travel beyond washington one 
official said nothing has been finalized so this is just a 
tentative indication of his plans 
the news caught officials in both states by surprise 
theres no truth to it as far was we can tell said mary ann 
seawell a stanford spokeswoman who said she checked with the 
university presidents office 
gorbachev and his wife raisa have a longstanding invitation to 
see former president ronald reagan and his wife nancy in los 
angeles however reagan spokesman mark weinberg said he was 
unaware of any plans for a gettogether 
officials said the minnesota stop would be in minneapolis but it 
was not clear what gorbachev would do there 
gov rudy perpich of minnesota said the white house told him to 
expect a decision on a minnesota visit by gorbachev in the next 
week possibly in the next 48 hours 
i think its bigger than the super bowl which minnesotas 
vikings entry of the national football league will host in 1992 
said perpich 
but the governor said he had no idea what the soviet leader 
might want to see when perpich was asked where he would most like 
to take the visitor the governor replied hibbing to visit my 
father and mother 
gorbachev is to arrive in washington on may 30 for his second 
summit with bush following their meeting on the island of malta 
last december white house statements have indicated the talks 
would conclude by june 3 
commenting on gorbachevs travel plans a us official 
speaking on condition of anonymity said he has always said he 
wants to see more of america 
another official said after the summit where gorbachev goes 
is purely up to the soviets 
a soviet advance team returned to moscow late last week after 
working with white house planners on an itinerary and sites for the 
summit 
the summit schedule was to have been announced monday but was 
delayed for at least 24 hours as the white house tried to pin down 
gorbachevs postsummit travel plans 
white house officials believe that gorbachev will arrive at 
andrews air force base outside washington on wednesday evening may 
30 
a formal welcoming ceremony is planned the next day at the white 
house along with a state dinner that night during the day bush 
and gorbachev are to hold talks at the white house 
june 1 the second day of their meeting has been reserved for 
signing any agreements that result from the meeting gorbachev also 
is expected to give a reciprocal dinner for bush 
on june 2 the two leaders are to go to camp david the 
presidential retreat in marylands catoctin mountains 
originally gorbachev was to have spent the night at camp david 
however officials say it now appears likely he will leave in the 
evening 
gorbachev has been to the united states twice in december 1987 
he held a summit meeting in washington with reagan the two leaders 
signed a treaty to abolish the two nations intermediaterange 
nuclear missiles 
then in december 1988 gorbachev met with reagan in new york 
in a telephone interview reagan spokesman weinberg said no 
one involved in planning president gorbachevs visit to the united 
states has been in contact with our office 
he recalled that reagan before leaving office talked with 
gorbachev in a farewell phone call and invited him to visit 
gorbachev also invited reagan to visit the soviet union weinberg 
said 
he said the invitations had been renewed in subsequent 
communications between gorbachev and reagan

gov rose mofford called the legislature into 
special session monday to consider a new martin luther king 
holiday hoping to forestall a referendum on the issue that has 
scarred the states image 
the bill to create a new paid holiday for state employees could 
face a key senate vote as early as tuesday but additional votes 
could take until friday it would replace a bill mrs mofford 
signed last year to trade in the paid columbus day holiday for a 
holiday in honor of the slain civil rights leader 
last years bill was a mistake that the legislature made 
mrs mofford said monday 
asked why she had signed it with much ceremony if she considered 
it such a mistake mrs mofford replied you dont veto a moral 
issue i never thought that it would come to this 
in its present form the bill would make both king day and 
colombus days state holidays but opponents said they might offer 
amendments to create space for a new king day by combining separate 
state holidays for washington and lincoln or to to offer state 
employees a cafeteriastyle choice of which holidays to honor 
controversy over a king holiday has dogged the states 
politicians for years democratic gov bruce babbitt declared a 
holiday by executive proclamation as he was about to start a 
presidential bid in 1986 but republican attorney general bob 
corbin called it an illegal usurpation of the legislatures role 
and republican gov evan mecham rescinded it days before it would 
have taken effect 
the ensuing uproar included protest marches tourist boycotts 
and convention cancellations by national organizations 
the furor also fueled a recall drive against mecham but a 
senate court of impeachment ousted him on other grounds before the 
recall vote could be held 
fortyseven states have some sort of official holiday honoring 
king arizona has an unpaid holiday for him proclaimed by mecham 
the third sunday in january the other states without official king 
holidays are montana and new hampshire 
the bill before the legislature would add the third monday in 
january to the list of paid holidays for state employees and retain 
columbus day as a paid holiday 
adding king day to the holiday list rather than swapping it for 
columbus day would cost the state an estimated 500000 to 35 
million but mrs mofford a democrat said the cost was worth it 
to avoid bad publicity over the lack of a king holiday 
i would trade that any time for the amount of money it could 
cost us in the end she said citing new boycotts including a 
threatened boycott involving the national football leagues super 
bowl im embarrassed because were being referred to as a racial 
state 
last years measure is in legal limbo pending a statewide vote 
because a coalition of columbus supporters and king opponents 
gathered nearly twice the 43350 signatures needed to force a 
referendum 
mondays bill would wipe out the referendum but king opponents 
and mecham have promised to gather new signatures and force the 
issue back on the ballot 
mrs mofford said she did not fear a referendum but believed 
lawmakers should decide the issue 
the state constitution gives opponents of the measure 90 days 
from the time the session ends in which to gather the signatures 
required for a referendum 
last years bill was approved in the fall allowing referendum 
backers to gather signatures in pleasant weather and during street 
fairs and football games this years 90day period would take 
place during summers blazing heat when there are few large 
gatherings 
mecham who is running for governor again has promised to put 
up to 4000 of his volunteers into the field to help gather 
signatures and organizers predict theyll get the signatures 
within two months

give a positive sign to support the reforms

earlier this month de klerk opened talks with an african 
national congress delegation led by nelson mandela and reached a 
broad agreement to work for an end to political violence and 
prepare the way for black entry into government

decades of international isolation because of its racial policies 
de klerks ninenation european tour is the most extensive by a 
south african leader since his national party won elections in 1948 
and imposed the apartheid system the party has held power ever

attorneys for double murderer robert alton 
harris argued before an appeals court monday that he should be 
spared the gas chamber because he got inadequate psychiatric advice 
at his original trial 
if the 9th us circuit court of appeals panel agrees with the 
argument it could open hundreds of cases to challenge an attorney 
for the state argued 
harris now 37 was convicted of the 1978 murders of two san 
diego teenagers whose car he wanted for a bank robbery 
following a long series of appeals he was sentenced to die in 
the gas chamber april 3 in the first execution in california since 
1967 
but a 9th circuit judge john noonan stayed the execution four 
days before it was to take place 
on monday a threejudge 9th circuit panel that included noonan 
was asked to decide if its proper to go back and evaluate the 
competence of the psychiatric advice given the defense in harris 
original trial in 1979 his attorneys argued the original jury 
should have been told about his extensive mental disorders 
the arguments centered on a 1985 us supreme court ruling that 
established a defendants constitutional right to a competent 
psychiatrist who will conduct an appropriate examination 
defense lawyers say new studies found harris suffers from 
organic brain damage fetal alcohol effect and other traumas from 
childhood and prenatal abuse 
harris lawyers contend those disorders should have been 
detected by the psychiatrists who aided his original trial lawyer 
and that the jury given such evidence probably would not have 
sentenced him to death 
the defense is asking the court to order a factfinding hearing 
in a lower court on the competency of the psychiatric advice their 
ultimate goal is to get a new trial on harris sentence if not the 
murder verdict 
the state attorney generals office defending the death 
sentence disputed the claims of incompetence state lawyers went 
on to argue that the claims of incompetence are beside the point 
because the supreme court guaranteed only the right of access to a 
licensed psychiatrist which harris had 
defense lawyer charles sevilla countered that the right to 
competent psychiatric aid means more than a licensed warm body 
but judge arthur alarcon told him the same argument had been 
rejected by three other federal courts including two appeals 
courts 
judge melvin brunetti suggested the defense was trying to expand 
the scope of the supreme courts 1985 ruling ake vs oklahoma 
deputy attorney general jay bloom said a ruling in harris favor 
would open maybe hundreds who knows thousands of cases to 
challenge in areas far beyond psychiatry 
any expert could be subject to attack bloom said anyone 
could come in and say i dont agree why should someone who 
comes along 12 years later be any more qualified than the original 
jury 
the judges questioned defense lawyers closely on whether the 
court could evaluate the work of harris psychiatrists who gave 
confidential advice to harris trial lawyer thomas ryan but 
didnt testify 
alarcon noted that evidence of harris alleged mental disorders 
might have been inconsistent with his defense at trial which 
blamed the shootings on his brother danny 
defense lawyer michael mccabe replied that harris lawyer had 
lacked the competent psychiatric evaluations he needed to make a 
sound decision on strategy

the state of florida is seeking to join the st petersburg times 
in a legal battle over stock dividends with a minority shareholder 
group led by texas billionaire robert m bass 
bass name was also mentioned as majority owners of freedom 
newspapers inc of irvine calif created a voting block to thwart 
unwanted suitors 
florida attorney general bob butterworth filed a motion may 9 to 
intervene in us district court in tampa saying he wanted to help 
fend off an attack by profiteers 
in short the attorney general has an interest in this case 
because it involves the administration of a charitable organization 
in florida butterworth said 
bass is working with poynterjamison ventures limited 
partnership the group filed suit in february against the times 
publishing co and the poynter institute a nonprofit journalism 
school that uses st petersburg times stock dividends to support 
its operations 
the bass group wants the times to redeem certain stock in the 
company thus giving the partnership a more equitable return on its 
investment 
the relief sought by the ventures partners would significantly 
diminish the future resources of the poynter institute 
butterworth said 
bass is aligned with relatives of the late nelson poynter who 
founded the institute and set up the unusual stock arrangement the 
group which owns 40 percent of the voting stock gets only 57 
percent of the dividends of times publishing 
the times has refused to redeem the disputed shares saying it 
wants to protect journalistic integrity of the newspaper and the 
institute 
at freedom majority shareholders representing two families 
asked merger lawyer martin lipton to create an agreement that votes 
their shares as a block essentially barring them from selling 
their stock to anyone but members of the families 
the action is meant to signal to anybody who is thinking of 
making a raid on the company that were determined to remain a 
privately held closely held family company robert c hardie 
chairman of irvinebased freedom newspapers said may 4 the 
company owns the orange county register 26 other daily newspapers 
and five television stations 
dissident shareholder harry hoiles has threatened repeatedly to 
sell his stock to an outside party and majority owners were 
concerned that he might align himself with bass hoiles was 
accompanied to several freedom meetings this year by attorney glen 
johnson whose firm works with the robert m bass group hoiles has 
said he has not talked to any bass officials about selling his 
stock to the fort worth investor 
hoiles has been battling the families of his sister mary jane 
hardie and late brother clarence h hoiles for more than a 
decade in an effort to split up the company and take his share of 
the assets 
as heirs to founder rc hoiles the three families each hold 
about onethird of the shares of freedom 
the majority stockholders contend that hoiles is entitled only 
to the value of his stock not the assets hoiles lost lower and 
appellate court cases to break up the assets but has said he plans 
to bring the case to the state supreme court

a jury found the dallas morning news did not set 
out to wreck its rival in obtaining 26 comics and features that had 
been running in the dallas times herald 
the harris county jury voted 102 on may 8 to reject the times 
heralds claim for at least 33 million in damages 
the times herald had contended the morning news and its parent 
the ah belo corp violated antitrust laws by taking over the 
features in a move to drive the times herald out of business 
the features which ran in the times herald until last fall 
included doonesbury the far side dear abby and erma bombeck 
times herald attorney wayne fisher said the newspaper will 
appeal 
we disagree that the conduct of our competitor was legal or 
proper in any way the paper said in a statement in fact it 
was wrong in many ways wrong morally wrong ethically wrong for 
the profession of journalism and wrong for dallas and its people 
belo chairman robert decherd said the most important thing 
now is for our two companies to go about making the best newspapers 
we can and benefit the communities we serve we feel strongly weve 
been vindicated 
decherd denied the morning news intended to drive the times 
herald out of business 
the morning news said it obtained the comics and features as 
part of a joint venture with universal press syndicate inc of 
kansas city the distributor of the features to get into the tv 
programming business 
witnesses for belo and the syndicate testified that universal 
press required all its features in the times herald be moved to the 
morning news as part of the venture 
the venture will use syndicate comics characters in tv programs 
and commercials to encourage newspaper readership 
the times herald had asked for 33 million in actual damages and 
unspecified punitive damages the 33 million would have been 
tripled had the times herald been successful in its lawsuit

a state appeals court on may 8 reinstated a libel 
suit filed by a former ciaowned airline against a television 
station over a report on drugcarrying planes 
the 3rd district court of appeal reversed a dade circuit court 
decision dismissing the case against wplgtv and ordered a trial on 
defamation claims by southern air transport 
the evidence tended to show that wplgtv didnt give the cargo 
carrier a fair opportunity to respond to the drug allegations 
in a series aired in 1987 the appeals court ruled 
the judges agreed with the lower court that southern air was a 
limited public figure which in legal terms means the airline would 
have to prove the station knew its story was false or aired it with 
reckless disregard for the truth 
southern air received widespread publicity before the series as 
a supplier for usbased contra rebels fighting nicaraguas ruling 
sandinistas 
the stations report included an informers statement that she 
watched as drugs were loaded on a southern air plane in colombia 
the same woman repeated the allegations before a us senate 
committee 
other defendants in the case are the station owner

a newport newspapers inconspicuous list of 
divorces could become a test of a states right to bar public 
information from being reported by the news media 
the us supreme court has refused to say whether states can put 
offlimits otherwise public information by invoking privacy 
concerns a newport divorce lawyer contends rhode islands privacy 
law is such a shield 
attorney thomas w kelly is suing the newport daily news on 
behalf of a woman who wants to keep her name out of the newspapers 
monthly listing of divorces granted in newport county family court 
a hearing in the case was scheduled for may 14 
the supreme court has opened the door for the first time 
said kelly citing its june 1989 ruling clearing the florida star 
newspaper after it published the name of a rape victim despite 
state law against such publication 
the paper was not liable for invasion of privacy the high court 
ruled but there might be a zone of personal privacy within which 
the state may protect the individual from intrusion by the press 
rhode islands 10yearold privacy law provides the right to be 
secure from unreasonable publicity of a fact which would be 
offensive or objectionable to a reasonable man of ordinary 
sensibilities 
kelly acknowledges his chances of winning are slim but argues 
his client is entitled to privacy because she is not a prominent 
figure and has not run for public office he wants the newspaper to 
discern the newsworthiness of the divorces it publishes 
jane kirtley head of the reporters committee for the freedom of 
the press said the lawsuit is frivolous in open court she said 
the press role is to act as a surrogate for that portion of the 
public which cannot be there 
harvard university law professor alan dershowitz who defended 
newport socialite claus von bulow on charges he attempted to murder 
his wife said there is no possibility a state can bar 
publication of a public record 
the only way for the state to get around that is to say 
divorce is not a matter of public record but of course it is 
dershowitz said 
david b offer the newspapers editor said divorces are 
noteworthy regardless of the people involved because of their 
effects on the community its businesses schools churches and 
welfare programs 
some may call that voyeurism or scandal offer said but 
it seems to me that if divorces are of interest to a segment of 
the community that people have a right to read about them in a 
community newspaper

censorship ended with the fall of 
nicolae ceausescu in december but the opposition says state 
control of television and major newspapers is just as effective 
spokesmen for independent news outlets and parties say telling 
the opposition story is extremely difficult as romania approaches 
its first free elections in 44 years scheduled for may 20 
the chief target of criticism is the national salvation front 
which dominates the interim government and is suspected by many of 
seeking to bring back a milder form of communism 
many ranking members of the front including interim president 
ion iliescu are former communists who had been critical of 
ceausescu front leaders profess democratic ideals including a 
commitment to freedom of the press 
the human rights law group based in washington dc said 
after a factfinding tour in late april that many romanians 
believed the front controlled the government 
it said the fronts advantages are amplified by the 
governments control of television printing presses and newsprint 
distribution of national and opposition print media international 
communications networks and air and ground transport 
there are widespread complaints that the newspapers 
distributed by the government especially those of opposition 
parties and certain independent papers often fail to reach their 
destination are not delivered promptly or are returned when they 
could have been sold the monitoring group said

nbc which once tried to buy 51 percent of cable 
news network is planning its own 24hour news service for its 
affiliates nbc news president michael gartner said may 7 
the affiliates could use the service as part of their own 
broadcasts or when nbc is dark and not broadcasting the plan 
likely will be presented to affiliates at their annual convention 
on june 36 in washington dc 
the proposal drew praise from james r sefert chairman of the 
nbc affiliates board although he emphasized he didnt have full 
details of it he likened it to an extension of an nbc news service 
called anews which sends affiliates news reports from nbc news 
and nbc affiliates 
nbc executives have told him in broad terms what the new service 
would be and i think its terrific said sefert president of 
cosmos broadcasting corp in greenville sc 
i really cant comment until i see the full proposal he 
said when asked if he thought nbcaffiliated stations would approve 
the idea but the outline sounded good 
its too early to tell cnn spokesman steve haworth said 
when asked about nbcs plan which could prove a rival for cnn at 
least with nbc affiliates that also take cnn service 
we still are studying it haworth said but weve 
developed very strong relationships with 220 broadcast affiliates 
over the 10 years that weve been in business were certainly

not seeking reelection 
republicans who have been locked out of the governors office 
for 16 years are fighting to end what they call oneparty rule 
in the state 
the gops prospects rose as a slump in the state economy and a

in his later years the great ty cobb came home 
to georgia in a fitful attempt to find peace now a drama trying 
to find the essence of the tempestuous cobb has come to georgia 
too 
cobb a look at the legend by playwright lee blessing is 
now playing at atlantas alliance theatre after its rookie 
production last year at the yale repertory theatre 
the play is directed by tony winner lloyd richards named best 
director for the broadway production of august wilsons fences 
richards is in his 11th season as artistic director of the yale 
rep yales success with the work last year led alliance officials 
to bring the production to atlanta 
its important for me in one sense to take a play about cobb 
and bring it down here blessing said i hope atlantans will 
take a look at cobb who is from north georgia and more 
identified with the state than any athlete ever has been and 
recognize something in what ive created that really rings true to 
them 
in getting the acclaimed play ready for the alliance and for a 
run at san diegos old globe theatre later this year blessing has 
rewritten parts of the work to sharpen some things up make some 
arguments stronger make some things funnier get rid of some dead 
wood he said 
still the play remains a look at the tormented soul of the man 
known as the georgia peach the recordsetting batter and 
basestealer who died renowned for his performance on the baseball 
field but vilified and virtually friendless 
he developed and earned a reputation as the meanest man in 
baseball blessing said 
the audience sees four characters in argument with each other 
and with themselves three are cobb himself the 20yearold peach 
just launching his fabulous career the 40yearold ty his playing 
days nearing an end and the 70yearold mr cobb four years from 
the grave 
the fourth character is also in a way a part of cobb oscar 
charleston a gifted and fiery ballplayer known as the black 
cobb charleston relegated to the negro leagues throughout his 
long career never won the public acclaim cobb did never was 
documented statistically the way cobb was and didnt make the hall 
of fame until 1976 and the cobb characters struggling to mold 
their myth cannot bear to hear it 
this play is in every sense a dispute blessing said 
cobb disputing with himself disputing with charleston disputing 
with the audience 
the convention of the play is that he has an interest that 
goes beyond the grave he wants not only to have been in the record 
one of the best baseball players who ever lived but he is still 
fighting for his myth 
its justifiable i think to create a play in which the myth 
is arguing with itself and disputing what it is to us and in a 
sense pleading with us to be something better than it fears were 
making it 
blessing a devout follower of the game hopes his audience will 
learn something about cobb the man and about oscar charleston 
too 
i have been a baseball fan all my life but it was only in 
researching this play that i even discovered the name oscar 
charleston he said some of the black players still alive 
today would tell you he was the best player who ever lived 
still the author of the tonynominated diplomacy drama a walk 
in the woods is a playwright not a baseball historian and 
blessing said he has been careful to create a play with emotion 
humor and something for even antibaseball fans those who 
believe baseball fanatics probably ought to be committed 
theres plenty here for a person who is interested in studying 
a human life theres even things for people who want to be 
entertained honest he said with a chuckle 
blessing called the alliance one of the most significant 
theaters in the united states and he doesnt necessarily view 
atlanta as a doublea stop in the ascension to broadways major 
league 
ive long since stopped having new york as a goal he said 
if a play goes to new york thats fine but for me the alliance 
is a goal yale was a goal im very excited about resident 
theater in this country and what its contributed 
i dont think a persons really a complete playwright without 
being in new york in a sense but i dont think a persons really 
a complete playwright without being in a resident theater 
the alliance presentation runs through june 3

campaign promises are not uttered under oath 
and president bush will not lack for company should he decide to 
renege on his vehement vow against new taxes 
ronald reagan did it on the same subject at least a dozen 
times and all without sacrificing the impression that he was an 
unyielding tax cut man 
bush of course has not undone his readmylips nonewtaxes 
refrain from the 1988 campaign all he has done is to ask 
congressional democrats to bargain on the budget without 
preconditions a process that is to begin today 
going in without preconditions does not mean that there will be 
an identifiable tax increase as part of the bargain coming out 
its a good bet that in the end the republican white house will 
just say no 
the reasons wouldnt have a lot to do with the sanctity of a 
1988 campaign pledge with cold war and defense concerns ebbing 
the notax stance may be the best issue the republicans have going 
for them 
furthermore for some conservatives it is more than an issue 
it is a policy by which they mean to starve the welfare state for 
funds there is also the dilemma of a government that has run up 
massive deficits in boom times facing the prospect of a need for 
more taxes just when the economy could be slipping 
campaign pledges are another matter they are made by the 
dozens and they come with no voteback guarantee dissatisfied 
voters can only wait until the next election and by then the 
issues may have changed and bygone promises may be forgotten 
that is as old as politics cicero wrote about electioneering in 
rome and his guidelines still apply 
all men have a feeling that they would rather you told them a 
civil lie than give them a pointblank refusal if you make a 
promise the thing is still uncertain depends on a future day and 
concerns but few people but if you refuse you alienate people to 
a certainty and at once and many people too 
the damage depends on the issue 
a promise broken by lyndon b johnson was the undoing of his 
presidency campaigning in 1964 johnson said he was not about to 
send american boys 9000 or 10000 miles away from home to do what 
asian boys ought to be doing for themselves but he did after 
winning landslide election and the vietnam war was the burden that 
led him to renounce candidacy four years later 
richard m nixon was wily enough to leave some room for maneuver 
in his campaign promises in 1968 for example he said he would 
end the war and win the peace although he didnt say how or when 
it ended but not on those terms the last americans withdrew from 
saigon in 1975 and north vietnam took over nixon who had 
resigned the white house over watergate by that time said congress 
forced the defeat by restricting and then refusing funds for the 
war 
jimmy carter promised in 1976 that hed balance the federal 
budget in his first term he couldnt come close reagan upped that 
ante saying he would balance it and cut taxes he got the tax cut 
but deficits soared reagan blamed it on a recession and on 
congress 
he made an art form of raising taxes while presenting himself as 
the archfoe of tax increases 
as governor of california he said he would not tolerate a tax 
increase and declared his feet were planted in cement on the 
matter when he had to have a tax increase anyhow he said the 
sound people heard was the cement cracking 
as president he confounded the democrats by championing one 
giant tax cut and then approving a series of increases sen george 
mitchell dmaine now the majority leader says reagan proposed or 
signed 13 tax increases and in the process convinced the 
american people that he was against all of them 
backing off a campaign pledge is as mitchell said a rather 
commonplace occurrence in american history 
nixon said last week that bush can change his position with no 
problem at all he can say i believed at the time but the 
situation has changed and im dealing with it 
thats one way to scrap a promise 
in the earl of louisiana aj liebling recounts another 
the story of a lobbyist who sought repeal of a state tax on movie 
tickets he campaigned for earl long for governor on the strength 
of a promise of repeal but when long won he recommended extension 
of the tax 
the fellow went to see him and he said i told my clients that 
you said you wanted their support and you wouldnt block removal of 
the tax what do i tell them now 
you know what old earl said 
he said ill tell you what to tell them tell them i lied

need standins and eddie albert and eva gabor reprise their roles 
as a successful manhattan lawyer and his ditzy wife they played 
the characters from 1965 to 1971 when cbs ended its price supports 
for their makebelieve farm 
gabor who is sixtysomething dahling and dont push your luck 
by asking what digit comes after the six is back on the publicity 
trail these days doing interviews to promote the movie special 
at her beverly hills mansion a few days back a reporter a 
photographer a cbs publicist and gabors own publicist sit 
downstairs waiting for zsa zsas younger nicer sister to make 
an entrance 
im sorry im late she says breezing into the living room 
with her makeup artist trailing behind 
much discussion ensues about the best place to shoot photos 
gabor keeps up two conversations at once one admonishing the 
photographer to not get too close and dont shoot me from below 
dahling always shoot a woman from up high and the other with 
her makeup artist what do you think dahling i think theyll 
be ok 
photos done gabor turns her attention to the rug where her 
dogs have had an accident please dont step on the wet spot 
she says and rings for the maid to bring a towel to cover the 
offending dampness 
the photographer leaves the makeup artist leaves gabor turns 
her attention to the interview with the cbs publicist taking notes 
here we are back again she says except for lucy i 
dont know of any other show thats been on as much as green 
acres its on in africa its everywhere 
people recognize her no matter where she goes she says 
oftentimes mistaking her for her copslapping sister sari aka zsa 
zsa being mixed up with her sister is something she has had to 
deal with most of her life 
it does not help to be from a family where there is so much 
chaos she says and laughs i walk down the street and people 
yell hey zsa zsa and i say not zsa zsa eva 
eva has been married five times but now is single she owns the 
largest wig company in the world she plays tennis dines often 
with pal merv griffin and grows a bushelful of roses and orchids 
she employs one secretary two maids and five gardeners to look 
after her sprawling estate its a tragedy she says it 
keeps me broke 
she was happy to do green acres revisited she says 
we are all back and kicking she says pat buttram mr 
haney said everyone of us is looking at the other and saying 
my god have they got old except for me of course 
playing lisa douglas is not easy she says people think 
comedy is easy to do its not its harder 
and though she loves the part dahling she thinks it has 
stereotyped her 
hollywood typecasts you always its very difficult to get out 
of that i was never given a chance to do a performance where the 
audience can see that im a serious actress i know im a good 
actress she says 
when she arrived here from budapest gabor signed with paramount 
pictures and did two unmemorable movies forced landing in 
1941 a b picture only to those too lazy to go down the 
alphabet she wrote in her 1954 autobiography orchids and 
salami and 1942s pacific blackout 
paramount soon dropped her television however was kinder as 
gabor tackled variety shows guest appearances and even chekhov 
costarring with boris karloff in uncle vanya 
i have worked since i was 16 she says i never knew where 
my next meal was coming or how nobody ever gave me anything they 
took 
once you do a character like lisa douglas no one thinks of 
you as a dramatic actress

marcia palacios mother never dreamed that her daughter would 
work in a cage with three tigers two lions three leopards two 
bears two hyenas and a wolf neither for that matter did she 
my fathers never seen the circus said palacio who is from 
staines england when my mother saw me work she went through 
two packets of cigarettes i heard her scream 
it all started nine years ago when the former ballet dancer 
then known as marcia spence met animal trainer luis palacio a 
native of tijuana mexico 
first they became a couple then they became coworkers 
marcia started tending baby animals learning the ropes from luis 
who had worked for circuses since he was 11 years old in 1988 she 
stepped into the cage with her husband and the big beasts 
i was terrified she recalled 
but she went into it with her eyes open 
on july 18 1986 during another circus in england marcia 
palacio had watched in horror from outside the cage as a lion bit 
and slashed luis the badly mauled trainer finally returned to work 
in may 1988 with a jagged scar across his jugular 
marcia went through the whole thing luis said she was 
there when it happened and there through the surgery she nursed 
me and learned to change the tracheotomy and do injections 
after he recovered ringling had an opening for a twoperson 
act despite the job hazard shed witnessed marcia wanted to try 
it 
now luis performs with several animals at the front of the cage 
while marcia controls the remaining animals at the rear at the 
finale marcia rides a tiger around the ring 
its very difficult to separate the relationship inside the 
cage and outside said luis sometimes when she makes a 
mistake i scream at her thats how i was taught but im 
growing 
the two relax by sightseeing but even a brave liontrainer has 
fears asked if they saw the empire state building while working in 
new york city luis shrugged 
wed have to go up he said i dont like going up

but i knew in my heart i could do it somehow she said 
after years of physical conditioning laurie became the only 
american woman to master a triple aerial somersault 
now jid is her husband as well as her catcher his face lights 
up when he talks about the circus and about his wifes 
accomplishments 
i love what im doing he said when an audience responds 
when people like me i feel proud and im proud of what shes 
doing too 
how do they balance the demands of living and working together 
you have to communicate a lot he said you need to talk 
to each other all the time on the trapeze 
its very hard said laurie you have to separate your 
personal life from your professional life and you still have to 
trust each other even though youre arguing you still know hes 
there to catch you

i found that 36 percent of the people aged 77 to 81 in sun 
city were childless compared to 19 percent in the nation as a 
whole she said 
that age groups childbearing years were during the depression 
and world war ii so their productivity was low to begin with 
still nearly twice the national average represents quite a piling 
up of childless people in sun city 
no children of course is the way of life in sun city a 
reporter could find no sun citian who admitted to missing the daily 
presence of children most on the contrary said they fully 
supported the rules that prohibit home ownership by anyone younger 
than 55 and ban visits for more than 90 days by anyone younger than 
18 
when sun citians found the rules difficult to enforce they 
petitoned the county zoning board successfully to give them the 
force of law only 3 percent refused to sign the petition 
we buy a lifestyle as well as a home said one another 
agreed but said he was certain many who signed felt pressure from 
their neighbors to do so 
the average sun city home among variously priced models goes for 
135000 eight out of 10 newcomers equityrich from their 
previous home sale pay cash nearly every household has a 
latemodel car or two the second car is often a golf cart 
equipped with headlights and other requirements for street driving 
to the supermarket and hairdresser as often as the golf course 
phoenix residents see sun citys upper middle class affluence as 
an obvious boon a total net worth within those walls of 8 
billion bank deposits of 4 billion state and county taxes of 32 
million yearly 
even so many in phoenix and other towns in this valley hold 
unvarnished resentment toward sun city and all it represents 
they have it made out there behind their walls and dont give 
one tiny damn about the rest of the world said howard grimes of 
nearby glendale who is 69 and retired i wouldnt care if they 
all moved away tomorrow 
the reasons are obvious during one 12year period sun citians 
united to vote down 17 of 19 school bond issues until neighboring 
towns whose youngsters were on double and triple shifts for lack 
of schools found a legal way to allow sun city to get out and form 
their own district they voted against a county transportation 
project a beautification project and fought for nine years to 
avoid property taxes on its golf courses swimming pools and 
clubhouses valued at 12 million until it lost the battle last 
year in the state supreme court 
resentment has grown so deep that last fall the del webb corp 
mounted a 250000 advertising campaign called sun city cares 
to change the image by stressing the work of sun citys network of 
volunteers which is prodigious and nearby schools a major 
beneficiary 
clearly sun city represents a potent political force eighty 
percent of its voters are registered republicans as opposed to 50 
percent in the state as a whole including sun city but it would 
be a mistake to take their votes for granted 
eight years ago one of their own residents president of a local 
republican club ran for county supervisor and lost narrowly his 
opponent was a 34yearold lawyer a democrat a female four years 
later the winner carole carpenter won reelection with 70 percent 
of the vote 
ms carpenter for her part feels sun citys locally tarnished 
reputation is somewhat of a bum rap she says she sees no great 
concern by others in the county for nursing homes and longterm 
care for the elderly in a state that has no medicaid program 
its a twoway street she said 
sun citys developers themselves shoved aside those predictable 
and essential needs for years ironically as part of a way to 
rescue itself from foundering 
about five years after it opened sun citys house sales fell to 
the point that webb who died in 1974 believed his venture would 
fail as so many had before notably in florida he figured as had 
many in florida that his house prices then about 9000 were too 
high and decided to solve the problem by adding an adjoining 
trailer park a routine florida solution 
he polled his residents and discovered many would leave if he 
did that so he went the other way he opened a new section of more 
expensive homes sales went up the secret he discovered was a 
feeling of exclusivity 
retirement is an unfamiliar change for everybody said 
deborah sullivan the arizona state sociologist a vacation away 
from home is not expecially for the financially well fixed what 
sun city became then and remains today in its promotion is that 
familiar playland for those who can afford it a resort 
nursing homes just didnt fit the picture they were as welcome 
as a skunk at a picnic eventually though sun citians aging in 
place became older frailer now their average age is 73 with 
threequarters of them over 75 
eventually the residents themselves demanded longterm care 
opening a floodgate for entrepreneurs today more than 25 services 
for varying degrees of care cluster around sun city nine of them 
inside the walls along with a 350bed notforprofit hospital a 
corps of 1300 volunteers provides services for patients and 
families about 250 doctors and dentists opened offices nearby 
availability of geriatric care became a lure rather than a 
turnoff and so did a wider selection of more elaborate houses 
with each new sun city addition for sale signs tend to remain 
longer on homes in the original section where the youngold are 
less willing to move in among the oldold and the homes there are 
less commodious 
along with sun citys evolution into a resort grew an 
increased awareness of status in a community that began as rather 
classless two private country clubs appeared and a private dinner 
club overlooking a manmade lake the sun city directory lists 
along with address and phone number the owners former occupation 
according to some longtime residents an earlier gaiety as 
among vacationers is less evident now like any other community 
disputes among residents are not uncommon as both they and their 
city age together a continuing dispute over whether or not to 
incorporate so far not has prevailed in three elections has 
caused lasting enmities one meeting became so heated two old 
timers stepped behind the hall to duke it out 
in general though tranquility prevails in camelot perhaps 
after the next 30 years sun citys critics and champions will find 
the answer to the final question the one that troubles sun citians 
the least 
that is whether the forces that shaped their place on heavens 
doorstep also work for the benefit of all of society

you will find no rough edges here no 
unswept driveway no unmowed lawn no jail 
this retirement community and adjoining sun city west have a 
population of 65000 about the same as galveston texas or 
portland maine or harrisburg pa and are virtually crime free 
about the most serious thing that happens around here is 
somebodys golf clubs getting snatched off a golf cart parked at 
the supermarket said norman thaler but any sort of violent 
crime no none of that 
thaler is one of 200 deputies in the sun city west posse 
another 200 deputies patrol sun city so 400 possemen all in 
vehicles all residents all retired all trained and duly 
deputized by the maricopa county sheriff patrol 23 square miles of 
pristine streets night and day troublemakers beware 
we dont arrest anybody thaler said if we see something 
that doesnt look right we phone the sheriff what we do for the 
most part is keep trouble from happening 
the residents apparently approve in every survey they list 
security among the main benefits sun city offers as a place to 
live out their years especially those who came here as many did 
from a big city 
to keep trouble from happening the possemen leave a note on the 
eat of every unlocked car phone the homeowner if a garage door is 
left open generally keep watch like a cop on a beat if they see 
potential trouble afoot an unfamiliar young person say they keep 
an eye on him 
anyone who goes on vacation or takes a trip fills out a card 
for us listing where they can be reached and who has a key to 
their house usually a neighbor thaler said we check those 
homes daily about 300 right now but about 2000 during the 
vacation time from july to september 
the posse also provides a service specifically tailored for a 
retirement community the average age here is 73 if a person with 
alzheimers disease strays from home in confusion which is not 
uncommon the posse mounts a wellpracticed grid search 
so far they always get their man

the music takes on a latin beat the 
dancers glue their bodies together they are doing yes the 
lambada the provocative brazilian dance that is the rage in the 
west 
the lambada in ulan bator in mongolia 
why not said suhjargalmaa a top editor at the official 
montsame news agency we knew about the beatles as soon as they 
appeared 
not only the beatles but such rock and pop stars as prince 
pink floyd phil collins and paula abdul have big followings among 
the hip urban youth of this communistruled shepherding nation 
tapes are carried in from eastern europe for decades mongolias 
door to the world 
but now with the cold war receding into history and mongolia 
learning glasnost and perestroika from its soviet mentor 
mongolians are eager for direct contact with the nonsocialist 
world 
if you were to stand here and shout out that you are an 
american probably a lot of people would crowd around just to see 
what you are like said my translator orgil a 27yearold 
foreign ministry worker who learned his fluent english in moscow 
like most mongolians he uses only one name 
after decades of letting in but a few western journalists the 
foreign ministry welcomed dozens early this year to witness 
mongolias first steps toward multiparty elections expected this 
summer 
it drafted nearly every english speaker in ulan bator to serve 
as translators and set up special phone and telex lines that 
eased but did not eliminate problems in contacting the outside 
world it even arranged news conferences with the countrys 
brandnew opposition parties 
geographically historically and politically mongolia still 
hovers in uncharted territory between its stalinist past and 
hopedfor democratic future geographically it stands along the 
chinesesoviet border where it harbors the gobi desert long under 
chinese influence it slipped into the soviet sphere relatively 
recently historic home of the mongol hordes that swept europe it 
uses the greekderived cyrillic alphabet of the slavic countries 
and the soviet union contradictions abound they always have 
for example among our translators were several people 
identified by their colleagues or opposition party members as 
having secret police connections 
the words long live the mongolian peoples revolutionary 
party the formal name of the communists still dominate a 
hillside over ulan bator in yardshigh stone letters evidence 
that the party believes in loosening up but not giving up 
the close sovietbloc tie is another part of the past that wont 
easily be erased it is stamped on the face of ulan bator in the 
stolid sovietstyle buildings the central square that imitates red 
square the sovietmade volga and lada cars 
it was the soviets who taught mongolians to eat potatoes and 
bread and drink vodka with their traditional mutton television 
viewers can pick from mongolias one station or the soviet channel 
almost all trade is with the soviet union or its other allies 
shops sell czech beer bulgarian pickle relish and east german 
fashion magazines 
the blond men dancing with the lonely wives of soviet soldiers 
in the hotel ulan bators bar are polish ukrainian and east german 
black marketeers profiting from the shortages left by 
stateplanned economies up and down the transsiberian railroad 
they bring chinese consumer goods to ulan bator and mongolian 
cashmere to moscow 
the east bloc connection has europeanized urban mongolians 
giving them a cosmopolitan air absent from the neighboring 
socialist capitals of beijing and pyongyang nowhere in beijing is 
there a bartender like bowtied arslan of the hotel ulan bator who 
serves up nightly political commentary in english german russian 
and a little japanese 
for this european polish suhjarlgalmaa said mongolians should 
be grateful to former dictator yumjaagiyn tsedenbal who married a 
soviet woman and made mongoliansoviet friendship a matter of 
dogma but hers is a minority view 
my chief concern on the streets was not to be mistaken for a 
russian so as to avoid the cold stares poor service and hissed 
obscenities directed at them 
people are fed up with everything soviet one local resident 
said mongolians are reveling in a new surge of nationalism with 
genghis khan the 13thcentury warrior king as their hero 
two hit rock songs sing the khans praises artists and scholars 
recently formed a society called genghis khans tent to revive 
traditional culture a taxi driver pasted a color picture of 
genghis khan like a holy card on the dashboard of his soviet sedan 
the party newspaper unen now prints its name in mongolias 
ancient script as well as in the cyrillic letters forcibly 
introduced in the 1940s schools offer night courses in the old 
script to young adults raised on cyrillic

some observers wonder if the government is encouraging 
traditionalism to divert attention from modern problems such as 
economic stagnation and rising crime 
a leading economist disclosed in april that more than half of 
mongolias 2 million people earn only the minimum wage of 260 
tugriks a month or less about 46 us dollars 
industrial production fell early in the year as workers took 
advantage of the political thaw to stage slowdowns and illegal 
strikes housing consumer goods and even meat one of mongolias 
chief products are perennially in short supply 
sometimes in summer we cant get meat for two or three 
weeks said orig a retired teacher in the tiny rural town of 
hugar southwest of ulan bator he said the town hopes to open a 
free market soon adding this will help solve the shortages 
but even ulan bators twiceweekly free market offers slim 
pickings to the thousands who visit it they file hopefully past 
stalls that display small heaps of salvaged screws and bolts rusty 
saws and screwdrivers homemade picture frames and a broken 
television valuable for its parts 
most of the customers come from nearby settlements of shanties 
and gers traditional felt tents known better in the west by their 
turkish name yurts stark and colorless the gertowns stretch 
across treeless grassless hills on ulan bators fringes 
children play ball in the dirt residents carry buckets to 
communal faucets but dig their own toilets sometimes badly as 
small rivulets of leaking sewage testify 
small wonder that the gertowns are the cradle of youth gangs 
with names like the gray wolves that fight each other and are 
blamed for a recent surge in muggings and rapes foreign ministry 
staff warned me against walking alone at night even in the city 
center 
neither the ruling party nor the halfdozen new opposition 
groups has offered a practical blueprint for dealing with these 
economic and social problems 
political wrangling has absorbed much of their energies already 
the leading opposition group the mongolian democratic association 
and its affiliated party has purged its top ranks twice amid 
charges of personal ambition 
rural dwellers make up only 37 percent of mongolias population 
but in this summers legislative elections they will have the 
decisive say the ruling party strongest in the countryside 
recently gave them more legislative seats than city dwellers 
how much they understand or care about the recent political 
changes remains to be seen 
i asked gonchig a 61yearold seminomadic herder in rural 
uvurhangai province what he thought of the opposition hunger 
strike in march that forced the communists to give up their 
constitutional hold on power 
we understood that it wasnt that they didnt have enough to 
eat that they were making political demands gonchig said 
chuckling of course to some extent they are crazy 
he follows developments sketchily via radio reports and copies 
of unen delivered to his ger once a week by pony express 
out in the rolling grasslands away from ulan bators incessant 
political debates it is easy to share gonchigs priorities 
the sight of white sheep against the green pasture is really 
quite lovely said orgil city born and bred 
indeed it is lovely even when seen from a soviet jeep that is 
hurtling across the open steppe bumping through ruts and rivers 
or from a mongolian twinpropeller plane that has spun off the 
gravel runway of a rural airport and become mired in the soft 
steppe mud 
in true mongolian fashion the 40odd passengers indulged in no 
screaming or complaining with them we journalists waited in the 
clear cold air as the pilot and crew dug the plane out

whats this are you sure this is new york city 
the inspirational home of blackboard jungle take a look at 
this high school on manhattans lower east side a nursery for 
excellence from nobel prize winners to jimmy cagney its pennant 
flies on the moon 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
in new york city the dropout rate approaches 30 
percent and armed school guards and metal detectors outnumber lunch 
boxes around the nation reading writing and rithmatic are in 
ruins 
and then theres stuyvesant high school 
there is no dropout rate no drug problem one hundred percent 
of its graduates go to college a majority to ivy league schools 
the football team has a 91 grade average and scored an average of 
1300 on national scholastic aptitude tests the national average 
is 903 
this one school on manhattans lower east side also boasts two 
nobel laureates and one fields medalist in math among its countless 
prestigious alumni perennially it wins more westinghouse science 
awards and national merit scholarships than nearly any school in 
the nation 
people are always trying to figure out if we have some special 
secret or formula says principal abraham baumel we really 
dont 
trying to figure out how stuyvesant came to be a diamond in new 
yorks thorny educational crown is like debating which came first 
the chicken or the egghead does the schools reputation for 
excellence help attract the best students or do the 
creamofthecrop kids build the stuyvesant mystique 
the answers baumel says are yes and yes 
stuyvesant students come from all over the city some traveling 
up to two hours from the outlying boroughs of staten island and 
queens they represent some of the citys richest and poorest 
families and their interests are as diverse as their heritages 
but if the 2700member student body has a single common 
attribute baumel says its that theyre highly motivated 
the kids in this school pursue academics with the same vigor 
most of middle america pursues sports the principal says when 
a kid gets 100 here kids will say hey way to go man its like 
the quarterback just tossed a crucial pass 
indeed trophy cases that line stuyvesants five floors are 
jammed with plaques and trophies from math science poetry and 
debate contests 
yellowing photos of students shaking hands with presidents and 
governors are tacked on bulletin boards amid handmade signs for a 
veal boycott a young astronauts club meeting and ads for the comic 
book marketplace 
students take courses in portuguese the bible as 
literature and language mind and artificial intelligence 
the level of work is unbelievable the work they do is on a level 
that would destroy the average college student much less the 
average high school student baumel says 
if you dont work hard theres not a place for you in this 
school says 17yearold bianca santomasso 
some teachers find stuyvesant students intimidating the work 
is very demanding the kids are very demanding the principal 
says 
others are inspired its incredible i learn from them 
says biology teacher roz bierig they know things that arent 
even published yet 
long before specialized magnet schools became the educational 
vogue stuyvesant sandwiched between ritzy gramercy park and a 
pocket of drugplagued projects was turning out some of the 
nations brightest students 
its eclectic alumni include actor jimmy cagney class of 18 
nobel prize winners joshua lederberg and roald hoffman 41 and 
55 mad magazine editor nick meglin 53 and attorney and 
former chief of the watergate task force richard benveniste 60 
air force col ronald grabe class of 62 spread stuyvesants 
fame farther than anyone else he took a 1932 stuyvesant pennant 
with him when the atlantis space shuttle circled the globe in 1989 
founded in 1904 as a manual training school for boys the school 
originally catered to the sons of mostly jewish italian and irish 
immigrants girls were first admitted in 1969 
baumel says the school remains a haven for immigrant strivers 
today nearly half of the student body is of asian descent 
students evenly split between the sexes must take an entrance 
exam to qualify for admission as they do at the citys two other 
science and math schools bronx high school of science and brooklyn 
tech

some 13000 students take the exam yearly stuyvesant accepts 
800 because its smaller and accepts less students stuyvesants 
cutoff is 50 points higher than at bronx science and 150 above 
brooklyn techs 
the schools reputation may attract them but baumel credits the 
kids with maintaining their own high standards 
he illustrates the point with a story about 1988 westinghouse 
winner and stuyvesant graduate chetan nayak who taught himself the 
complex math theory of tensor analysis and was doing graduatelevel 
math at 13 
baumel says that when nayak was a sophomore he read a paper by 
noted princeton physics professor john wheeler on unified field 
theory in physics called him on the phone and started firing 
questions at him 
youve got to understand baumel says his voice rising in 
excitement einstein is here he says pointing to an invisible 
top line and john wheeler is here hes just one step below 
youre talking about one of the top physicists in the world and he 
just called him up to chat 
wheeler became nayaks mentor and guided him in the research 
work that won nayak now at harvard westinghouses top 20000 
prize 
but braininess is not all there is to stuyvesant the student 
body is also known for inventiveness spunk and charitable works 
when one student wanted to start a lacrosse team he went out 
himself and raised 7000 for the necessary equipment 
two other students convinced each of the schools 75 homerooms 
to sponsor a foreign foster child their efforts have made 
stuyvesant the worlds largest foster parent in size and heart 
others have collected shoes for the homeless made thanksgiving 
dinner for local elderly tutored poor children in drugplagued 
projects and served as translators for new immigrants 
balancing many hats has never been a problem for senior sirish 
maddali 
the popular misconception is that stuyvesant students go home 
and read the dictionary or something like that says the 
16yearold sirish i play the guitar in the band manage the 
school baseball team i do lots of regular things i just happen 
to like science too 
sirish a squarely built athletic youth who hopes to become a 
cardiovascular surgeon is one of those kids who was attracted to 
stuyvesant because of its reputation the only difference was he 
was living a continent away in nigeria at the time 
his family moved to new york in 1986 he enrolled at stuyvesant 
in 1987 and jumped into the schools westinghouse science program 
beginning research in the field of enzyme kinetics 
for two years sirish attended 10 classes a day and then headed 
straight to a professional lab where he would work at least another 
five hours many experiments required overnight stays he kept a 
toothbrush handy 
weekends and summer vacation were also spent at the lab where he 
became such a frequent visitor he was given his own access key a 
privilege not granted to many phd candidates 
his work the euphoniously named a better statistical 
analysis by nonlinear parameter estimation of the acid phosphatase 
activity of the genetically engineered microbe w3110 r702 in soil 
amended with montmorillonite or kaolinite clay earned him a 
semifinalist spot in the westinghouse contest bigger prizes await 
of course 
in fact stuyvesant high students dominate the westinghouse 
contest with its awards that range from 7500 to 20000 
of this years westinghouse honorees 39 students came from 
stuyvesant the most in the nation five of the 40 finalists came 
from stuyvesant as well in 1988 stuyvesant kids placed first and 
second and took a record 47 spots in the 300member honors list 
principal baumel brags that was more than california florida and 
texas combined 
in the 49year history of the westinghouse stuyvesant had first 
place seven times and 70 finalists in the top ten only bronx 
science where jonas salk went to school has a better overall 
record three firsts and 118 finalists 
roald hoffman the 1981 nobel prize winner in chemistry was a 
westinghouse honoree in 1955 
hoffman fondly recalls the daily walks from his fathers 
delancey street luncheonette to the cement schoolhouse with its 
carved and bolteddown wooden desks and prehistoric lab equipment 
the equipment remains something short of state of the art the 
building itself seems ancient with peeling paint and worn steel 
stairways all that will change when stuyvesant moves into its new 
10story 100 million school in battery park near the staten 
island ferry in 1991 
its hard for me to imagine a new stuyvesant hoffman said 
the old one was such a remarkable place

boating is getting safer in part because of the war against 
drinking while boating but many many more lives would be saved if 
people wore life vests while on the water 
when youre in the water its too late to look under the seat 
and find a life vest 
figures from the national marine manufacturers association show 
that while the number of boats increased from 96 million in 1973 
when a record high of 1754 fatalities was recorded to 173 
million in 1988 only 946 people died in boating accidents in 1988 
thats a fatality rate of 55 deaths per 100000 boats in 1988 
public opinion is turning against drinking and driving says 
capt bill griswold chief of the coast guard auxiliarys boating 
and consumer affairs division we will continue to educate the 
public about the dangers of boating and drinking 
he said 50 percent of all boating fatalities are alcohol related 
more and more states are recognizing the problem and passing 
boating while intoxicated laws 
whether or not a person is intoxicated four out of every five 
boating deaths is by drowning 
federal law now requires that every boat carry one personal 
flotation device per passenger 
many fishing tournaments such as those run by the bass anglers 
sportsman society require that not only must each contestant wear 
a pfd while the boat is running on its outboard motor but that the 
drivers jacket be hooked to an ignition kill switch 
a kill switch shuts off the engine if the driver is thrown 
overboard that means the boat is still in the area if the victim 
can swim back to it 
despite those examples most people simply do not believe 
anything will happen to them and do not wear their pfds 
according to nmma 
but all it takes is a bump on the head or the shock of hitting 
cold water to render a person helpless for a few minutes and by 
that time the victim may be a fatality statistic 
makers of pfds have realized that making a better looking more 
comfortable pfd is a key to getting people to wear them 
in addition to making a wide variety of pfds for specific 
purposes such as water skiing or kayaking they come in varieties 
of colors and patterns and are lighter and more comfortable 
pfds for fishermen are being made with numerous pockets for 
lures or other tackle 
the coast guard has adopted five categories of pfds heres a 
rundown to help you decide which you want in your boat 
offshore life jacket best for open rough or remote waters 
where someone overboard may be in the water a while it will turn 
an unconscious person face up in the water its drawback is it can 
be a bulky unit 
nearshore life vest best suited for boating in calm inland 
waters where a victim will be picked up quickly its more 
comfortable but will not necessarily turn over a person face down 
in the water 
flotation aid a lighter and more comfortable vest for use 
where there will be help on the scene fast its the most popular 
type of life vest but it will not necessarily turn over a 
facedown victim 
throwable device this is not recommended for children and 
nonswimmers it can be a cushion ring buoy or any device that 
will keep afloat someone who can hang onto it 
special use device these are legal for only special uses 
they are inflatables or combinations of permanent and inflatable 
flotation when inflated they provide the same buoyancy as an 
offshore jacket but are less reliable because they have to be 
inflated and can be punctured rendering them useless

thirty years ago bob kutz had a dream 
he wanted to create a museum to show off the achievements of 
sport fishermen and to keep records of those achievements 
today the national freshwater fishing hall of fames record 
book the 1990 edition published in april contains thousands of 
records for 125 species of freshwater fish 
its awards program makes it possible for the average angler to 
hold a certified world record 
the program includes world records in five categories rodreel 
ice fishing polelineno reel fly fishing and miscellaneous 
methods and state records for the united states 
its taken a lot of work by mostly a lot of volunteers over 
the years says ted dzialo who has taken over as director kutz 
remains active as public affairs director his wife fannie kutz 
continues as business manager 
the hall is centered in a 7acre complex of museum buildings and 
fishing offices in hayward wis 
its symbol is a 4story tall cityblock long walkthrough 
fiberglass muskellunge its open jaw is an observation platform 
that can hold 30 people 
the museum attracts more than 100000 visitors per year 
its displays range from a 150yearold chippewa indian birchbark 
canoe to 300 classic and antique outboard motors in addition to 
prize mounts of freshwater fish there are thousands of lures 
rods reels and accessories on display in the museum 
pools at the museum are used for childrens fishing contests 
we wanted something which would be pleasant to visit and yet 
have all the information to tell the story of sport fishing 
dzialo says 
its records program is probably its best known and there still 
are a lot of open places there he says 
the rodreel division is broken down into line classes by the 
teststrength of line the bigger the fish the more line classes 
for the species fly fishing also is broken down into line classes 
there are no line classes for what in essence is cane pole fishing 
in the ice fishing category there are records for poleline and 
tipup fishing 
proper records and photographs are essential for having a 
potential record certified dzialo says 
here are some tips for wouldbe record holders 
first if you have a big fish on land it yourself dont let 
someone else touch the line you may have someone net or gaff the 
fish 
get the fish to a certified scale as soon as possible these 
scales used for trade have a seal showing the last time it was 
inspected 
weigh the fish in front of two witnesses not your fishing 
companions and get their names addresses and signatures measure 
the girth fork length and total length of the fish 
make pictures color pictures are best hold the fish broadside 
for positive identification one trick is to lay it next to a 
yardstick if its a picture of you holding the fish get the 
camera in close so the fish is easily seen they want to see the 
fish not your feet 
have a fisheries biologist identify the fish and give you a 
short written signed report 
freeze the fish it wont hurt it when it comes time to mount 
your trophy 
save the first 25 feet of line from the hook or lure to be 
sent with your application for fly fishing save about 15 inches 
of the tippet leaving the fly or hook attached this is so the 
line can be tested to see if it is in the line class where you 
claim your record 
to get a world record application write or call the national 
fresh water fishing hall of fame box 33 hall of fame drive

a fisherman can spend a good deal of time 
pondering the impressive display of baits at a major sporting goods 
store trying to decide what to buy to fill the tackle box 
at todays prices you can spend the proceeds of a winning state 
lottery ticket buying fishing lures the best advice is to buy a 
couple of several varieties try them and then buy more colors and 
types of what works for you 
this is a rundown of some basic types of lures to use as a 
guide you may want to try some or all of them 
the most common bait is the plastic worm it also is about the 
cheapest its most commonly used for bass but is effective for 
other species such as walleye pick out several colors get a 
couple packs of darkcolored ones such as black purple or motor 
oil a couple with two colors and couple with sparkles 
the most effective color usually is determined by the color and 
clarity of the water youre fishing so variety allows 
experimentation 
crankbait is a generic type word used to cover a variety of 
lures there are several varieties most use a plastic lip to make 
them wobble and throb in the water 
the one that doesnt is a stickbait it floats and you must 
impart action to it by wiggling jerking or twitching your rod tip 
then come surface baits or shallow divers they have small lips 
which either impart wobble or pull them slightly below the surface 
for diving crankbaits the size of the plastic lip usually 
determines the depth at which the lure will run the bigger the 
lip the deeper the dive the deepdivers are designed to be worked 
along the bottom digging into the mud and bouncing off branches 
most of these baits will float so start the retrieve with very 
fast turns on the reel to get them to working depth then slow them 
down when they strike an underwater obstacle lower your rod tip 
to give them slack and usually they will float free 
another variety of crankbaits are the lipless plastic ones 
which use the top of the lure to impart diving action these dive 
to a variety of depths and often include rattles to add noise to 
the vibrations designed to attract fish 
one last variety of crankbaits are the poppers and chuggers 
they have concave faces or very wide lips and are designed to 
bubble and gurgle when retrieved usually in short jerks 
they stay on top of the water and are best fished at dusk dark 
and dawn imitating frogs 
spinnerbaits are about the most versatile lures around they can 
be fished on top or on the bottom at almost any depth they come 
in a wide variety of colors and blade combinations they can be 
pitched right up against the bank and retrieved surviving in 
places most other lures would hang up 
generally the larger the blade the slower a spinnerbait can be 
worked through the water and still stay on top their cousins the 
buzzbaits are designed almost entirely for topwater use and are 
best fished in lowlight conditions 
spoons and jigs are a unique class of lures in that most can be 
fished straight up and down some spoons can be retrieved 
horizontally but most are designed to be fished up and down with a 
flick of the wrist imitating a dying baitfish falling from above 
some jigs hooks with a lead head and maybe a bit of skirt 
attached also have a flashing spinner and are designed to be 
fished naked others are designed to be hooked through a second 
bait 
these lures are especially effective in colder water 
spinners are a combination of a hook or hooks a spinner 
possibly a bit of deer hair or rubber and a blade to flash they 
come in all sizes from tiny ones to take trout and bluegills to 
sizes that look like dangerous weapons designed for muskellunge 
one more thing be sure put get some plain ordinary hooks 
several sizes from 20 for large bass walleye or pike to about a 
no 8 for small panfish 
with hooks in your tacklebox you can always buy a few minnows 
crickets or worms and be reasonably sure you will at least catch a 
mess of bluegills for an excellent dinner

for bass bugs hair is now 
the noble art of bugging for bass with a fly rod has been 
dominated by bugs of cork balsa and plastics since the 19th 
century 
today bugs of hair and feathers are making inroads on the 
hardbody fish foolers they come closer to looking alive than the 
standards of the past 
since they are soft the fish take a millisecond or so more to 
catch on to the fact they are eating something that just aint for 
real 
of course there are the tried and true flyrod teasers like the 
redoubtable harry mary and the upscale minnow imitations like 
the mudlerminnow but the hair bugs of today will go well past 
those 
in addition to hair poppers that are in the same body style as 
the bugs of yore that pop and gurgle as they are jerked slid or 
pulled across the surface you can now dig a bit deeper in the 
water with a diver which on retrieve plunks and submarines an inch 
or so below the surface and zooms up like a wounded baitfish 
some have even fashioned frogs that have legs and wiggle like 
they are alive 
hair is at least for threethumbed tiers like myself easier to 
shape than balsa or cork 
colors run the full spectrum one of the top sellers is the deer 
hair version of the always popular bumblebee bug 
a bass rig flyrod will be from 8 feet to 9 feet any more length 
puts in the class with ma bell timbers the line should be in the 
8to10weight class some folks say they can use their midsize 
trout gear but they must lift weights 
casting technique has to be modified a bit to throw the larger 
bugs 
the leader generally seven feet will work needs to be very 
stiff at the butt and again rather stiff at the tippet using the 
onefoot orvis braided leader link taper it down from 30 lbs to 
20 lbs then a tippet of 10 lbs or 15 lbs depending on the cover 
you are fishing 
fish caught on bugs as with flies are usually lip hooked so it 
is easy to unhook and release them without damaging them 
though a beam will get very ambitions every now and then the 
large size of the real bass bugs size 1 to 2 in most cases will 
keep most of the panfish intimidated and off your hook 
the sound of a bass clobbering your bug is much like that of an 
icebox hitting the water after a twostory fall it can be 
unnerving in the daylight and absolutely terrifying at night 
if the bass is a jumper the hair bug will be harder to throw 
than the hardbody type because it is lighter the lightness of the 
hair bug also helps in casting 
bass dont make long runs like trout and saltwater fish but 
they bulldog down and then jump and tailwalk about giving the 
angler as much sport as you can get doing anything you let other 
people watch you doing 
try it

when her husband suggested the family could use more cash 
janice henke got herself a job trapping skunks 
when i come in from an unsuccessful skunk expedition my 
husband wont let me come in the house unless i take off every 
stitch including my sneakers and hang them in the tree says 
mrs henke who lives far enough outside of glens falls ny that 
there are no neighbors nearby 
then its into a shower and i leave my clothes outside for a 
week or so 
most of the skunks live through the ordeal and only about one in 
20 takes a shot at her with its personal perfume she says 
as both a licensed wildlife rehabilitator and licensed nuisance 
wildlife agent she must first decide which situation applies when 
a potential customer calls 
you have to decide whos distressed is it the people or the 
creature she says generally its the people 
the animal is in distress if it cant get away 
if the animal could leave if it wanted to but doesnt care to 
just now its the people who are in distress 
if its the people who are distressed the cost is 25 per skunk 
normally its a simple matter of setting a box trap outside the 
hole the skunk is using to get under a building or through a fence 
but there are exceptions 
the lady called me in a panic because she said theres a 
skunk in my washing machine mrs henke says id never had 
that before 
the skunk apparently fell into the machine after climbing 
through a basement window broken by the womans children 
skunks are a major problem in upstate new york where they are 
attracted to mans warm dwellings and groomed lawns said mrs 
henke in an interview during this years north american wildlife 
and natural resources conference in denver she is a lobbyist for 
the national trappers association and executive vice president of 
furbearers unlimited 
as winter approaches skunks begin to den up and sometimes a 
dozen or more will hole up under a house or mobile home 
disputes among skunks are settled in a manner that leaves a very 
unpleasant aroma for the homeowner above 
mrs henke uses a wire box trap which is pretty good sized 
so when the animal considers entering it it wont touch his sides 
or back i used a twix bar for bait caramel flavor 
next morning if the homeowner finds an occupied trap ill 
come with my skunk blanket 
its an old yellow blanket with a hole in it so she can 
watch the animal while she moves up on it holding the blanket up 
so it cant see a human 
some skunks react aggressively to the approaching blanket 
stamping their front paws 
she waits then lowers the blanket over the cage figuring if 
hes going to spray hes going to do it now or never 
then she wraps the cage in the blanket places the package in 
the back of the pickup truck and takes it to a spot on state land 
where hopefully there arent any houses around 
then i uncover the end of the cage remove the door and if he 
doesnt come out by himself i pick the cage up and give him a 
heaveho and he rolls over and gets up and trundles off through 
the woods 
while buildings with such things as warm water pipes are a 
source of comfort lawns are a source of food lawns are full of 
grubs primarily the larvae of june bugs and japanese beetles she 
says 
they hunt those by smell and they dig and it looks like a lawn 
has been ravaged by a pick of hogs if the skunk has been really 
industrious she says 
then its time for the wire trap and old yellow blanket

the director of the us fish and wildlife service sees the 
challenge of the 90s as a balancing act between traditional 
supporters and new constituencies with heavy burdens on the 
scales 
were not primarily a recreation agency but i do see us 
needing to broaden our mission to provide visitor recreation on 
the nations 450 national wildlife refuges john turner says 
but we do need to continue to support the resources and the 
users that are the backbone of the agency with their dollars and 
their years of effort and thats the hunters and fishermen he 
says 
obviously the interests of this society are expanding to 
nonconsumptive uses and more total use of wildlife and we need to 
expand our programs to meet those growing needs 
turner a wyoming legislator since 1970 and operator of a 
guideoutfitter service was confirmed by the senate july 31 
he is in charge of managing the countrys 93 million acres of 
wildlife refuges at a time when the complexity of the issues 
facing wildlife at times seems overwhelming but also at a time 
when the polls show the people have never had a greater interest 
in wildlife 
this is a time of great opportunity to do things for diverse 
life forms for habitat which i think is part of americas roots 
our main focus has got to be the wild critters and the 
habitats that are entrusted to us and that gives us a full 
platter turner says 
during an interview at the north american wildlife and natural 
resources conference turner talked about his vision for the refuge 
system 
he says he wants to expand americans interest in the total 
value of wildlife 
im really concerned about the future of the consumptive 
users hunters and anglers he says we need to teach kids how 
to fish and were failing in the mission we need to try to bring 
kids especially minorities into the out of doors 
we need to relate to blacks and kids out of the urban areas 
were used to relating to a white population he says 
he is worried about the antihunting movement 
i welcome their concern for wildlife but their energies 
theyre so misdirected and selfdestructive we ought to all be 
working for the welfare of wildlife and habitat 
we ought to be joining forces and save for later the question 
of what to do with the surpluses and how to manage nongame 
populations the antihunting movement is just terrible 
destructive perhaps the most destructive part of the conservation 
movement today he says 
turner also said he wants to see business and the private 
landowner in the conservation movement 
their good will is going to be essential to the enhancement of 
the resource and we havent always done a good job of earning it 
he said i see new opportunities to join hands with these private 
landowners that is going to be the key to whether or not we 
succeed

the loon is a quick change artist switching from 
its drab smokygray color of winter for much more formal dress 
complete with necklace and sequins for summer in the north 
its haunting penetrating call brings a vision of north 
americas wilderness to those lucky enough to hear it 
the loon is associated with beautiful pristine settings 
natural lakes that arent denigrated by pollution says carroll 
l henderson nongame wildlife supervisor with the department of 
natural resources in minnesota which is home to the largest loon 
population in the 48 states 
about 12000 loons nest in minnesota 
the loon needs the clear clean waters of remote lakes because 
they depend on eyesight to catch fish under water henderson 
says introduction of carp into clear waters has hurt the bird 
because the fishs grubbing along the bottom makes the water turbid 
its eyes are red because of a special filter to provide better 
underwater vision 
a tough aggressive bird when it comes to protecting its nest 
from wolves or other predators the loon has enough size to deter 
many animals seeking a meal 
the common loon the only one of four north american species 
that nests in the united states weighs 8 to 12 pounds three times 
the weight of a mallard duck 
its body is three feet long and it has a wingspan of five feet 
but theyre set so low in the water people dont realize 
theyre that big henderson says 
the reason they sit so low in the water is their bone structure 
which helps make them superb swimmers and fish catchers but also 
makes takeoffs difficult if not downright hazardous 
loons bones are more dense than those of most other birds 
which makes them heavier because of the weight they can dive to 
depths of 200 feet and remain submerged several minutes 
the same powerful legs which make them such good swimmers are a 
handicap on land the legs are set far back on the body behind the 
balance point so a loon has difficulty walking 
because of its weight a loon needs at least 75 feet and often 
as much as two football fields depending on weather and wind 
direction for a running flapping splashing takeoff 
once airborne it can reach speeds of 75 mph 
its landing style also is different most water birds land with 
their bodies at an up angle their webbed feet outstretched to hit 
the water like skis a loon hits low and hard pounding into the 
water on its breast

a dull knife is dangerous 
when your knife isnt sharp you pull tug try to force it 
and sooner or later its going to slip says peter kuhn a knife 
expert with lansky sharpeners of buffalo ny 
thats when you get hurt 
for years man got sharp edges by chipping flakes of a flint or 
other crystallized stone which often produces edges of razor 
sharpness 
more recently metal blades have been sharpened by drawing a 
stone across the blade or drawing the blade across a stone 
the critical things for sharpening a knife is the angle at which 
the knife and stone meet and that that exact angle be maintained 
through the sharpening process 
changing the angle even a few degrees will lead to rolling the 
edge and reducing sharpness 
there are many types of sharpening stones like sandpaper they 
range from coarse for removing a lot of metal in a hurry to 
ultrafine for putting the finishing polish on an edge 
all should be held at the same angle to the edge 
the lansky system solves the problem of exact angle as do other 
systems by holding the blade in a jig or vice 
the sharpening stones which come in several degrees of 
fineness attach to a guide rod which feeds through a hole in the 
jig the rod keeps the stone at the same angle to the blade stroke 
after stroke 
the jig provides angles of 30 25 20 or 17 degrees but you 
really dont need the 17 degrees for a knife thats like a 
razor kuhn says 
he says a 25 degree angle on a blade is about the best for a 
quality knife that needs a good working edge 
it takes a little time to work a very dull blade to brilliant 
sharpness and obviously longer blades take more time than short 
ones a jig may have to be moved on the blade of a long hip knife 
its best to use a jig mounted on a workbench or table top to 
begin work on a dull blade that way you have both hands free to 
work the sharpening stone 
but once you get a sharp edge on your knife unless you abuse 
it it will take only a few strokes occasionally on a pair of 
sharpening roads or a folding vsharpener to get the edge back in 
mint condition

the ailment is lyme disease so named because it was identified 
in 1975 near old lyme conn 
the real culprit was the tickborne infection 
there is no vaccination or cure so the keys to fighting the 
disease are insect repellents and poisons 
tests conducted by research entomologist carl schreck of the 
us department of agriculture found properly used repellents 
provided 80 percent to 90 percent protection against ticks 
the atlantabased national centers for disease control reported 
6000 cases of lyme disease in 1988 the last year for which 
figures were available double the number in 1987 it was reported 
in 43 states 
symptoms are similar to many other illness low grade fever 
fatigue head and body pain 
the tick bite itself usually is unnoticed but within a month of 
being bitten a red rash appears around the bite on about 
twothirds of those bitten sometimes it is solid but usually it 
has a brighter outer edge and little or no color in the middle 
although it can vary greatly in size up to coverage of a whole 
arm or thigh it usually is about 4 inches in diameter 
the rash is a signal to get to a doctor for help 
a blood test usually will confirm the disease by detecting the 
antibodies the bodys immune system is turning out to fight it it 
can take two months or more for those antibodies to show up so a 
test after the first couple of weeks usually produces a false 
reading 
there are two ways to get the disease by going into areas 
infected with diseasecarrying ticks or having pets go into those 
areas and bring the ticks to you 
use tick sprays dips powders and collars to help your pet 
avoid tick bites 
proper clothing and repellents can provide nearly complete 
protection when outdoors 
wear longsleeved shirts and long pants when outdoors where they 
may be ticks tuck pants into high socks to keep ticks from 
crawling into clothing 
keep your boots or shoes laced up 
wear a hat 
wear lightcolored clothing making it easier to spot a tick 
before it crawls through a buttonhole tightly woven fabrics are 
harder for ticks to climb 
collared shirts help keep ticks from climbing up onto your neck 
two types of products add to your armor first is an 
insecticide such as permethrin which is designed to be sprayed on 
clothing not your skin second is a repellent containing deet 
diethylmetatoluamide which can be sprayed on clothing or 
directly on exposed skin 
spray clothing thoroughly especially around places like laces 
in boots at the top of boots or where pants go into socks places 
where ticks may find entry between layers of clothing 
check your clothing and your body after an outing a tick is no 
larger than a goodsize pinhead and can be very difficult to spot 
if you find a tick attached to your skin dont try any of the 
old wives tales about removing ticks with a lighted cigaret or 
anything else that may cause the tick to regurgitate fluid into 
the bite 
use a finejawed tweezers to grab the tick as close to your skin 
as possible and slowly pull it straight out do not squeeze the 
ticks body that simply injects its fluids into the bite

the 1980s ended as a disaster for the west indian 
manatee 
a record 174 of the huge endangered mammals were found dead in 
the united states last year primarily because they were struck by 
boats and barges in florida waters according to the us fish and 
wildlife services regional office in atlanta 
so far 1990 is even worse for the sea cows 
a record 74 manatee deaths were reported in january alone most 
of that due to the christmas freeze that sent temperatures 
plunging in north florida 
the service has been studying manatee deaths since 1974 
the fws said there were 510 deaths in those 15 years for which a 
cause could be found of that number 418 were attributed to the 
animals being struck by boats or barges seventyeight died when 
they were crushed or drowned in floodgates of locks in canals and 
50 were killed by humans some were shot others caught in fishing 
nets or lines 
the population was estimated at 1000 animals in 1980 and 
aerial surveys of warmwater refuges in december found 1200 
individuals 
the manatee has been around for 60 million years evolving from 
fourfooted animals about the time the dinosaurs were on their last 
legs 
because of the deaths in 1989 the state of florida proposed 
stringent new measures to help protect them 
the measures include establishment of manatee protection plans 
in those florida counties that had the highest rates of 
boatmanatee collisions last year they also call for creation of 
new manatee protection zones where boats may travel only at 
reduced speeds to help prevent collisions and controlling 
expansion of new boating facilities in areas inhabited by manatees 
the state also is planning stepped up enforcement of all laws to 
protect the species 
the big slow moving animals simply cant get out of the way of 
fast boats the animals which can reach a length in excess of 10 
feet and a weight of more than 1000 pounds lounge in rivers and 
canals feeding on plants 
although they do move out into salt water they spend most of 
their lives in fresh water 
they winter in warm water areas such as springs and have found 
new habitat in the warmwater discharges of power plants as far 
north as south georgia 
crystal river national wildlife refuge on floridas gulf coast 
was established as a haven for manatees merritt island national 
wildlife refuge on the atlantic coast also has areas closed for 
manatee protection

think youve heard all the fish stories 
as this one is told the shad a most sensitive fish was 
terrified at storms and troubled waters and delighted in quiet and 
musical sounds so some wise old german fishermen hooked some wood 
to their nets and hung a number of small bells on them 
when the nets moved the bells chimed in harmony and the fish 
were lured to their destructions 
the story comes from terry mayer a designer of bell jewelry and 
a bell hobbyist shes designed a fish bell introduced by 
cartiers in 1980 as well as a whale bell in sterling silver and a 
fish whistlebell among others 
in researching styles for her fish bells she found references 
to bells ringing in markets in ancient greece to announce the 
arrival of a fresh catch and ancient indian ocean sailors ringing 
bells through the dark night to frighten away monster fish 
she notes the connection between fish and bells in many other 
nations 
in japan for instance the carp is the national emblem of 
boyhood the symbol for swimming courageously against the stream of 
life windbells with brass pendant carps were formerly used in 
celebrations of childrens day thoughout the far east and bronze 
carp bells are given to boys today as a revered toy 
in italy some fishermen hook a bell to the fishing pole to 
alert them to a bite and in india brass bells in teardrop shapes 
are called fishing bells

americans seem be spending more time outdoors lately including 
entertaining outdoors 
in a recent survey 73 percent said their families have become 
more interested in spending time outdoors at their home since 1986 
and half of the respondents said they are spending more time 
entertaining outdoors 
the survey was conducted by the better homes and gardens 
consumer panel 
as a result of the outdoors interest says john cashmore 
weyerhauser lifewood program manager americans are also looking 
more at new products for their outdoor environments 
he says outdoor millwork products for building decks and 
hightech lowvoltage lighting fixtures are among the products 
gaining new interest 
the new outdoor millwork products cashmore says offer 
consumers more variety than dimensional lumber decorative 
spindles and railings lattice panels turned finials and posts 
with notches and grooves for easier assembling 
technological advancements in lowvoltage outdoor lighting also 
have expanded the number of fixture styles available 
we know people are doing more outdoor dining lounging and 
entertaining says tom swain toro lighting marketing manager 
so it only makes sense that the dinner parties may continue after 
sunset the night is a much friendlier place if its tamed by 
lights 
the better homes and gardens consumer panel survey said 60 
percent found lightscaping their deck and yard with lowvoltage 
lighting of interest to them 
the survey also said 74 percent would build their outdoor 
project themselves

the ball is back in play at the court according to a survey 
sponsored by the american tennis industry federation 
more than 20 million americans over 12 years old played tennis 
in 1988 and a steady core of enthusiasts play regularly according 
to the survey conducted by audits and surveys a public opinion 
firm that projected the figures from a sample of 4000 households 
tennis participation boomed in the 1970s then declined 
says brad patterson the atifs executive director we believe 
the decline bottomed out in the mid1980s and that participation 
has been growing ever since 
thirtyeight percent of all players say they played more in 1988 
than in the year before while 27 percent say they played less 
fiftyseven percent said they would like to have played more and 39 
percent say they plan to play more this year compared to 13 
percent who plan to play less 
these positive attitudes are one indication that the sport is 
in good health says patterson 
the sampling indicates that most people who play tennis do so 
because they think its good exercise 61 percent competition was 
important to 32 percent followed by fun 22 percent and the 
social aspect 14 percent 
only 23 percent participated in organized match play and 30 
percent of the players say they keep score less than half the time

american quarter horses are status symbols overseas and exports 
in 1989 rose 223 percent over the previous year reports the 
american quarter horse association the first three months of l990 
show an additional 7 percent increase the association says 
they foreigners come to america to buy because we know how 
to breed although they have good breeding stock they dont 
utilize it because they dont know how says carol rose owner of 
the american quarter horse ranch in gainesville texas the 
american qaurter horse is more versatile compared to other breeds 
they are easier to ride and have a much calmer temper they are a 
pleasure horse 
the germans and japanese are among the best customers for the 
horses according to the association bob crosthwaite president of 
a seattle horseexporting company regularly sends quarter horses 
for use in el rancho grande japans first dude ranch which opened 
in 1975 its a fad over there he says they are into the 
western way of life people want to get on a horse who have never 
even seen a horse 
exporting is timeconsuming and expensive quarantines of about 
two weeks with tests and vaccinations are monitored by the u s 
department of agriculture says david harpman a veterinarian who 
specializes in exporting horses from houston for several texas 
breeders during that period a travel agent arranges the flight 
and shipping stall once the horse arrives in its destination 
country it is usually quarantined again with the owner responsible 
for the cost 
each country has different regulations for which the owner 
must be responsible harpman says this can be a costly fee for 
the buyer the shipping alone can cost as much as 3000

if you dine out under the sky during the 
summer take extra precautions to avoid food poisoning 
between 20 and 80 million people or up to a third of the 
population suffer from food poisoning each year says kay 
stanfill assistant professor of clinical dietetics at the 
university of oklahoma health services center she rates the 
hazards of bacterial contamination a far greater threat to food 
than pesticides 
picnickers should be wary of undercooked or raw meat poultry 
eggs or fish prime areas for the growth of salmonella she points 
out raw eggs that are cracked should never be used and meats such 
a poultry and fish should always be thoroughly cooked chicken on 
the rotisserie is done when you cut into it and there are no pink 
juices running from the drumstick which is the part that cooks the 
slowest stanfill says pork also should be well done and not 
have any pink juices running from it beef can be cooked rare 
but she advises eating it soon after 
food poisoning victims can suffer diarrhea fever and vomiting 
lasting two to seven days beginning any time from 12 to 36 hours 
after they eat contaminated food stanfill says it might be so 
mild that they wouldnt even know they had it but it can escalate 
up to being fatal 
she cites the united states department of agricultures seven 
commandments of food safety 
wash hands before handlng food 
keep it safe refrigerate 
dont thaw frozen food on the kitchen counter use the 
refrigerator 
wash hands utensils and surfaces again after contact with raw 
meat and poultry 
never leaver perishable food out longer than two hours 
thoroughly cook raw meat poultry and fish 
freeze or refrigerate leftovers promptly 
stanfill adds that you should be sure you are cooking food long 
enough in the microwave and not serving undercooked food that may 
look done but isnt

the texas parks and wildlife commission which 
oversees a park system used by 21 million people a year offers 
some suggestions to make your picnic more friendly to the 
environment 
use biodegradable paper plates not plastic even better 
take washable plates cups and silverware which you reuse 
pack sandwiches in biodegradable waxed paper or reusable 
containers you take with you 
if you bring soap make sure it is lowphosphate and 
biodegradable 
pack a paper sack for your trash and put it all in the garbage 
can 
take empty aluminum cans back home and sell them to a 
recycling center 
use cloth napkins and table covers instead of paper throwaways 
use cleaning cloths instead of paper towels 
be especially careful with sixpack rings that hold beer of 
soda cans together they can be a real disaster for birds and 
marine life they are practically invisible in the water and birds 
and fish get caught in them and die 
if you use them cut the rings before you throw them in the 
trash if you see any sixpack rings somebody has used to trash the 
environment pick them up and put them in a garbage can

you dont have to see an animal to know theres 
been one in the area 
there are five basic types of signs most animals leave behind 
and a sharpeyed observer can find them and learn from the clues 
they provide 
the first is tracks in sand or mud any animal will portray its 
presence 
the second is scats or droppings not only can they be 
identified by species and sometimes by male or female of the 
species but scientists analyze them to tell what foods the animals 
ar using 
planteating animals leave their marks whitetail deer which 
have no upper incisor teeth leave a ragged edge on the stems of 
plants they break off the head of a catfish lying on the bank 
often means an otter recently dined rotted logs that have been 
torn up often are the remains of a restaurant where skunks or foxes 
dug out grubs 
construction signs are among the most obvious beavers build 
dams most birds and squirrels build nests many animals excavate 
dens 
animals often leave bits of themselves behind that includes a 
birds feather a snakes skin or the antlers of deer elk or 
moose animals hairs caught on branches or around holes in trees 
tell of the animals using them 
an experienced sign reader can be your guide there are several 
good field guides available to help the beginner interpret what he 
sees during a walk in the woods

nursing home residents whose hearts have stopped 
are so rarely helped by cardiopulmonary resuscitation that perhaps 
homes should not even offer to try it researchers suggest 
failing that policy change residents who want to avoid 
resuscitation should get their doctors to record that wish in their 
medical records and should legally appoint somebody to speak for 
them said researcher dr thomas finucane 
cardiopulmonary resuscitation called cpr involves forceful 
thrusts to the chest and blowing air into the mouth 
that amounts to a meaningless assault when performed on 
nursing home residents who have only a tiny chance of benefit 
researchers said and it imposes costs such as the nursing time 
taken from other areas of patient care they said 
moreover the community of residents may be disrupted by this 
generally futile violent event often inflicted on a frail and 
failing neighbor 
finucane practices geriatric medicine at the francis scott key 
medical center in baltimore and is on the faculty of the johns 
hopkins school of medicine he and his colleagues discuss the issue 
in the march issue of the journal of the american geriatrics 
society 
they checked hospital and ambulance records for nursing home 
residents older than 65 who underwent cpr and then were taken to a 
hospital 
results showed that 102 of 117 were pronounced dead in the 
emergency room and 13 others died later in the hospital only two 
survived hospitalization one of whom died two weeks after release 
and the other eight months after 
we conclude that the benefits of cardiopulmonary resuscitation 
initiated in nursing homes are extremely limited the researchers 
wrote 
even if a patient is resuscitated he is likely to be in pain 
from broken ribs and may suffer brain injury from the period his 
brain lacked oxygen finucane said in a telephone interview 
currently nursing homes generally require that cpr be attempted 
on all residents unless a specific order to the contrary is 
written researchers said 
in principle finucane said a donotresuscitate order can be 
written after the doctor discusses cpr with his patient if the 
resident can participate and the family 
what actually happens is in many many cases no one ever 
talks to the family about it and when you do talk to the family 
about it many times the family is extremely conflicted finucane 
said 
the family feels terrible because theyre putting their 
relative in a nursing home and now the doctor is essentially 
asking about letting the relative die they feel this intensifies 
the abandonment in some way so one common thing is that families 
make very unrealistic requests to resuscitate patients 
as for a request for cpr by the nursing home resident himself 
finucane compared it to a patient asking for repeated futile cancer 
surgeries or for all the blood in a blood bank even if the blood 
type does not match 
a better approach might be not to do cpr unless the patient or 
family signs a form asking for it he said yet some family 
members may do so unrealistically and then there will be 
unprotected older people who will undergo meaningless violence 
he said 
so he said he reluctantly favors simply not offering cpr 
even though that removes the option of informed consent to the 
procedure and the chance of reviving the few people who would 
benefit 
its a tradeoff he said it is a flawed proposal but i 
believe it is the best on the menu right now 
ethicist bart collopy of the third age gerontology center at 
fordham university in new york said the new work raises a 
crucial question just from a medical viewpoint the notion of 
routinely pursuing futile treatment is quite dubious 
collopy said he would prefer that cpr be included as part of a 
discussion of an overall care plan with the resident and family 
failing that he suggested that decisions on cpr be made 
individually denying cpr to older people as a group might 
encourage similar blanket denials of other treatments he said 
the key question he said is whether cpr would give nursing home 
residents a benefit by their definition not our definition

the loudest round of applause came when 
an advocate complained that buses for homebound seniors arrived 
hours early or late and sometimes dropped people at doctors 
offices and supermarkets but never returned for them 
for people robbed of their mobility julie shaw told the states 
pepper commission on aging the bus was a lifeline but an 
unreliable one 
members of the state commission wanted to know who was 
responsible for the bus service and promised to follow up on the 
complaint one of the commissions duties is to act as a watchdog 
for seniors 
the fledgling commission which hired its staff at the first of 
the year is one of two bearing the name of the late us rep 
claude pepper mr senior citizen 
since his death last may 30 the two commissions the mildred 
and claude pepper foundation and his allies have guaranteed his 
legacy will spread beyond his work over a 43year political career 
a congressional report in march by the bipartisan commission on 
comprehensive health care commonly known as the pepper commission 
called for a 66 billionayear plan for mandatory health insurance 
for all americans and longterm medical care 
the pepper foundation created by the congressman three years 
before his death has received a 10 million grant from congress to 
fund philanthropic works 
beneficiaries include florida state university which will be 
the home of the elder statesmans official papers and a pepper 
institute on aging at the tallahassee campus 
im not sure if anybody can replace claude pepper said cal 
broughton a legislative representative with the american 
association for retired persons in washington they dont replace 
somebody like that there will be a number of people that will take 
up a number of issues and a number of causes 
people across the country knew that a complaint to pepper got 
action and the wily politician could be a gadfly or turn on his 
southern charm to get what he wanted 
his washington office became a central processing station for 
complaints by senior citizens about federal services and by the 
disadvantaged about just about anything 
in congress peppers legendary oratory played a pivotal role in 
the repeal of mandatory retirement and helped protect social 
security from cuts 
the general accounting office the investigative arm of 
congress is still producing reports requested by pepper said 
kathy gardner a former aide to pepper as a staff member on the 
house select committee on aging 
his legislation to create the national institute on deafness 
the 13th unit in the national institutes of health passed just 
before his death and regulations setting minimum training 
standards for nurses aides at nursing homes were published in 
march under a pepper bill 
although peppers name was widely associated with the illfated 
catastrophic health care bill he opposed its financing method in 
his final illness he had a wry smile over the stirrings of public 
dissent which would lead to repeal gardner said 
other politicians have absorbed pepper packages or platforms on 
comprehensive national health insurance nursing home care home 
health care and youth programs she said 
across the nation peppers name has been given to the national 
institutes of health administration building a center on aging at 
the university of michigan and an award from the mount sinai 
hospital geriatrics department in new york 
almost daily i hear of some new program building award et 
cetera that has been named after him said frances campbell a 
longtime legislative aide who chairs the pepper foundation 
in florida where pepper began his political career as a 
28yearold state legislator elderly issues are a priority in a 
state long viewed as the nations retirement mecca 
the state pepper commission set two priorities for the spring 
legislative session boost state aid for the poor living in group 
homes who dont require nursing home care and reinstate senior 
education programs cut three years ago 
nationwide roughly 12 percent of the population is over 65 
said edward annis a state commissioner and retired chief of 
surgery at miamis mercy hospital in florida were approaching 
19 percent among those are many affluent citizens who come down 
here and merely change their residence from other states but among 
those are great numbers of people who have a rough time getting 
along 
at a recent hearing in lauderhill commissioners were told of 
state legislation to require doctors to accept medicare patients 
the hidden rate of elderly suicides the need for adult daycare 
for alzheimers patients the danger of hypothermia and cuts in 
services to the blind elderly 
with the pepper name in the commission title as a daily reminder 
of his political passions commission executive director june noel 
said i think we have to remember what he stood for while we go 
about our business 
he will have a lasting legacy said john rother legislative 
director of aarp as long as people refer to him and appeal to 
his memory in attempting to build support thats an indication 
that theres a real legacy

elderly participants in a federal nutrition 
program for the needy wont be shoved out but others hoping to 
join may have to find food elsewhere a federal official says 
cost overruns and food shortages prompted the us department of 
agriculture in january to ask that states drop some elderly people 
from the program to make room for poor women infants and children 
but that drew some opposition particularly from sen dennis 
deconcini dariz whose office argued that the agency was 
creating competition between groups of poor people 
the federal bureaucracy caused a problem where these two 
groups were pitted against each other said tim gearan a 
deconcini aide who specializes in nutrition appropriations 
the 11yearold program called food plus operates in 18 states 
and the district of columbia the 278000 participants more than a 
third of them elderly are provided food from federal surplus 
commodities 
usda had said in a january directive that programs would have to 
be trimmed to september 1989 levels and that elderly participants 
might have to be replaced with needy infants children and women 
who were either pregnant or had small children 
were not bumping any people off the program right now but 
were not accepting any new ones said phil shanholtzer a 
spokesman for the us department of agriculture 
gearan and shanholtzer agreed that the problem lies at least in 
part with the way usda acquires food 
another problem shanholtzer said was that most states had 
exceeded their authorized case loads which hadnt been a real 
big deal as long as there was plenty of money 
however he added shortages of dairy products which must be 
included in the food packages forced the usda to buy nonfat dry 
milk and canned milk on the open market 
surpluses were not as readily available as in past years 
shanholtzer said adding that milk purchases sucked up quite a 
bit of money 
gearan said the usda shouldnt have anticipated a dairy surplus 
shanholtzer said the usda has enough money to continue the 
program for the remainder of the year but gearan said food plus 
generally needs to be better funded and better operated 
we really think we can do a better job he added these 
people are really destitute theyre selling their furniture they 
cant skimp on their utility bills but they will skimp on their 
food bills

ronald angel of the university of texas at austin studied 2498 
unmarried elderly people the study group consisted primarily of 
nonhispanic white female widows more than half of those studied 
were at least 80 years old and 40 percent had annual incomes less 
than 7000 
worobey and angel asked participants whether they preferred 
living alone moving into another persons home or having someone 
move into theirs or entering a nursing home 
although the formation of an extended household is an obvious 
mechanism by which people might pool their resources in order to 
increase their aggregate wellbeing this option is not readily 
adopted the researchers said the strains associated with 
living with family members appear to outweigh any advantage that 
may result from pooled resources 
the study did not provide exact figures as to the percentage of 
respondents in each group

ive got to find a better way of getting john 
to cut back on fat and cholesterol than shrinking the size of his 
hamburger he was furious 
my friend letitias lament is due to the fact that many of us 
are faced with changing a lifelong habit meat was not only eaten 
every day but often in two or three meals a day bacon at 
breakfast lunch meat or leftovers from the roast for sandwiches 
and the focal point of dinner and although many of us are willing 
to cut back not everyone wants to give up meat completely 
the fat is where the flavor is no doubt about that whether 
its the skin of chicken or turkey or the layer of fat around a 
chop or steak so if were going to give up that fat what have we 
got to replace it 
to the rescue come cooking techniques that have become very 
popular yearround grilling which can be done in a fireplace in 
winter rotisseries oven broiling quick sauteeing with these go 
marinades that impart wonderful exotic flavors to meat this is not 
a new way of cooking its embracing many cultures 
we have the great and favorite peasant dishes couscous 
cassoulet curry feijoada picadillo all these are served with or 
without meat so couscous can be made with lamb or chicken or 
vegetables so can curry and cassoulet 
lets look at chinese food the balance is often onethird meat 
to twothirds vegetables yet the food is beautiful and delicious 
we also dont have to give up our favorite foods im happy to 
fry chicken for a picnic but i find when i remove the skin and dip 
the chicken in a beaten egg and equal amounts of shredded parmesan 
cheese and breadcrumbs and bake it at high temperatures its 
crunchy or rub skinned turkey legs with a little oil and oregano 
and crushed red peppers bake at high heat and its crispy 
you can also skewer beef lamb chicken or fish shish 
kebabstyle with vegetables and broil only four to eight minutes 
for a delicious entree you marinate first with herbs and oil and 
sometimes wine or vermouth for a rich flavor 
and oldfashioned meat loaf why not bake one up cut into 
portions ziplock and freeze extra servings or buy a pound of 
ground meat season with mustard and egg and milk and fresh dill 
and roll into 24 meatballs four or five make a serving that is 
bountiful and fun to eat 
breaking the habit doesnt have to be so hard after all

in slang a rhubarb is a noisy 
argument but in the garden rhubarb behaves like a model citizen 
with scarcely any help from me this attractive vegetable thrives 
quietly in a corner its rosy stalks coming up year after year for 
my favorite pies 
how did such an easygoing plant lend its name to quarrels and 
fights well it seems theater people discovered that muttering 
rhubarb over and over creates the sound effect of anger in 
crowd scenes red barber a famed baseball broadcaster widely used 
the term for hassles on the diamond and a comic author of the 
1940s h allen smith wrote a novel rhubarb featuring a 
pugnacious cat with that name 
actually the taste of rhubarb has an extratartness that 
inspired poets long ago to use the word to convey emotional 
bitterness in pies and sauces you need plenty of sweetener to 
bring out the vegetables best qualities moreover the plant has a 
dangerously split personality only the stalks are edible the big 
green leaves are poisonous and must be trimmed off after harvest 
rhubarb and asparagus generally are the only perennials grown in 
the vegetable garden and usually occupy end spaces leaving middle 
areas for annuals like tomatoes corn and beans as a perennial 
rhubarb is ideal for an elderly gardener seeking lighter chores 
you plant it once after that it just about takes care of itself 
coldhardy rhubarb needs winter dormancy and is not usually 
grown in areas where winters are too mild you can raise rhubarb 
from seed but most people save a year by putting in roots 
obtainable from seed houses and nurseries or from a neighbor happy 
to give away root divisions ive found that one wellestablished 
plant cut back from three i planted 20 years ago easily takes 
care of pies for me and my wife nowadays with some stalks left 
over to give away 
prepare the soil well before planting mixing in rotted manure 
or compost for three plants youll need a bed about 3 feet wide 
by 10 feet long the plants eventually get large so space them 
about 3 feet apart you put in the roots known as corms 3 or 
4 inches deep leaving the tops about 2 inches below the surface 
dont touch firstyear growth the plant needs time to establish 
itself but start harvesting the second year to avoid rot dont 
cut the stalks with a knife but grasp them at the bottom and 
twist breaking them off beneath ground level 
i keep out weeds by mulching with leaves which also enrich the 
soil as they decompose if you dont have leaves salt hay 
obtainable from nurseries will do as well in all these years 
ive never had to use chemical fertilizer for the rhubarb nor have 
i had any problems with diseases or insects 
while it needs sun rhubarb will tolerate some shade one 
recommended practice ive followed is to remove flower stalks 
which tend to weaken production as soon as they appear the pale 
green pompon size flowers are easily recognizable 
in my garden 50 miles north of manhattan rhubarb comes up in 
march and its stalks are long enough for pulling by midmay my 
plant produces stalks a foot or more long reddish at the lower end 
and greener at the top five or six of these are plenty for a pie 
some varieties may produce much longer and larger stalks ive read 
of stalks weighing 2 pounds 11 ounces being exhibited at the 
massachusetts horticultural society a century ago 
rhubarb was known from antiquity as a medicinal plant the root 
being used as a laxative now as a vegetable its ranked high in 
fiber and contains vitamins a and c and some b vitamins and 
minerals native to southeastern russia it was reputedly first 
brought to america from england by benjamin franklin in 1770 and 
was being offered in seed catalogs by the early 19th century aside 
from its popularity in pies which gave it the name pie plant 
rhubarb has found its way onto gourmet menus in a sauce say for 
duck or fish 
botanically a vegetable rhubarb was classified as a fruit by 
the us customs service in 1947 import duty being lower on fruits 
than on vegetables the plants name just seems to inpspire 
imaginative use world war ii aviators for example called 
lowaltitude strafing runs rhubarbs because they could see the 
bigleaf plants in the gardens

older professionals who move on to second jobs 
that pay less money and offer fewer benefits may find more 
satisfaction than they did in previous positions a study shows 
a survey of 24 workers who joined a selfhelp group for 
unemployed professionals found that the 16 who found jobs within a 
year were more satisfied with supervisors nature of work and 
likelihood for advancement than they were in previous careers even 
though they were less satisfied with salaries 
results of the study were published in the april issue of the 
journal of counseling published by the american psychological 
association 
the author university of oregon psychologist brent 
mallinckrodt examined how professionals over 40 rated new jobs for 
pay benefits satisfaction with coworkers and supervisors the 
nature of the work and prospects for advancement 
it was believed that increased age would predict decreased job 
satisfaction and instead the reverse happened mallinckrodt said

older women can maintain continued interest 
in sex if they have a sexually active partner and are free of 
disease and mental illness researchers report 
although sexual activity in general declines with age the 
proportion of elderly women who retain sexual desire and are 
sexually active is remarkable drs arshang d mooradian and 
vicki greiff wrote in the may issue of archives of internal 
medicine 
anxiety and depression are more common in the elderly than in 
younger people and such mental disturbances can spur a loss of 
sexual desire the university of arizona researchers said 
they said older women with estrogen deficiency also experience 
changes related to sexual function such as reduced vaginal blood 
flow but the deficiency can be easily treated they added 
for women who are healthy sexual activity and interest in sex 
doesnt necessarily decline with age mooradian and greiff said

even with president bushs assurance that 
everything is on the table its hard to imagine a major 
deficitreduction agreement emerging from the politically jumpy 
group he and the democrats have assembled 
but thats why this years budget summit could be a surprise 
success 
in past times with an atmosphere more conducive to agreement 
budget compromises have proven tough 
president reagan convened an emergency summit in 1987 when the 
crisis on wall street scared republicans and democrats alike 
making conditions excellent for a big deal to put the nations 
fiscal policy on track toward a balanced budget 
the negotiators were a serious and mostly agreeable group 
reagan sent his chief of staff former sen howard baker to lead 
his representatives house majority leader thomas s foley 
dwash anchored the democratic group from congress 
but almost a month of closeddoor sessions yielded a plan that 
only kept things from getting worse today it looks like the 
federal deficit will run about as high this year as it did then 
and the atmosphere for agreement appears worse 
going into this years talks there is no clear crisis to spur 
action though the administration warns that next years deficit 
could run up to 100 billion over the 64 billion deficit limit 
no one will use the adjective congenial for this years 
negotiation group the fact that its an election year only makes 
matters worse 
baker foley and other key players in the 1987 talks are gone 
baker returned to the private sector while foley is now speaker of 
the house he like bush will watch the negotiations from a 
distance 
the presidents top man this time will be chief of staff john 
sununu a strongwilled conservative who already has flirted with 
sinking the whole effort 
at the same time the president was reassuring democrats he would 
go into the talks openminded sununu was saying the opposite was 
really true that bush would kill any tax increase the democrats 
proposed 
one top democratic aide said sununu was making bushs call for a 
summit look like an invitation to a beheading 
besides those attending because of committee or executive branch 
positions the other republicans in the talks specialize in 
attacking democrats on the tax issue house minority whip newt 
gingrich rga is outspoken on almost anything that could defeat 
democrats and sen phil gramm rtexas is about as antitax as 
anyone in the senate 
on the democratic side foley appointed majority leader richard 
gephardt dmo as chairman of the talks 
gephardt who sought his partys presidential nomination in 
1988 is one of bushs most persistent critics and the leading 
opponent of the presidents plan to cut capital gains tax rates 
bush has complained that gephardts attacks are too personal and 
bushs spokesman marlin fitzwater compared gephardt to 
televisions maxwell smart 
house majority whip william h gray iii dpa and sen wyche 
fowler dga also joining the democratic squad are seasoned 
political sharpshooters fowler once compared gingrich to an organ 
grinders monkey 
but there may be a silver lining in this storm cloud 
in 1987 negotiators on both sides seemed hampered by doubt 
they were always breaking up to check back with their principals 
reagan senate majority leader robert byrd or house speaker jim 
wright inevitably delicate discussions would screech to a halt 
when details of pending proposals were leaked 
this time checking back with the big guys will be a formality 
if this bunch can agree on something theyll know that the people 
outside can buy into it 
rep silvio conte rmass a veteran of previous budget talks 
and a participant in this years sessions says that in 1987 it 
took 10 or 12 days before the group got over its mutual suspicions 
and down to business he expects the same thing will happen this 
time 
when a deal is struck the best thing to do is seal it quickly 
he said perhaps armored cars could take the negotiators to the 
white house for a signing ceremony before people begin to pick away 
at it he joked 
once the agreement is in place he predicted youll hustle up 
a majority vote

in these days of growing environmental concern 
and overflowing landfills the comeback of a packing material 
called excelsior long thin strands of wood nearly forgotten in 
the age of plastic is only natural 
after the earth day celebration it was phenomenal the 
interest said jim lefevre assistant branch manager for american 
excelsior co of arlington texas our customers are telling us 
their customers are asking for environmentally safe packaging 
despite the pervasive spread in recent decades of plastic foam 
peanuts and plastic bubble pack companies like lefevres never 
stopped making excelsior for the last four decades it was used 
mainly to cover budding foliage and prevent erosion 
now it has received a facelift of sorts to make it more 
palatable to companies packaging everything from cosmetics to 
delicate dishes 
in red green blue orange purple and every shade between 
excelsior made one of the more colorful displays at last weeks 
eastern packaging exposition at new yorks javits convention center 
it wasnt the only packing product on view that sought to play 
on the burgeoning sensitivity to environmental concerns 
theres no question about it i think most major corporations 
are going to have a real thrust into using more environmentally 
safe materials said philip thorn a purchasing manager of 
johnson amp johnson orthopedics in braintree mass 
our selling point now is biodegradable and nontoxic even our 
glue is nontoxic kevin arnold told customers as he described 
cardboardlike packaging materials made by honeycomb corp of north 
haven conn 
new laws are forcing some companies to buy biodegradable 
packaging said robert sadlik supervisor of miles pharmaceutical 
besides he says peanuts are getting to be a problem you 
open a box and they blow all over the place somebodys got to come 
up with something to replace peanuts 
brian stewartson sales manager for ranpak corp of willoughby 
ohio claims his company already has the product padpack 
consists of thick paper that has been crumbled 
its back to the basics theres no pizzazz stewartson said 
padpack sales in the northeast for the first three months of 
this year were 300 percent above the same period last year 
theres definitely something going on he said 
one product on display was lock n pop a key tech corp 
item that salespeople said could be used instead of plastic wrap to 
seal boxes and attach them to one another 
lock n pop is a clear nontoxic and often invisible

fred biesecker president and chairman of the board of drug 
plastics and glass co inc of boyertown pa conceded that his 
own companys invention a plastic container that uses onethird 
recycled plastic is not the least expensive way to make a bottle 
but he says a better life is not a cheaper life 
he said he had not thought about recycling plastic before 
attending a waste seminar in new york two years ago he smiled as 
he noted today im introducing a bottle thats got garbage in

rigs rose for the second straight week increasing by 11 to total 
941 baker hughes inc reported 
the rig count the previous week climbed a modest three after 
posting declines for several weeks a year ago the rig count was 
771 baker hughes said monday 
baker hughes rig count is the widely watched industry index of 
drilling activity it reflects the number of rotary rigs actively 
exploring for oil and gas as of last friday not the number of 
producing wells 
houstonbased hughes tool co an oil toolmaker company that 
merged with baker international corp of orange calif has kept 
track of the rig count since 1940 
in december 1981 at the height of the oil boom the rig count 
reached a peak of 4500 but oil prices plunged to less than 10 
per 42gallon barrel in the summer of 1986 prompting a collapse in 
the rig count that bottomed out at 663 the lowest since hughes 
began compiling figures 
among major oilproducing states wyoming posted the largest 
gain with five followed by new mexico four and texas three 
michigan ohio and pennsylvania each increased by two while 
colorado added one 
louisiana had the largest decline with five followed by 
oklahoma four kansas three and california one north dakota

nv philips announced today the 
resignation of its president in a crisis of confidence after 
the multinational electronics company barely broke even in the 
first quarter 
cor van der klugt 65 will retire on july 1 and be succeeded by 
his deputy jan timmer former philips president wisse dekker said 
at a news conference today 
dekkers announcement followed days of speculation over van der 
klugts future set off by philips may 3 announcement that it had 
earned a mere 6 million guilders or 31 million in manufacturing 
profits during the first three months of this year 
dekker said the results had caused a crisis of confidence in 
the financial world because van der klugt had claimed the company 
was performing far better 
the problem is that expectations were raised and that 
there is such a huge difference between the expectations and the 
real results dekker said 
that is about the worst thing that can happen to a company 
he added 
after the may 3 announcement philips stock plummeted 167 
percent from 3770 guilders or 1984 a share to 3140 guilders 
or 1652 last friday 
but philips stock rose 2 guilders or 105 today as investors 
were encouraged by the announcement 
van der klugts replacement followed a highly unusual 
intervention by dekker philips president from 198286 and the 
current chairman of its board of supervisors 
the supervisory board maintains an oversight function at 
philips although it is not involved in daytoday management 
operations 
dekker said the disappointing figures were primarily the result 
of poor performance by the companys integrated circuits and 
information systems division 
it was a great leak from which money simply flowed said 
dekker who refused to disclose specific figures 
gert lorentz the divisions chief is also resigning dekker 
said 
philips firstquarter results contrasted with a 222 million 
guilder or 116 million profit in the same period last year 
the firstquarter figure for this year did not include a 
onetime gain of 330 million guilders or 173 million from a 
selloff of philips defense activities including the hollandse 
signaal radar company 
the episode has even prompted public comment from 85yearold 
frits philips the last member of the philips dynasty to have led 
the firm he criticized van der klugt for not providing earlier 
warning of the poor earnings levels according to dutch press 
reports 
dekker claimed it was unclear why the poor results were not 
disclosed earlier 
van der klugt has no proper explanation and its a mystery 
to me too dekker said 
ata kahrel an analyst with the amsterdambased brokerage h 
wesselius and co said the flow of information to philips 
management appeared to have failed but said the reason why 
remained unclear 
philips computer division is probably just facing a malaise 
with just the slightest drop in demand theyre stuck with these 
huge stocks kahrel said 
philips itself has blamed its poor performance on currency 
exchange problems and ballooning interest rates of recent months 
the dramatic drop in philips stock price has spawned 
speculation the firm might become a target for a hostile takeover 
bid by one of its japanese competitors 
based in this southern dutch city nv philips gloeilampen 
fabrieken has grown from a light bulb factory to one of the worlds 
largest producers of electric appliances and electronic equipment 
its us subsidiary is north american philips 
van der klugt described by the authoritative dutch newspaper de 
volkskrant as a remote ivorytower figure took over from dekker 
in april 1986 he had been vice president since 1982 
timmer who heads philips consumer electronics division has 
brought the division into the black through costcutting measures 
involving widespread staff reductions earning him the dutch 
business page nickname of hurricane gilbert

shares on londons stock exchange made their 
largest daily gain since july to finish monday well above the 
psychologically important 2200level despite sluggish afternoon 
trading 
the financialtimes stock exchange 100share index closed at 
22145 up 386 points or 178 percent from friday the intraday 
low of 2202 was reached just after the market opened 
the financial times 30share index rose 247 points to close at 
17335 
volume was a relatively thin 3751 million shares compared with 
the moderate 5101 million shares that changed hands friday 
the financial times 500 index finished up 1756 at 119393 
dealers said strength on wall street added fuel to an early 
rally that was sustained throughout the session and exaggerated by 
a shortage of stock 
meanwhile the market largely ignored some gloomy economic news 
released around midday that showed gains in april in british retail 
sales and producer prices pointing to continued high inflation 
the government reported a 1 percent rise in april retail sales 
from march surpassing market expectations of a 03 percent monthly 
rise and a 24 percent annual increase in sales 
the april provisional producer price index showed output prices 
rising 1 some houses have 
had for sale signs for a year meaning their sellers are eager 
for action and possibly willing to help with financing 
add at least one more reason opportunity exists in a time 
frame youth comes once in a lifetime and real estate bargains 
appear only a few times more often few segments of the marketplace 
are more cyclical 
there is little question that younger homebuyers have had 
difficulties in recent years 
while the ownership rate fell generally in the 1980s from more 
than 65 percent at the beginning to less than 64 percent near the 
end the decline was a consequence solely of bad times in the 
younger age groups 
in the age group 25 through 29 years for example the 1979 
ownership rate was 44 percent but just over 35 percent in 
mid1989 in that time the rate for ages 3034 fell from 62 percent 
to less than 54 percent 
meanwhile in every fiveyear age grouping from 60 years or more 
the ownership rate rose since 1980 the rate for ages 6064 has 
been more than 80 percent 
real estate people point out that in those statistics lies 
opportunity they call attention to the likelihood that many older 
homeowners are not just eager to sell but may be in a position to 
help with financing 
why should a seller want to help with financing first of 
course to sell the house but then to obtain a doubledigit rate 
of return backed by solid collateral 
the financing picture is everchanging usually for the better 
while it is true that many banks have been burned and therefore 
are increasingly strict in appraising properties and potential 
buyers most still want to lend 
finding the best lender isnt nearly as difficult as it once 
was either 
with the multiplication of mortgage products mortgage 
specialists have become institutions in many communities and are 
thoroughly knowledgeable about what individual banks offer they 
can choose the right one and for no fee 
at the same time many real estate agents have developed 
arrangements with lenders in their areas enabling them to 
originate mortgages right from their sales offices in most 
instances the real estate agent will charge a fee 
this practice has developed into open warfare between the 
mortgage bankers association of america which seeks to have the 
practice banned and the national association of realtors which 
views it as an effective sales tool 
for the time being wouldbe buyers can afford to let the two 
groups fight it out either through legislation or the courts and 
accept the best of what either has to offer 
they should be aware however that a fee may be charged and 
they should understand that they themselves bear responsibility 
for making certain that the loan conditions are indeed the best 
obtainable

shares of electronics giant nv 
philips bounced back monday after a dramatic shakeup that saw its 
president and the head of its computer business resign due to a 
crisis of confidence among shareholders 
news that president cor van der klugt would resign on july 1 a 
year before his scheduled retirement pushed nv philips 
gloeilampenfabrieken up the equivalent of 105 to close at 1757 
a share in amsterdam 
the companys stock had plummeted 167 percent since the may 3 
disclosure that philips a flagship of dutch industry had barely 
broken even during the first quarter of the year 
philips the worlds secondlargest electronics concern after 
japans matsushita is a leading maker of lighting equipment 
consumer electronics home appliances and semiconductors 
product brand names include philips and magnavox televisions 
polygram records norelco appliances and philips light bulbs the 
company also holds a 47 percent stake in the whirlpool 
international bv appliancemaking joint venture 
wisse dekker the former philips president who heads the 
companys board of supervisors told reporters that van der klugt 
had maintained until just before the profit figures were released 
that the company was doing much better 
the problem is that expectations were raised and that 
there is such a huge difference between the expectations and the 
real results said dekker who was philips president from 198286 
that is about the worst thing that can happen to a company 
he said 
dekker told reporters that van der klugt apparently was unaware 
in advance of the poor firstquarter results which did not include 
a onetime 173 million gain from sale of philips defense 
businesses 
van der klugt has no proper explanation and its a mystery 
to me too said dekker who flew home from a vacation in the 
united states to deal with the crisis 
the board of supervisors maintains an oversight role at philips 
although it is not involved in daytoday management 
dekker said he held several days of intensive talks with van der 
klugt and gert lorentz head of the computer division van der 
klugt decided to quit after consulting with the board and lorentz 
also tendered his resignation 
replacing van der klugt will be his deputy jan timmer whose 
38year track record with philips includes bringing profitability 
to its polygram records subsidiary and the consumer electronics 
division he now heads 
timmer whose reputation for widespread staff reductions has 
earned him the dutch business page nickname of hurricane 
gilbert already had been slated to replace van der klugt on 
july 1 1991 
neither van der klugt nor timmer attended mondays news 
conference 
shareholders are expected to approve the personnel changes at an 
extraordinary meeting expected to be convened about july 1 dekker 
said 
jan stoop an amsterdambased executive of the barclays de zoete 
wedd investment bank said mondays rallying of philips stock 
reflected pure sentiment that timmer could be the man to turn 
round the company 
that is sentiment for the short term for in the longer term 
the mood has to be one of wait and see stoop said 
philips reported a profit of only 315 million in the first 
three months of this year not including the gain from the defense 
unit sale that compared with a profit of 116 million for the 
corresponding 1989 period 
philips has blamed its poor results on unfavorable currency 
conversion rates and the soaring interest rates of recent months 
although analysts have indicated van der klugts optimistic 
forecasts indicated problems with the companys control over its 
farflung businesses 
dekker said the worst losses were suffered by philips 
integrated circuits and information systems division which faces 
fierce japanese and south korean competition 
dekker would not disclose specific losses at the computer 
division 
ata kahrel an analyst at the amsterdam brokerage h wesselius 
and co said the division was probably just facing a malaise 
with just the lightest drop in demand theyre stuck with these 
huge stocks

the supreme court today squelched a lawsuit 
charging the united steelworkers union with negligence in a 1972 
idaho silver mine disaster that killed 91 miners 
the justices by a 63 vote said the state court suit was 
preempted by federal labor law 
the disaster occurred may 2 1972 at the sunshine mine in 
kellogg the us bureau of mines said an underground fire 
apparently started when timbers and debris ignited spontaneously 
the miners died of asphyxiation or carbon monoxide poisoning 
families of dead miners sued the union on grounds it appointed a 
member to the mines safety committee the union member had 
accompanied the company safety engineer in monthly inspections 
the union was accused of negligence for the alleged failure of 
its member to point out or correct such problems as corroded 
oxygenbreathing equipment and padlocked rescue equipment 
the idaho supreme court ruled in 1986 that the union could be 
sued in state court 
but the nations highest court ordered the idaho court to 
restudy its ruling in light of a 1987 decision in which the 
justices gave unions nationwide more protection against being sued 
in state courts 
that 1987 ruling said such lawsuits generally are preempted by 
federal labor law 
the idaho supreme court after restudying the silver mine 
disaster case said the negligence claims in it were different 
because a union member was on the mine inspection team 
writing for the high court today justice byron r white said 
the idaho court was wrong 
white said the negligence claim cannot be described as 
independent of the collectivebargaining agreement 
the unions representatives were participating in the 
inspection process pursuant to the provisions of 
collectivebargaining agreement he said 
chief justice william h rehnquist and justices anthony m 
kennedy and antonin scalia dissented 
writing for the three kennedy said none of the unions 
arguments for displacing idaho law without any trial on the 
merits has validity 
george cohen the unions washington dc counsel who argued 
the case march 26 called the ruling a complete vindication of 
our position 
the supreme court has held that insofar as a union is 
enforcing a safety and health article of collective bargaining 
it is governed exclusively by federal labor law principles cohen 
said 
coeur dalene idaho attorney ken howard said he would reserve 
comment until after reading the courts opinion 
the case is united steelworkers vs rawson 89322

jury selection in the securities fraud trial of 
ivan boesky associate john a mulheren jr began monday with 
questions about key players in wall streets insider trading 
scandal 
about 100 citizens on the panel of potential jurors were asked 
in a questionnaire whether they had ever heard of michael milken 
drexel burnham lambert inc and boesky the convicted stock 
speculator who was mulherens onetime friend and business 
associate 
mulheren 40 is on trial in us district court on 41 counts of 
conspiracy securities fraud mail fraud and recordkeeping 
violations involving his relationship with boesky 
the indictment claims that mulheren and boesky then among the 
nations most powerful speculators in stocks of takeover targets 
schemed to inflate the price of gulf amp western inc shares and 
conceal ownership of large blocks of stock 
boesky released recently after serving two years of a 
threeyear prison term is expected to deliver his first public 
testimony at the trial he paid 100 million in penalties and 
pleaded guilty to one felony to settle the biggest insider trading 
case ever 
boeskys cooperation with prosecutors aided in many other 
insider trading cases including the guilty pleas of drexel last 
year and milken who ran the firms junk bond department last 
month 
mulheren whose firm jamie securities is now defunct was known 
as a daring trader who wore jeans and boat shoes to the office he 
carried over his casual style of dressing to the courtroom on 
monday wearing a yellow openneck shirt and khaki pants 
in february 1988 police arrested mulheren leaving his rumson 
nj mansion with a loaded israelimade assault rifle and a pair 
of army fatigues stuffed in a gym bag in the back seat of his 
mercedes 
according to court documents mulheren intended to shoot boesky 
and boeskys chief trader michael davidoff because without them 
the head hunt would be over 
doctors for mulheren later said the episode happened because 
mulheren had stopped taking the prescribed drug lithium to treat 
manic depression 
new jersey authorities dropped weapons possession charges in 
exchange for three years of pretrial probation mulheren also 
surrendered his gun collection

soybean futures prices fell sharply monday on the 
chicago board of trade extending the previous sessions steep 
losses amid concerns that rainy weather could force an expansion of 
soybean acreage 
oat futures also closed lower while wheat and corn futures ended 
mixed 
rainy weekend weather in the midwest is believed to have slowed 
the pace of corn planting in the region which is also the nations 
premier soybean belt 
with more rain expected this week analysts said speculation is 
brewing that some farmers may be unable to plant as much corn as 
they had planned and will instead sow those acres with soybeans

the chief financial officer of bank of new england 
corp one of the few senior executives who remained with the bank 
after it reported huge losses this winter says he plans to take 
early retirement at age 54 
david b payne will step down in july after 32 years with the 
bank named to the top financial post last year payne came from 
the banks connecticut subsidiary he was named president at 
connecticut bank and trust co in 1988 
im going home payne said i always considered this a 
short assignment and i let everybody know early on that i wanted to 
go back to hartford 
late last year the bank began to show huge losses primarily due 
to bad loans in the plunging new england real estate market the 
25 billion bank had more than 1 billion in losses last year 
federal regulators apparently sought the ouster of several top 
bank executives but payne distanced himself from the problems and 
escaped the purge 
lawrence k fish the banks new chairman said payne was 
helpful as the bank struggled to set itself aright 
his steadiness was especially valuable during the most 
troubled times fish wrote in a letter to employees 
payne said he will stay on with the institution as outside 
director of constitution capital management the banks subsidiary 
that oversees about 500 million in pensions and institutional 
funds 
first however im going to put my feet up for a couple of 
months payne said monday the last year was 12 months but it 
seemed like it was many more than that

closing the united states to competition from 
foreign banks would be ineffective and prompt retaliation against 
us banks federal reserve chairman alan greenspan told a 
congressional panel monday 
us banks need less regulation not protection from overseas 
financial institutions to compete in a rapidly changing 
international marketplace greenspan and other witnesses told a 
subcommittee of the house banking finance and urban affairs 
committee 
it would clearly be counterproductive to close our markets to 
foreign competition merely because foreign markets are less open 
than we like greenspan testified such an action would invite 
retaliation and would not be very effective in any case 
greenspan said foreign companies simply would funnel their 
transactions through offshore banks that continue to do business in 
america he also said removing the competition of foreign banks 
would reduce the pressure to update banking regulations delaying 
needed changes and harming us banks and consumers 
the subcommittee was meeting in chicago to assess the 
competitiveness of us banks against their far east counterparts 
but witnesses also said the nations banks soon could face stiff 
international competition from european banks 
by jan 1 1993 european countries plan to eliminate many 
internal trade barriers forming a market the subcommittees 
witnesses said would surpass the united states in size and wealth 
some witnesses criticized us regulations that bar banks from 
certain lines of business they said these regulations make it more 
expensive for banks to attract deposits that in turn limits the 
ability of us banks to compete against foreign banks that are 
faced with fewer restrictions the witnesses said 
we believe the system now hampers the ability of our financial 
institutions to effectively compete in the marketplace said l 
william seidman chairman of the federal deposit insurance corp 
its hard to think of what more we can do to handicap our banks 
but greenspan said the nations low saving rate also hampers the 
competitiveness of us banks in foreign markets by lowering the 
amount of money available to banks to loan out 
committee members and speakers disagreed on what steps would 
strengthen us banks ability to compete overseas committee 
chairman frank annunzio dill hinted broadly for sanctions 
against countries with policies that lock out us banks 
in america we say buy american he said in japan they 
say buy japanese or else to those who seek to keep our 
institutions out i say keep away 
annunzio said japanese banking concerns now own 40 percent of 
the worlds banking assets and foreignowned banks hold 23 percent 
of us bank assets 
if this rate of japanese expansion continues you will not get 
dollars from an automatic teller machine you will get yen he 
said 
but representatives of asianbased banks said their countries 
restrictions against us banks were temporary and necessary to 
protect local banks which were illprepared to cope with the 
competitive challenge of foreign banks 
the longterm objective of the korean government in my 
opinion is to provide a level playing field for both domestic and 
foreign banks as they face a more deregulated competitive 
banking environment in korea said chang woo lee regional 
managing director for korea exchange bank 
rep marcy kaptur dohio argued against further bank 
deregulation she called the savings and loan industry crisis 
compelling evidence that the financial community could not handle 
it 
we gave new powers to financial institutions and now the 
american people have to pay up 500 billion she said referring 
to the federal bailout of the thrift industry

pricecutting schemes do not necessarily 
violate federal antitrust laws even if they hurt a competitors 
business the supreme court ruled monday 
the justices voted 72 to end a lawsuit against atlantic 
richfield co brought by independent gas stations in california and 
washington state 
the court said that only when a companys pricecutting can be 
proved to be predatory and harmful does it violate the federal 
sherman act a major antitrust law 
predatory pricing is defined as setting prices below the level 
necessary to sell a product at a profit or below an appropriate 
measure of the cost of producing the product 
in other rulings monday involving businesses the justices 
squelched a lawsuit charging the united steelworkers of america 
with negligence in a 1972 idaho silver mine disaster that killed 91 
miners the justices said the state court suit was preempted by 
federal labor law 
families of dead miners had sued the union in state court on 
grounds it appointed a member to the mines safety committee the 
union was accused of negligence for the alleged failure of its 
member to point out or correct such problems as corroded 
oxygenbreathing equipment and padlocked rescue equipment 
refused without comment to allow 30 states to sue 26 
manufacturers in the supreme court over removal of asbestos from 
public schools and other government buildings the ruling action 
does not preclude the states from suing asbestos manufacturers in 
their respective state courts 
in the antitrust case usa petroleum co an independent oil 
dealer had accused atlantic richfield or arco of conspiring with 
arco gas station dealers to fix prices illegally to drive the 
independents out of business 
arco contended that its plan which included lowering gasoline 
prices to attract more customers and discontinuing credit card 
sales to save money is legitimate 
arco lawyers said the major companys share of the retail gas 
market in california and washington was 10 to 12 percent in 1981 
and increased to 14 to 16 percent in 1983 because of lower prices 
a federal judge threw out the lawsuit but the 9th us circuit 
court of appeals reinstated it in 1988 the appeals court said that 
although there was no proof arco engaged in predatory pricing it 
still may have injured usa petroleum in violation of federal 
antitrust law 
but justice william j brennan who wrote the courts opinion 
said usa petroleum had not suffered any antitrust injury 
when a firm or even a group of firms lowers prices but 
maintains them above predatory levels the business lost by rivals 
cannot be viewed as an anticompetitive consequence brennan said

greenwich conn 
the government is set to release its report on industrial 
production for april on tuesday april consumer prices and housing 
starts on wednesday and march trade figures on thursday 
mcgroarty said market sentiment is that the data will point to a 
further weakening in the economy which could result in lower 
interest rates and subsequently depress the dollar 
the dollar sentiment is still quite negative he said the 
feeling is that theres more of a chance that rates will decline

cocoa futures prices roared to their highest levels in more than 
year monday in a rally ignited by reports of renewed unrest in the 
ivory coast the worlds largest cocoa producer 
on other commodity markets oil futures rose sharply soybeans 
plunged while grains were mixed livestock and meat futures were 
mixed and precious metals were mixed 
cocoa futures settled 88 to 105 higher on new yorks coffee 
sugar and cocoa exchange with the contract for delivery in may at 
1389 per metric ton the highest settlement of a nearmonth cocoa 
contract since april 3 1989 
the rally followed reports that solidiers had temporarily 
surrounded the presidential palace and some radio and television 
stations in the ivory coast capital of abidjian protesting wages 
and living conditions 
protests by various sectors of ivory coast society have occurred 
occasionally since early march after president felix 
houphouetboigny ordered austerity measures to combat economic 
distress caused by last years collapse of cocoa prices 
houphouetboigny has since rescinded some of the measures and 
has said multiparty elections will be held later this year 
yet traders remain closely attuned to the ivory coast situation 
and tend to buy futures on signs of unrest fearing cocoa shipping 
could be disrupted analysts said 
the market is convinced this is a boiling pot said arthur 
stevenson of prudentialbache securities inc 
he said traders fear a new government may not honor longstanding 
cocoa supply agreements forged during houphouetboignys 30year 
reign 
analyst stephen w platt of dean witter reynolds inc said 
buying interest also may have been piqued by bullish comments made 
over the weekend by derek chambers a trader with philipp brothers 
inc who is believed to be holding a large cash position in cocoa 
energy futures prices rose on the new york mercantile exchange 
amid reports that saudi arabia had cut oil production and western 
oil companies had agreed to reduce their purchase requests 
further buying was prompted by reports that loadings of cargo 
from brent oil platforms in the north sea would be reduced in june 
for maintenance 
west texas intermediate crude oil futures settled 27 cents to 76 
cents higher with june at 1971 a barrel heating oil was 1 cent 
to 157 cents higher with june at 5243 cents a gallon unleaded 
gasoline was 80 cent to 123 cents higher with june at 6297 cents 
a gallon 
soybean futures fell sharply on the chicago board of trade 
extending the previous sessions steep losses amid concerns that 
rainy weather could force an expansion of soybean acreage grain 
futures ended mixed 
rainy weekend weather in the midwest is believed to have slowed 
the pace of corn planting in the region which also is the nations 
soybean belt 
the national weather service has predicted aboveaverage 
rainfall in the midwest through midjune analysts said speculation 
is brewing that some farmers may be unable to plant as much corn as 
they had planned and will instead sow those acres with soybeans 
which can be planted later than corn 
corn planting was 69 percent complete as of sunday according to 
an agriculture department report soybean planting was 12 percent 
done 
wheat futures staged a modest recovery monday after the usda 
announced the soviet union had bought nearly 300000 metric tons of 
us wheat at subsidized prices the usda also said the soviets 
bought 150000 metric tons of us corn 
wheat futures settled 1 cent lower to 2 cents higher with may 
at 384 a bushel corn futures were cent lower to 2 cents 
higher with may at 289 a bushel oats were 3 cents to 4 cents

cents lower with may at 623 a bushel

slack demand and lower wholesale pork prices hog futures also 
retreated while cattle futures were mixed 
live cattle settled 12 cent lower to 32 cent higher with june

monday that helping people is more important than making money 
though monetary compensation is important for all of us to 
survive it cannot be the reason for working akio morita said in 
a commencement address at the graduate school of business 
what we must achieve in work and in life is something which 
ruur pockets it must be something which fulfills 
us to our heart it must be somns deeper than oething more more than an 
allconsuming drive to look out for number one said morita who 
earlier was given an honorary doctor of law degree at graduation 
exercises for penns 4900 undergraduates 
morita said the role todays graduates and future business 
people choose must be more than merely an unending personal 
quest for the dollar or yen or dmark 
you should strive to create an atmosphere where management and 
employees can come together to develop and reach common goals 
mutual recognition and mutual respect must be instilled he said 
you must recognize the worth of the individual and respect his 
or her right to discover fulfillment for themselves

southland corp the parent of the 7eleven 
convenience store chain said monday that tax benefits from past 
red ink helped reduce its first quarter loss by nearly 60 percent 
the company which has turned to japanese investors for help in 
avoiding junkbondinduced bankruptcy said it lost 6944 
million or 35 cents per share in the quarter ended march 31 
compared with 16943 million or 86 cents in the same period last 
year 
revenue rose 2 percent to 194 billion from 190 billion 
this years quarter was helped by a 52 million tax benefit from 
past losses carried forward pretax losses from continuing 
operations increased to 16198 million from 13795 million 
southland was taken private in december 1987 by the founding 
thompson family in a 49 billion leveraged buyout financed with 
highyield junk bonds

its gasoline refinery and other operations to help pay down the 
notes the company said monday it had paid 159 billion on senior 
bank term loan since the buyout including 3995 million this 
year and still owes 9004 million 
in march southland announced a complicated restructuring 
involving the sale of 400 million of southland stock to itoyokado 
ltd which operates 7eleven stores in japan the sale would give 
itoyokado 75 percent of the companys common stock leaving 15 
percent in thompson hands

businesses held inventories steady while 
increasing sales in march the government said monday 
analysts said the report indicated little threat of production 
cutbacks or loss of jobs 
the commerce department reported that shelf and backlot 
inventories were unchanged at a seasonally adjusted 794 billion 
backlogs had fallen 04 percent in february and risen 03 percent 
in january 
sales rose 06 percent to a seasonally adjusted 5391 billion 
following gains of 14 percent in february and 04 percent in 
january the february increase was first reported at 13 percent 
what it the report means is that producers are looking very 
realistically at domestic demand and the possibility of a slowing 
overseas demand for usmade goods and are bringing production in 
line with those expectations said gilbert benz an economist 
with the swiss bank corp in new york 
unlike a period of slow growth where businesses often get 
caught short with an excess buildup of stocks in the current 
environment we see they are anticipating a slowdown and adjusting 
production so they dont have to slash inventories and cut 
production radically he added 
march business activity produced a 147 ratio of inventories to 
sales matching a january 1989 ratio that was the lowest since the 
current economic expansion began after the 198182 recession the 
ratio means that it would take 147 months to exhaust inventories 
at the march pace it peaked at 170 in october 1982 
the decline in inventories was greatest in the manufacturing 
sector dropping 03 percent for the second straight month 
however backlogs edged up 02 percent at the wholesale level after 
declining 03 percent in february retail inventories gained 03 
percent after posting a 07 percent loss the previous month 
sales on the other hand dropped 02 percent at the retail 
level and the commerce department reported last week that retail 
sales fell another 06 percent in april the biggest plunge in six 
months 
but manufacturing sales rose 11 percent wholesale sales 
advanced 08 percent

playboy enterprises inc is hoping no nudes will 
be good news for its bottom line at least as far as its stock 
certificates are concerned 
ever since playboy went public in 1971 its stock certificates 
have been graced with the nude image of february 1971 playmate 
willy rey 
but playboy said monday it will replace the nude figure with a 
clothed one in conjunction with a recapitalization plan unveiled 
last week 
the change is expected to save the chicagobased company money 
the unusual design gave the stock a certain measure of novelty 
appeal spokeswoman terri tomcisin said playboy has about 14000 
singleshare stockholders about six times as many as most other 
companies its size many of whom bought one share just to get the 
racy stock certificate 
the problem she said is that it costs playboy about 100000 
annually to service the accounts of those shareholders 
playboy hopes to reduce that expense through its 
recapitalization 
the plan includes a reverse stock split one new share of class 
a voting stock for two old shares plus a dividend of three new 
shares of class b nonvoting stock for each new share of class a 
stock 
stockholders with just one share of playboy would get only a 
check 1262 at mondays closing price and a facsimile of the 
old stock certificate 
ms tomcisin said the design of the new stock certificates will 
include someones image and although she said she didnt know who 
it will be they will be clothed to discourage novelty purchases 
ms tomcisin laughed at a suggestion that playboy founder hugh 
hefner may be pictured on the certificate 
all she knows she said is that the new design will somehow 
reflect the fact that the company is a global company

chrysler corp has approved limited production of 
the dodge viper a twoseat sports car billed as a performance and 
price rival to the chevrolet corvette autoweek magazine reported 
monday 
two versions of the viper will be built probably as 1992 models 
and delivered in mid to late 1991 autoweek said in a report in 
its may 21 issue 
the rearwheeldrive car will cost between 30000 and 40000 
one version will be powered by a 318cubicinch v8 engine 
autoweek said the other will offer a v10 engine developed in part 
by chrysler subsidiary lamborghini and capable of reaching 100 mph 
in less than 10 seconds the magazine said 
chrysler chairman lee iacocca was expected to formally announce 
production of the viper on friday in los angeles the magazine said 
a concept version of the viper was seen as long ago as january 
1989 at the north american international auto show in detroit 
chrysler motors president robert lutz and thomas gale vice 
president of product design have supported production of the viper 
while awaiting iacoccas decision 
iacocca said in july 1989 that he was leaning toward approving 
the viper 
such an exotic product might not be expected to emerge from a 
slumping auto market and chryslers 1billion costcutting 
program but the viper was the first project to result from 
chryslers conceptual design and rendering system the 
computerdriven system could cut by 25 percent the amount of time 
needed to bring a totally new car to market gale said last year

the state of pennsylvania filed a lawsuit 
monday against seven of the states largest car insurers in an 
effort to force them to cut rates under the states revamped auto 
insurance law 
the complaint filed in commonwealth court also claims the 
companies have been acting in concert to undermine the new law 
which calls for rate rollbacks of at least 10 percent beginning in 
july 
last week gov robert p casey vowed to wage war against 
insurance companies that attempt to pull out of the pennsylvania 
market to avoid rate cuts the suit appeared to be an early shot

the securities and exchange commission filed a 
civil lawsuit monday accusing the president of a radio paging 
services company of manipulating the price of his companys stock 
the sec early last month suspended trading in the stock of the 
company southland communications inc of santa ana calif 
southland president ahmad bayaa was accused of engaging in the 
stock manipulation scheme with shaw terhrani a broker with bc 
financial corp of atlanta 
the sec complaint said that beginning in january 1989 bayaa and 
terhrani began accumulating southland securities in various broker 
accounts opened in the names of friends and family members 
as of april 11 they controlled more than 1 million shares in 
addition to the 898800 owned by bayaa and his wife the sec said 
in the lawsuit filed in manhattans federal court 
when bayaa and terhrani became worried that southlands 
financial condition would cause other investors to sell their 
stock they allegedly attempted to keep southland stock off the 
open market the lawsuit said 
the sec said the men did this by arranging matched trades and by 
negotiating an agreement with at least one brokerage firm not to 
loan out southland stock held in customer margin accounts 
these practices caused the price of southland stock to nearly 
double from 875 to 1675 between march 13 and april 3 
according to the lawsuit 
the sec is seeking a court order compelling bayaa and tehrani to 
give up their alleged illegal profits which were not specified

armstrong world industries inc said a 
preliminary count shows its candidates won three of four board 
seats contested by the belzberg family of canada in a proxy fight 
armstrong also said monday that shareholders had rejected five 
amendments to the companys bylaws proposed by the belzbergs 
the belzbergs own 107 percent of armstrong through their 
investment vehicle first city diversified inc their efforts to 
exercise greater control over the company prompted pennsylvania 
lawmakers to pass the nations toughest antitakeover law earlier 
this year 
armstrong said an independent group of judges corporation trust 
co had found armstrong nominees received about twothirds of the 
votes cast while the belzberg slate received about onethird 
a spokesman for first city said armstrong has yet to give the 
belzbergs any meaningful breakdown of the vote 
shareholders voted at their annual meeting april 30 to elect 
four directors to the companys 13member board an armstrong 
spokesman said the company has 47150000 shares outstanding and 
83 percent of them were voted in the election 
official results should be available within the next few days 
armstrong said 
were delighted that our shareholders have backed us so 
solidly said william w adams armstrong chairman and president 
the fact that such a large portion of shares was voted in 
support of our boards nominees and not voted in favor of the 
belzbergs proposals is highly gratifying he said 
the belzbergs contend that the company improperly voted 5 
million shares of stock in its employees stock ownership plan on 
its behalf in the proxy fight 
edward e scharff spokesman for first city said those shares 
technically arent owned by anybody because they have not yet been 
distributed to the employees they shouldnt have been voted for 
anybody he said 
scharff also disputed the companys claim that the belzbergs 
proposed amendments had been defeated he said that if the shares 
in the employee stock ownership plan were excluded the belzbergs 
position would have carried 
its possible if not likely that the five shareholders 
rights proposals would have carried overwhelmingly scharff said 
the proposed changes are being argued in federal court in 
reading pa 
one proposal would allow a shareholder or group owning 20 
percent or more of the stock to call special shareholder meetings 
the companys position is that shareholders have the right to ask 
the board at its discretion to call meetings 
adams said he could not yet confirm first citys claim to have 
elected one of its candidates harvard business professor michael 
e jansen to the board 
but if so we would hope that as he learns more about our 
company he will make a substantial contribution to armstrong and 
its continuing success adams said 
armstrong management has declined to meet with the belzbergs 
the family has publicly criticized the company for supporting 
pennsylvanias new antitakeover law and accused management of 
working against shareholder interests 
conversely armstrong has characterized the belzbergs as inept 
managers who have driven companies virtually into the ground 
compromising shareholder earnings
