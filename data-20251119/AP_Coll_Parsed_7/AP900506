president roh taewoo on monday 
appealed to the nation to reject the road toward chaos but 
even as he spoke radical students armed with firebombs and pipes 
seized the governing partys headquarters 
plainclothes police firing tear gas recaptured the building 10 
minutes after the takeover arresting the students one woman was 
led away with blood dripping from her nose and mouth 
windows were broken and furniture smashed in the takeover but 
no damage estimate was immediately available 
right now we are in a difficult time roh flanked by his 
cabinet ministers told a nationwide television audience we are 
on a crossroads where the country can either be on a road toward 
progress or fall into a road toward chaos 
roh whose governing party has been losing popularity said 
labor unrest land speculation crime and eroding confidence in the 
economy were problems that all must work to solve 
this is the time to decide the fate of the nation he said 
the opposition party for peace and democracy warned monday that 
south korea faces a very dangerous national crisis that threatens 
the overall basis of democracy 
the party in a statement accused roh of a plot to 
prolong power by merging his party with two other opposition 
parties the merger was announced in january 
roh said the recent heightening of uneasiness had been 
partly caused by what he called illegal labor strikes at the state 
television network and the nations largest shipyard 
in the strike at the hyundai heavy industries co shipyard 
dozens of workers barricaded inside a huge crane began a hunger 
strike sunday to press their demand for the release of jailed union 
leaders reports said 
officials at the shipyard in ulsan a port city 200 miles 
southeast of seoul said they are prepared to negotiate an end to 
the protest but the workers have insisted on the release of the 
jailed unionists before talks the reports said 
the protests began april 28 when 12000 riot police fired tear 
gas and stormed the shipyard to end the strike 
in his speech roh said the government would guarantee a legal 
labor movement but will deal strongly with illegal labor 
disputes or collective actions with political purposes 
the government maintains some of the recent labor disputes have 
been politically motivated 
he also pledged to build housing for workers and improve welfare 
for poor people 
the future of our economy depends on the will and efforts of 
the government business workers and consumers roh said the 
government alone cannot run the economy 
he appealed to workers to refrain from demanding wage hikes 
higher than productivity until the economy has recovered 
inflation has been increasing at an annual rate of more than 10 
percent for the first time in many years and the stock market is at 
a twoyear low 
in addition exports are not selling well labor unrest huge 
wage increases and the rise of the south korean won against the 
dollar have hurt the competitiveness of the countrys products 
overseas

financier charles keating jr will resign as 
chairman of american continental corp the holding company he 
founded which oversaw the failure of lincoln savings and loan 
association a newspaper reported saturday 
james j feder a lawyer for keating said keating will step 
down as early as next week to help shareholders recover their 
losses the arizona republic said 
to remain as chairman would be a conflict of interest feder 
told the newspaper 
creditors of american continental who say they lost more than 
200 million on junk bonds would get 21 million for starters under 
a plan to settle the holding companys 13monthold bankruptcy case 
lawyers for keating who built american continental into a 6 
billion holding company complained they werent asked to 
participate in talks which led to the proposed settlement 
the plan would require the companys failed savings and loan 
subsidiary californiabased lincoln savings and loan to pay 21 
million to settle numerous lawsuits against it 
lawyers for the unsecured creditors committee of american 
continental and the governments resolution trust corp the entity 
charged with cleaning up the nations savings and loan mess 
announced their agreement friday to us district judge richard m 
bilby the rtc runs lincoln savings which was seized by regulators 
in april 1989 
bilby had been scheduled to rule friday on a motion to replace 
keating with a trustee the judge scheduled preliminary and final 
hearings on the plan for june 78 and july 1920 
more than 50 percent of the creditors must vote on the proposal 
for acceptance and twothirds must approve it 
lawyers handling lawsuits against the companies contend that 
23000 people were steered into risky investments by american 
continental or lincoln employees and lost more than 200 million 
the plan would end much of the litigation invlving the holding 
company and lincoln savings 
the day before regulators seized lincoln savings american 
continental asked us bankruptcy court here for protection from 
creditors while it and 11 lincoln subsidiaries reorganized the 
chapter 11 action omitted lincoln allowing a federal deposit 
insurance corp takeover of the sampl 
a securitiesfraud lawsuit against lincoln and american 
continental claims keating and others conspired in 1983 to buy 
lincoln to divert federally insured deposits to their own use 
american continental acquired lincoln in february 1984 for about 
51 million 
in addition to liquidating the company the proposal includes 
dismissal of the bankruptcy cases of the 11 subsidiaries and of all 
claims against lincoln and its creditors by american continentals 
creditors veal said 
it also calls for a partial resolution of claims by 23000 
investors who held 200 million in lincoln junk bonds and for 
unwinding the corporate relationship between acc and lincoln by 
assigning certain assets of accs bankruptcy estate to the rtc 
the proposal did not identify those assets 
the settlement doesnt affect an rtc civil lawsuit against 
keating which similarly accuses him and other lincoln insiders of 
a racketeering conspiracy to buy lincoln to divert federally 
insured deposits for their own use 
keatings contributions to influential lawmakers figure in an 
ethics probe of five us senators who met with regulators on 
behalf of lincoln

sir reginald goodall a leading conductor of the 
works of richard wagner has died he was 88 
his death was announced from a nursing home at bridge near 
canterbury where he died on saturday the cause of death was not 
disclosed 
despite his reputation as an interpreter of wagner goodall was 
never principal conductor of a leading orchestra or opera company 
during his career he worked with the opera companies at covent 
garden glyndebourne sadlers wells and the english and welsh 
national companies 
he also worked abroad as an assistant to some of the centurys 
greatest conductors including wilhelm furtwangler otto klemperer 
clemens krauss and hans knappertsbusch he coached some of 
britains finest wagnerian singers gwyneth jones donald mcintyre 
and david ward 
goodall was reclusive his whos who entry occupied only four 
lines and after a performance he would leave the podium quickly 
for the musicians and singers to receive applause without him 
he rarely used a baton preferring to conduct with halfclenched 
fists 
british critics called him the greatest living wagnerian in 
1979 when his performances of wagners tristan und isolde with 
the welsh national opera company were sold out 
he was then a frail widower living alone in the kent 
countryside he was knighted in 1985 for services to music 
members of the wagner family visited britain to hear goodall 
conduct and called him the greatest conductor of the masters music 
he was born in the cathedral city of lincoln and he studied at 
the royal college of music and then in munich and vienna he was an 
organist doublebass player and choirmaster 
in 1945 goodall conducted the sadlers wells premiere of 
benjamin brittens opera peter grimes but for 20 years he rose 
no higher than conductors assistant for opera companies 
rodney milnes the countrys leading opera critic wrote it 
says a lot about england that this towering genius should have been 
on the music staff at covent garden for two decades and more 
serving under notably inferior musical directors and being given 
virtually nothing to do all the conductors with whom he is to be 
compared are dead 
critics said goodalls high ideals long and detailed 
preparation of an opera individual coaching of all the singers and 
all the instrumental rehearsals were too demanding for opera 
houses in his own country 
goodall gave his last performance at the 1987 promenade concerts 
in london where he conducted act three of wagners parsifal 
his funeral will be in canterbury on may 14 there was no word

to the chagrin of congressional investigators 
a special prosecutor appointed to probe former secretary samuel r 
pierce jrs tenure at the department of housing and urban 
development is ignoring their latest hearings 
arlin m adams the courtappointed prosecutor said he has 
taken appropriate steps to insulate his office from learning of 
former hud official dubois l gilliams testimony before a house 
subcommittee 
gilliam once a deputy assistant secretary of hud under pierce 
and now serving an 18month sentence for taking bribes testified 
for three days last week before the house government operations 
housing subcommittee 
in his testimony gilliam said that pierce was deeply involved 
in steering hud grants to friends and political allies 
particularly during election years 
the panels chairman rep tom lantos dcalif characterized 
the testimony as contradicting pierces sworn statements a year ago 
that he did not decide who received federal housing grants 
after hearing gilliams testimony lantos accused pierce of 
using discretionary hud grant programs as a political slush 
fund he challenged the former secretary to appear before the 
panel and offer a pointbypoint rebuttal 
i have every reason to believe mr gilliams testimony until 
it is proven to the contrary lantos said that has not 
happened 
adams action to insulate his staff from the immunized testimony 
of gilliam is a step similar to the one taken by the special 
prosecutor during the congressional irancontra testimony of oliver 
north and others through it prosecutors retain an ability to 
bring further charges against gilliam 
but congressional investigators claim gilliams testimony might 
provide prosecutors the evidence to go after much bigger fish 
including pierce 
dubois gilliam is no oliver north said the subcommittees 
staff director stuart weisberg 
pierce and three other top aides including former executive 
assistants deborah gore dean and lance wilson have refused to 
testify before the panel invoking a fifth amendment protection 
gainst selfincrimination 
weisberg said he assumed adams took the step out of extreme 
caution and would later review gilliams testimony and use it in 
his investigation adams declined to comment through a spokeswoman 
terry dugan 
the dispute highlights a longrunning rift between the 
congressional investigators and the bush administrations justice 
department over the limited scope of adams investigation 
currently adams probe is limited only to one hud program 
members of the house subcommittee want it broadened to cover the 
activity of pierce and his top aides in all hud programs and 
possible perjury by pierce in a may 25 1989 appearance before then 
panel before be began invoking his fifth amendment rights 
a republican on the panel rep chris shays of connecticut said 
the justice department has an obligation to investigate gilliams 
allegations because of the narrow limits that attorney general dick 
thornburgh sought on adams original appointment 
this committee has done almost everything it possibly can do 
it is now up to the independent counsel and the justice department 
to do their jobs shays said and frankly i have seen very 
little evidence to date that they have done their jobs 
he complained that adams who is just beginning his work has 
been presented with a confused mandate by the justice 
department 
if the special prosecutor hasnt been given the responsibility 
to look at all of hud it clearly rests with the justice 
department shays said they have chosen to retain it and i 
think its about time we started to see some action 
pierces attorney paul l perito took sharp issue with the 
committee members assertion that gilliam had contradicted pierces 
statement 
perito said pierces may 1989 statement that he wasnt involved 
in deciding who got grants applied only to the section 8 moderate 
rehabilitation program which subsidizes developer who renovate low 
income housing 
the section 8 program was the first of many hud programs to fall 
under allegations of abuse during pierces eightyear tenure as a 
member of president reagans cabinet 
perito said pierces statement made without an attorney present 
and before he decided to invoke his constitutional rights to not 
testify further did not consider other programs in which he had 
legal discretion to award grants 
this committee keeps trying to adjudicate as a court of law 
perito said it is not only fanciful its defamatory 
thornburgh requested the court to name a special prosecutor only 
after house democrats legally compelled to consider their request 
for one his recommendation to the court was for a narrow 
investigation and he specifically recommended against broadening it 
to include possible perjury

in gubernatorial races across the country 
gender has become an issue as female candidates clash with their 
male opponents on abortion sexism and the importance of putting a 
woman in the statehouse 
women like dianne feinstein in california ann richards in texas 
and barbara hafer in pennsylvania are on the forefront of what some 
observers expect to be a breakthrough decade for women in politics 
there are three women now serving as governors two of whom are 
retiring and at least 10 women are considered to be serious 
gubernatorial hopefuls this year 
its a testament to the womens movement said shana weiss 
of the hollywood womens political committee its no longer a 
symbolic movement but a real kind of recognition that women are 
equal players in the political game 
sensing a political change feinstein has made the very fact 
that shes a woman an issue in her campaign urging voters to make 
history by electing her the states first female governor 
this is a big moment for me and a historic one for women 
she said in announcing her candidacy much thought and 
deliberation preceded this decision i am a nonincumbent in a race 
against two entrenched statewide figures a woman in a field of 
men 
feinstein faces attorney general john van de kamp for the 
democratic nomination the likely gop nominee is us sen pete 
wilson 
van de kamp has responded by pointing to what he calls his 
strong record on feminist issues and accusing feinstein of using 
gender to obscure her own record 
if a man were to stand in front of a crowd of men and say 
vote for men because as a fellow man i can help mens interests 
i can be labeled a sexist said duane peterson van de kamps 
spokesman im sort of surprised shes doing that 
the prospect of making history also is a theme in joan finneys 
bid to win the democratic nomination for governor of kansas 
but in finneys case the significance of her becoming the 
states first female governor has been woven into speeches subtly 
rather than offered as a major campaign issue 
in texas meanwhile there has been nothing subtle about 
richards democratic campaign against republican candidate clayton 
williams 
gender politics had stood in the wings because of williams 
antiabortion stand and opposition to the equal rights amendment 
but it took center stage when he revealed he went to prostitutes 
when he was a teenager and a college student 
earlier williams said hed be uncomfortable running against a 
woman because he grew up in a mans world he also made a 
comparison between bad weather and rape and passed it off as a 
joke if its inevitable just relax and enjoy it he said 
williams has denied being a sexist but acknowledged the remarks 
were insensitive 
claytons heart is in the right place even if he doesnt pick 
the right words williams spokesman bill kenyon said 
richards campaign has condemned the remarks as insulting to 
women 
clayton williams has gone to great lengths to be a 
stereotypical cowboy one off those roughhewn texans who conquered 
the west lets get up in the saddle and ride off into the sunset 
sort of thing said richards campaign manager glenn smith 
in a number of campaigns male and female stereotypes have 
spilled over into candidates defenses of issues most notably 
abortion 
the us supreme courts 1989 decision to give states more power 
in regulating abortions has helped make abortion rights a key 
campaign issue in many races 
in pennsylvania hafer is running as a prochoice republican 
against staunchly antiabortion gov robert p casey a democrat 
seeking a second term 
in an interview last august hafer said she expected male 
candidates to shy away from running for governor because of the 
abortion issue 
thats a tough issue to talk about she said its a gut 
issue its not a nice issue a lot of men wouldnt be 
comfortable speaking about it and they know its going to be an 
issue 
though all three california gubernatorial hopefuls are 
prochoice on abortion feinsteins campaign has contended that a 
female governor would be more likely to strongly defend abortion 
rights 
a man can be a staunch defender of abortion rights many have 
been said feinstein spokeswoman dee dee myers but theres a 
visceral reaction that women have to the issue because they are 
women its a point of common experience

civil rights forces hope to propel a 
wideranging job discrimination bill past its first house committee 
hurdle this week now that they have softened a key provision 
opposed by employers 
it will add to our support rep augustus hawkins dcalif 
chairman of the house and education and labor committee said after 
the lawmakers last week inserted milder language in the bills 
major fairhiring provision 
hawkins the chief house sponsor hopes the committee will 
approve the bill tuesday it then would move on to the judiciary 
committee before being positioned for house floor action 
a similar bill is set for floor action in the senate 
the bills provisions range from a ban on racial harassment in 
the workplace to new ground rules easing the way for job 
discrimination lawsuits against employers 
the bill was designed to overturn six 1989 supreme court 
decisions that civil rights supporters say added up to a sharp 
setback for minority rights in the workplace 
as drafted the bill would have forced employers named in 
discrimination suits to justify any hiring practices that 
diminished the chances of minorities and women being hired height 
and weight requirements for example in the case of women 
businesses would have to prove that the requirement in question 
represented a business necessity 
conservative critics complained that it would be virtually 
impossible for employers to prove that their hiring standards were 
in the bills words essential to effective job performance 
critics warned that employers would turn to minority hiring 
quotas to protect themselves from lawsuits 
attorney general dick thornburgh in a recent letter to lawmakers 
said the measure could usher in such quotas he said top advisers 
to president bush would recommend a veto 
the administration is calling for a more modest bill to combat 
job bias but it is not making headway in the democraticcontrolled 
congress 
bill supporters initially scoffed at conservative complaints 
that proving business necessity would be too tough for employers 
civil rights groups complained that a 1989 supreme court decision 
skewed the ground rules against the victims of unfair hiring 
the 1989 ruling wards cove vs antonio involved workers at a 
salmon cannery in alaska it required those filing suit to prove 
that the hiring practices in question such as a height 
requirement do not represent a business necessity 
the wards cove decision broke with longstanding procedures 
established under the courts 1971 griggs vs duke power co 
decision 
under griggs employers had to prove business necessity and 
bill sponsors claim employers did not resort to hiring quotas in 
that era 
hawkins conceded that the complaints that have been raised are 
bona fide he offered to change the standard from essential to 
effective job performance as it appeared in the original bill to 
bears a substantial and demonstrable relationship to effective 
job performance 
the committee adopted the change unanimously with republican 
critics of going along but stopping short of saying they had 
changed their minds about the overall bill 
its still a quota bill said rep steve bartlett rtexas 
civil rights forces said however that softening the measure 
was guaranteed to add support on the house floor 
before we had the votes to pass the bill this will give us 
the majority to override a veto in both houses said ralph neas 
executive director of the leadership conference on civil rights 
hawkins said he understood that the senate would adopt a similar 
amendment he said there was now enough support in the house to 
override a presidential veto 
hawkins said a veto of major civil rights legislation would 
force the administration to pay a political price that goes 
beyond the black vote he said the votes of women and the 
disabled would also have to be considered by the white house in 
sizing up any veto plans 
but bartlett said the measure has a bare majority on the floor 
its not a vetoproof majority

many decisions must be handed down before the 
supreme court can begin its summer recess in late june or early 
july but the 198990 term already has taken on a conservative tint 
especially in lawandorder cases 
of 17 criminallaw decisions announced by the court so far this 
term defendants have lost 13 
justices william j brennan and thurgood marshall the courts 
most consistent liberals cast dissenting votes in all 13 
the court gave police broad new powers to search the homes of 
arrested suspects cut back the appeals rights of prison inmates 
allowed us agents to search foreign homes of noncitizens without 
warrants and curtailed selfincrimination protection for people 
accused of child abuse 
two of the four decisions won by defendants are notable not only 
because they focus on significant issues but because justice byron 
r white was in the majority 
over 28 years white has earned a reputation as a hardliner who 
favors law enforcement forces in criminal cases 
but in one decision this term his vote helped forge a 54 
majority to bolster the rule barring the use at trial of evidence 
unlawfully obtained by police 
and in another white wrote for a 72 court in ruling that 
overnight guests in private homes enjoy the same privacy 
protections as their hosts against police arrests and searches 
two police practices still to be judged setting up roadside 
checkpoints to catch drunken drivers and using anonymous tips to 
justify stopping and questioning people

justice antonin scalia who has never been accused of being a 
shrinking violet at first appeared hesitant but soon warmed to the 
task of telling a senate subcommittee what he thinks about 
interpreting disputed language in federal laws 
my position is that legislative history what congress says 
about a bill before passing it into law is not always unreliable 
or unhelpful but i cant tell when it is i tend not to use it 
at all scalia said 
his remarks came as he and justice sandra day oconnor appeared 
before an appropriations subcommittee last week to present the 
courts 192 million budget request for next fiscal year 
sen warren rudman rnh noting that discussion of money 
matters was concluded in 11 minutes told scalia there was some 
extra time to fill 
you want me to sing something scalia asked with a smile 
rudman said hed rather have the justice expound on what he has 
written about interpreting federal law 
you really want me to do this scalia asked before launching 
into an extraordinary 15minute discussion with rudman and sen 
dale bumpers dark 
scalia noted and oconnor reiterated the point that his views 
on the matter are not shared by a majority of the courts justices

supreme court vacancies created by resignation retirement or 
death most often are discussed in terms of presidential 
administrations for example president carter never got to appoint 
anyone to the court 
but looking at court vacancies decade by decade shows that the 
1940s had eight the 1950s five the 1960s five the 1970s four and 
the 1980s three 
what will the 1990s bring some guess there will be seven new 
justices in place by the start of the next century

a modern doubledecker passenger train 
slammed into the back of an oldfashioned steam train that 
apparently stalled going up a steep hill sunday at least six 
people were reported killed and 90 injured 
the crash occurred at night in a remote area 25 miles north of 
sydney tv pictures showed that an undetermined number of people 
were trapped in the mangled wreckage of the two trains which were 
carrying about 430 people 
the crash site near the hamlet of brooklyn is surrounded by 
dense bushland and rescue workers had to drive down a dirt track 
to reach it when they arrived they found debris from the trains 
scattered over a 100yard area 
many injured passengers had to be carried more than 500 yards to 
waiting ambulances witnesses said at least six of the injured 
were reported in serious condition and some of them were taken to 
hospitals by helicopter 
the dead and injured included passengers on both trains said 
police who provided the casualty figures 
the doubledecker train with an estimated 100 people on board 
was traveling from the city of newcastle to sydney 
the steam train which had been chartered by a group of jazz 
fans and had around 330 people on board also was traveling south 
after a oneday trip to hunter valley 100 miles north of sydney 
the accident occurred between two tunnels according to a 
spokesman for gosford police who did not identify himself 
witnesses said the doubledecker train which was powered by 
electricity slammed into the steam train after it failed to make 
it up a steep gradient 
rob schwarzer new south wales state rail group manager said 
the cause of the accident was not immediately known but he agreed 
that it may have been caused by the steam train stalling in the 
path of the other train 
passengers on the doubledecker train said it stopped briefly 
behind the steam train the driver told us we would be about 10 
minutes as the steam train didnt have enough power to get up the 
hill justine reis said we stayed there for a while then 
started up around a curve and next thing bang people were thrown 
everywhere they just got thrown from their seats 
another survivor student ben shaw said we waited for about 
five minutes then we took off and just hit people were flying 
everywhere 
richard stohr a passenger in the second carriage of the 
doubledecker said the steam train apparently was not able to make 
it up the hill 
he said his train appeared to be trying to pick up speed to 
tackle the hill out of the tunnel when it slammed into the back of 
the stationary train a woman just flew past me just sailed 
past he said 
i think she was killed 
survivors were taken to a returned servicemens club at berowra 
about five miles from the crash site

voters in yugoslavias secondlargest 
republic croatia went to the polls sunday in the second round of 
free parliamentary elections that could lead to a secessionist 
movement 
the centerright croatian democratic union which advocates the 
republics independence from the rest of yugoslavia won a 
landslide victory april 22 in the opening round of croatias first 
free elections in more than 50 years 
a secondround triumph for the democratic union is certain to 
deepen the split with serbia yugoslavias largest republic and 
exacerbate tensions that are slowly pulling apart the countrys six 
constituent republics 
the voting was to continue monday and croatian electoral 
officials said initial results were not expected until that 
afternoon 
in the first round the democratic union won 104 of 131 seats in 
the 356seat threehouse regional parliament the second round was 
scheduled for runoffs 
the croatian communist party renamed the party for democratic 
reform won only 13 seats in the first round while the centrist 
coalition for national accord considered one of the preelection 
favorites won just three 
now every vote counts and i know croatians are aware that by 
voting for us thay are voting for peaceful life in the republic 
and in yugoslavia said ivica racan the republics communist 
leader who over the past six months has steered croatia to 
multiparty democracy 
yugoslavia is a loose federation of six republics and two 
autonomous provinces fraught with ethnic and ideological tensions 
croatia and slovenia are pushing for closer ties with the west 
and democratic reforms serbia meanwhile has a hardline 
communist leadership and along with montenegro continues to follow 
a oneparty system 
the centerright demos coalition which won last months free 
parliamentary elections in slovenia was expected monday to form 
the first noncommunist regional government in yugoslavia in more 
than 40 years 
in croatia the democratic unions leader franjo tudjman wants 
yugoslavias republics to become independent states and establish 
relations only if common interests were involved 
the reform communists are more cautious they say the national 
federation model is fine for now but if it fails to reflect the 
republics needs in the future yugoslavia should become a 
confederation without central rule 
the 66yearold tudjman once was the yugoslav armys youngest 
general but later spent almost five years in jail after being 
convicted of croatian nationalism and hostile activities against 
the state 
his bid for power has fueled the fierce rivalry that has existed 
between serbia and croatia ever since yugoslavia was created after 
world war i 
serbias media strongly influenced by the communists brand 
tudjman a secessionist and a fascist 
croatias 450000 serb minority which is haunted by memories of 
mass extermination in the croatian puppet state set up by nazi 
germany recently staged several antitudjman rallies serbs 
represent slightly more than 10 percent of the republics 46 
million population 
serbs in croatia say they would demand full autonomy for the 
regions where they live if tudjmans party wins the elections

candles and singing ancient hymns crowded into moscows epiphany 
cathedral sunday for the funeral of russian orthodox patriarch 
pimen

moscow and russia died thursday of heart failure after a long 
illness the 79yearold monk had presided over the church during 
years of repression keeping it cowed but alive 
many citizens returned to the church after president mikhail s 
gorbachev ordered an end to official harassment but the once iron 
control of the bearded orthodox priests over masses of simple 
peasants has disappeared after the decades of stalinist terror 
when tens of thousands of churches were closed and many clerics 
imprisoned 
thousands of believers crowded under the low vaulted ceiling of 
epiphany cathedral from friday night to sunday to pray for pimen 
he lay in state his face covered with a white satin cloth 
embroidered in silver beneath a towering wall of icons glittering 
with gilt and dark paintings of saints 
the holy synod the leadership of the russian church surrounded 
the bier during the funeral service immediately behind them stood 
several of mother theresas nuns who have been working in a moscow 
hospital and officials from other christian denominations 
roman catholic cardinal johannes willebrands of the netherlands 
representing the vatican world council of churches 
generalsecretary emilio castro and catholicospatriarch of georgia 
ilya ii were among the other dignitaries the official tass news 
agency said 
gorbachev and other soviet leaders sent messages of condolence 
outside the cathedral aged beggars pleaded with believers for 
change in the name of christ and the memory of pimen police 
controlled access to the cathedral but apparently allowed new 
arrivals in as others left 
the patriarchs body was buried sunday afternoon in the crypt of 
the assumption cathedral in the trinityst sergius monastery in 
zagorsk 45 miles from moscow

parliament in last years first multicandidate elections

sugar growers poured more than 33 million 
into congressional campaigns between 1983 and 1989 to keep us 
sugar prices artificially high a consumer group charged sunday 
us sugar support policies artificially keep the price of 
sugar so high that consumers have spent billions more than they 
should have said ellen haas executive director of public voice 
for food and health policy 
officials for the sugar industry acknowledge the campaign 
contributions but disputed the contention that consumers are paying 
too much for their product 
the program keeps prices stable said joe terrell spokesman 
for the american sugar alliance consumers in this country pay on 
average about what is paid in developed countries worldwide or 
less in some cases 
eiler ravnholt a representative for the hawaiian sugar 
planters said the average price of sugar at us grocery is 39 
cents a pound compared to 42 cents to 44 cents in the other 
developed countries 
we do have a definite interest in keeping the sugar program 
the way it is because it keeps prices stable said ravnholt 
whose organization represents growers in the second largest sugar 
cane producing state after florida 
public voice said contributions from 17 sugarproducer political 
action committees increased after the passage of the 1985 farm bill 
setting agriculture policy through 1990 
after the 1985 vote the group said the sugar pacs increased 
their contributions to members of congress supporting price support 
and quota programs by 75 percent lawmakers who opposed the 
programs saw their contributions from the sugar pacs fall by 42 
percent public voice said 
of course responded ravnholt 
i would have an awfully hard time justifying to my members 
paying money to members who voted against us he said i think 
every political action committee does the same 
critics contend that the system of price supports and quotas for 
sugar is among the most blatantly protectionist of any us farm 
programs because prices are controlled through imports it also is 
often a tool of foreign policy 
when the government wants to lower domestic sugar prices it 
allows more foreign sugar into the market many foreign suppliers 
are third world countries whose economies rise and all dramatically 
depending their access to the us market 
congress is still working on the 1990 farm bill that will set 
sugar policy for the next five years but a house agriculture 
subcommittee has approved a program that soon will be acted on by 
the full committee 
its key provisions would 
continue the requirement that the sugar program impose no 
direct cost to taxpayers 
maintain the current loan rate a price guarantee for growers 
at 18 cents a pound in 1991 with an annual escalation after then 
equal to the overall rate of consumer inflation minus 2 percent 
require that at least 125 million tons of sugar be imported 
create a new reexport program that would allow caribbean 
countries to sell raw sugar to us processors at a higher price 
than the world market would pay the processors then could sell the 
refined product to other countries 
extend the length of loans from 6 months to 9 months 
prohibit countries that sell sugar to cuba from selling to the 
united states 
mandate import quotas on specified products containing sugar

in a scene reminiscent of the movie its 
a wonderful life residents of a small town pitched in loans 
totaling 85000 in five days to enable the communitys only 
grocery store to reopen 
ray franzs store burned in 1988 he rebuilt it with money from 
his insurance company but ran out of money to restock and was 
turned down by several banks 
but thanks to his friends and customers in the upper michigan 
town franz will reopen his store tuesday 
we got to keep this town going said retired postmaster bill 
green cripes when your grocery store is gone youre dead 
the village population 600 has no movie theater or shopping 
mall 
franz said the community loan is overwhelming 
its incredible is what it is franz said i cant imagine 
this happening anywhere else 
donors were given promissory notes entitling them to a charge 
account at the store and a 7 percent discount on groceries that are 
charged when they have charged an amount of groceries equal to 
their loan plus 7 percent the loan is paid off 
after the december 1988 fire franz battled over insurance 
coverage and finally settled out of court but after paying 
attorney fees he had just enough money to rebuild the 
10000squarefoot franz market which hes owned since 1976 
franz 42 needed an additional 85000 for inventory but three 
banks turned him down 
i was depressed he said but i was too far along to walk 
away 
john lyman an onekama high school teacher and jack mosora a 
retired car salesman said they figured it was time to pay back 
franz he has been president of the village council chief of the 
volunteer fire department junior varsity football coach little 
league coach and a member of the rescue squad 
on april 23 they called residents asking for donations and 
within five days collected the money many checks were for 1000 
in the movie its a wonderful life townspeople pitch in to 
help save the failing savings and loan run by the character played 
by jimmy stewart 
john kline a retired engineer who lives just outside town 
jumped down from his tractor to write a check for 1000 one woman 
wrote a check on the hood of her car 
it just snowballed franz said its embarrassing that the 
community has that much confidence in us 
i love it here its the little things like when you drive 
down the street and wave because you know everyone he said 
several donors including the 72yearold green waved off any 
talk of promissory notes 
i didnt ask the details green said i didnt care about 
groceries i figure if there is some day down the road where he can 
cut the 1000 loose great otherwise forget it

droughtstricken areas of the west bracing for a summer of 
rationed water parched crops and forest fires now face another 
plague hordes of hungry beetles bees crickets and grasshoppers 
that love hot dry weather 
california in its fourth drought year just finished a winter 
rainy season that yielded only 55 percent of normal precipitation 
water supplies to central california farmers are being cut in half 
and drought cops patrol coastal cities citing scofflaws who 
defy lawnwatering bans 
its weather only a bark beetle could love 
the insects are thriving on droughtstressed trees across 
california last year they killed trees containing 2 billion board 
feet of timber and state department of forestry officials predict 
a similar toll this summer 
in drought conditions the trees dont produce the amount of 
pitch they usually do so when the beetles drill into the trees 
theyre more successful at getting in and laying their eggs said 
don perkins head of the forestry departments pest management 
program 
the eggs hatch into larvae which eat the trees from the inside 
out then develop into beetles that fly off and lay more eggs 
they can have three or four life cycles if you have a real 
warm dry spring and warm weather in the fall perkins said 
beetlekilled trees and tinderdry weather have made 
californias fire danger the worst in decades 
we have hundreds of thousands of large kindling stands said 
lisa boyd forestry department spokeswoman things are as dry 
right now as we would normally see in august and september 
its not beetles but bees that are annoying northern california 
tourist towns around lake tahoe where swarming yellow jackets last 
summer forced people from beaches and back porches 
even more bees are expected this summer prompting the south 
lake tahoe chamber of commerce to declare war the group is 
distributing 5000 bait traps filled with the insecticide diazinon 
populations of the groundnesting yellow jackets surge if hot 
dry weather occurs in spring when the queen bee is starting her 
nest said roger akre a washington state university entomologist 
by august a single queen can hatch out 5000 workers 
in northern nevada officials are battling mormon crickets 
which can grow to the size of mice by devouring vegetation bark 
and virtually anything else in their path 
theyre just absolutely voracious said akre theyre 
eatingmachines 
state officials hope to fend off the invasion nevadas largest 
since the 1930s by spreading poisonlaced bran and oil on eggs at 
the mouth of canyons the crickets hatch in the mountains then hop 
down into the valleys to feed 
east of the rocky mountains winter rains have put a green cast 
on much of the great plains but drought persists in north dakota 
where some farmers have not raised a crop in two years and anxious 
citizens hold rain dances and prayer meetings to plead for moisture 
so far all theyve got are grasshoppers lots of grasshoppers 
in eastern north dakota researchers last fall counted 1700 
grasshopper eggs per square yard compared with a normal count of 
200 said dean mcbride a north dakota state university 
entomologist

a chapel built by pioneers in thanks 
for deliverance from a grasshopper plague is being used more than a 
century later by parishioners praying to avert an infestation 
expected this year 
every time there was a crucial problem the people came 
together and prayed and it worked nancy wenner organizer of a 
series of nine prayer services that began last week said sunday 
why couldnt it work today 
roman catholic settlers in this central minnesota town built 
assumption chapel in 1877 as a memorial of thanks for relief from 
the swarms of grasshoppers that had devastated their crops for two 
years 
the original frame structure was destroyed by a tornado in 1894 
but the rebuilt granite chapel used only for special services is 
the focus of renewed prayers as the threat of another grasshopper 
invasion looms over the state 
a plaque above the door to the small chapel shows the virgin 
mary ascending into heaven above two grasshoppers their knees bent 
in submission 
wenner who runs a hardware store and funeral home with her 
husband in the town of 2000 said the entire community has 
suffered under three years of drought 
this is an agricultural area and its a real concern she 
said 
university of minnesota researchers say the drought cycle has 
fostered conditions favorable for a grasshopper infestation this 
year and egg counts have been reported at up to 10 times normal 
hatches usually begin in may and the winged insects do the most 
damage from the end of june through early july 
parishioners will gather at the grasshopper chapel as they 
refer to it on nine consecutive thursdays to recite the rosary 
celebrate mass with pastors of catholic churches in the area and 
pray for rain and relief from the expected infestation 
ken schefers a rural paynesville farmer who battled 
grasshoppers last year with chemicals thinks the services are a 
good idea 
its worked in the past he said last week theres no 
reason to think god has forgotten us what we survive on is hope 
and prayers most of the time 
relying on hope and prayers isnt new to minnesota farmers who 
have tried nearly everything in their battle against grasshoppers 
some resourceful settlers tried to protect their gardens with 
blankets in the 1870s but the insects soon chomped through them 
according to historical records hordes traveled miles each day and 
could devour entire wheat fields within hours 
they covered not only gardens and fields shrubs and trees 
but houses barns wagons and fences and were so thick at times on 
the railway track that their crushed bodies prevented the wheels 
from taking hold and trains were actually stopped according to 
an account in history of stearns county

is quite different from his book 
it was a best seller i must have done something right 
dunne said in the may 1218 issue of tv guide magazine 
dunne who also complained about the way his the two mrs 
grenvilles was reworked for television had no say in the script 
i sold it and i was paid handsomely he said 
dunnes 1988 novel was about a writer who moves in society 
circles 
the script changed the central character gus played by ben 
gazzara from an ironic observer to a conventional hero 
if i had wanted it that way i would have written it that 
way dunne said 
the network felt that gus should be a participant said the 
screenwriter kathleen a shelley a movie must have one person 
for the audience to sympathize with identify with and care about

president vaclav havel led 
czechoslovaks sunday in paying a belated tribute to us gis who 
helped liberate their nation from the nazis only to find their 
exploits erased later from stalinist history books 
havel spoke at the end of a weekend festival marking the 45th 
anniversary of this western bohemian citys liberation by gen 
george pattons us 3rd army 
scores of us veterans took part in the celebration and 
czechoslovak revelers drove restored world war ii jeeps and wore 
american army uniforms 
only a year ago such festivities would have been unimaginable 
under the countrys hardline communist rulers in power at the 
time the official position was that only the soviet red army 
liberated czechoslovakia in 1945 
but last novembers democratic upheaval ended four decades of 
communist rule 
finally the day has come when we can express our gratitude and 
thanks publicly to all those persecuted forgotten or erased from 
world history havel a playwright and former political prisoner 
told up to 40000 people who packed pilsens city square for 
liberation day celebrations 
many of them did not live to see this welldeserved 
recognition by our country 
it was the first time that the main czechoslovak observance of 
the end of world war ii was held in pilsen in past years the 
celebrations took place in prague the capital and highlighted 
only the soviet role in the countrys liberation 
it was a moving experience for the many elderly american 
veterans who took part many were making their first trip back 
they stole our hearts then and they are doing it again 
today said bobby capps of birmingham ala now retired to lake 
alfred fla who was a member of the 396th field artillery 
you cant describe how much love there is 
the holiday brought tens of thousands of people to pilsen from 
across western czechoslovakia to drink the famous pilsener beer 
eat sausages hear speeches and indulge in a festival of americana 
including country and western bands swing music and a us film 
festival featuring patton starring george c scott 
people pasted us and czechoslovak flags in the windows of 
their homes and flew the stars and stripes from car antennae 
this is a dream something genuinely unbelievable said 
czech singer pavel bobek who recalled visiting pilsen as a 
7yearold and seeing the us troops 
during a ceremony at city hall a plaque commemorating the us 
liberation was remounted it had been taken down by stalinist 
authorities at the height of the cold war in 1951 
all americans thank czechoslovakia for putting american 
soldiers back in their true place in history said us 
ambassador shirley temple black the former child film star 
today america once again stands shoulder to shoulder with 
you she told the crowd 
earlier havel spoke at a sunday morning ceremony in the small 
town of rokycany where a plaque was unveiled honoring the troops 
of the us 9th infantry regiment 2nd division who rolled into 
town in their jeeps on may 5 1945 
without the truth about the past we cannot live in truth 
today and we cannot truthfully enter a better future he told a 
cheering crowd of about 5000 people 
jarka heinzova who as a teenage student knew a little english 
and acted as an interpreter for the us troops recalled how they 
affectionately called her jerry 
they brought us liberty and saved our lives she said 
searching for words in her rusty english we never dont forget 
their arrival and what they did for us 
rokycany is near the demarcation line where us troops halted 
their eastward advance in the wars closing days as part of the 
controversial yalta conference agreement which allowed the red 
army to occupy much of eastern europe 
under the agreement us troops were prevented from pushing on 
to liberate prague just 50 miles away 
in 1949 the communists established full control and set up a 
sovietstyle state

the harbor pilot who was at the wheel of a 
freighter that rammed the sunshine skyway bridge a decade ago 
sending 35 motorists to their deaths now spends his days helping 
others cope with tragedy 
former capt john lerro is a crisis counselor helping prisoners 
mend their lives the despondent find hope and rape victims a way 
to forgive 
but he hasnt forgiven himself 
i dont always think about it said lerro 47 you cant 
live life like that thinking about your screwups im not sitting 
at home saying woe is me 
but have i forgiven myself for it i dont know im not very 
forgiving of people including myself the people who died died 
forever 
on may 9 1980 lerro was guiding the 609foot freighter summit 
venture through the narrow winding shipping channel of tampa bay 
when a sudden blinding squall knocked out the ships radar and 
eclipsed the bridge 
lerro was seventenths of a mile from the bridge and at a 
crucial turning point he decided to shoot for the 800foot 
hole the shipping passage beneath the bridge 
he missed 
the ship sheared a bridge support dropping a 1400foot section 
of concrete roadway during morning rush hour seven vehicles 
including a bus with 26 aboard plummeted 150 feet into the water 
one man survived after his pickup bounced off the ships bow 
i made the best decision i could you couldnt stop with the 
wind blowing 60 to 80 knots about 70 to 90 mph youd hit the 
bridge for sure lerro said you keep going at least youve 
got some control 
if it happened again today id do the same thing but ive 
had years to philosophize 
he had been at the pinnacle of his career he was qualified to 
guide vessels through the panama canal he was a deputy tampa bay 
harbor pilot an expert in maneuvering vessels through the tricky 
40mile stretch between the nations seventh busiest port and the 
gulf of mexico 
he had been scheduled for promotion to fullfledged pilot with a 
jump in pay from 45000 to 100000 two days after the accident 
the state took his license a month after the accident but he won 
it back only to surrender it 11 months later and end his career 
at sea when he developed multiple sclerosis 
then he and his wife of 21 years divorced 
your job is to transcend storms when youre a pilot he 
said i had to live with that with the loss of life i lost my 
health my identity as a pilot my job and my wife four years ago 
i hit bottom 
with encouragement from friends he went back to school and 
earned a masters degree in counseling from the university of south 
florida 
i was looking for a way to help myself said lerro i was 
told if you want to feel good make somebody else feel good it 
works no matter what their trouble ive been there 
for the past three years hes been a volunteer at the 
hillsborough county crisis center four hours a day two or three 
times a week 
to bring a smile to the face of someone really hurting touches 
the soul he said 
he lives with his son charles 24 he supports himself on 
disability and alimony 
ms has left him with a decided limp his gait is slow and 
strained and he tires easily but hes determined not to let it 
beat him 
a new bridge built at a cost of 250 million carries traffic 
across the bay the old one still stands alongside a gaping hole 
in its midsection a grim reminder of the tragedy 
you learn from everything that happens to you lerro said 
sure ive had a onetwothree punch but to complain about it 
would be a fourth punch i dont need that i dont think im at 
the basis of things yet i suspect thats spiritual maybe thats 
where the forgiveness is

a us business group has told japanese and 
american political leaders to stop blaming each other for trade 
friction and get down to solving their own problems at home 
the commission on usjapan relations for the 21st century 
including corporate chiefs whose firms have prospered in japan 
listed among domestic problems contributing to us competitive 
weakness the high federal budget deficit and the american emphasis 
on quick corporate profits 
the harsh rhetoric between the two countries is reaching 
intolerable levels and risks grave repercussions such as closing of 
the us market to japanese imports and a wave of retaliatory 
protectionism said a study issue last week by the commission 
the two countries should acknowledge that there is blame 
enough to go around get on with expanding the horizons of 
cooperation while working through the disputes that frustrate 
both said the report 
it predicted minimum immediate impact from current economic 
negotiations toward cutting the us trade deficit with japan 
currently 49 billion despite demands from congress 
rather than the two governments telling each other what is 
wrong and blaming each other for inaction they now need to 
undertake the changes that each pledged at last months washington 
session on structural barriers the commission continued 
besides protectionism and economic decline a breakdown of 
usjapanese cooperation could have serious political 
consequences said commission chairman edson w spencer former 
chief executive officer of honeywell corp chairman of the 
usjapan business council and board chairman of the ford 
foundation 
his group recommended talks to modernize the 40year usjapan 
security alliance by adding political and economic cooperation in 
third world development peacekeeping and environmental protection 
the national security council should add coordinating us economic 
policy toward japan and europe to its security duties it said 
the report targeted shortterm profit pressures of american 
business as a major culprit weakening us competitiveness 
to increase the domestic savings rate and reduce the cost of 
capital it is essential for the us to reduce the federal budget 
deficit to keep inflation low and to thus permit real interest 
rates to drop the commission said it suggested a hefty levy on 
shortterm gains if the capital gains tax is revised along with 
incentives to boost savings 
there appears however to be only one solution for 
lengthening the profit horizons of american business it added 
that is for corporate managers to ignore shortterm profit 
pressures and educate their shareholders to expect enhanced 
shareholder value in a longer term 
the commission called itself an american group that works for 
american interests sponsors include the usjapan business 
council the council on foreign relations and the japan society 
which administers its privately contributed funds from the 
usjapan foundation the pew charitable trusts the ford 
foundation the american express foundation the rockefeller 
brothers fund and smithkline beecham 
other members of the commission are university of tennessee 
president and former state gov lamar alexander former north 
carolina gov james b hunt jr national academy of sciences 
president frank press peter g peterson former secretary of 
commerce now chairman of the blackstone group and director of 3m

prime minister vp singh called sunday 
for a crackdown on indias increasingly violent separatist groups 
including punishment for people shouting provactive slogans 
more than 1000 people have been killed in the violence so far 
this year 
in a letter to the heads of indias 25 states singh blamed 
antiindia agencies from across the border in pakistan for the 
secessionist unrest which has claimed more than 1000 lives this 
year 
he said such groups have a sinister design to throw india 
into chaos 
singh demanded firm punishment for people who shout 
provocative slogans or religious cries or distribute handbills and 
posters that could incite others to violence 
state intelligence bureaus were ordered to increase their 
surveillance of suspicious elements and their activities 
according to a partial text of singhs letter carried by two indian 
news services 
meanwhile in jammukashmir state site of a violent moslem 
separatist movement eight people were kiled in clashes sunday 
official sources said 
security forces said they killed four moslem secessionists near 
indias border with pakistan official sources said 
in the troubled states summer capital srinagar moslem 
militants killed one man and wounded another who they accused of 
being police informers security forces said two more militants 
and a woman bystander were killed in other violence around the 
state police said 
the deaths brought to 349 the number of people slain in 
jammukashmir since jan 20 when india launched a crackdown on the 
separatist movement by moslems seeking to establish an independent 
state in the scenic kashmir valley 
police officials who spoke on condition of anonymity said they 
feared more violence on monday when government workers were to open 
their offices in srinagar for the summer season 
the winter capital of the mountainous region is jammu to the 
south 
posters lining the streets of srinagar warned government workers 
not to go to work one poster warned that those who came to work 
would suffer the consequences of a holy war 
during a curfew relaxation sunday militants and security forces 
exchanged gunfire there were no immediate reports of casualties 
the crisis in kashmir has heightened the traditional distrust 
and animosity between india and pakistan 
india accuses predominantly moslem pakistan of harboring and 
arming the separatists pakistan denies these allegations but says 
it supports kashmiri moslems right to selfdetermination 
the two countries went to war over kashmir in 1948 and 1965 
both nations have claimed kashmir since 1947 when british colonial 
rule ended and the two states were partitioned along religious 
lines the old princely state of kashmir had a moslem majority but 
its ruler was a hindu who opted to join india 
sixtyfour percent of jammukashmirs 6 million people are 
moslems but nationwide moslems make up only 12 percent of the 
population hindus comprise 82 percent of indias 880 million 
people 
in his letter singh also accused external agencies another 
apparent reference to pakistan of fomenting a separatist movement 
in punjab state just south of kashmir 
so far this year at least 746 people have been killed in 
violence sparked by a sikh nationalist movement in punjab indian 
news reports said 12 people died saturday in punjab and on friday 
sikh nationalists damaged a television tower with a rocket in the 
state 
police in new delhi also are investigating sikh involvement in 
three bomb blasts in the capital over the last three weeks that 
killed 11 people 
singh said the central government had reliable information that 
external agencies aiding and abetting terrorist and secessionist 
groups have instructed them to focus on violent acts 
he expressed concern that such groups might stir up clashes 
between hindus and moslems around the country 
government figures released in april said 607 people died in 
such religious clashes last year a 750 percent increase over the 
previous year those figures did not include deaths caused by the 
sikh kashmiri moslem and other separatist movements

us rep donald lukens fighting for 
reelection in this weeks primary under the cloud of a sexrelated 
conviction has been certified as delinquent by the ohio department 
of taxation a newspaper reported sunday 
the tax department certified a personal income tax delinquency 
of 1514 including penalty and interest against the ohio 
republican on april 18 the columbus dispatch said 
the ohio attorney generals office filed a lien april 27 with 
the butler county clerk of courts in hamilton for collection of the 
tax for 1988 the newspaper said 
in may 1989 lukens was convicted of contributing to the 
unruliness of a minor for having sex with a 16yearold columbus 
girl lukens was sentenced to 30 days in jail and fined 500 he is 
free on a 100000 bond while appealing the conviction a ruling on 
his appeal is expected within a month 
lukens faces three opponents in tuesdays gop primary he has 
been snubbed by the local gop but has refused repeated calls to 
resign his office and leave the race 
the dispatch said spokesmen for lukens at first denied the tax 
liability but later admitted that it existed when the newspaper 
asked for a copy of lukens 1988 state income tax return and a copy 
of any canceled check for payment 
i dont know what you are talking about bill jarrell 
lukens chief of staff first said when asked about the matter 
jarrell said lukens had an old tax liability at one time but said 
it was paid 
if lukens had a new tax liability he would have paid it off 
during a reelection campaign jarrell said 
its obvious were not going to let this sit out there he 
said 
buz lukens is catching up on all of his debts jarrell said 
he has paid off over 12000 of debts this sounds like a 
story that was planted by somebody 
david stitt treasurer of lukens campaign said he shares a 
house with lukens in middletown and we have not received any 
mailing no one has received anything about any tax lien 
but when the dispatch later asked jarrell to provide 
documentation he said lukens is aware that the taxes are there 
he has called that office the ohio department of taxation 
and told them to send him a bill he knows he owes that money 
jarrell said 
tax department spokesmen said delinquencies are not certified to 
the attorney generals office until attempts to collect the tax 
have failed spokesmen in the attorney generals office said liens 
are not filed with clerks of court until additional tax collection 
efforts are unsuccessful 
stitt said saturday that lukens has been waiting for a federal 
income tax refund of about 5000 based on an amended 1986 tax 
return so he could pay his state tax obligation 
his federal is overpaid and he was waiting for his refund to 
pay that the state stitt said we have never been notified 
of the exact amount owed the state 
buz has never reneged on a debt he will pay everybody off 
in formally announcing he was running for reelection last week 
lukens apologized for what he termed a dumb mistake 
also running for the gop nomination in lukens 8th district seat 
are former 8th district rep thomas kindness state rep john 
boehner and hamilton bond underwriter mort meier the nominee will 
be whoever gets the most votes regardless of whether he receives a 
majority there is no provision for a runoff

a former israeli army officer wanted by 
colombia on charges of training drug cartel gunmen denied sunday 
that he helped divert a shipment of israelimade weapons to a 
colombian drug lord 
colombian authorities discovered a cache of israelimade uzi 
machine guns and other weapons during a raid in february on a ranch 
owned by gonzalo rodriguez gacha who died in a gun battle with 
police in december 1989 
after the weapons were found colombia filed a strong diplomatic 
protest with israel israeli officials responded that the weapons 
were part of a shipment intended for the caribbean island nation of 
antigua and barbuda 
on sunday the israeli defense ministry issued a statement 
saying israel only sold weapons to sovereign nations and approved 
arms shipments only after receiving guarantees about their end use 
we have no information on how the weapons were passed to 
private hands in colombia the ministry statement said 
the new york times quoting american and antiguan officials 
said investigators have traced the arms shipment to two former 
israeli army officers yair klein and maurice sarfati 
the newspaper said sarfati an israeli citizen who used to live 
in southern florida could not be located for comment sarfati is 
being sought by us authorities because his produce company in 
antigua defaulted on 13 million in loans from the united states 
the times reported sunday 
israel tv reported saturday night that sarfati had provided a 
document to us and antiguan authorities linking klein to the 
diversion to colombia of 100 galil automatic rifles 100 uzi 
submachine guns and other guns 
a preliminary investigation by antiguan authorities has 
determined that the arms shipment passed through antigua a tiny 
island 250 miles southeast of puerto rico on april 24 1989 and 
arrived in colombia five days later 
but klein told the associated press in an interview sunday that 
the document reportedly provided by sarfati is forged and has no 
truth in it 
in august 1989 the colombian government accused klein and his 
hod hahanit security company of training gunmen for the medellin 
drug cartel headed by gacha and others klein contended he had 
been helping ranchers defend themselves against leftist insurgents 
klein said he has no idea how the arms ended up on gachas 
ranch where colombian police said they found 232 israelimade 
weapons including rifles shoulderfired rocket launchers and 
infrared nightscopes 
klein said the weapons shipped to antigua had been intended for 
a survival training camp being set up in the island nation for 
panamanian rebels seeking to overthrow gen manuel noriega 
when the boat was on the way the operation was canceled and 
the weapons were then stuck in antigua said klein a reserve 
army colonel who heads the hod hahanit private security firm in 
israel 
according to klein the antinoriega panamanians asked for a 
refund but were told their money had already been used to purchase 
the weapons the panamanians then asked that the weapons be sent to 
panama klein said 
the boat then left for panama and somehow it got to colombia 
or part of the weapons got to colombia said klein suggesting 
that some of the arms may have reached panama 
klein said sarfati became upset over the change in plans and may 
have given authorities a forged document bearing the emblem of 
kleins security firm 
the times said financing for the arms shipment was provided by 
the new york branch of the israeli bank hapoalim 
a bank spokesman in jerusalem speaking on condition of 
anonymity said the bank had no knowledge of klein or his firm 
we have no information about the transactions mentioned he 
said 
an israeli foreign ministry spokesman baruch bina reiterated 
sunday that israel would offer its full cooperation to antiguan 
authorities investigating the arms deal 
the times said a us senate investigations subcommittee is also 
looking into the antiguan affair as part of an inquiry into 
allegations that colombian drug traffickers have used israeli 
weapons and mercenaries 
bina said the israeli government approved the purchase based on 
an official document signed by the antiguan minister of 
national security or defense 
bina said the name of vere bird jr the minister of public 
works and national security adviser to his father prime minister 
vere c bird sr is on the november 1988 purchase order requesting 
the arms for the antiguan defense forces 
israel acted according to an official document signed by vere 
bird jr with the understanding that the weapons were for his use 
solely said bina 
in antigua the scandal has plunged the government into one of 
its worst crises since the 81yearold bird sr came to power in 
1956 bird jr has denied any wrongdoing and stepped down from his 
post until the matter is resolved 
the island nations government announced friday that a british 
jurist louis blomcooper would head the investigation into the 
israeli arms shipment 
bina said that klein had no connection to the government and 
therefore he could not respond to any accusations about his 
activity

a man who became a widower twice under 
similar circumstances is appealing his murder conviction in the 
second death arguing that the prosecutor failed to prove that the 
body found at the base of a cliff was his wifes 
dennis r larson is serving a 50year prison sentence in the 
killing of kathy frost larson 26 prosecutors says she died in an 
80foot plunge from otter cliffs in acadia national park on oct 
11 1987 four weeks after she married larson and just seven weeks 
after she met him 
larsons first wife leslee reynolds larson vanished in 1975 in 
montana larson told authorities that he was the only witness as 
she washed away in prickly pear creek some 50 miles south of 
larsons hometown of great falls he was never charged in that 
death 
one of the issues in larsons appeal was the move by a judge to 
allow the prosecution to reopen its case midway through the trial 
after larsons lawyer said that prosecutors had not proven the body 
in the 1987 death was really that of kathy frost larson 
assistant attorney general garry greene said the state will file 
a response to larsons appeal monday the maine supreme judicial 
court could hear oral arguments as soon as june 
miss frost met larson just seven weeks before her death through 
a personal ad in the bangor daily news three weeks after they met 
they were married even though miss frosts mother worried that her 
daughter was being pressured into the move 
larson immediately took out a life insurance policy for 300000 
on himself and 200000 on his bride with a double payment for 
accidental death 
mrs larsons fatal fall was initially explained by larson now 
40 as an accident that occurred as the couple were looking for sea 
otters after making a bet over who could spot one first larson 
said he heard a scream and found that his wife had tumbled over the 
edge 
friends and family were suspicious about larsons claim that his 
wife was walking along the cliffs because she was said to be 
terrified of heights 
maine state police also became increasingly suspicious when they 
learned about the disappreance of larsons first wife leslee 
reynolds larson 
her body was never found after the 1975 incident in montana 
seven years later she was declared dead and larson collected some 
20000 from an insurance policy larson married and divorced 
another woman before meeting miss frost 
after larson was questioned several times by police he changed 
his story and said that while he and his wife were on otter cliffs 
they got into a fight and she shoved him he shoved her back and 
she went tumbling off the edge he said 
larson was then charged with murder at the time montana 
authorities reopened their investigation into the first mrs 
larsons disappearance but found no new clues 
at a nonjury trial last spring in hancock county superior 
court justice jack o smith found larson guilty of murdering kathy 
frost larson in an attempt to collect 400000 from an insurance 
company 
but in his appeal defense attorney william ferm argues that 
larson got an unfair trial 
when the prosecution rested its case during the trial ferm 
immediately moved for an acquittal arguing that assistant attorney 
general jeffrey hjelm had failed to prove that the body at the foot 
of the cliffs was indeed kathy larson 
over objections from the defense the judge then allowed the 
prosecution to reopen its case and present more detailed evidence 
that the body was mrs larsons 
greene says the judge has the discretion for such action but 
ferm argues in his appeal that the additional evidence should not 
have been allowed 
larsons appeal also raises other questions including whether 
the state can prosecute a death in a federal park and whether the 
testimony of two other women who answered larsons personal ads 
should have been admitted 
testifying for the prosecution one woman had said that larson 
discussed marriage on the first date and the second woman said 
larson talked of settling down with her 
ferm is also challenging the admission of testimony from an old 
friend of larsons richard balhizer balhizer testified that 10 
years earlier during a hunting trip larson talked of someday 
marrying a foreign woman having an accident and collecting 
insurance money ferm said the testimony was too far removed from 
mrs larsons death and too prejudicial to larson

nina hyde who as the washington posts 
fashion editor shared wine with yves saint laurent her recipes 
with bill blass and her tears and pain with ralph lauren geoffrey 
beene calvin klein oscar de la renta and donna karan is dead at 
57 
but before she died they and other designers shared their 
pocketbooks in her honor the nina hyde center for breast cancer 
research was founded by lauren and his friends more than a year 
before she succumbed to the disease friday 
she had trooped the world with them the showrooms of paris and 
new york and tokyo and even beijing but nina solomon hyde had her 
own style 
she didnt own a pair of high heels wore a swatch watch picked 
up years ago at an airport novelty shop and sometimes would show 
up in the same outfit three times a week her wedding ring was 
usually her only jewelry 
clothes she once observed are important as another way 
of looking at ourselves they are as revealing as how we vote what 
we eat what we choose to see at the movies to me that is why 
writing about clothes is important 
to that end she tried to address herself to the general reader 
the one who doesnt know how to cope with all the choices out 
there the one who is stunned by the prices the one who is looking 
for some reality in the fashion business the one who is looking 
for some help 
in recent years she devoted her experience and energies to a 
more compelling concern of women detection and treatment of the 
disease which was to kill her 
in 1982 she said a mammogram was misread at a time when her 
chances for full recovery would have been 90 percent the mistake 
was not discovered for three years when her cancer had spread to 
more than a dozen lymph nodes 
when i was first told i threw a pen across the newsroom 
i decided to keep the problem to myself she once wrote now 
ive come to the point where i can talk about my cancer and i talk 
a lot 
her crusade prompted lauren a longtime friend who himself has 
recovered from a lifethreatening tumor removed from the lining of 
his brain to launch the research facility in her name at the 
georgetown university hospital sixteen other major designers 
kicked in as well

secretary of state james a baker iii 
sunday invited poland to participate in a sixnation meeting in 
paris to seek a guarantee of its western border from a united 
germany 
i thought it was important to try to come by baker said of 
his sixhour stopover in poland on his way back to washington 
in bonn on saturday the four victorious world war ii allies and 
two germanys decided to include poland in a july session of 
unification talks baker took it upon himself to convey the 
invitation 
baker said during his stopover that he gave polish leaders a 
complete report on the meeting in bonn germany which also 
included leading diplomats from the soviet union france and 
britain 
officials from the six nations agreed german unification should 
move forward without delay and indicated their countries should not 
try to impose restraints on what will be europes most powerful 
nation 
we had a very good discussion with the prime minister and i 
believe he is satisfied with the message baker said of polands 
tadeusz mazowiecki the east blocs first noncommunist prime 
minister 
poland has sought a role in the talks to press its security 
concerns especially the permanence of its postwar western border 
drawn along the oder and neisse rivers to include territory from 
defeated germany 
the rush toward german unification has raised concern in poland 
where the prospect of a resurgent economic and political power next 
door stirs memories of germanys world war ii aggression 
a senior us official traveling with baker said later its 
not just a pure border question its a fear that history might 
repeat itself and they want to do everything they can as the 
process unfolds to prevent that 
he said on condition of anonymity that polish leaders showed 
they were determined to secure polands border with germany in a 
binding treaty 
the poles and americans were in full understanding said 
wladyslaw klaczynski the polish foreign ministry spokesman 
poland would like to get a guarantee from the superpowers 
confirming the fact of the inviolability of the polish border 
the formula is not set yet but that demand was not questioned he 
said the point is the four superpowers should become an extra 
insurance of polish borders 
baker delivered a formal invitation signed by west german 
foreign minister hansdietrich genscher on behalf of the sixnation 
bonn meeting asking polish foreign minister krzysztof skubiszewski 
to address the july unification talks 
at the twoplusfour talks poland will be allowed to raise 
not only strictly border questions but also wider ones including 
the implications of germany unity for polands security 
mazowiecki said 
east germany has affirmed polands borders the west german 
parliament in march passed a resolution unequivocably confirming 
polands frontier and said a united germany should sign a treaty 
accepting the border 
but polish leaders have said there are procedural differences to 
resolve 
there is no controversy about the substance of the issue 
another senior us official said on condition of anonymity all 
of the parties that are involved agree on where that line is now 
and should be in the future the problem is how you go about 
establishing that 
the bonn meeting was the first toplevel session on unification 
among the germanys and the allies which split germany into two 
countries after world war ii other meetings will be held in june 
in berlin and in september in moscow 
on sunday west german chancellor helmut kohls said the first 
session produced a historic result for germany and europe 
there are no more obstacles to the realization of the right of 
selfdetermination of all germans kohl said in a statement 
after more than 40 years of painful separation the germans 
longing to be united in one state is being fulfilled he said 
but after the talks one obstacle to swift unification remained 
soviet opposition to a united germanys membership in nato 
on sunday lutz stavenhagen state minister in kohls office 
said it should be made clear to the soviets that the western 
alliance would change 
nato would make disarmament and arms control its priorities 
things that are very much in the soviet interest stavenhagen 
said 
in poland baker also met with president wojciech jaruzelski a 
former head of the nowdissolved communist party and solidarity 
leader lech walesa

world jewish congress president edgar m 
bronfman on sunday said a united germany should teach about its 
nazi past to avoid repeating the lowest point ever reached in 
mans inhumanity to man 
it was the congress first meeting on german soil since it was 
founded in switzerland in 1936 
early sunday rightwing militants fought with foreigners in 
street clashes in east berlin the official east german news agency 
adn said five people were injured and eight people were arrested 
there has been a rise in racist violence in east germany 
including rampages through restaurants and public squares by 
neonazi skinheads usually jobless youths with closeshaved heads 
shouting epithets against jews and foreigners 
in opening the threeday jewish conference bronfmann noted that 
tuesday may 8 will be the 45th anniversary of the defeat of 
nazism a victory for all mankind 
he also reminded the 500 delegates that berlin was the capital 
of the third reich the womb of hitler a satan whose name is 
associated forever with unspeakable horror 
it was at berlins wannsee villa in january 1942 that leading 
nazi officials plotted the third reichs socalled final solution 
to exterminate jews worldwide 
six million jews were killed by the nazis between january 1933 
and may 1945 along with hundreds of thousands of others 
pointing out that berlin may now become the capital of a united 
germany bronfman said inevitably the questions of forgiveness 
and of reconciliation arise 
reconciliation is possible if we speak the truth and the 
truth is that only the 6 million jews who were murdered can 
forgive he said 
speaking to west german chancellor helmut kohl and other 
officials present for the opening ceremony bronfman said the 
memory of nazi atrocities was painful for both sides 
yours because it is part of your history ours because it is 
the worst thing that ever happened to us it is the only real 
bridge between us the only road to reconciliation bronfman said 
he said the new generation of germans should not be blamed 
we do demand nonetheless an admission of collective 
responsibility the new germany must forever teach what happened 
so the lowest point ever reached in mans inhumanity to man can 
never occur again he said 
kohl invited to speak at the opening ceremony said the 
location and date of the conference gave it a special meaning 
the two german states are pushing for swift unification since east 
germanys communist government was toppled in a peaceful revolution 
last fall 
never may it be forgotten that the genocide of the european 
jews was prepared and directed by the national socialists under the 
violent leadership from berlin kohl said referring to the nazis 
he said it remains the duty of all democratic powers also 
those in a united germany to fight without compromise against 
those who secretly or openly spread prejudice against the jews 
or their religion 
he said a united germany will continue to pursue a close and 
honest relationship with israel 
however kohl said that for decades east germanys communist 
leaders denied responsibility for the holocaust leaving it to west 
germany to shoulder the blame he said that it would now be the 
task of school officials in east germany to deal truthfully in 
teaching about germanys past 
also attending the meeting were former east german communist 
premier hans modrow and gregor gysi head of east germanys 
reformed communist party

jurors never doubted richard j brennekes 
claim of cia connections or his story about reaganbush campaign 
officials trying to get iran to delay the release of us hostages 
until after the 1980 election the jury foreman says 
we all came away extremely comfortable with the verdict and 
extremely convinced that mr brenneke was not guilty of any of the 
charges said foreman mark kristoff of beaverton 
brenneke a shadowy figure who has claimed involvement in the 
irancontra affair was indicted on five counts of lying to a 
federal judge in denver in 1988 at the time he was appearing as a 
character witness for heinrich rupp a denver gold dealer convicted 
of bank fraud 
brenneke was charged with making false declarations a charge 
slightly stronger than perjury about his and rupps alleged cia 
connections and about the alleged hostage delay and the key 
officials involved 
the jury returned its verdict clearing brenneke after five hours 
of deliberation friday the votes were unanimous in each of the 
five rounds of secret balloting said kristoff 
there never was a guilty vote kristoff said saturday 
in numerous media interviews brenneke has said he had 
firsthand knowledge about the irancontra arms deals called 
before a senate subcommittee on narcotics and international 
relations in 1988 brenneke claimed to have run drugs from colombia 
to the us as part of a contra supply operation he also testified 
to having purchased arms in czechoslovakia for the nicaraguan 
rebels that testimony was called slanderous by thenvice 
president bush and a 1989 senate committee report concluded that 
brenneke never had the central intelligence agency connections he 
claimed 
in the testimony in denver that led to his trial brenneke said 
he had met rupp in 1957 when they worked together for air america 
the cia proprietary airline in october 1980 brenneke told the 
judge he and rupp helped to arrange a series of meetings in paris 
concerning the 52 americans taken hostage by iranian militants in 
the us embassy in tehran 
brenneke told the judge that rupp had flown george bush then 
the republican vice presidential candidate to the secret meetings 
at his trial last week however brenneke testified he did not 
actually see bush in paris 
he claimed that the negotiations were attended by the late cia 
director william casey then head of ronald reagans campaign and 
donald p gregg who at the time was a cia agent and is now us 
ambassador to south korea 
during brennekes trial gregg testified he was at the delaware 
seashore the weekend brenneke said the meetings took place and 
produced snapshots to prove it a retired meteorologist popped up 
among the defense witnesses saying he had consulted 1980 weather 
maps and found greggs photographs could not have been taken on the 
weekend in question 
another defense witness former national security adviser 
richard v allen acknowledged there was concern among the reagan 
camp about the possibility that a hostage release just before the 
election could mean a win for carter but allen also said he did 
not attend any meeting in paris 
in the end the 52 hostages seized nov 4 1979 were not 
released until jan 20 1981 the day reagan was sworn into office 
during deliberations kristoff said the jury did not consider 
whether delaying the hostage release might have sabotaged president 
carters reelection effort 
we kept it simple said kristoff an inventory control 
auditor for a sportswear manufacturer we didnt want to get 
involved in the presidential election that wasnt what we were 
trying 
although the jury did not discuss whether the paris meetings 
actually took place kristoff said my feeling is that there was 
a meeting whether those particular people were involved is 
something i cant say 
in his closing arguments friday assistant us attorney thomas 
m orourke portrayed brenneke as a rejected cia job applicant who 
operated on the fringes trying to make arms deals trying to 
get into intelligence gathering but never getting involved in the 
real thing 
defense lawyers tried to show the government had buried evidence 
of brennekes work for the cia 
after the verdict defense lawyer michael scott said the jurys 
finding does not mean that bush was actually in paris meeting with 
iranians before the election the verdict scott said means the 
jury did not find my client guilty 
former cia agent frank snepp who in 1977 tried to publish a 
book criticizing intelligence operations in vietnam but was blocked 
by the courts testified that the the agency used front 
organizations to conceal government involvement in certain 
operations 
kristoff said such testimony was key in the jury deliberations 
the main thing we kept coming back to was the term 
deniability said kristoff

one arm of the unpredictable lava flow 
that encircles this coastal town stalled sunday as molten rock 
pooled in a low spot just short of its expected plunge into the sea 
another branch of the flow remained active moving at up to 30 
feet per hour near a church and store said bruce butts deputy 
administrator for hawaii county civil defense 
kalapana a tiny country town that boasts just one store was 
sealed off its residents gone because scientists are certain that 
lava from kilauea volcano will overrun whats left of the community 
sometime soon 
one arm of the flow pooled at the base of sand dunes near harry 
k brown state park butts said it was just a matter of time he 
said until enough lava amassed to spill over the sand and ooze 
into the ocean 
the kalapana mauna kea congregational church and kalapana store 
and drivein were standing sunday although butts said the flow was 
active to the west and north of the structures and threatening 
both the towns other church has been moved out of harms way 
the sevenyear eruption had destroyed 136 homes in kalapana and 
elswhere on the volcanos flank 60 of them since april 4 in 
requesting a federal disaster declaration for hawaii island on 
saturday gov john waihee said damage totals 61 million 
residents and reporters were ordered out of the park area 
saturday night and civil defense had to move its command post from 
there to a papaya grove on higher ground butts said 
the area was sealed off because unstable winds were blowing 
noxious gases from burning asphalt lava also was burning trees in 
the area and setting off explosions of methane gas in the ground 
butts said 
officials were concerned about a possible health threat when the 
hot lava reaches the oceans salt water and produces steam clouds 
known as laze that contain hydrochloric acid and other potentially 
hazardous chemicals 
our main concern is the trade winds butts said as long 
as there are trade winds the laze will be blown away

philippine investigators said sunday 
they had no firm evidence linking communist rebels to the slaying 
of us marine and were considering other motives for the killing 
near the subic bay naval base 
gunnery sgt john fredette 34 of la buena calif was fatally 
wounded late friday on a darkened street in olongapo the garrison 
town near the usrun subic bay base 50 miles west of manila 
the killing led us officials to cancel all offpost leaves and 
ban nonessential travel for the 40000 troops defense department 
civilian employees and dependents at the six us bases in the 
philippines 
in manila a spokesman for president corazon aquino expressed 
the governments regret over the slaying and pledged that the 
filipino military would take all necessary steps to protect 
americans 
we grieve with the family of sgt fredette said deputy 
presidential press secretary horacio paredes the military 
authorities are taking whatever measures are necessary to assure 
the safety of american personnel in the bases 
fredettes slaying follows a warning issued earlier this month 
by philippine officials that the marxist new peoples army was 
planning to kill an american before the may 14 start of talks on 
extending the lease for the six us bases 
mrs aquino has refused to say whether she supports extending 
the lease which expires in 1991 leftists have called the bases an 
infringement on filipino sovereignty 
no one has claimed responsibility for fredettes killing but 
olongapo police said on saturday that they suspected communist 
rebels fredettes watch and wallet were not taken by the 
assailants police said 
but on sunday brig gen gerardo flores chief of staff of the 
national police said there was no firm evidence that new peoples 
army guerrillas were responsible for the slaying 
the theory that sgt fredette was killed by the new peoples 
army is still inconclusive flores told reporters our 
investigators are zeroing in on other angles 
flores added that fredette who had been in the philippines 
about a week on temporary assignment from el toro calif was shot 
with a 38caliber pistol while urban guerrillas normally use 
45caliber weapons in their attacks 
on sunday the olongapo police were offering alternative 
theories 
police said they were investigating a possibility that the 
killing may have been drugrelated because fredette had been seen 
hours earlier talking with some filipinos who appeared to be high 
on drugs 
another theory was that the killers may have confused fredette 
for another american who lived near the scene of the shooting 
police said 
although police had questioned about 100 people an investigator 
said there were still no firm leads 
all we get are negative results but troop operations are 
continuing said police sgt elmer de loen we are really 
having a hard time 
the slaying and restrictions on offbase travel have hurt 
businesses catering to us personnel near the bases 
sources in olongapo requesting anonymity suggested that police 
might be facing political pressure to avoid linking the slaying to 
the rebels so that the us military will lift the restrictions 
which threaten the local economy 
if the rebels were responsible fredette would be the sixth 
american slain by npa guerrillas since april 1989 when army col 
james nick rowe was assassinated in suburban quezon city 
the first attack by communist rebels on american troops was in 
april 1974 when three navy officers were killed on the edge of the 
subic base

african national congress leader 
nelson mandela said sunday that blackwhite negotiations cannot 
succeed until the government abandons its insistence on special 
privileges and protections for whites 
mandela addressing a mostly black crowd of 50000 at a soccer 
stadium said last weeks groundbreaking talks between his african 
national congress and the whiteled government were successful 
but he said the governments demand of special group rights 
for whites and other minorities is unacceptable to the anc the 
countrys most powerful opposition group 
we do not want discussions that have started so well to be 
determined by any solution which is based on race mandela said 
any form of racialism is a formula for disaster 
president fw de klerk has repeatedly said he wants to 
dismantle the countrys apartheid policies of racial segregation 
and negotiate a new constitution that includes the countrys black 
majority 
he has said however that a oneperson onevote system would 
lead the 28 million blacks to dominate the countrys 5 million 
whites and other minorities de klerk has said he envisions some 
mechanism that would give whites veto power on major policy 
decisions 
mandela said he wants to meet de klerk before the two sides hold 
further talks and will urge him to abandon the idea of special 
rights for whites 
the fact that mr de klerk wants to bring this concept to the 
negotiating table means that white south africa does not yet trust 
us mandela said 
our duty both as black and white leadership is now to go all 
out into the country and talk to our people not in terms of black 
and white but in terms of south africans mandela added 
the crowd of 50000 on this warm sunny day was significantly 
smaller than recent anc rallies at the same soccer city stadium on 
the edge of soweto the huge black township outside johannesburg 
when mandela appeared at soccer city in february two days after 
his release from prison more than 100000 people turned out when 
walter sisulu and several other anc leaders appeared in october 
shortly after their release from prison more than 70000 attended 
mandela said some members of the press are going to say that 
this rally was not as big as expected because blacks in this 
country are not in favor of negotiations but he added there 
is no doubt that our people are fully behind these negotiations 
smaller more militant black groups such as the pan africanist 
congress and the azanian peoples organization oppose negotiations 
with the government and have accused the anc of selling out 
they say they are only willing to negotiate the direct transfer of 
power from whites to blacks

pope john paul ii on sunday urged the three 
baltic republics of lithuania latvia and estonia to negotiate with 
moscow in their effort to gain independence from the soviet union 
john paul said the rights of the republics must be balanced 
against the damage that soviet president mikhail s gorbachevs 
policies of economic and political liberalization could suffer 
things must be resolved by a dialogue but by an effective 
dialogue the pontiff told reporters in a news conference on his 
flight from rome to mexico one cannot go beyond this at this 
time 
on friday latvia followed lithuania and estonia in declaring 
independence from the soviet union 
leaders of overwhelmingly roman catholic lithuania have been 
appealing for international support for their break with moscow 
john paul said the rights of the baltic nations were violated by 
the 1939 pact between the soviet union and nazi germany that 
resulted in soviet domination of the formerly independent lands 
on the other hand naturally there is an international order 
in this case even the order of soviet perestroika which takes 
into account the whole dimension of an immense country which is 
made up of many peoples said the pope who was born in poland 
but certainly perestroika must open itself to and i think it 
already has opened itself to this aspiration of the peoples that 
make up the soviet union perestroika is the catchword for 
gorbachevs reform program 
gorbachev has called on the baltic states to withdraw their 
declarations of independence and follow a lengthy constitutional 
path if they want to secede 
he has imposed a partial economic embargo on lithuania in order 
to make his point estonia and latvia have taken a more gradual 
approach in their quest for independence and have so far escaped 
economic penalties from moscow 
john paul met gorbachev in december and diplomatic ties between 
moscow and the holy see were established three months later

a group of third world countries in the 
international monetary fund on sunday said an expected agreement on 
60 billion in contributions to the fund should not be linked to 
plans that would require 11 developing countries to make their loan 
payments current or lose their voting rights 
the proposal for suspension of voting and representation 
rights of those members will not serve a useful purpose and is not 
acceptable said the group of 24 third world nations 
the group known as g24 includes cabinet ministers and heads 
of central banks sayyed mohammad hossein head of irans central 
bank is chairman of the group 
after a closed session the group issued a statement addressing 
recent usbacked recommendations to link the increased 
contribution to making 11 delinquent countries pay 43 billion 
dollars in arrears they owe the fund 
it also has been proposed that to get the delinquents to pay up 
the fund could suspend their right to vote 
iran is not among the 11 countries in arrears 
the g24 statement came as treasury secretary nicholas f brady 
met with finance ministers from japan west germany britain 
france italy and canada they were trying to reach agreement on 
the exact amount of new imf contributions and other fund business 
including what to do about the arrears 
on thursday a senior treasury official supported a 
carrotandstick approach that would offer help from a special 
program to countries in arrears if they agree to new policies 
designed to put them in better shape to pay up 
under the proposal the imf would suspend the countries rights 
to vote in the fund until they made the payments imf voting rights 
correspond roughly to a governments contributions known as quotas 
the us contribution to the 60 billion in increased quotas 
would be about 12 billion that would not change us voting 
rights since other imf members also would contribute the united 
states has the largest single voting power just short of 20 
percent 
however the g24 would have enough votes just over 15 percent 
to block an agreement 
at a news conference presenting the statement adeli declined to 
say whether g24 members would vote against the 60 billion quota 
increase if it is linked to the arrears plan 
he added that the group did not want to delay the agreement on 
the increased quotas 
if this is taken up in the interim committee the developing 
countries would discuss it and hope to reach an agreement he 
said 
the 11 delinquent countries are sudan zambia peru guayana 
honduras cambodia liberia panama sierra leone somalia and 
vietnam

marine reserves in arkansas for weekend training at camp 
robinson joined national guardsmen and civilian volunteers in 
completing sandbagging before dawn sunday around 25 homes in 
lowlying sections of north little rock 
were going to be in fairly good shape today unless the sand 
walls that weve made dont hold said city spokesman joe smith 
the waters there but we were able to prepare well enough to keep 
the water off of the neighborhoods we think were keeping our 
fingers crossed 
emergency personnel in two communities elsewhere in arkansas 
also requested guardsman to help with sandbagging said gary talley 
of the state office of emergency services

lake was expected to crest monday at about 645 feet or 5 feet 
above the overflow spillways 
mobile homes around the lakeshore were inundated and oklahomas 
marshall county had only one road leading to the outside because of 
high water from arms of the reservoir 
despite warnings of submerged power lines floating propane 
tanks trees docks and other obstacles many sightseers toured the 
lake by boat officials said wakes from the boats were blamed for 
destabilizing some submerged structures said marshall county civil 
defense director john martin 
in texas water from the trinity river still stood several feet 
deep sunday in the rochester park area southeast of downtown 
dallas as residents spent a fourth day waiting for the water to 
recede flood stage is 30 feet and sunday the trinity stood at 438 
feet in dallas 
rochester park resident alester crumbley said this is the third 
time in a year his home has been flooded he moved back into his 
home only two weeks ago after spending 11000 and several months 
rebuilding from two floods last year he said 
flooding continued in several rural counties along the trinity 
south of dallas as the record high water washed out levees 
at trinidad about 60 miles southeast of dallas the trinity was 
475 feet deep sunday far above the 28foot flood stage

evacuated from their homes the last couple of days and as far as i 
know water is still in their homes said a dispatcher from the

when a judge ruled in favor of martin gaffney in 
his aids lawsuit against the us government the marine warrant 
officer didnt do much celebrating 
instead he left the south weymouth naval air station where he 
is a computer specialist and drove to nantasket beach there he 
found a deserted strip of sand to walk along and think 
i just kind of turned to the ocean and breathed a sigh of 
relief said gaffney 40 whose legal battle ended april 26 when 
a judge ruled that negligence by navy doctors in 1981 led to 
gaffneys wife contracting the aids virus through a blood 
transfusion she died in 1987 
gaffney also lost a 13monthold son to the disease and has 
tested positive for the human immunodeficiency virus that causes 
aids although he shows no symptoms 
along with relief he feels rage he said 
the veteran officers loyalty toward the military soured after 
he sued the government gaffney a chief warrant officer is still 
bitter about fbi investigations into his background and what he 
says has been rudeness and betrayal on the part of navy officials 
at first i was pretty angry he said i felt disgust that 
it had taken four years to get to this point then i just wished 
mutsuko would have been here to share it 
the familys ordeal began in 1981 when gaffneys japaneseborn 
wife mutsuko entered the long beach naval hospital to have a baby 
gaffneys suit claimed navy doctors botched his wifes pregnancy 
by failing to perform a caesarean section when mrs gaffney was two 
weeks late in delivering the baby the baby a boy was eventually 
stillborn and mrs gaffney required a blood transfusion the blood 
she was given was contaminated with the aids virus 
if a caesarean had been performed in time the judge said a 
blood transfusion would not have been necessary 
mrs gaffney 38 died a year before gaffney filed the 55 
million suit in us district court in boston the couples son 
john died of aids in 1986 
a second trial has been ordered to determine the amount of 
damages the case is expected to encourage others who believe they 
contracted the aids virus through medical malpractice to sue a 
date for the trial has not been set 
only 6yearold maureene gaffney has escaped infection it was 
the uncertainty over her future that led gaffney to sue 
i feel confident that maureene will be taken care of said 
gaffney who has made plans for his daughter to live with his 
brothers family in lowell if necessary 
for now gaffney lives with his daughter in base housing when 
they moved there base officials barred her from the day care 
center until sen edward m kennedy intervened on maureenes behalf 
maureene was admitted recently to a prestigious private school 
over 11 other applicants gaffney said she sees a therapist 
regularly to cope with the loss of her mother and brother he said 
she is aware that her father is infected with the virus although 
they dont discuss it 
gaffney said that he has been too busy with mundane things 
and the lawsuit since he was diagnosed hiv positive to think much 
about his own future 
im ready for whats going to happen as far as my own health 
going downhill and im ready to prepare for it he said i 
wanted justice before i left the world and before i started to 
deteriorate 
although his doctors recommended he take the drug azt which can 
slow the progress of the virus gaffney has so far refused it as 
long as he is healthy he said i see no reason to take 
medication 
gaffney said that he used to feel so sad and bitter that he only 
wanted to live long enough to hear a verdict in his favor but now 
hes changed his mind 
if i was given a choice of going to wherever you go and being 
with my wife and sons or staying with my daughter id stay here 
with her he said

the centrist national unity party 
appeared headed for victory in parliamentary elections sunday in 
the breakaway state of northern cyprus 
the parliamentary elections could have led to a change of power 
for the first time since turkeys 1974 invasion divided this island 
into ethnic greek and turkish sectors 
but by sunday evening with 80 percent of the votes counted the 
national unity party which backs longtime turkish cypriot leader 
rauf denktash had a strong lead garnering 54 percent of the votes 
an opposition coalition the national struggle party was taking 
44 percent of the votes and the remaining 2 percent was shared by 
the new cyprus party and the independents 
the coalition was seeking to unseat the national unity party 
founded by denktash and in power for 15 years analysts had said 
said such a shift would help revive stalled peace talks aimed at 
reuniting the breakaway turkish republic of north cyprus with the 
greek cypriots 
the 100000 registered voters on sunday chose among candidates 
for the 50seat parliament the winners will serve fiveyear terms 
turkish cypriots declared independence in november 1983 the 
state is recognized only by turkey which keeps an estimated 30000 
troops in the northern sector 
in a presidential election two weeks ago voters in the 
breakaway republic gave denktash a fourth term he took 67 percent 
of the vote 
the opposition had accused denktash of intransigence in 
reunification talks raising hopes on the greek cypriot side that 
an opposition victory would lead to concessions 
the campaign was marred by unprecedented violence party 
activists engaged in fistfights damaged cars and hung their own 
posters over rival party ones 
the opposition coalition comprises the conservative new birth 
party mainly supported by settlers from turkey the leftist 
socialist liberation and republican turkish parties 
the coalitions combined vote in previous elections five years 
ago was 61 percent but the divided vote gave them only a minority 
of seats in parliament the national unity party captured 28 seats 
with 36 percent of the vote under an election system that favors 
the largest party 
the opposition has also accused the governing party of 
corruption misuse of economic resources and partisanship 
especially in the appointment of civil servants

latvian politicians said sunday they were 
steeling themselves for strikes protests and an economic blockade 
now that the kremlin has reportedly rejected their declaration of 
independence 
the baltic republics president meanwhile appealed for the 
kremlin to open talks on independence instead of just threatening 
with blockades 
the televised address came a day after latvias communist party 
chief alfreds rubiks quoted soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
as telling him he could not accept latvias secession and may 
impose sanctions 
we understand the situation in latvia will be very tough even 
critical this summer said peteris lakis one of the leaders of 
the latvian peoples front which engineered fridays declaration 
also sunday pope john paul ii urged the three baltic republics 
lithuania latvia and estonia to negotiate with moscow in their 
efforts to gain independence 
the polishborn pope said the rights of the republics must be 
balanced against the damage that gorbachevs policies of economic 
and political liberalization could suffer 
things must be resolved by a dialogue but by an effective 
dialogue the pope told reporters on a flight from rome to 
mexico one cannot go beyond this at this time 
anatoly alexeyev head of the interfront movement of nonlatvian 
residents predicted the soviets would start an economic blockade 
soon 
alexeyev a prominent opponent of secession said a labor group 
representing about 140000 workers has called a general strike for 
may 15 to protest the declaration of independence 
neighboring lithuania declared independence march 11 and 
gorbachev responded by sending soviet troops to seize some 
buildings and by imposing economic sanctions including an oil and 
natural gas embargo 
last month estonia announced its intention to secede but stopped 
short of declaring independence and set no date for leaving the 
soviet union the kremlin has imposed no sanctions on estonia 
the soviet union forcibly annexed the baltic republics in 1940 
they began campaigning for independence shortly after gorbachev 
began his reforms and he has offered them a greater say in 
economic and political decisions but not secession itself 
of latvias 26 million residents 53 percent are ethnic 
latvians and 33 percent ethnic russians many of the nonlatvians 
especially russians oppose secession 
this was a step into the dark alexeyev said nobody knows 
where we are going alexeyev a russian said his family has been 
living in what is now latvia for 200 years 
the televised address by anatoly gorbunov latvias president 
appeared designed to reassure latvians as well as carry a message 
to the kremlin 
lets begin by hearing out others opinions and comparing 
arguments and not just threatening with blockades and clinging to 
the old gorbunov said 
as he left the latvian tv studio where he taped the address 
sunday gorbunov said he had not been in contact with gorbachev 
ill call him tomorrow and present once more the essence of 
our declaration and our future intentions he said 
asked about rubiks report of gorbachevs hardline stance 
gorbunov said the account was only the opinion of one party and 
on the official level there has been no statement yet 
thousands of antiindependence protesters plan to gather 
wednesday during the celebration of victory day the defeat of nazi 
germany in world war ii said viktors alksnis a member of 
parliament who opposed the declaration 
he said he had expected gorbachevs tough reaction after 
latvias supreme soviet parliament voted for independence instead 
of considering the kremlins offer of special status in a 
revamped soviet federation 
no selfrespecting government will hold talks with rebels 
alexeyev said in an interview our politicians decided to beat 
their fists on the table first and then try to talk 
but lakis said he suspected rubiks may have exaggerated the 
harshness of gorbachevs stand and that he believed the kremlin 
would open talks within several months 
opponents of independence painted a darker picture of what to 
expect 
unfortunately it seems hard times are awaiting us alksnis 
told 200 people who held an impromptu rally sunday at rigas 
military stadium after a show of handtohand combat parachuting 
and pyrotechnics dedicated to victory day 
alksnis said he believes that economic sanctions on latvia had 
already begun in practice because in recent months some soviet 
factories had broken contracts and stopped supplying their latvian 
partners

chancellor helmut kohl praising 
the results of an international conference on germanys future 
said sunday nothing more stood in the way of german unity after 
more than 40 years of painful separation 
at saturdays conference in bonn the four victorious world war 
ii allies agreed that unification should go forward without delay 
it was the first toplevel unification session among the 
germanys and the allies the united states soviet union britain 
and france which split germany into two countries after world war 
ii 
the conference kohl said in a statement produced a historic 
result for germany and europe 
there are no more obstacles to the realization of the right of 
selfdetermination of all germans he said after more than 40 
years of painful separation the germans longing to be united in 
one state is being fulfilled 
soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze meanwhile hailed a 
new era 
the cold war is over our planet the world europe are now 
embarking on a new road he said 
shevardnadze secretary of state james a baker iii and 
counterparts from britain france and the two german states took 
part in the nearly sevenhour talks 
the sides agreed on several issues including a timetable for 
future meetings and the inclusion of poland in some of the talks 
soviet objections to nato membership by a united germany remained 
the main stumbling block 
west germanys foreign minister hansdietrich genscher said 
the meeting cleared the way for quick german unification and left 
it up to the germans to determine the pace of the process 
in an interview with the zdf television network genscher 
referred to a statement in which shevardnadze was quoted as saying 
the settlements of interior and foreign aspects of german unity 
do not necessarily have to come at the same time 
the statement translated by the west german foreign ministry 
reflected a significant shift in the soviet position because it 
separated the problem of nato membership from other aspects of the 
unification process ministry officials said 
it was a surprising formulation thats making our life 
easier said one bonn diplomat who asked not to be named 
genscher said shevardnadzes clear distinction of interior and 
foreign aspects of german unity reaffirmed the right of the 
germans to alone decide the time of unification 
this requires from the two german states which now hold 
unification in their hands a high degree of responsibility 
genscher said 
the six foreign ministers at the conference dubbed the 
twoplusfour talks announced a timetable for further meetings 
with a session in june in east berlin in july in paris and in 
september in moscow 
the soviets have called for a neutral germany 
the soviet news agency tass said the kremlin opposed german 
membership in the north atlantic treaty organization because it 
would touch on soviet security interests and disrupt the 
balance of forces in europe 
east germany has long served as a buffer between the east and 
west blocs the soviet union has and estimated 380000 troops in 
east germany while the united states has about 250000 soldiers in 
west germany

a fire set by inmates swept 
through a prison near the city of la plata killing 33 prisoners 
and injuring 12 officials said sunday 
the blaze saturday night began when prisoners piled mattresses 
and furniture against a cell block entrance and set the material on 
fire to prevent guards from entering to break up a fight between 
two inmates one of whom had struck a guard prison warden julio 
barroso said 
the two inmates who were not identified had argued over who 
was the most macho and one attempting to prove his 
superiority had called a guard and hit him prison authorities 
said 
the fire blocked the only entrance to the fifthfloor minimum 
security block and filled the area with flames and thick smoke 
before prison officials and firefighters were able to break through 
and extinguish the blaze barroso said 
officials said 33 prisoners in the 3000inmate lisandro olmos 
federal prison died of burns and suffocation and 12 were 
hospitalized two in serious condition

newsday columnist jimmy breslin has apologized 
for his racist expletivefilled newsroom tirade against a reporter 
of korean descent who criticized his column the newspaper said 
sunday 
but breslins apology sent to newsday staffers on friday as an 
internal computer message failed to quell the brouhaha over his 
remarks 
on sunday asianamerican groups called for his resignation for 
the outburst against staff reporter jiyeon mary yuh 25 who had 
sent him an internal computer message calling his may 3 column 
sexist 
in an obscenitylaced newsroom tirade breslin called yuh 
slanteyed 
shes a yellow cur lets make it racial breslin said 
his remarks made outside the presence of yuh were reported by 
the daily news and in a letter of complaint to newsday managers 
from members of the papers staff 
the 61yearold pulitzer prize winners apology said in part 
to the people i work with i am no good and once again i can 
prove it i am sorry i said things i shouldnt have said the 
racial and sexual insults i spewed are never appropriate 
but helen zia president of the new york chapter of the 
asianamerican journalists association said the apology was very 
flip 
zias group joined the coalition against antiasian violence and 
the organization of asian women in demanding that breslin resign or 
be fired and that he make a formal public apology to yuh 
the columnists apology to the staff came after an internal 
systemwide computer reprimand from editor don forst who called 
breslins racist and sexist comments offensive and inexcusable 
and protests by the papers staff some of whom heard his 
outburst 
this is the worst case of racism i have encountered yuh a 
native of chicago who lives in jersey city nj said sunday 
yuh who reports for newsday from queens says she has never met 
breslin and has never communicated with him before her message 
thursday also sent to forst and another editor which criticized 
breslins portrayal of the role of women in thursdays column 
breslin said he hated what he called official women 
including his wife city councilwoman ronnie eldrdige who he said 
devoted too much of her time to official duties and not enough to 
the home 
yuh messaged breslin that his column was spewing sexism 
according to a letter to newsday editor anthony marro written 
by reporter jessie mangaliman and signed by 46 staff members 
breslin stormed into the newsroom friday after reading yuhs 
message in addition to the racial epithets breslin used coarse 
sexual terms to describe yuh according to the letter which 
denounced breslins racist vituperation and called his 
behavior unprofessional 
theres a part of me that says let him be suspended but 
theres another part of me that says let him be fired said 
yuh 
it proves that racism comes in all kinds of packaging you can 
encounter it anywhere from your colleagues in the boardroom from 
your neighbors not necessarily people in a white sheet she 
said referring to the ku klux klan 
in a comment about her husband quoted by the daily news on 
sunday eldridge said breslin doesnt believe what he wrote in 
his heart but the way he is when he knows hes wrong he lashes 
out he just acts that way 
newsday spokeswoman chiara coletti said sunday the paper plans 
no further action against breslin

east germans voted in their first free local 
elections sunday choosing a city councilman from west germany as 
mayor of their secondlargest city early projections showed 
the conservative party of prime minister lothar de maiziere 
captured the most local government seats followed by the 
leftleaning social democrats according to projections by west 
germanys ard television 
the reformed communist party now called the party of democratic 
socialism was finishing a distant third 
hinrich lehmanngrube a city council member from the west 
german city of hanover ran for mayor of leipzig and television 
projections indicated he was the winner 
lehmanngrube holds dual east and west german citizenship since 
he became an east german citizen only last month he was not 
allowed to vote in the election however anyone who is an east 
german citizen over the age of 18 can be elected to office 
it was not immediately clear whether he would quit his hanover 
post 
the parties performances generally reflected the results of the 
march 18 national elections when east germanys first democratic 
government was elected 
however de maizieres christian democrats took only about 34 
percent of the vote in local races according to the ard 
projections compared to the 41 percent they gained in the march 
balloting 
local issues dominated individual races so it was unclear if 
any dissatisfaction with the rush to unite the two germanys was a 
factor in the races 
the social democrats were holding much the same total as in the 
national elections and the christian democrats losses appeared to 
have been distributed among a group of small specialized parties 
the social democrats however captured the two largest cities 
east berlin and leipzig the ard projections showed 
sundays turnout was about 80 percent short of the 93 percent 
who voted in the march elections 
about 250000 people from 62 parties ran for more than 20000 
councils and municipal posts in 7784 cities districts towns and 
villages about 124 million east germans were eligible to vote 
the local balloting effectively gives local communities control 
of their hometown governments and bureaucracies after four decades 
of centralized communist control 
farright groups were kept off the ballots and foreigners for 
the first time were allowed to take part radicals plastered 
leaflets across the country during the night calling for an 
election boycott 
the balloting followed widespread clashes in east berlin the 
night before between rightwing radicals and foreign workers eight 
people were reported arrested and five were injured 
walter berghofer who was elected as communist mayor of dresden 
in 1986 in elections that were widely presumed to be rigged lost a 
bid to hang onto his office the projections indicated 
sundays voting was only the second free balloting in east 
germanys fourdecade history and brought the revolt against 
stalinist oppression full circle 
in the last local elections on may 7 1989 the communist 
government had claimed that candidates it backed won 99 percent of 
the vote 
the protests that followed eventually exploded into the mass 
demonstrations that ousted hardline leader erich honecker in 
october and opened the berlin wall 
the christian democrats won the march elections by promising 
prosperity to east germans through a fast merger with west germany 
and a quick shift to a free market economy 
since then there have been widespread fears that east germans 
will suffer joblessness and lower living standards when they lose 
their vast socialist subsidies 
de maiziere voted in his home district in east berlin and called 
the elections the second important test of democracy in the 
country 
in the small community of rosin voting was interrupted for 30 
minutes after an anonymous telephone caller said a bomb would 
explode in a school being used as an election precinct the school 
was closed while police searched for a device 
police reported another bomb threat near merseburg and said a 
26yearold west berliner was arrested in hennigsdorf for trying to 
plaster leaflets for the outlawed rightwing republican party 
leaflets and posters were plastered overnight in subway stations 
and on walls saying germans germany and national alternative 
for germany 
rightwing radicals fought street battles with foreigners late 
saturday night and early sunday in a section of east berlin where 
many foreign workers live 
tension between foreign and german workers has been increasing 
in recent weeks as east germany moves toward a free market economy 
the elections likely were the last for east germany as a 
sovereign state unification with west germany is expected to be 
completed next year

pope john paul ii beginning a mission to 
strengthen his church and improve relations with mexico beatified 
the countrys most revered indian on sunday and urged mexicans to 
emulate him in their fight to improve society 
you cannot remain indifferent before the suffering of your 
brothers before poverty corruption the outrages against truth 
and human rights said the goldrobed pontiff at a mass 
the eightday visit to mexico is john pauls 47th trip outside 
italy as pope his 10th to latin america and his second to mexico 
at the modern tentshaped sanctuary of the virgin of guadalupe 
the pope beatified juan diego a humble indian honored as the man 
to whom the virgin appeared in 1531 
john paul also beatified a 19thcentury priest and three indians 
known as the child martyrs of tlaxcala who died almost 450 years 
ago beatification is a step toward possible sainthood 
in a lastminute change of plans mexican president carlos 
salinas de gortari welcomed the pope at the airport instead of the 
foreign minister the move emphasized recent warming of relations 
between the vatican and mexico which has some of the harshest 
anticlerical laws outside the communist bloc despite being 
overwhelmingly roman catholic 
in his homily the pope said catholics cannot in fact refrain 
from participation in politics that is the multiple and various 
economic social legislative administrative and cultural actions 
destined to promote the common good 
the pope appeared to be indirectly challenging mexicos laws 
against participation by the church in politics the 1917 
constitution written after years of revolutionary upheaval denies 
recognition to the church and bars priests from speaking about 
politics from the pulpit 
despite the restrictions the pope received a rousing welcome as 
he began his tour more than 200000 people lined the ninemile 
route through the city to the basilica of guadalupe waving flags 
in the vatican colors of yellowandwhite 
spanish tenor placido domingo who lives in mexico city sang 
parts of the mass 
the crowds were smaller than predicted possibly due to a light 
rain the giant courtyard at the basilica was less than half full 
with about 30000 people when the pope arrived 
i come as a herald of faith and peace in hopes of boosting 
the energy of ecclesiastical communities so that they can be of 
service to their brothers john paul said at the airport after a 
13hour flight from rome 
he was welcomed by a mariachi band playing cielito lindo or 
little beautiful skies one of mexicos unofficial anthems 
salinas greeting the pope said your visit is a new 
encounter with the generosity of a nation of many cultures plural 
visions and deep religious sentiments 
the presidents presence was part of his twoyear initiative to 
improve relations with the church mexico broke diplomatic ties in 
1926 after the church sided with conservatives during the mexican 
revolution 
this is something new and very important the pope told a 
news conference during the flight aboard the papal plane we are 
making efforts to improve relations between the state and the 
church 
salinas named a personal representative to the vatican in 
february considered a step toward a possible resumption of 
diplomatic relations 
the beatification of juan diego came during a campaign by the 
pope to strengthen the church in latin america home to nearly half 
the worlds 850 million roman catholics 
beatification is a step toward sainthood and means masses can be 
celebrated in the persons honor 
according to legend juan diego carried outofseason roses to 
his bishop from the hill where the virgin of guadalupe appeared 
when he opened his white cloak the image of the virgin appeared on 
it the virgin was named patron of the americas by the church in 
1910 
the beatification emphasized the churchs recent efforts to 
appeal to the poor and the indian minority in the past the church 
backed the ruling classes in repressing mexicos native population 
which is why restrictions on the church were written into the 
constitution after the 19101920 mexican revolution 
the pope is trying to inject vigor into a church that is rapidly 
losing ground to evangelical sects although the church claims 90 
percent of mexicos 85 million people are catholic church figures 
show the number of protestants grew more than 500 percent between 
1950 and 1980 to 329 percent of the population 
earlier sunday john paul sent a message to president bush 
urging the united states to welcome mexican immigrants 
i pray that your nation will continue to be the hospitable 
land in which many people including those of mexican origin have 
been given the opportunity of starting a new life

freed hostage frank reed said sunday his 
islamic kidnappers beat him so savagely that they broke his nose 
jaw and ribs and tried to break his feet with iron rods after he 
tried unsuccessfully to escape twice he was put in solitary 
confinement for more than two years 
thank god they didnt kill me he said i was one of their 
pet whackers 
he said his hezbollah guards hit him more than 200 times in the 
head body and feet after his first attempt to gain freedom and 
that he suffered minor fractures in his feet 
they tried to break my feet he said they hit my feet 
many times with iron rods and my feet had been slightly broken 
two days later he tried to escape again and was hit in the back 
with such force that his kidneys bled he said 
this kind of treatment went on and on and on for a long 
time he said then sometime about a year later one pig of a 
man who constantly haggled me broke my ribs kicked my ribs in on 
the right side id managed somehow to push them back lying on my 
back 
despite the pain and hell he went through he said i did 
everything in my power not to cry out and not let them think they 
were ever going to get a single advantage on me and i didnt 
reed said he was chained either to a wall or radiator and that 
the first time he sat up on his own was when he was released after 
44 months in captivity he said he and other hostages slept on thin 
foam rubber mattresses 
reed said he lay on his back for the more than 3 years except 
when he was exercising eating or making trips to the toilet 
we were blindfolded 24 hours a day we slept with our 
blindfolds on because if we had any collateral with our keepers we 
didnt want to lose it by letting them see our eyes 
we were kept in very familiar places to you apartment houses 
for the most part in bedrooms our bedroom doors were locked and 
when they the guards were out we raised our blindfolds we were 
always on guard when they did come in 
sen bob dole the republican minority leader from kansas who 
spoke at the news conference asked for the help of every foreign 
leader everyone who can make a difference in bringing about 
the release of the remaining six american hostages and 10 
westerners they know who they are he said 
sen daniel patrick moynihan dny who also appeared at the 
news conference urged israel to release the moslem prisoners it 
holds 
it is in their interest to do and if theyre part of the world 
nations seeking legality and decency they should now act to bring 
it about in lebanon moynihan said 
syrian and iranian officials said sunday the release of any more 
american hostages likely hinges on israels willingness to free 
hundreds of moslem prisoners including sheik abdul karim obeid a 
shiite cleric kidnapped from his home in 1989 
president bush last thursday again appealed for the release of 
all hostages but sidestepped commenting on whether that should 
include 400 shiites held by israel 
more

joining reed at the news conference was robert polhill a fellow 
american educator who was freed april 22 polhill said he was 
shocked when he heard of the brutal treatment of reed i cant 
say i was maltreated polhill said 
for the first time reed gave graphic details of his days in 
captivity the 57yearold educator said our routine was 
breakfast a cigarette up on your feet after we came back 
from the toilet we were allowed to exercise 
when he was first kidnapped reed said he would just lie around 
not doing anything but worrying 
i was a layabout trying to wonder about this and wonder about 
my school and wonder about my family and worry about my friends i 
said if i dont worry about myself im in trouble there aint 
going to be any frank reed i got up and started doing my pushups 
he began with just six and worked his way up to a record 103 
it was part of my will 
with some matches he had he drew a picture of his 9yearold 
son tarek on the back of the door of his cell so that when his 
guards opened the door they couldnt see it on the ceiling he 
drew a picture of his syrianborn wife fahima known as fifi he 
was admonished for this 
this is one of the ways i had to kind of remind me to keep 
myself going but i knew in the final analysis if i didnt keep my 
life going there certainly wasnt going to be any fifi or any 
tarek 
he said american hostage terry anderson looked wonderful 
physically he last saw anderson more than a year ago anderson 
42 chief middle east correspondent of the associated press was 
abducted march 16 1985 
reed said fellow captives john mccarthy and brian keenan were 
kept together and were in good physical condition 
theyve been fortunate i spent probably two years 2 years 
in solitary confinement while they were fortunate to have the two 
of them together at all times reed said he said mccarthy and 
keenan developed one of the unique relationships in the history 
of human relationships 
reed talked with reporters after he joined other former hostages 
and their families for a brunch and reunion at a hotel in this 
washington suburb his two daughters by a previous marriage 
marilyn langston and jacqueline reed both of malden mass were 
among those present 
reed had said he hoped the gathering would focus international 
attention on the plight of the remaining hostages held by islamic 
militants in lebanon 
reed revealed details about mccarthy and keenan for the first 
time 
both of them physically in terms of muscle development are 
probably in the best shape theyve ever been in in their lives 
unlike myself who kind of in one silent protest i ended up just 
exercising by walking reed said 
he said mccarthy and keenan have been doing an excessive number 
of pushups situps and other exercise in fact i looked at john 
the other day and he looked beautiful i wished i looked like he 
does reed said 
he said they had received a lot of books so theyre keeping 
their minds going

president bush agreed with leaders of congress 
on sunday night to press for fullscale budget negotiations with no 
preconditions to bring the widening federa deficit under control 
lawmakers said 
the congressional leaders emerged from 90 minutes of talks at 
the white house saying they would be back later in the week for 
further talks with bush 
first they need to consult with other members of the house and 
senate they said 
but house speaker tom foley asked if things were now on track 
for fullscale budget negotiations with the white house said i 
think thats going to be the outcome 
foley and senate majority leader george mitchell said they did 
not discuss any specifics with bush including whether the 
president is now willing to budge from his nonewtaxes pledge 
but foley said the assumption is that all matters would be on 
the table that we would not enter any talks with preconditions 
mitchell said there was a general agreement that any 
discussions will be without preconditions if and when they occur 
senate minority leader bob dole said the lawmakers expected to 
meet again with bush late tuesday after conferring with other 
lawmakers including leaders of the key budget and taxwriting 
committees 
congress and the white house have made repeated efforts in 
recent years both with former president reagan and with bush to 
forge grand compromises on the deficit 
sluggish economic growth and rising interest rates of late have 
driven up the deficit making it harder to meet the grammrudman 
mandate of a deficit no larger than 64 billion for fiscal 1991 
which starts oct 1 
foley said he expects more lasting results this time 
all of us who took part in this meeting feel that we need a 
major and meaningful effort that has been somewhat lacking for 
various reasons in past years to narrow the deficit for both next 
year and over several years the speaker said 
i think theres goodwill on all sides in attempting to deal 
with the fiscal problems the country faces said foley 
were going to i think find a way to deal effectively with 
them 
foley said the congressional leaders including house minority 
leader bob michel wanted an opportunity to consult with our 
membership and to consult again with the president 
stephen hart the presidents deputy press secretary said the 
white house had no immediate comment on the meeting 
bush slipped upstairs to his private quarters with the leaders 
after hosting a lecture at which author david mccullough held forth 
on the 26th president theodore roosevelt 
white house chief of staff john sununu and budget director 
richard darman portfolios and legal pads in hand preceded bush up 
the stairs treasury secretary nicholas brady came staight from 
talks on capitol hill with finance ministers from the group of 
seven nations the other major western democracies 
congress has ignored the 12 trillion budget blueprint that 
bush submitted jan 29 
if were going to do it first we have to have an agenda we 
have to know who the players are and what our goals are dole 
said before the meeting 
sununu said that with the full house and senate budget 
committees having approved democratic versions of the 1991 budget 
last week it was time to sound out the leaders on where to go next 
but he insisted there would be no negotiating at this meeting 
were not doing anything sununu said 
the congressional leaders were among 200 guests at the roosevelt 
lecture 
bush sought to play down expectations that had surfaced when 
word of the private meeting leaked out last week 
were not into a negotiation were talking process the 
president said thursday 
the 1990 deficit was supposed to be 99 billion under a budget 
deal that bush and congress struck in april 1989 but that has been 
undone by higher spending and slower than expected growth of tax 
revenues and now the nonpartisan congressional budget office 
expects the 1990 shortfall to reach 159 billion 
the deficit in 1989 was 152 billion

an iranianbacked shiite moslem group 
sunday denied holding western captives but also indicated that more 
would not be released unless the united states helps gain freedom 
for moslem prisoners in israel 
the statement was made by senior hezbollah leader hajj abu 
yasser in an interview broadcast live on the groups alnour radio 
station 
in tehran the radical speaker of irans parliament sunday 
denounced the united states as the enemy of islam hated by 
our people and ruled out a resumption of diplomatic relations 
mehdi karrubis remarks reported by irans official islamic 
republic news agency echoed antius statements by other iranian 
leaders 
the statements were apparently triggered by president bushs 
refusal to make a goodwill gesture toward iran and its shiite 
moslem allies in lebanon following the recent release of two us 
hostages 
good will has to be replied by good will kamal kharrazi 
irans ambassador to the united nations said in an interview 
sunday on abctvs this week with david brinkley 
on the same program syrias foreign minister farouk alsharra 
said his government remains committed to exerting whatever 
influence it can to win freedom for the remaining hostages 
but he complained how do you expect their captors to be so 
humanitarian and release other hostages when their relatives have 
been kidnapped by israel 
that was in reference to the kidnappers and irans demand that 
israel free about 400 lebanese and palestinian prisoners including 
sheik abdulkarim obeid 
obeid a prohezbollah cleric was abducted by israeli troops 
from his home in southern lebanon in july 1989 
hezbollah or party of god is believed the umbrella group for 
extremist shiite factions holding most of the remaining 16 western 
captives in lebanon they include six americans 
we have repeatedly announced that we have not kidnapped any 
hostages if we were the group holding the hostages we would have 
the courage to announce it abu yasser said 
asked why his group is accused of holding the hostages abu 
yasser replied this could have arisen from the fact that 
hezbollah has never publicly condemned those who employ the method 
of hostageholding because hezbollah knows the real reasons behind 
the hostage issue 
the one who bears responsibility for this issue is the 
american administration because it is the one which instigated this 
line he said 
abu yasser said thousands of downtrodden moslems were 
kidnapped by the ustrained lebanese army between 1982 and 1988 
most were seized before any westerners were abducted in beirut and 
are still unaccounted for he said 
we are not concerned with condemning those behind the 
predicament of the american administration abu yasser said 
he said the united states pays scant attention to the harsh 
practices of israel in the region 
it never condemns zionist practices in lebanon or palestine or 
the golan heights he said so why should we then take the 
stand that serves the interests of the us administration 
abu yasser said the goodwill initiative of freeing american 
captives robert polhill and frank reed has placed the hostage issue 
in a realistic framework 
polhill 55 was freed april 22 after 39 months held by shiite 
moslem extremists in lebanon reed 57 was released april 30 after 
42 months in captivity 
the release has put the ball in the american court it has 
raised anew the issue of prisoners held by israel its surrogates 
the lebanese army and the lebanese forces abu yasser said but 
we havent seen any seriousness or concern on the part of the 
american administration to bring about the release of those 
prisoners 
bush has said washington will make no move of its own until all 
six remaining american hostages held in lebanon have been freed 
unconditionally 
but he has said the united states would have no objection to 
israel freeing the prisoners and last week offered to help iran 
establish the fate of four iranians who disappeared in lebanon in 
1982 
israel has linked any release of lebanese or palestinian 
prisoners to freedom for three israeli soldiers held in lebanon 
the six americans are among 16 westerners believed held hostage 
in lebanon the longestheld is terry anderson chief middle east 
correspondent for the associated press he was kidnapped march 16 
1985

arrived in beijing friday to formally normalize longstrained 
relations between the two neighbors 
ochirbat and his party then flew to inner mongolia a swath of 
steppe and desert just inside chinas northern border where 35 
million ethnic mongols live it remained part of china while what

democratic party and the new progressive party which share the 
democratic associations goal of democratic reform had agreed to 
take part in an advisory council to be established under the

oppositions demand that the 370member legislature resign and a 
multiparty legislature be set up until elections are held 
more than 93 percent of the current legislators are communist 
party members 
the communists agreed to hold multiparty elections this summer 
but the opposition complained that the new election law was biased 
in the communists favor it said free elections could only be held 
if a multiparty interim legislature was in place 
only a few hundred people gathered sunday in ulan bators 
central square for an opposition rally the source said several 
dozen democratic association members have been holding a sitin in 
the square since tuesday but the number of supporters and 
onlookers at the scene has never climbed above a few hundred the 
opposition group said sitins were also being staged in six other 
cities and hunger strikes in three five hunger strikers in one 
city were reported hospitalized but no one was reported in serious 
condition 
the goal of all the protests is an interim legislature the 
source said he said the opposition groups leaders were 
considering sunday whether to accept the advisory council 
compromise 
details such as how the council would function and its size were 
not immediately announced it was expected to be set up immediately

thousands of chanting demonstrators surged 
through downtown taipei sunday in the latest of a series of 
protests against the selection of the nations top general as 
premier 
it was the biggest demonstration since president lee tenghui 
offered the post to defense minister hau peitsun five days ago a 
move that has raised widespread fears of greater military 
interference in the government 
hau 71 who served eight years as chief of the general staff 
before becoming defense minister last year would be the first 
general to head the cabinet he is to replace lee huan 73 in two 
weeks 
members of the the opposition democratic progessive party and 30 
other private groups joined the peaceful protest the demonstrators 
shouted general comes democracy goes and we oppose military 
intervention in politics 
police put the number of protesters at 5000 reporters covering 
the event estimated the size of the crowd at about 10000 
a democratic nation should have a civilian cabinet we fear a 
military premier will lead to authoritarian rule said student 
leader fan yun 
protesters also denounced a news blackout on the protests by the 
three government tv stations students sprayed protest slogans at 
the entrances of the three stations 
a popular political weekly the journalist editorialized sunday 
that lees choice of hau as premier was absurd the magazines 
cover featured a black background with the four bold white 
characters for heartfelt sadness 
lee has defended the nomination saying he himself would be in 
control of the military forces he also said a civilian would 
succeed hau to head the defense ministry 
but opposition politicians claimed hau would dominate the 
government and the military 
the government has gradually eased its authoritarian grip in 
recent years lifting martial law allowing opposition political 
parties and giving more government posts to native taiwanese 
but the general belongs to the governing nationalist partys old 
guard which fled to taiwan in 1949 after losing a civil war to 
communist forces on mainland china

when alan c ashton designed a 
wordprocessing program 12 years ago he hoped only to supplement 
his salary as a brigham young university professor and better 
provide for his 11 children 
from those visions of a few extra bags of groceries in the 
ashton familys larder sprang what today is wordperfect personal 
computings preeminent wordprocessing software company with 281 
million in sales last year 
ashton who left byu in 1984 wont say how much he earns as 
corporate president most of wordperfects earnings are recycled to 
fuel the companys stillphenomenal growth but in 1988 he and his 
family moved into a 17000squarefoot mansion on three acres 
im not even sure how many rooms it has he said but it 
certainly is large enough to have a couple of parties going on at 
the same time 
while insisting happiness and joy does not depend on how much 
money you have ashton recounts how wordperfect has grown from 
a handful of customers and 36000 in sales its first year to more 
than 4 million users and projected sales of around 400 million in 
1990 
wordperfect had only two employees cofounders ashton and his 
talented graduate student bruce w bastian when it began 
operations in 1979 as satellite software inc 
ssi became wordperfect corp in 1982 ashton jokes not only to 
gain better name recognition but to end errant calls for satellite 
dish installation 
now the 1900employee company has a sevenbuilding campus at 
orems timpanogos research park just a few miles from byu and is 
erecting two more buildings at the site 
it also boasts an international audience including 53 nations 
offers wordperfect in 16 languages and is developing japanese and 
russian versions 
ashton says 1990s expected record earnings will be fueled by 
sales of the companys latest release of its topselling word 
processor wordperfect 51 retailing for 495 a copy 
also expected to contribute heavily is the new drawperfect a 
495 business presentation graphics package shipped in february 
and the june release of wordperfect office 30 a 149 upgrade of a 
desktop office organization program 
the company already is well on the way to its 400 million sales 
goal owning an estimated 60 percent of the wordprocessing market 
in march wordperfect had 40 million in sales capping a record 
1085 million first quarter 
don willmott an associate editor and software expert with pc 
magazine said wordperfects success can be boiled down three 
things quality customer support and keen marketing 
its always had an edge up he said its a superior 
product and has excellent support you get unlimited customer 
support for as long as you own their product 
while other programs trying to exploit the personal computing 
craze that began with the popularity of ibms pc in the early 1980s 
were counterintuitive in design wordperfect started by 
offering a cleaner much friendlier interface willmott said 
other programs are now just as userfriendly he said but 
wordperfects predominance is established for many years to come 
weve seen in so many ways that once you get the installed 
base the momentum keeps going willmott said 
ashton said hard work and luck got wordperfect off to a fast 
start but employees are responsible for sustained growth since 
then 
raiding heavily from the cream of computer science graduates at 
byu and the university of utah ashton said wordperfect has built a 
talented creative work force loyal to the region and the company 
for example of more than 200 programmers only a halfdozen have 
left the company since its inception 
the company is privately owned and thus not obligated to 
disclose its finances it wont say what employees are paid but 
ashton says they know hard work will be rewarded when wordperfect 
topped 100 million in sales in 1987 for example hawaiian 
vacations for two were given to about 300 employees 
although programmers are the core of development at wordperfect 
ashton says the 560 operators manning the companys tollfree help 
lines are crucial to keeping the customer base happy and growing 
we take 12000 to 13000 calls a day i dont think theres 
any other company computer or outside the computer industry that 
is handling that level of support he said 
ashton and bastian now chairman of the wordperfect board have 
kept the reins firmly in their grip together they still own 998 
percent of the company which remains debtfree thanks to a policy 
of using available revenues to fund capital improvements 
the company also is unusual because of its utah location far 
removed from californias silicon valley the nations computer 
programming mecca 
we lived here when we started byu the community colleges in 
the area and the u of u university of utah in salt lake city 
provide great sources of very good people ashton said and i 
think they enjoy living in this location as well some that have 
worked back east or in silicon valley have come back here and very 
much enjoy the environment

missouri has generally recovered from 
the drought that crippled farmers cities and towns two years ago 
but the river that bears its name hasnt been so lucky 
dry weather in the dakotas continues to keep water in short 
supply throughout the missouri river basin officials say that 
will cause rough traveling this summer for the river barges that 
carry grain and fertilizer across missouri 
more significantly for the nation the low water also could 
cause problems for the commercially important mississippi river 
complicating the issue is south dakotas recent decision to file 
a federal lawsuit sometime soon against the us army corps of 
engineers to force it to keep more water in strapped reservoirs in 
the north 
the corps says it will negotiate but that doesnt reassure the 
people responsible for drinking water in kansas city and other 
missouri river towns 
everybodys going to suffer in some way said chet worm 
chief of the reservoir regulation branch of the corps in omaha 
neb the people at the reservoirs up north are suffering now and 
the people downstream could be suffering later 
tracy mehan director of the missouri department of natural 
resources said things are going to be difficult were going to 
have to tighten our belts in the area of drinking water and 
navigation no question 
already the corps has shortened this years navigation season 
on the missouri and told barge operators they must carry fewer tons 
per barge 
essentially besides losing about five weeks of the season 
they wont be able to carry as much cargo worm said 
the missouri carries only a fraction of the commercial cargo 
carried on the mississippi each year about 24 million tons 
compared to 75 million tons but the restrictions still have a big 
impact on the few companies that operate barge lines there 
we charge by the ton so if we carry fewer tons per barge we 
lose money said roger blaske coowner of blaske marine inc of 
alton ill which operates barges on both the missouri and 
mississippi 
but higher costs arent his main worry 
if they release less water we may have to quit on the 
missouri altogether blaske said 
the river is controlled by a series of six dams between montana 
and south dakota designed to control flooding in wet years and 
maintain a stable river in dry years 
south dakota gov george mickelson contends the small amount of 
barge traffic traveling the 730 miles between sioux city iowa and 
st louis doesnt justify the low water levels in his states 
reservoirs 
although the state of missouri has received normal rainfall so 
far this year north dakota south dakota and montana each lacked 
both winter snow and spring rains 
because of that the missouri river received only 80 percent of 
its normal spring runoff about 196 million acre feet of water 
flowed into the river north of sioux city compared to the normal 
25 million worm said 
the low water levels have threatened city and rural water supply 
systems left boat ramps far from waters edge and prevented 
irrigators from using water in the huge reservoirs worm said 
farther south about 1400 boat slips between sioux city and omaha 
are endangered 
mehan says he recognizes south dakotas legitimate worries but 
says missouri has water needs too and might enter the fight with 
legal action 
we would hope to be accommodating to their problem but we 
certainly have to draw the line somewhere he said 
many missouri cities and towns including kansas city st 
joseph and st louis have improved their drinking water intake 
systems in recent years but that might not protect them if the 
corps cuts back the water flow mehan said 
the effect the low missouri will have on the mississippi river 
is another question and a troubling one officials say 
the missouri is going to be lower this year than it was last 
year said ken kruchowski a spokesman for the corps in st 
louis and we had major problems on the mississippi last year 
well just have to wait and see

why save if the end is near 
if people dont think theres a future they dont save 
says joel slemrod associate professor of business economics at the 
university of michigan and author of studies comparing nuclearwar 
fears with savings habits 
the higher the fear the less is saved he says 
the united states had the highest fear of nuclear war and our 
net private savings rate is near the bottom he said 
slemrods theory differs from most economists disagree on 
whether theres a single reason for the savings rate 
one theory for the low us savings rate blames the throng of 
baby boomers coming of age putting off saving to buy and equip 
homes and making other major purchases 
you have to look at demographics a large portion of the 
population in the acquiring phase of life said virginia 
stafford spokeswoman for the american bankers association in 
washington 
another idea is that inflation may make people feel less likely 
to squirrel away money that will erode in value 
other experts maintain the us savings rate historically has 
been lower than other nations because of cultural difference and 
federal tax laws which for example can make it more advantageous 
to borrow rather than save 
robert dugger chief economist with the aba said some believe 
the dismal increase in inflationadjusted income between the early 
1970s and 1990 made people spend more to keep the lifestyle they 
wanted and that meant less savings 
besides he said uncertainty about the future could make people 
less sure theres any value in saving today 
thats similar to what slemrod found in his first study 
published in 1986 in the journal of conflict resolution he 
compared the us net average private savings rate which includes 
households and companies with fears about the likelihood of 
nuclear war between the late 1940s and mid 1980s to measure fear 
he counted national media mentions of nuclear war and the 
doomsday clock set by the bulletin of atomic scientists since 
1947 
movements of the clock and savings rate were almost 
identical he said 
his second study to be published in the journal economic 
inquiry later this year looked at international gallup polls that 
asked if people thought nuclear war was likely within 10 years he 
compared that with the average net savings rate in western nations 
between 1981 and 1984 the most recent year for which both figures 
were available 
fears of war were higher in countries where savings were less 
he said in the united states the fear index was 545 and the 
average net private savings rate was 104 percent in japan the 
figures were 294 for fear and 193 percent for savings in 
switzerland the fear index was 339 percent compared with savings 
of 189 percent in spain the fear index was 418 percent vs 11 
percent for savings 
the bush administration is concerned enough about americas 
savings habits to offer its family savings account which would 
enable families to save up to 5000 a year and not pay taxes on 
the interest if they left the account untouched for seven years 
the plan is before congress 
even so since a 1987 nadir the us savings rate has edged up 
government and private figures show 
by one measure the percent of disposable income that households 
save the rate of 32 percent in 1987 rose to 55 percent for all 
of last year and was 59 percent for january said analyst ysabel 
burns mcaleer of the american financial services association in 
washington 
slemrod in part credits improved eastwest relations i think 
the thaw has been around long enough the future is more assured 
now he said 
it may be boomers are past peak borrowing years dugger said 
of the savings rise also he believes that improved us 
productivity is enhancing real income which contributes to savings 
thirdly the berlin wall effect is to increase the present 
value of future benefits of savings so you tend to save more 
he said 
since slemrod finished his research the doomsday clock moved 
in march it was turned back from six to 10 minutes to midnight 
with midnight being doom 
i think the perception right now is that we have a future 
again the deepest part of the cold war affected people in 
hardtomeasure ways said len ackland editor of the bulletin of 
atomic scientists 
people do feel freer and sense the possibilities of a better 
future and start preparing for it and part of that is savings

third world countries that have discouraged 
private investment must look increasingly to business for help in 
developing said bernard chidzero minister of finance in 
zimbabwes oneparty government 
in my part of the world there are many countries which are 
oneparty states i dont have to mention them im sure you know 
them and changes are beginning to take place even there he 
told reporters sunday 
i think this should be encouraged and we ought to learn a 
great deal from what has happened in eastern europe he said 
in the past many governments have discouraged private investment 
by their own people as well as by foreigners chidzero said such 
governments have attempted to promote greater public sector control 
of the economy and sought to reduce influence over the economy held 
by outsiders he said 
chidzero spoke to reporters as chairman of the development 
committee that brings together industrial and third world countries 
under the auspices of the world bank and the international monetary 
fund the two bodies are holding semiannual meetings which end 
tuesday 
he endorsed the work of the international finance corporation 
the world bank arm that lends directly to private companies rather 
than to governments the corporation wants to double its capital of 
13 billion so it can make more loans 
chidzero expressed the concern often heard from african 
leaders that new interest in investment in the liberalizing 
countries of eastern europe will reduce aid for the third world he 
said he hoped donor countries would not do that 
by leaving the developing countries alone or siphoning 
resources from them into eastern europe they would be creeating a 
very dangerous situation an explosive situation he said 
they would create conditions that are likely to undermine 
international peace and security

german unification will help other countries 
by increasing german imports and cutting german exports west 
german finance minister theo waigel said sunday 
that trend should help reduce global trade imbalances including 
the united states big trade deficit and lead to more stable in 
foreign exchange rates waigel said 
germanys wide open borders offer foreign sellers additional 
possibilities in a new joint economic and currency area waigel 
said in a statement prepared for a meeting of finance ministers 
from the group of seven leading industrial countries or g7 
they will lead to rising imports since the typical demand of 
east german consumers is in great part for the kind of goods which 
come largely from other countries 
west germanys big surplus of exports along with japans is 
the other side of the huge us trade deficit or surplus of 
imports that reached 109 billion last year 
west german factories will produce more for sales in east 
germany and less for exports to the rest of the world waigel said 
he said not only western industrial countries but eastern europe 
and the third world will benefit from the chance to increase 
exports to a unified germany that should lead to a better balance 
of trade and more stability of world exchange rates he said 
the seven ministers were meeting at the capitol rather than in 
bradys treasury department where such sessions have been held 
previously he was scheduled to give them a tour of the building 
the tour could serve as a reminder that the united states 
expected 12 billion contribution to an increase in international 
monetary fund resources will need approval from congress there is 
some congressional opposition though the contribution will not add 
to the us budget deficit 
the g7 ministers were aiming for an agreement on new 
contributions to the funds resources which are used for loans to 
developing countries their views were expected to be largely 
accepted by the other 145 member governments 
the imf and its sister agency the world bank are holding their 
semiannual meetings in washington through tuesday 
waigel predicted an agreement would boost the imfs resources by 
about 60 billion or 50 percent that is the figure predicted by 
us treasury officials although the imf has sought an increase of 
80 billion

critics of us cigarette exports told 
congress the nations reputation as a maker of lifesaving medical 
miracles is being tarnished with a new image as an exporter of 
disease and death 
free trade is not a license to export lung cancer or ride 
roughshod over the antismoking laws of other nations sen 
edward m kennedy dmass said friday at a hearing of the labor 
and human resources committee he chairs 
kennedy sided strongly with critics of the industry in a growing 
debate over whether the us government should continue seeking 
expanded foreign markets for american cigarettes 
the house has scheduled committee hearings later this month on 
legislation to prohibit such trade promotion and to require on us 
brands sold abroad the same health warning that appears on 
cigarette packages in the united states 
fridays hearing was the first airing of the issue in the 
senate where legislation has not yet been proposed 
the governments success in opening markets to us cigarette 
brands in japan south korea and taiwan and a current effort in 
thailand drew strong praise and support from witnesses representing 
the cigarette industry and tobaccogrowing states and in a letter 
earlier this week from house members to ambassador carla hills the 
us trade representative 
their message was that the dispute is not a health issue but a 
question of fair trade of gaining equal rights for us brands to 
be sold to people who will continue to use a legal product 
tobacco regardless of what country it comes from 
millions of people around the world smoke and will continue to 
smoke whether or not american cigarettes are available said sen 
mitch mcconnell rky one of several legisltors testifying from 
tobaccogrowing states 
tobacco was one of the few us exports earning a surplus more 
than 42 billion last year to help offset the 109 billion us 
trade deficit he said 
accusing the thai government of hypocrisy mcconnell charged 
that it is protecting its tobacco monopoly and planning to expand 
its own exports yet has the audacity to ask us not to export 
cigarettes to thailand for health reasons 
kennedy said foreign sales may help multinational tobacco 
companies but us tobacco farmers are getting the short end of 
the stick because most american brands sold abroad are made in 
foreign factories using cheap hightar and highnicotine 
nonamerican tobacco 
rep chester atkins dmass a coauthor of the house 
legislation testified that the industry failed to address the 
major issue its current effort to gain rights to promote us 
brands in thailand even though the southeast asian country 
prohibits tobacco advertising for health reasons 
atkins and kennedy accused the industry and us administration 
of a double standard seeking rights to lure asian women and young 
people to smoke with forms of promotion forbidden in america where 
smoking is on the decline 
dr prakit vathesatogut director of the thai antismoking 
coalition displayed to the subcommittee wearing apparel such as 
shirts and caps bearing us cigarette brand names such as marlboro 
and winston which he said are handed out in thailand and thai 
advertising depicting smoking as part of a youthful american image 
in the modernday equivalent of the opium wars our government 
is aiming to unleash the marlboro man on the thai citizenry 
atkins said 
the opium war between britan and china was fought from 1839 to 
1842 over the right of british traders based in india to ship opium 
to china china which sought to ban the import of opium lost and 
was forced to permit the opium trade for decades

northwest airlines has had recurring problems 
with the computerized flight controls on its new airbus a320s 
airline and federal records show but officials say the problems 
havent endangered any passengers 
in early march northwest sent pilots a bulletin advising them 
to be aware of possible problems following a recent series of 
events related to suspected failures in the cockpit computer 
system the star tribune reported sunday 
northwest said last week it is involved in discussions with the 
federal aviation administration and airbus industrie the european 
consortium that builds the plane on ways to prevent and correct 
the problems the newspaper said 
the bulletin was issued so crews are not caught by surprise 
when something happens said stuart henning vice president for 
flight operations 
faa officials said the agency is working closely with northwest 
to resolve the problems 
it is a properly certified aircraft said mort edelstein of 
the faas regional office in chicago any failures are not out of 
the ordinary when youre breaking in an aircraft but at no time is 
safety compromised 
an airbus spokesman did not return a phone call seeking comment 
sunday 
the a320 is the only commercial aircraft that uses computers to 
operate all flight controls northwest is the only us airline 
flying the aircraft 
two a320s have crashed since 1988 the most recent in february 
killed 92 people in india 
airbus has blamed the accident on pilot error but some indian 
officials have suggested a computer malfunction the government has 
grounded all indian airlines a320s pending the report of a 
committee investigating the crash and halted further deliveries of 
the plane 
three people died in an a320 crash in france in 1988 
investigators have blamed pilot error for both crashes 
northwest issued its bulletin three weeks after the indian 
airlines crash we have had a recent series of events related to 
suspected guidance computer failures these failures may not be 
easily recognized this notice is meant to heighten pilot 
awareness of potential problems the bulletin said 
the bulletin advised crews to monitor the autoflight system 
with increased vigilance and to be aware of poor or improper 
response from the autothrust system which regulates the engines 
speed pilots were told to revert immediately to manual thrust if 
the autothrust system responded poorly or improperly 
northwest has eight a320s in use since last july when it put 
the first of them into service the airline has filed 39 reports 
known as service difficulty reports on the a320 with the faa 
the star tribune said it got copies of the reports through the 
freedom of information act 
some of the reports refer to computer malfunctions at least 
nine incidents caused an a320 to abort takeoff return to the 
airport after takeoff or divert to another airport before the 
scheduled landing the newspaper said 
faa records show northwest pilots were forced to take quick 
action on three occasions because of suspected computer 
malfunctions 
northwest officials said the aborted takeoffs occurred well 
within acceptable margins of safety and that in each instance the 
pilot could have taken off and flown the plane manually 
steve arnold a northwest pilot and a320 first officer and 
spokesman for the air line pilots association on questions 
regarding the plane said pilots are enthusiastic about the plane 
its like going from props to jets he said once you get 
into this airplane you look back and say what an improvement

a group of third world countries threatened to 
block a 60 billion increase in the international monetary funds 
resources because it is linked to a plan to force delinquent 
nations to repay their debts 
the group of 24 g24 third world countries voted behind closed 
doors to issue a long statement on fund policies it included 
criticism of plans to link the increased imf contribution to making 
11 delinquent countries repay 43 billion in arrears they owe the 
fund it has been proposed that to get the delinquents to pay up 
the fund could suspend their right to vote 
the proposal for suspension of voting and representation 
rights of those members will not serve a useful purpose and is not 
acceptable the joint statement said 
on thursday a senior us treasury official supported a 
carrotandstick approach to the arrears problem 
it would offer help from a special fund to countries in arrears 
if they agree to new policies designed to put them in better shape 
to pay up until they do it would suspend their rights to vote in 
the fund the rights correspond roughly to their contributions 
known as quotas 
the us contribution to the increased quotas would be about 12 
billion the amount would not be added to the federal budget 
deficit and would not change us voting rights since other 
members also would contribute 
sayyed mohammad hossein adeli head of irans central bank and 
chairman of the group of 24 declined to say whether group members 
would vote against the 60 billion quota increase if it is linked 
to the plan on arrears 
if this is taken up in the interim committee the developing 
countries would discuss it and hope to reach an agreement he 
said at a news conference 
he added that the group did not want to delay th agreement on 
the increased quotas 
the fund classes 130 of its 152 members as developing countries 
the 24 in adelis group would have enough votes just over 15 
percent of the total to block an agreement voting is based on 
quotas with the largest single voting power just short of 20 
percent in the hands of the united states 
the 11 delinquent countries are sudan zambia peru guayana 
honduras cambodia liberia panama sierra leone somalia and 
vietnam 
the statements from adeli and his group came as us treasury 
sexcretary nicholas f brady was meeting at the capitol with 
finance ministers from japan west germany britain france italy 
and canada they were trying to agree on the exact amount of the 
new contributions and other fund business including what to do 
about the arrears

greyhound is calling for a fouryear wage 
freeze and the elimination of about 4500 union jobs in its latest 
contract offer in the twomonthold drivers strike an executive 
for the bus line said sunday 
the offer was made saturday as negotiators met for the first 
time since midmarch and a day after the company announced a 56 
million loss for the first three months of this year 
the union called the offer greedy and an insult 
bargaining talks were halted indefinitely following saturdays 
session 
the companys offer which outlines a major reduction in 
services for the only nationwide bus system would give drivers 
1279 an hour rather than their previous 30centsamile rate 
said greyhound vice president anthony p lannie 
the companys poor financial situation and move to reduce 
services are forcing it to eliminate about 2000 of its 6000 
driver jobs lannie said 
another 2500 union jobs would go to the 2500 nonunion 
replacement drivers the company has hired since the strike began 
march 2 lannie said adding that the 500 union members who crossed 
picket lines also would be kept 
the bus line told union negotiators it had immediate openings 
for only 620 striking drivers and probably could take another 700 
back within a few months 
the wage offer amounts to a wage cut for some employees rather 
than a freeze contended union president edward m strait he said 
he would not relay the proposal to local union presidents and 
rankandfile members who have been on strike since march 2 
theyd throw me out the upstairs window if i went back with 
this its an insult there would be no dignity for the drivers 
strait said i would characterize it as greedy they dont 
care about their employees 
union officials calculated that a driver who normally makes runs 
from washington dc to new york would lose more than 30 a day 
or as much as 7000 a year from the companys proposed switch to 
an hourly rate strait said 
before the strike union drivers had made an average annual 
salary of about 24000 
lannie said the 1279 an hour rate equals what drivers were 
making under the 30centpermile rate it also would equalize pay 
among drivers he said adding that the permile pay system meant 
drivers in different regions earned different amounts 
the companys sixyear proposal provides standstill wages in 
the first four years and 3 percent wage hikes in both the fifth and 
sixth years lannie said 
strait head of the amalgamated council of greyhound local 
unions said he was insulted by the companys attitude during 
saturdays ninehour bargaining session 
for a company on the rocks thats going under they could 
have come in and said hey were in trouble can you help us 
instead they said this is what its going to be strait said 
contending that the company was trying to bust the union 
strait called on the company to abandon its position of keeping 
the replacement drivers but lannie said the company would not 
compromise on that issue 
lannie said the company was forced to propose a wage freeze and 
scrap jobs because of the financial problems created by the strike 
we were backed into a corner they walked off the job in a 
fashion designed to shut us down they are where they are by virtue 
of their own actions lannie said 
the greyhound official said the company was not trying to break 
the union because the bus line has a long history with this 
group we would like to continue that relationship 
lannie and strait are trying to settle disputes over wages job 
security and seniority issues for the 6300 striking drivers and 
3000 clerical and maintenance workers who also walked out in march 
many of the striking union members who would lose their jobs 
under the proposal were parttime drivers while all drivers under 
the new proposal would be fulltime the company official said 
lannie said the company proposes to let union drivers who lose 
their jobs take their pension funds without penalty and it also 
wants to discuss severance pay with the union 
lannie said the company is abandoning charter service in all but 
19 of the 197 cities where it was offered 
the company plans to keep lines running to all but 2 percent of 
the cities it served he said it plans to reduce its practice of 
running additional buses in peak periods when buses are full now 
passengers will have to wait until the next scheduled bus departs 
he said
