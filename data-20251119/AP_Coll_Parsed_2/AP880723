booked into jail in a wet bathing suit after she allegedly tried to 
use her board to make a getaway from a florida marine patrol 
officer 
jean felicia kuznar of jensen beach was charged with careless 
operation of a vessel interfering with navigation resisting 
arrest without violence and fleeing and eluding law officers 
her problems with officer leslie jones began when mrs kuznar 
was windsurfing wednesday near the stuart causeway and a powerboat 
entered the channel 
ms jones said the powerboat had to take evasive action to 
avoid an accident so she approached mrs kuznar in her patrol 
boat to discuss the matter 
ms jones said mrs kuznar refused orders that she bring her 
windsurfer to shore and told me to get lost 
mrs kuznar said she was trying to get to shore and complained 
that the officer swamped her with the patrol boats wake

evangelist jimmy swaggart received a 
standing ovation from about 2500 followers friday at his first 
crusade outside his home state of louisiana since he was defrocked 
amid reports he had hired a prostitute 
the three days of revival meetings were not supported by the 
national or local offices of the assemblies of god swaggarts 
former denomination but crowds lined up at the door and sales of 
swaggarts albums and tapes were brisk 
im forgiving to him hes not exempt from sin or 
temptation said etta mae martin 57 of kansas city mo who 
arrived with her husband two hours before the arena doors opened to 
grab frontrow seats 
she said swaggart should put his troubles behind him and get on 
with his life 
i wanted to show that men make mistakes and hes forgiven 
said charles randle 24 of indianapolis since he told the 
truth everyone wants to get on him 
in february swaggart tearfully confessed on television that he 
had committed an unspecified sin against god and his family the 
confession was followed by allegations that he had hired a 
prostitute to perform lewd acts while he watched 
assemblies of god pastors were told not to be supportive or 
cooperative with jimmy swaggart ministries any longer said the 
rev charles shank district superintendent of the nations largest 
pentecostal denomination he has been disciplined by the church 
and isnt part of our fellowship 
nevertheless organizers planned for at least 8000 followers 
including assemblies of god members to attend the crusade each 
night 
as the band struck up an upbeat religious song swaggart and his 
wife frances kneeled to greet the outstretched hands of members 
of the audience who walked up to the stage 
i thank you for your kindness and your love swaggart said 
i thank you for literally opposing every force of darkness and 
saying we love you 
its such a thrill to be here we love you more than we can 
express frances swaggart told the crowd 
swaggart singing and playing the piano appeared in good humor 
as he kidded his wife about her fervent address to the audience 
shes always complaining about those women creatures throwing 
their hands up im going to show her that on television in a few 
weeks and well see the crusade is being videotaped for the 
relatively few television stations that have not canceled 
swaggarts program 
swaggart didnt refer directly to his troubles friday night but 
he urged the audience to write checks or give cash totaling 100 or 
more to save his television ministry 
we desperately desperately need that help he said i do 
not ask it for me i ask it for souls 
outside the 17000seat downtown market square arena a handful 
of protesters carried signs reading ban the bible and ban 
christianity 
swaggart said he viewed the crusade in indianapolis as a fresh 
start 
ive changed an awful lot he said after a dress rehearsal 
im more keenly aware of the hurt and pain of other people im 
more aware of their weaknesses and despair 
swaggart returned to the pulpit may 22 but was defrocked by the 
assemblies of god for refusing to abstain from preaching for a year 
while undergoing professional counseling swaggart 52 said his 
multimilliondollar global ministry could not survive such an 
absence 
jozette ausbury a spokeswoman for the assemblies of god in its 
springfield mo headquarters said members could not be punished 
for attending the crusade 
they can go if they want to thats fine she said 
the church had not decided whether ministers who attend the 
crusade could be punished the church has not ruled what sanctions 
it would apply to local ministers who might help the crusade but 
it has given ministers at jimmy swaggart ministries until oct 1 to 
leave or be defrocked 
no local assemblies of god ministers are known to be assisting 
the crusade 
baldock who heads the compassion center mission on wheels and 
ark of the new covenant church recruited about 300 volunteers to 
serve as ushers security guards and support staff 
i preach just like most of my brothers preach forgiveness 
love and mercy restoration baldock said thats not only with 
reverend swaggart thats with anyone accepting the message of 
jesus christ that has a problem and because im forgiven 
the scriptures teach us that if we expect to be forgiven we 
must forgive ourselves

they live by a brutal code of each 
man for himself in prison but in the middle of the woods they 
learn to stand together against a fiery enemy that is not affected 
by their crimes color or gangs 
we cant bring our problems with us to the fire lines said 
rafael rojas 20 of hollister who is serving time in the 
california youth authority for burglary 
rojas was among hundreds of state prisoners battling a pair of 
arsonlinked wildfires in heavy timber and brush near the calaveras 
county town of rail road flat 150 miles east of san francisco 
gov george deukmejian on friday offered a 10000 reward for the 
capture of the arsonist and declared a state of emergency in the 
county 
nearly 11000 acres and six homes had been charred by friday as 
firefighters neared containment of the blazes which have caused an 
estimated 38 million damage to the droughtparched region since 
tuesday 
wielding shovels saws and other hand tools state fire capt 
bob seguras strike team of inmates stood guard thursday when the 
fire burned out to a section of the more than 18 miles of 
bareearth control lines that firefighters had carved around the 
fires 
let it burn right to the edge segura bellowed at the 
inmates clad in orange jumpsuits 
some of the inmates had to use ladders off a nearby state pumper 
truck to climb up the nearvertical mountain toward the advancing 
flames 
within minutes he told his crew from the dewitt nelson cya camp 
in stockton that it seemed the line would hold for the time being 
a few of the inmates slid down the slope hand over hand on a 
fire hose others descended on the ladder hours after being dumped 
off from a stifling personnel truck it was finally break time 
this is better than being behind walls rojas said in an 
idle moment 
added team member stevie wright every time they ask you 
want to go on a fire everybody stands up and says yeah 
wright 19 of vallejo is serving a sentence for possession of 
cocaine 
inmates in the california youth authority or state prison 
systems can volunteer to train as firefighters but candidates are 
screened to determine that they are suited and that they are low 
security risks supervisors are unarmed but even so there are very 
few escape attempts 
correctional officer alex castillo supervising state prisoners 
in line for food at the rail road flat fire camp after coming off 
the lines said most of the inmate firefighters are proud of what 
they do 
they like getting outside and later you hear them say things 
like hey we saved a house there castillo said 
added prisoner myron bright with a sincere expression on his 
face its a good way to pay my debt to society bright 36 
who is serving time for insurance fraud works out of the green 
valley camp near folsom prison 
castillo said he and other crew supervisors make allowances 
because of the nature of the work 
if youre out there for more than a week at a time they get 
antsy if youre real strict they wont respond in a good way and 
you dont need tension on a fire he said 
the inmates said they realize the work is dangerous but trust 
the supervisors to keep them alive 
one prisoner said the work has changed the direction of his life 
id like to become a professional firefighter said wright 
the first week i get out im going to put in an application

a contaminated water hose in the 
kitchen of the air force academys cadet dining hall apparently 
caused the outbreak of food poisoning that affected 673 people 
academy officials said friday 
officials said a floor drain had backed up in the kitchen of 
mitchell hall on july 12 and the hose was placed in the drain in 
an effort to clear it the hose then was used to rinse celery that 
was put in the chicken salad served at lunch that day 
bacteriological tests shows the hose was contaminated with e 
coli bacteria tests were still being conducted on the food to 
confirm that the bacteria in the hose caused the outbreak of 
gastroenteritis 
academy officials said they planned to have civil engineers 
examine the 30yearold drain system they also said they planned 
to review kitchen procedures including how food handlers are

a group called the committee for responsible 
genetics has announced a campaign to persuade university biologists 
to turn aside defense department requests for additional research 
into germ warfare 
at a news conference friday four scientists on the committee 
said the pentagon is asking for 300 million to conduct research 
into biological warfare techniques and the researchers said this 
work could lead to the development of weapons for a war nobody 
could win 
christin anfinsen a nobel prizewinning biologist at johns 
hopkins university said biotechnology has advanced so rapidly that 
the production of biological weapons is relatively simple 
we could develop warheads to spread anthrax disease within 
six months and so could the soviets said anfinsen 
no nation he said could win a war with biological weapons 
because a counterattack would be swift and deadly 
army lt col john chapla a pentagon spokesman confirmed that 
the military is seeking funds to conduct biological research but 
he said the effort is aimed at developing a defense against germ 
weapons not at making the weapons themselves 
chapla said a hearing will be held monday on the environmental 
impact of a planned 54 million biological aerosol test facility 
at the dugway proving ground in utah 
in a telephone interview chapla said the army has let more than 
100 biological research contracts to private research groups the 
army he said plans to research defensive measures such as 
protective clothing and detection and decontamination equipment 
he said army researchers also will attempt to develop vaccines that 
would protect against germ warfare agents 
but he said none of this work was aimed at producing weapons 
chapla also said that for germs to be used as weapons the army 
would have to develop a delivery system a way to manufacture the 
germs and a doctrine for the use of such weapons he said no work 
is being done in any of these areas 
at the scientists news conference jonathan king a professor 
of biology at the massachusetts institute of technology said the 
same techniques needed to develop a defense against biological 
weapons can be used to develop the weapons themselves 
in an offensive biological warfare program the first thing 
you do is develop a vaccine to protect your own troops he said 
king also said the most serious danger of biological weapons is 
that they could lead to uncontrolled contamination of vast 
populations if they are released 
biological weapons are not like gunpowder or nuclear bombs 
he said biological agents can spread and reproduce 
anfinsen said new laboratory techniques in which the genetic 
pattern of bacteria and viruses can be changed makes a defense 
unlikely against germ weapons 
since you can make any number of variables the defense 
against them is impossible he said the inability to defend 
against such an attack is universal 
richard novick director of the public health research 
institute said biological weapons are neither a threat nor a 
deterrent for major powers because all the technically advanced 
nations can equally develop such weapons 
what he fears instead novick said is that the germ weapons 
developed by the pentagon could be used secretly to assert american 
will in small countries 
king and novick said the pentagon is actively recruiting 
biologists to conduct germ warfare research 
i have been approached and most of us have king said 
jane e koretz a researcher at rensselaer polytechnic 
institute said advances in genetic engineering are a twoedged 
sword 
it can be used to improve the quality of human life or it can 
be used for its destruction she said using the new biological 
techniques to develop weapons ms koretz said would be a 
perversion of the reasons that most scientists conduct the 
research 
she said genetic manipulation techniques could be used to 
develop a germ or virus that could spread like small pox 
you can understand why we are so horrified she said 
the committee for responsible genetics is circulating a petition 
among university biologists that contains a pledge not to engage 
knowingly in research that would further develop biological warfare 
agents 
a day before the news conference kathleen c bailey assistant 
director of the us arms control and disarmament agency of the 
state department announced that the government believes there now 
are at least 10 countries conducting research into biological 
weapons

iran and iraq agreed to hold crucial peace 
talks with the secretarygeneral early next week on a ceasefire 
and a political settlement to end their eightyear war 
a un ceasefire team planned to leave for iran and iraq this 
weekend after iraq finally agreed friday to accept it iran agreed 
earlier to welcome the mission 
iran formally protested iraqs latest ground offensive and said 
iraqi chemical warfare attacks had killed dozens and injured 
hundreds 
on monday iran finally accepted resolution 598 the security 
councils yearold plan to end the persian gulf war iraq accepted 
it earlier 
iranian foreign minister aliakbar velayati and his iraqi 
counterpart tariz aziz agreed to hold separate intensive talks in 
new york with secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar on 
implementing the plan 
after more than a dozen rounds of fruitless un talks this 
round will be the most crucial diplomats said perez de cuellar 
said wednesday he hoped to have a ceasefire in a week or 10 days 
it was not immediately known whether the belligerents would hold 
direct talks as urged by iraq whether they would hold proximity 
talks with perez de cuellar shuttling between delegations or 
whether the talks would take place at different times 
iranian ambassador mohammad jaafar mahallati told reporters 
that velayati might agree to a facetoface meeting with aziz 
earlier in the week mahallati rejected direct talks 
iran is ready to go along without any limitations whatsover in 
the implementation of resolution 598 if the secretary general 
requires it he said 
perez de cuellar says he prefers direct talks but diplomats 
said he was not likely to force the issue 
velayati is expected to be here monday and aziz also is 
expected to arrive early next week previously iranian envoys from 
tehran refused to be here while ranking iraqi officials met the 
secretarygeneral 
the decision by iran militarily battered and politically 
isolated to accept a ceasefire was a surprise 
iraq after a string of battlefield victories initially called 
irans move a trick and said it would accept a ceasefire only 
after direct talks with iran 
but iraq came under intense diplomatic pressure from many 
nations including the soviet union its major arms supplier and 
the united states to come to terms quickly and agree to a 
ceasefire said informed diplomatic sources who spoke on condition 
of anonymity 
when the secretarygeneral agreed to call both envoys to new 
york iraq agreed to allow the un ceasefire mission to go to 
baghdad 
i am very optimistic now because the confusion and 
misunderstandings have been removed said ismat kittani iraqs 
ambassador to the un the two foreign ministers will come and 
discuss with the secretarygeneral how to get the peace process 
going fullblast at the technical level and political level 
mahallati said the un team will arrive in tehran on sunday 
the team then planned to travel to iraq in its weeklong mission 
before reporting back to the secretarygeneral 
perez de cuellar said that after the team returns he will be 
able to put resolution 598 into motion by setting dates for a 
ceasefire troop withdrawal prisoner exchange and formal peace 
talks and establishing an impartial panel to decide which nation 
started the war 
iran has insisted that iraq must be branded the aggressor 
diplomats say iran needs international condemnation of iraq to 
persuade iranians to accept a ceasefire 
but resolution 598 is vague on a panel that would determine 
responsibility for the war and diplomatic observers said they 
expected iraq to try to undercut that provision 
iraq invaded iran in september 1980 after several border 
skirmishes 
the un technical team will include five officers from the un 
truce supervision organization based in jerusalem two un 
observers already in both tehran and baghdad and a civilian 
political officer 
perez de cuellar said the ceasefire would be monitored by about 
250 un observers but he said funding would be a serious problem 
for a new un peacekeeping or observer force 
now that the un is engaged in a very major operation there 
soon will be a lack of financial stability and in fact almost 
bankruptcy of the organization he said in a statement this 
will impair very seriously these new operations 
the united nations is facing a crisis of unpaid dues largely 
because the united states has not paid 467 million or about 
twothirds of the total owed to the world organization by its 
member states

strong tax collections from businesses and 
individuals are brightening the outlook for reducing the federal 
budget deficit in 1988 with red ink for the fiscal year through 
june running 2 percent lower than 1987 
the treasury department on friday reported a rare 95 billion 
surplus last month trimming the gap between what the government 
has spent and what it has taken in during the first nine months of 
the fiscal year to 118 billion 24 billion less than during the 
same period last year 
if the deficit continued building at the same rate it would 
total 1474 billion when the fiscal year ends sept 30 down 
slightly from the 1504 billion budget gap of last year and 
substantially below the 2211 billion record high set in 1986 
right now it looks like the chances are pretty good that we 
can beat last year said mark lasky an economist with data 
resources inc a lexington mass forecasting firm 
michael k evans president of evans economics inc in 
washington said higherthanexpected collection of individual 
income taxes in both may and june are making projections earlier 
this year by private economists of about a 160 billion deficit 
look pessimistic 
quarterly individual tax payments due in june totaled 462 
billion up 141 percent from the same month in 1987 in may tax 
payments totaled 18 billion nearly double the collections in may 
1987 
corporate tax payments also rose bolstered by strong profits of 
us companies they totaled 183 billion in june 186 percent 
more than the same month a year ago 
nobodys really sure including the treasury how this new tax 
reform law works my view is that the law actually is collecting 
taxes that were going into tax shelters which is what its 
supposed to do in 1989 well see even more of this evans said 
the major uncertainty remaining for this year he said is how 
much the government will have to spend to help droughtstricken 
farmers higher grain prices caused by droughtinduced shortages 
could lower government price support payments but special aid to 
farmers with shriveled crops could more than make up for that he 
said 
the treasury department said federal spending last month totaled 
899 billion a 77 percent increase over june 1987 however 
revenues surged a greater 198 percent above last years level to 
993 billion 
it was only the third surplus posted since the fiscal year began 
in october there was a surplus in january because social security 
checks for the month were mailed at the end of december and another 
in april as individual income tax payments poured in 
for the first nine months revenue totaled 6811 billion up 
69 percent from last year while spending was 7991 billion up 
55 percent 
the administration is forecasting a deficit of 1467 billion 
just slightly above the 144 billion target in the grammrudman 
budget balancing law next years target is 136 billion 
in june the largest spending category was interest on the 
national debt followed by the military social security and other 
programs in the department of health and human services 
military spending totaled 246 billion last month and 2133 
billion for the fiscal year so far up 39 percent from the same 
period a year ago 
spending for social security totaled 213 billion last month 
and 1608 billion for the past nine months up 56 percent from 
the same period in the 1987 fiscal year 
the other programs in the department of health and human 
services including medicare and medicaid spent 137 billion in 
june and 1187 billion so far this budget year a 6 percent 
increase over the first three quarters of fiscal 1987 
interest on the 25 trillion national debt totaled 316 
billion last month and 1691 billion so far this fiscal year an 
increase of 102 percent over the same period last year

the justice department has found no basis to 
investigate former deputy attorney general arnold burns for 
promoting a former law partner for a judgeship sources say 
the criminal divisions public integrity section reached the 
conclusion after reviewing information about the relationship 
between burns and stuart summit who has been nominated to the 2nd 
us circuit court of appeals in new york according to the 
sources who spoke on the condition of anonymity 
burns and former criminal division chief william weld plan to 
testify before congress tuesday about their march 29 protest 
resignations 
they quit out of concern that the continued tenure of attorney 
general edwin meese iii was hurting justice department operations 
and morale 
the washington times disclosed burns support for summit last 
month suggesting the former deputy attorney general might have 
violated federal conflictofinterest law 
the washington times this month disclosed that weld had been the 
focus of an internal justice department investigation into whether 
he smoked marijuana at a wedding in 1982 weld has emphatically 
denied the allegation made in an anonymous letter and the 
departments office of professional responsibility closed the 
matter 
congressional sources and sources close to the justice 
department have said the leaking of unfavorable information about

secretary of state george p shultz has 
decided to help israel hold on to soviet jews who might prefer 
settling in america according to us officials 
he will not oppose a prospective change in israeli procedures 
designed to stem the exodus to the united states of jews who left 
the soviet union with exit permits for israel the officials said 
friday 
but shultz is likely to heed the advice of the bureaus that 
handle soviet and refugee affairs and keep pushing moscow to permit 
wider emigration across the board 
most jews who leave the soviet union are permitted to depart if 
they can get visas from israel once they reach vienna the transit 
point for soviet emigres nearly 90 percent of them go elsewhere 
mostly to the united states and are taken in by the united states 
as refugees 
concerned about the situation the israeli cabinet has ordered a 
change in procedures soviet jews granted exit permits would 
receive their israeli visas in romania and fly to israel 
the change in procedure which has not been put into effect 
would make it harder for soviet jews to come to the united states 
because they would have to qualify for entry as immigrants this 
could require long waiting periods and most would be fenced out for 
various reasons as ineligible 
the state departments european bureau which is involved in 
soviet policy and the human rights bureau had both recommended to 
shultz that he urge israel to change its policy and appeal to 
moscow to permit wider emigration 
richard schifter the assistant secretary of state for human 
rights and humanitarian affairs proposed that soviet jews remain 
eligible for admission to the united states as refugees even after 
they reach israel 
the state departments near eastern bureau which deals in arab 
and israeli affairs recommended to shultz that he not contest the 
israeli cabinets decision advice he will follow at least 
temporarily according to officials who spoke on the condition they 
not be identified 
the debate is less a state department debate than a debate 
about feeling the israelis would be insulted and that it would 
undermine the purpose of the state of israel if refugees left the 
soviet union and did not go to israel an official said they 
need and want immigrants 
david a harris the washington representative of the american 
jewish committee described the problem as one of the hottest and 
most complex issues in israelidiaspora debate he referred to 
divergent views among jews living in israel and elsewhere around 
the world 
ideally harris said the compromise would be a twotrack 
policy soviet jews who want to go to israel would leave the 
ussr with israeli visas those seeking resettlement in the 
united states would leave with american visas it is our hope the 
administration will press the kremlin in this direction its fair 
its equitable its logical 
most soviet citizens are unable to obtain exit permits but 
thousands of jews armenians and ethnic germans over the years have 
enjoyed a special privilege of emigrating very small numbers of 
jews are permitted to go directly to the united states the others 
can leave only if they obtain visas for israel

italian high fashion designers presented the most 
ornate collections in many a season for this fall and winter 
perhaps in an effort to give a lift to their own sagging image 
during the fiveday roman fashion week ending friday night the 
couture runway brimmed with gold silver bronze and precious 
stones sequined embroidery no longer flatly stitched stood out 
in threedimensional flora and fauna while precious pelts of mink 
sable and fox rimmed cuffs collars and hemlines 
the great success achieved by french designer christian lacroix 
coupled with a power struggle between milan and rome for control of 
the italian fashion scene has weakened the image of the 
madeinitaly couture label which in the 1960s presented a real 
threat to the supremacy of french couture 
today only a handful of buyers and press representatives come 
to rome for the twiceayear showings mainly to check in at 
valentino and gianfranco ferre the popular milanese readytowear 
designer that began its high fashion collections two years ago 
rome tries to put its best foot forward by using elegant hotels 
and historic outdoor settings for its shows they contrast sharply 
with milan trade fairgrounds where the italian readytowear shows 
are held and parisian tents where french collections are 
displayed 
although individual houses such as lancetti mila schoen 
galitzine and andre laug have a long list of faithful clients the 
valentino couture label is the only one that can still give the 
french a run for their money 
the look for the fallwinter italian style is vaguely russian 
with sable playing heavily for day and night on hats coats 
jackets sweaters and evening gowns redingote coat styles abound 
as well as wide lapels on jackets and high collars on dresses and 
blouses alike 
shades tend toward fall greens purples and browns flannel gray 
makes a big comeback and the newest shade of the season is ruby 
red championed by gianfranco ferre in his much applauded 
collection 
in a situation emblematic of their unsettled state the 
designers could not agree on one hemline with some diving way 
below the knee while others still offered short skirts however 
the tiny miniskirt is out and the preferred length is right on the 
knee 
although not prominent pants dot the collections with ferre 
offering the newest idea gray flannel mantailored trousers by 
night worn with a sumptuous sequined top 
heels are very high makeup is pronounced with bright red lips 
and hairstyles are neat often pinned back at the neck 
for evening wear the designers let themselves go often 
tailoring their gowns from shimmering gold silver or bronze 
fabrics and decorating an otherwise simple sheath with heavy 
jeweled sequins or entire lifesized floral arrangements of fabric 
and sequins 
and if thats not enough fur trimming is sometimes added for 
extra winter warmth 
with prices for a couture gown starting at 10ooo and soaring 
over 100000 for more elaborate models it is understandable that 
the designers are eager to give the client her moneys worth 
however the look can and often does fall into fashion kitsch 
only valentino and ferre were able to carry this opulence off 
gracefully 
ferre unburdened his floralsequined and furtrimmed silver gray 
ballgown by interspersing its layers of velvet and taffeta with 
yards and yards of airy tulle 
valentino streamlined the look by relegating ornate sequins to 
cummerbunds on a simple chiffon gown and fashioning his floral 
creations out of bands of satin

washington extension of the life of the irancontra grand jury 
will push the 18monthold investigation into the start of the next 
presidents term with more charges possible 
us district chief judge aubrey e robinson acted friday just 
six days before the jury was to be disbanded to extend its work 
for six more months through jan 27 1989 by then president 
reagans successor will be in office 
robinson in his order responded to a sealed motion from 
independent counsel lawrence e walsh to extend the inquiry even 
as walshs staff prepares for the scheduled sept 20 opening of the 
trial of former white house aide oliver north lawyers for north 
have asked that the trial be postponed until march 1989 
walsh is expected to continue looking into the activities of 
us officials and others in central america following the 
indictment last month of a former cia station chief in costa rica 
joseph fernandez 
an unspecified number of coconspirators were cited along with 
fernandez in an illegal supply network aimed at getting funds to 
the contras in 1986 when congress had banned us aid to the 
nicaraguan rebels 
robinsons order said the purpose of the extension was for the 
investigations identified by the government in its motion 
jim wieghart walshs spokesman said he could not comment on 
specifics of the planned investigations mentioned in the judges 
order 
walshs investigation previously focused on us fundraising 
efforts for the contras arms sales to iran and the diversion of 
profits from the sales to the rebels 
this led to charges against north former national security 
adviser john m poindexter and arms dealers richard v secord and 
albert hakim for their roles in the iranian arms sales and the 
diversion of profits from the sales to private use and to the 
contras 
two fundraisers and former national security adviser robert c 
mcfarlane earlier pleaded guilty to other charges resulting from 
walshs grand jury investigation 
the charges against fernandez accused him of helping north and 
secord coordinate air drops of weapons and supplies to contra 
groups in 1986 
trials of poindexter secord and hakim will follow that of north 
on tuesday north poindexter and hakim petitioned the us 
court of appeals to have their indictments dismissed because they 
believe testimony given to congress under grants of immunity would 
be used against them in the trials

washington a 40 percent increase in the us sugar quota will 
benefit the dominican republic the philippines brazil and 36 
other countries and is bringing praise from large us sugar users 
the increase in what had been the lowest sugar quotas in 113 
years authorizes the purchase of 300000 additional short tons of 
sugar in 1988 and also reallocates the 20300 tons of sugar that 
would have been bought from panama before all trade with that 
country was cut off 
the agriculture department and the office of the us trade 
representative announced the sugar quota expansion to 1056675 
tons at the end of the trading day friday 
the new quota is about 56000 tons higher than the 1987 figure 
but lower than the 1986 quota of 17 million tons the 1988 quota 
previously had been the lowest since 1875 agriculture and trade 
officials said 
agriculture secretary richard e lyng who has advocated a 
scrapping of the program that keeps us sugar prices higher than 
those on the world market said the increase was necessary because 
of unexpected cuts in us production including the likely 
effects of the drought on sugar beet yields 
the low sugar quotas announced last december had brought 
criticism from us sugar users who anticipated difficulty getting 
enough sugar and disappointment in countries whose quotas were cut 
particularly the philippines which has long been dependent upon 
the us sugar quotas to help its ailing economy 
the us sugar program offers a kind of dual subsidy helping 
the producing countries by paying well above world market prices 
for their sugar and helping us sugar growers by guaranteeing them 
the higher prices too the united states buys sugar under the 
quota system at the same price it pays us producers about 23 
cents a pound up from 18 cents earlier this year the current 
world market price is approaching 15 cents a pound after dipping to 
around 6 cents 
under the new quotas the dominican republic will be able to 
sell 176710 short tons up from 123200 the philippines 158640 
up from 110600 and brazil 145590 up from 101500 those three 
countries account for almost half of the foreign sugar sold to the 
united states 
last december when the agriculture department set the low 
quotas officials said the cuts were justified because of decreased 
consumption with americans using more artificial and other natural 
sweeteners 
the program is designed to guarantee us producers a high price 
for their sugar and is also favored by producers of artificial 
sweeteners because they also can charge higher prices 
critics include manufacturers who use a lot of sugar in their 
products because it keeps sugar prices high 
but sugar users were pleased with the new quotas 
we applaud the secretary of agriculture said tom hammer of 
the sweetener users association which represents companies that 
use sugar 
it will stop the inflationary spiral that was going on with 
domestic sugar prices he said hammer said the need was 
immediate and urgent because my members believe that without 
it adequate supplies of sugar by late summer and fall were very 
much in doubt 
except for the elimination of panamas quota the share of sugar 
purchases allocated to each country will not change 
lyng said the new quota includes a base import quota of 975000 
tons and 2000 tons of specialty sugar 
the new allocations raised the minimum quota from 5770 tons to 
8000 
it was the first midyear increase in the sugar quota since 
april 5 1984 when there was a shortfall in us sugar cane 
production

hordes of thirsty ants driven by drought 
and heat are invading homes throughout the san francisco bay area 
in search of water and residents say no one seems to know how to 
stop them 
ive never seen anything like it there are millions of 
them said anita lowery of novato ive almost cried 
the ants are climbing out of light switches creeping into baby 
bottles and even making their way into freezers 
they are getting into bed with people when you turn on the 
water they come out of the faucet in globs people finding 
themselves taking baths with ants said dick wolbert of jackson 
pest control in novato 
experts say the tiny insects are only looking for water for 
their bonedry nests but unsympathetic human hosts are calling 
exterminators 
it is really really bad this year and its creating 
hysteria said kevin pendergraft of california exterminators in 
walnut creek 
more than 150 calls have come in each day since last weekend 
when temperatures soared to record highs he said 
the county is going under with all the ants wolbert said 
people have called in who havent had ants for 20 years they 
have them all over the house 
even ant fans wish the ants would march somewhere else 
as a scientist benny fouche admires ants as survivalists 
but as a homeowner hes being driven crazy by the insects 
persistence 
fouche a research associate in urban entomology at the 
university of california at berkeley looks for nests in the yard 
of his el cerrito home but admits hes probably wasting his time 
unless you get the queen i can almost guarantee that the ants 
will outpersevere you theyll just keep coming he said the 
colony needs food and water they have thousands of workers who 
will sacrifice themselves 
if they werent so good at surviving they wouldnt have defied 
all the pest control people in the bay area fouche said 
wolbert called the situation just another result of nature 
changing and said a similar problem occurred during the 1977 
drought 
they just have to set up a happy home they need water and a 
little food he said if you have food in your pantry or water 
in your sinks youre going to have them 
wolbert said he couldnt understand all the uproar its 
really phenomenal ants are very clean theyre always preening 
each other 
susan grippi of novato didnt share his complacency

a libyan man accused of gathering 
information about american intelligence operatives and arranging 
for the military training of american dissidents in libya has been 
ordered held without bail 
a us magistrate on friday granted bail to five other 
defendants including mousa hawamda a travel agency owner accused 
of involvement in an alleged libyan plot to assassinate a high 
government official in the united states sources have said the 
official was former white house aide oliver north who played a key 
role in the 1986 us bombing of libya 
the prosecution immediately appealed the bail for hawamda a 
naturalized american described by the fbi as a senior libyan 
intelligence operative and he was ordered held pending an appeals 
hearing early next week 
the new york times in todays editions quoted justice 
department officials as saying there is little evidence to support 
a federal prosecutors assertion that hawamda may have helped in 
the alleged plot 
the times said justice officials who asked not to be identified 
said they were baffled when us attorney henry e hudson asserted 
in open court earlier this week that hawamda should be held without 
bail because he was a libyan intelligence officer who may have 
assisted in a plot to kill a government official 
the officials who asked not to be identified said that while 
there may have been an assassination plot aimed at north the only 
information linking hawamda to such a conspiracy came from an 
informer whose reliabiity is uncertain 
hudson had no comment on the assertions that there was little 
evidence to support allegations about the assassination plot the 
times said 
f andrew carroll the lawyer representing hawamda called the 
prosecutions contention of a plot to kill a high government 
official ludicrous 
hawamda and the five others were among eight men arrested 
wednesday on suspicion of a scheme to illegally use libyan 
government funds to solicit support for libya among american 
dissidents including indians and black muslims 
fridays hearing before magistrate leonie brinkema was to 
determine whether the six would be freed on bond 
the bail ranged from 250000 for hawamda to 10000 for manhal 
ben mohamed a moroccan who worked for hawamda 
two other defendants are being held in denver colo and 
detroit mich 
alvin m binder a criminal lawyer from mississippi who 
represented four of the defendants in court said the case was 
very political binder a criminal lawyer who represented 
atlanta child murderer wayne williams in 1982 said the prosecution 
had made allegations with no concrete evidence 
hudson told reporters after the detention hearing that the 
case involves issues far beyond just a diversion of funds but he 
refused to elaborate saying additional charges would be made when 
indictments are returned possibly late next week 
speaking for the prosecution fbi special agent donald j 
bartnik said the defendant held without bail saleh alrajhi was a 
libyan intelligence operative who in june 1987 was ordered to 
gather the names and addresses of us intelligence officials 
dealing with the mediterranean region 
the fbi seized a document handwritten by alrajhi as a cover 
letter for a computer list of intelligence operatives bartnik 
said the list and letter were sent to the head of libyan 
intelligence mohamed madjoub he added 
alrajhi also wrote madjoub a memo which indicated the libyans 
had promised to fund american dissident groups in the united states 
and pay for their military training in libya bartnik said

eastern airlines announcement that it would lay 
off 4000 employees and eliminate service to 14 cities to cut costs 
was met with bitterness and fear by workers who should learn their 
fate by monday 
ive heard rumors this way since ive been working here 
said evelyn perez a ticket agent at kansas city international 
airport who has been with eastern for 11 years its always been 
felt but now its real 
the plan announced friday by the lossplagued airline would trim 
12 percent of the work force and eliminate service to the 14 cities 
on aug 31 
included among the layoffs or early retirements will be 520 jobs 
in miami 300 in atlanta and 350 in kansas city mo which will no 
longer be the carriers western hub eastern president phil bakes 
said 
the reductions also will include 1100 jobs from the new york 
city area including 600 at a reservations center in woodbridge 
nj and 500 flight attendants pilots and managers based at 
kennedy laguardia and newark airports 
last november eastern eliminated 3500 jobs mostly from the 
companys union ranks 
we are preserving the airline were strengthening the 
airline i dont care to place the blame anywhere bakes said 
citing high operating costs and increased competition for easterns 
huge losses 
but john j bavis chairman of the 3500member air line pilots 
association contingent at eastern disagreed 
theyve done nothing over the past two years except squeeze 
the assets out of eastern in order to help subsidize our sister 
airline continental he said 
both eastern and continental are subsidiaries of houstonbased 
texas air corp which lost 466 million last year 
the announcement came in the seventh month of bitter contract 
talks between eastern and the machinists union which is seeking 
raises for 10000 eastern workers the carrier is seeking 161 
million in pay cuts and other concessions 
the miamibased airline also is seeking 69 million in 
concessions from its pilots union which began formal contract 
talks with the company friday 
last year we lost 182 million in essence eastern is 
returning to its basic roots in an attempt to regain strength in 
the marketplace bakes said 
easterns operations in boston new york washington atlanta 
and miami will be the core of the carriers service he said 
the 14 cities being cut are albuquerque nm fort de france 
martinique las vegas and reno nev minneapolisst paul minn 
oklahoma city and tulsa okla omaha neb dallas and san antonio 
texas pointeapitre guadeloupe san diego st lucia west 
indies and tucson ariz 
the personnel cuts will involve both union and nonunion members 
and management personnel bakes said the reductions will reduce 
the work force to 29500 down from 43300 in september 1986 
the airline said the work force reduction would allow it to sell 
a proportional share of its fleet cutting the number of planes it 
operates from 246 to 202 in the fall 
machinists local chief charles bryan was en route to miami from 
atlanta and could not be reached friday earlier this week after 
word of the impending cuts leaked he said eastern would have no 
credibility and said texas air president frank lorenzo was 
evil 
the machinists union is seeking a twoyear contract with raises 
of 15 percent and 5 percent which eastern says will cost 50 
million yearly 
employees were shocked by the news of the layoffs said a 
reservation operator in woodbridge nj 
a lot of us have 10 or 15 years seniority and now were going 
to be looking for other jobs said the woman who would only 
identify herself as josephine theres a lot of crying going on

weddings and soccer games still stir 
iraqis arab zeal for celebration and a religious holiday can be a 
time of great feasting 
but iraqis are showing an uncharacteristic lack of jubilation 
over irans agreement to halt its 8yearold war with iraq for 
people like suad mousa the war will end only when her family is 
reunited 
i really want the guns to fall silent and for my dear husband 
to come home said the 34yearold mother of three whose husband 
has been in the army since the war began 
when the iranians said they would accept the un ceasefire 
resolution i really thought the war was finally over but it seems 
now it will take weeks and probably months before he will be 
back she said 
such warweary wariness has been common in iraq after iran 
agreed monday to accept a truce 
there was nothing no reaction said a european diplomat who 
was in baghdad on monday 
iraqis seem deeply suspicious of the iranian decision and the 
government is insisting any truce be tied to a final settlement 
parades celebrations and television specials typically greet 
iraqi victories in battle none followed the iranian announcement 
official news media and president saddam husseins ruling baath 
party have encouraged caution and continued vigilance by the 
military 
the army has continued to fight and it said thursday night it 
had recaptured 33 northern hills lost to iran in the early days of 
the war 
iran said iraqi units penetrated 12 miles into its territory 
friday and claimed iraq used chemical weapons 
exultation is common here over much less than the end of a long 
and costly war fusillades of tracer bullets lit the night sky over 
baghdad when iraq defeated rival syria in the arab soccer 
championship thursday night 
wedding parties toot car horns and bang drums as they move 
through the streets of baghdad 
families are buying sheep to slaughter for the eid aladha feast 
that marks the end of islams season of pilgrimage to mecca the 
date depends on the moon but it is expected sunday or monday 
celebration of the wars end however apparently will have to 
wait for a final peace 
diplomats in baghdad say distrust of the iranians who accepted 
a security council resolution they had rejected since its passage a 
year ago is rooted in hundreds of years of conflict between arab 
iraq and persian iran 
government officials also feel iran may want a truce only as a 
respite in which to rebuild their army which has lost several 
battles this year 
some cite iranian statements that a ceasefire does not mean the 
end of the war which irans revolutionary patriarch ayatollah 
ruhollah khomeini sees as a crusade for his own vision of islam 
iraq rejected proposals of a ceasefire two years ago when its 
own forces were being battered near the southern city of basra and 
many observers felt collapse was near 
it would certainly not accept a truce without real peace now 
that it has the upper hand militarily said a western diplomat who 
recently talked with iraqi officials he said iraq insists on 
direct peace talks with iran as a sign of serious purpose 
a european diplomat said iraqis are still going to be nervous 
about the iranians because the iranians havent been beaten and 
still are ruled by crusading clerics he said iran could be 
militarily quite potent within a year or two 
although they are not celebrating ordinary iraqis are anxious 
for the war to end 
i am an old man said 68yearold mahmoud shaker at the 
counter of his auto parts store i have been running the shop for 
four years since my elder son was conscripted i am very tired and 
i want him back to the shop and with the family

its over and atlanta is happy 
city and business officials praised their city and the publicity 
it received during the fourday democratic national convention 
which ended thursday 
the awareness of atlanta and georgia is at an alltime high 
throughout the world and that will translate into investment 
decisions in future months george berry commissioner of the 
state department of industry and trade said friday 
berry said gov joe frank harris plans a businesshunting trip 
to australia this fall and we will not have to explain to 
anybody we meet with where atlanta is and thats the big benefit 
of the convention as far as we were concerned 
many americans are still in the mindset that atlanta is 
gone with the wind said denise s dwozan spokeswoman for the 
atlanta convention and visitors bureau referring to the novel and 
film about the south during the civil war 
but she said i think they now have an excellent picture of 
atlanta in 1988 a progressive exciting city 
mayor andrew young also pleased with the city in its role as 
host plugged atlanta as a site for future major events 
i would hope that we have received the kind of good coverage 
around the world that will convince the olympic committee that we 
really know how to put on a party young said friday the city is 
the us nominee to be host of the 1996 summer games 
live broadcasts during the convention by network morning 
television shows which originated in atlanta were particularly 
helpful in dispelling myths ms dwozan said 
those programs showed atlanta is a metropolitan city with a 
fabulous skyline a lot of fortune 500 companies she said and 
people already have begun calling wanting more information the 
callers say gosh i never had any idea yall had all that down 
there so can you send me a packet 
preconvention studies estimated the convention would bring 
between 587 million and 643 million into the city which spent 
15 million to stage it 
berry and ms dwozan estimated that the direct economic impact 
was about what had been predicted but they stressed the shortterm 
gain was not their goal 
the city already is a major convention town ms dwozan said so 
the hope is that tourism will increase and businesses will look 
closer at moving to atlanta or georgia because of interest 
generated by the convention 
ms dwozan said convention bureau president ted sprague 
estimates the city received about 1 billion worth of media 
awareness worldwide we could never have afforded an 
advertising campaign like that 
for the most part she said atlanta was accurately 
portrayed some of the stories that were negative were accurate 
atlanta is not perfect we do have things that need improving 
and some of the stories touched on that all in all were 
thrilled 
the atlanta chamber of commerce had set as a particular goal 
keeping the 15000 reporters in town informed about the city and 
trying to make it easy for them to work hoping the city would look 
good 
in that we overwhelmingly achieved that objective said 
chamber spokesman barry king it was great it was fantastic 
exposure a little bit of the good a little bit of the notsogood 
nobody really zinged us badly king said the city 
performed fantastically hospitality was truly gracious in all 
respects police and security people were outstanding they looked 
good the demonstrators got their point across 
we couldnt have bought this kind of exposure he said

democratic presidential nominee michael 
dukakis and running mate lloyd bentsen launched their general 
election campaign friday with a trip to bentsens home turf and a 
promise that were going to make every american a shareholder in 
the american dream 
about 1000 supporters endured blazing heat to greet the 
democratic ticket on an airport tarmac here adjacent to bentsens 
hometown of mission i dont want to kid you dukakis said 
this is going to be a tough race 
a mexican band played and both dukakis and bentsen perspiring 
in the july heat addressed the crowd in both english and spanish 
dukakis command of spanish helped him win texas in the super 
tuesday primary 
you know how important texas is going to be to us and we need 
your help dukakis told residents of the state also claimed as 
home by the certain republican nominee george bush i know what 
you did on super tuesday for michael dukakis you can do it again 
bentsen said what we have seen on the part of michael dukakis 
is a reaching out a bringing in of all segments of society 
the pair met briefly with reporters asked about bush campaign 
manager lee atwaters characterization of his acceptance speech as 
negative and nonspecific dukakis replied well hes an expert 
on both subjects 
dukakis and bentsen then headed to houston for another rally 
after which they traveled to california for the night 
dukakis was greeted at the stockton calif airport by a large 
crowd some of whom said they had waited as long as two hours to 
catch a glimpse of he democratic nominee 
in houston dukakis stood with bentsen their arms upraised at 
a rally surrounded by the citys skyscrapers before a crowd of 
about 3000 people 
the republicans are confused dukakis said they dont 
know what to make of this ticket and theyre worried let me tell 
you because they know were not going to concede one single state 
of the 50 to the republican party this fall 
bentsen was to accompany dukakis throughout a fivestate 
coasttocoast swing through the weekend 
aboard their plane were several members of the texas 
congressional delegation and ann richards the state treasurer who 
delivered the democratic keynote address in atlanta last monday 
night 
enroute to mcallen dukakis noted that the community is in the 
rio grande valley an area suffering unemployment of 25 30 35 
percent 
were going to make every american a shareholder in the 
american dream thats what this campaign is all about he said 
earlier former democratic rival jesse jackson gave dukakis and 
bentsen an enthusiastic sendoff from atlanta before a crowd of 
jacksons convention delegates jackson called on his supporters to 
provide the ticket with the same street heat that led to civil 
rights gains in the 1960s he said they needed to find millions of 
new voters for the november election 
weve got to keep on that street heat enough heat for 
george bush to get out of the kitchen jackson said 
the stakes are very high dukakis said before leaving 
atlanta where he accepted the democratic nomination thursday 
night we cant take another four years of what weve been going 
through for the last eight 
the campaign stakes in texas are the third highest in the 
country it trails only california and new york in electoral votes 
with 29 and dukakis is counting on bentsen to put those in the 
democratic column 
the senior senators personal popularity in the lone star state 
is solid and his fundraising ability unparalleled he first won 
the senate in 1970 by defeating thencongressman bush and has been 
reelected twice since netting 60 percent of the vote in 1982 and 
hes staying on the ballot again this year 
modesto calif was the next stop after the texas visit where 
the ticket will be eyeing californias top prize of 41 electoral 
votes the swing back east will take them through minot nd and 
st louis mo and then a rally in pennsylvania fourth with 25 
votes in the electoral college 
dukakis aides said the trip was designed to demonstrate their 
intent to battle in every state conceding none to the republicans 
jackson and his audience gave a polite reception to bentsen the 
more conservative half of the ticket jackson acknowledged that 
bentsen might be what the democatic party ticket needed now 
he represents a wing we represent a wing he said it 
takes two wings to fly 
jackson compared bentsen with lyndon johnson who was viewed 
with skepticism by blacks but who rose to the occasion and 
became a force behind the civil rights legislation when he became 
president but jackson also needled bentsen implying that people 
should vote for him for president to get him out of the senate 
in practical terms it means the contras have lost a vote 
bentsen applauded jacksons remarks and recited for the group 
his own record on civil rights he asked for their support saying 
indifference is not an option in 1988 and at the end received 
a standing ovation

the soviet union has developed a plan that 
would give each nation unprecedented access to each others bomber 
bases strategic naval ports and military ships as a way of 
verifying constraints on cruise missiles according to a report 
published today 
the washington post quoting soviet officials reported the 
proposal calls for permanently stationing teams of us and soviet 
inspectors outside factories where cruise missiles are produced 
where their warheads are installed and where the weapons are loaded 
onto submarines and other ships 
it also calls for periodic inspection of military bases where 
longrange aircraft are equipped with cruise missiles and 
shortnotice inspections of unrelated sites where cruise missiles 
are strongly suspected of being illegally stored 
the post said the kremlin plan was outlined in interviews with 
viktor karpov the soviet foreign ministrys disarmament chief and 
col gen nikolai chervov senior arms control adviser on the 
soviet general staff 
according to karpov and chervov soviet leader mikhail s 
gorbachev still wants to sign an agreement with president reagan 
sharply cutting strategic offensive nuclear arms and incorporating 
these inspection rights to verify each sides compliance 
but the soviet officials said the reagan administration thus far 
has blocked the plan because of navy and air force resistance to 
proposed soviet inspections they called on reagan to make a 
political decision in the next six weeks to overrule the military 
or see his hopes for agreement dashed 
this is a twoway process the post quoted chervov as 
saying we are not happy about us inspection personnel on our 
submarines but if we are serious about controlling arms then we 
should agree on inspections of anything

five men and a woman dueled politely 
over the divisive issue of women priests at the world conference of 
525 anglican bishops 
three came out against women priests or urged caution and two 
were in favor with archbishop of canterbury robert runcie holding 
an advisory role at panel discussions on friday 
runcie is leader of the worlds 70 million anglicans whose 
leaders are tackling the question at the lambeth conference held 
every 10 years the 525 bishops attending are from 164 countries 
runcie recalled that the 1978 conference agreed that the 
decisions of any of the 27 selfgoverning churches should be 
respected by the others whether they agreed or not 
but since then he said matters are not what they were he 
referred to the ordination of more than 1200 women priests and 
more than 1400 women deacons priestly assistants who can conduct 
baptisms marriages and funerals but not holy communion 
runcie says the anglican communion could break up if a woman 
bishop is consecrated a step now being considered by the us 
episcopalians and new zealand anglicans he said opposing male 
bishops would not feel in communion with a woman bishop thereby 
sundering traditional links within the church 
the rev nan arrington peete who was ordained in los angeles in 
the us episcopal church and now works in indianapolis and 
archbishop of canada michael peers spoke out strongly in favor of 
admitting women to the priesthood 
ms peete told the bishops that under her leadership her 
congregation in all saints parish increased fundraising and 
activity to help the homeless 
in her city episcopal priests as well as roman catholic 
priests and sisters seek me out for spiritual direction ms 
peete said 
peers said canadian anglicans have ordained women priests since 
1976 
he said women now enrich the clergy in a way that had not been 
so before and they promise to enrich our lives 
the us episcopalians and the anglican church of canada have 
ordained 1163 of the 1269 women admitted to the priesthood by a 
quarter of the worlds anglican churches the majority still refuse 
women priests 
anglicans are the worlds second largest body of christians 
after the roman catholic church 
the bishop of london graham leonard the leading opponent of 
women priests and bishops in the church of england anglicanisms 
mother church said women priests already had impaired communion 
he said people had left the anglican church in some places where 
women have been ordained 
much greater impairment will inevitably take place if women 
are consecrated to the episcopate he said 
leonard listed 10 profound concerns of the opponents of 
women priests and bishops the foremost are that god chose to 
embody himself in a man jesus christ and that jesus chose 12 men 
for his apostles 
a palestinian presiding bishop samir kafity of the episcopal 
church in jerusalem and the middle east said it was only natural 
to consider women priests when there are women scientists judges 
and political leaders 
but he said roman catholics were firmly against women priests 
and bishops and that the orthodox churches also objected so 
those who seek the unity of christendom must take this fact into 
consideration kafity said 
archbishop of brisbane john grindrod primate of australia 
stressed the dangers to the anglican communion of consecrating a 
woman bishop 
he said it might be necessary to appoint a special group to 
produce guidelines for womens ordination if the conference did not 
have time

surgeon general c everett koop says he fears 
a wave of retribution against smokers drunken drinkers and 
others whose actions are seen as a public health threat could 
spread to aids victims by the next decade 
such a response would be tragic but not unexpected to the 
health profession koop said on friday 
he cited the recent passing of laws to segregate smokers and 
public retribution against drunk drivers teenagers who become 
pregnant drug addicts and wife beaters 
koop said it is possible that the american people already 
traveling the road of retribution will extend that retribution 
against aids victims in the 1990s when the annual health bill 
for the disease reaches 5 billion 
the surgeon general commented in a speech after receiving an 
honorary fellowship from the american college of legal medicine

the official tass news agency corrected an earlier 
report to say that the soviets are ready to dismantle equipment at 
a controversial radar station in siberia not the entire station 
itself 
the united states says the krasnoyarsk radar station in south 
central siberia violates the 1972 antiballistic missile treaty 
that limits the missile defenses each superpower can build 
us officials say the buildings that now house the radar 
station must go because they could be used to hide materials after 
the radar itself is dismantled 
but the latest tass dispatch transmitted friday spoke only of 
the dismantling of equipment 
us officials say the krasnoyarsk radar could be used to help 
direct the soviet response to a nuclear missile attack the soviets 
say the radar is designed to track space objects and is not subject 
to the abm treaty 
on tuesday foreign ministry official viktor p karpov told a 
government news briefing that the soviets were ready to take action 
on the krasnoyarsk radar if the united states committed itself to 
observing the abm treaty for at least 10 years 
tass originally quoted karpov as saying if an understanding 
to abide by the abm treaty as signed in 1972 is reached the 
soviet union will be ready to dismantle the krasnoyarsk radar in a 
verifiable way that would leave no doubts on the part of the united 
states 
that sparked speculation at the geneva superpower arms talks 
that the soviets had agreed to us demands 
but fridays dispatch from the soviet news agency said that due 
to a translators error some of karpovs words had been dropped 
and that his statement should have said the soviet union was ready 
to dismantle the equipment of the krasnoyarsk radar

democrat michael dukakis has begun his campaign for the white 
house with sen lloyd bentsen in a symbolic trip to his running 
mates texas home turf and a blast at george bush saying the 
republicans wouldnt know a balanced budget if it hit them in the 
face 
traveling together in triumphant departure from their convention 
city of atlanta the new democratic ticket made a parting appeal to 
jesse jacksons loyalists and then flew to texas to tout their new 
bostonaustin connection and declare their intention to sweep the 
state that is bushs adopted home 
the republicans are all confused they dont know what to 
make of this ticket dukakis said in houston with the texas 
senator by his side 
and theyre worried let me tell you because they know were 
not going to concede one single state of the 50 to the republican 
party this fall he said 
the candidates left on their campaign stump with praise from 
jackson but the civil rights leader said his followers will be 
ready to turn up the street heat to make sure the nominees 
follow the jackson agenda 
you ask us trust you jackson said to dukakis and bentsen 
all that we can ask of anyone is that they not betray that 
trust 
bush campaigning in milwaukee praised dukakis acceptance 
speech as very good but harped on the differences between 
dukakis and bentsen saying dukakis is far more liberal on most 
issues than his running mate bush predicted the democratic party 
will be running against itself by the time we get through 
bush was scheduled to make campaign appearances today at a law 
enforcement convention in tampa fla and in memphis tenn 
dukakis and bentsen were traveling together in california today 
continuing their threeday crosscountry campaign kickoff swing 
with a rally in californias san joaquin valley before flying to 
minot nd for an appearance at the state fair 
although north dakota has but three electoral votes they were 
journeying to the droughtstricken state in part to make clear 
their intention to challenge bush in all regions of the country 
including the agricultural midwest as well as the electoral giants 
the first stop out of atlanta was mcallen in the southern tip of 
texas and the rio grande valley not far from bentsens hometown 
mission and later to houston which both bentsen and bush claim as 
homes 
the democrats spoke before about 1000 people in sweltering heat 
on the airport tarmac in mcallen where many in the crowd sought 
shelter under umbrellas and some in the heavily hispanic audience 
waved red and black flags of the united farmworkers union 
bentsen called it fitting that the first stop was his home 
region and dukakis displayed his fluent spanish to appeal to the 
crowd while reminding them that both he and bentsen have immigrant 
roots 
and now we are the nominees the son of immigrants and the 
grandson of immigrants he told them thats america my 
friends 
at a news conference dukakis responded to criticism from bush 
his republican opponent 
if the vice president wants to spend all his time talking 
about labels i guess he can do so but we know who balances 
budgets and who doesnt the massachusetts governor said 
in houston dukakis stood with bentsen their arms upraised at a 
rally surrounded by the citys skyscrapers and before a large crowd 
that numbered 3000 or more hundreds more lined the street for a 
block as they left 
ive brought a friend home from massachusetts bentsen said 
drawing cheers from his homestate crowd house speaker jim wright 
of fort worth appeared with them 
earlier in atlanta dukakis had asked jackson delegates for 
support in a joint appearance where jackson had declared his 
support for dukakis and said he should be president 
jackson also remarked that bentsens selection to the ticket 
means the contras have lost a vote and bentsen was asked later 
whether that meant he had changed his position on aid to the 
antisandinista rebels in nicaragua 
no i havent changed my position at all bentsen said 
there are those things where were going to have some 
differences i think that showed some of the qualities of this man 
that hes quite willing to listen to different viewpoints

leaders of the nicaraguan rebels 
struggling to quell internal dissent say they will seek a new 
round of peace talks with the leftist sandinista government 
alfredo cesar one of the seven contra directors said friday he 
is asking president oscar arias of costa rica to arrange the talks 
cesar also said col enrique bermudez a controversial hardliner 
who was elected to the rebel political leadership this week will 
step down as military commander of the usbacked rebel forces 
cesar told a news conference that bermudez will be the 
military supervisor of our military forces but without any 
command 
the sandinistas have said bermudezs election to the political 
directorate of the nicaraguan resistance makes the possibility of 
negotiating peace even more remote 
the contras and the sandinistas have been trying to negotiate an 
end to their sevenyear war since march the talks have been 
prompted in large part by the regional peace plan that won arias 
last years nobel peace prize 
cesar is the chief contra negotiator in the talks 
the last round of talks ended in a stalemate on june 9 and no 
new talks have been scheduled a temporary truce however is still 
in place after repeated extensions 
the sandinistas accused the cia of engineering bermudezs 
election to the political directorate of the nicaraguan resistance 
they said his election removes the contra leaderships civilian 
mask 
bermudez who publicly resisted peace talks with the 
sandinistas was a colonel in the national guard of the rightist 
proamerican somoza dynasty that ruled nicaragua for 42 years until 
the sandinistas overthrew it in 1979 
his background is a source of suspicion for some members of the 
resistance who fear the rebel movement is turning to the right 
the controversy heated up after bermudez was elected to the 
directorate monday in the dominican republic the seven commanders 
of the small contra organization called the southern front which 
has a political base in costa rica resigned in protest 
bermudez was the top military commander of the main 
hondurasbased contra force 
cesar publicly appealed to the seven friday to withdraw their 
resignations he said the new directorate will delegate areas of 
responsibility and in this sense col enrique bermudez will step 
down next week from the general command of the national liberation 
army 
cesar said the leaders who resigned were frustrated that they 
were not getting us aid he said the costa rican government would 
not allow delivery through costa rica 
the contra force led by bermudez got us aid through honduras 
cesar said the contras asked arias two months ago for permission 
to deliver humanitarian aid through the costa rican red cross but 
have received no reply 
congress cut off military aid to the contras in february

residents say they warned 
authorities for weeks about a crack in a concrete water tank that 
collapsed releasing a 750000gallon wave that killed four people 
injured 19 and destroyed nine homes 
but as always they never listen perfecto guerrero de la 
cruz said friday as he paused from digging through his houses 
rubble with a pickax 
the gray rectangular tank was near the top of a steep hill 
overlooking a neighborhood of adobe cinderblock and concrete 
houses a 120footlong wall broke away from the tank without 
warning about 920 am friday 
we heard a very loud sound like an explosion said vicenta 
saucedo 33 she said she followed her daughters when they went out 
to see what had happened i saw a torrent of water flowing past 
nineyearold martin torrez de la rosa was grinding corn near 
the bottom of the hill when he heard the noise and looked up 
when i was running away i saw a boy over there he said in 
a shaking voice pointing to a spot farther downhill the water 
took him away 
the water swept away people walls roofs furniture and 
clothing survivors dug through the rubble friday afternoon 
searching for buried possessions in this border town near el paso 
texas 
some residents dried their salvaged clothes on parked cars 
others cleared spots in the dirt where they placed dishes 
appliances religious artifacts and other items 
three people died at the scene and a fourth died later in a 
hospital fire chief gabriel rodriguez said 
city engineer luis soria told the el paso heraldpost that 
authorities were looking into the possibility that the 3yearold 
tanks foundation was weakened by three weeks of unusually heavy 
rainfall 
manuel ortega director of the city water and sanitation 
department said he inspected the tank after the collapse and could 
find no defects in materials workmanship or design 
the rectangular gray tank measured 120 feet by 60 feet and rose 
about 12 feet from the ground cracks started developing in the 
walls a few weeks ago said guerrero adding that he and other 
neighbors reported the problem to authorities 
the tank was filled earlier this year giving residents of two 
subdivisions running water for the first time 
so we finally got water but then we got too much and lost a 
life guerrero said 
guerreros 17yearold nephew francisco olvera guerrero was 
killed jorge martinez 3 and jose antonio martinez lin 9 also 
were dead at the scene the fire chief said rodriguez said a man 
died friday afternoon at a hospital and that his identity was 
being withheld pending notification of relatives 
one person was in critical condition at juarez general hospital 
a police spokeswoman said twelve others were hospitalized with 
minor injures and about six others were treated and released 
irene vallez who lives near the accident site said she also 
had seen cracks in the tanks walls she said water started leaking 
from the structures roof last week prompting her to call 
authorities 
she said she saw water trickling down the street from the tanks 
direction about 905 am friday then about 15 minutes later i 
heard a sound like an explosion 
the east wall appeared to have broken away cleanly from the rest 
of the tank a 90foot section of the wall was thrown 20 feet 
across a dirt road where it came to rest leaning against a house 
steel reinforcing bars sticking out of the broken concrete like a 
cats whiskers 
the rest of the 9inchthick wall was pushed to the side and 
blocked the road the tanks other three walls and roof stayed 
intact the tank was one of 23 serving the city ortega said 
the water slammed into the homes before draining into a gully 
about 100 yards downhill from the tank 
mayor jaime bermudez promised that families made homeless would 
be guaranteed shelter food and clothing water service was 
restored to the area friday evening by reconnecting homes to a 
metal water tank

a federal judge who threatened an attorney 
with jail over the use of ms and her maiden name is no 
stranger to such threats say lawyers who practice in his courtroom 
there is no more powerful man than an american judge sitting 
in his courtroom he is a king said allen brunwasser who once 
spent 48 hours in jail for missing a hearing before senior us 
district judge hubert teitelbaum 
i felt seriously threatened said leonard sharon who was 
surrounded by federal marshals when teitelbaum objected to a 
petition he tried to file its also humiliating because it can 
affect the way jurors look at you and your case 
teitelbaum prompted feminists to demand his resignation and the 
local bar association to launch an investigation into courtroom 
sexism when he recently ordered attorney barbara wolvovitz to use 
her husbands last name and not use ms during a trial 
attorneys who have appeared before teitelbaum said friday his 
courtroom antics began years ago 
teitelbaum 73 a former us attorney and fbi agent who took 
the bench in 1971 could not be reached for comment friday there 
were no answers at his office or home telephones he consistently 
has refused to talk to reporters 
sharon now practicing law in auburn maine said teitelbaum 
ordered him arrested and called him a liar in 1984 over a petition 
the judge claimed contained errors 
i didnt lie but if he has facts that say i did someone else 
should have decided the issue sharon said he cant pitch and 
call balls and strikes at the same time 
the judge later vacated his order 
stanley preiser who now practices in charleston wva and 
boca raton fla said teitelbaum called him a dumb jew and 
threatened him with jail in 1985 when he asked the judge to 
reschedule a case around a jewish holiday 
he said it was the first time i had known you were jewish 
because i have never met a dumb jew before recalled george 
mahfood preisers cocounsel in the case 
i was stunned and astounded preiser said that courtroom 
was totally different from any other american courtroom i had been 
in before 
teitelbaum stepped down from the case after the two attorneys 
filed motions to the 3rd us circuit court of appeals for his 
disqualification mahfood said the judge was enraged over the 
motions to have him disqualified 
he told us it was improper to investigate him and if we 
continued wed be put in jail he said 
in 1973 teitelbaum dispatched marshals to a local court for 
brunwasser who was finishing a trial there teitelbaum had 
brunwasser jailed for 48 hours for contempt for not attending a 
hearing scheduled at the same time 
brunwasser served the time but the 3rd circuit overruled 
teitelbaum and cleared brunwasser of contempt 
hes got a napoleonic complex said pittsburgh attorney 
harvey daniels hes very bright hes very knowledgable in the 
law but hes very domineering he takes over your case and tries 
it for you

the official soviet news agency reported friday on the results 
of first deputy foreign minister yuli m vorontsovs visit to 
tehran the iranian capital tass said much attention during 
vorontsovs visit was paid to developments in afghanistan 
soviet troops began withdrawing from afghanistan on may 15 
soviet forces entered the country in december 1979 to help fight 
rebels opposed to kabuls moscowbacked government 
many of those insurgents are moslem fundamentalists supported by 
tehran in their fight against the marxist government that took 
power in april 1978 after a bloody coup 
the soviet side pointed out in particular that iran might 
make its contribution to the cause of normalizing the situation in 
afghanistan tass said it was agreed that the sides would 
continue to discuss the issue constructively 
tass gave no further details but the soviets presumably were 
eeking an end in iranian aid to the afghan insurgents the soviets 
repeatedly have accused pakistan of violating international 
agreements on afghanistan by not stopping arms and munitions 
shipments to the rebels through pakistani territory 
during his threeday visit to tehran which ended friday 
vorontsov met with iranian president sayed ali khamenei and foreign 
minister ali akbar velayati and he held businesslike talks

promote the return of soviet servicemen who are being kept by the 
afghan armed opposition to the soviet union tass said the 
iranian side promised to render assistance in this respect

and are presumed to be held by the rebels 
in june the soviet red cross and red crescent societies 
appealed to iran pakistan and the united states as well as to the 
afghan guerrillas to help secure the return of the missing men 
previous soviet diplomatic efforts on prisoners of war have 
focused on pakistan last month in moscow foreign minister eduard 
a shevardnadze summoned the pakistani ambassador to ask for his 
help in securing the prisoners return

afghanistan before the pullout began under terms of the 
unbrokered agreement on afghanistan signed in geneva in april 
half of the soviet troops are supposed to be home by aug 15 and

about 2500 followers gave evangelist jimmy 
swaggart forgiveness money and a standing ovation in his first 
crusade outside louisiana since he was defrocked amid reports he 
hired a prostitute 
i thank you for your kindness and your love swaggart said 
friday night as he opened a threeday revival i thank you for 
literally opposing every force of darkness and saying we love 
you 
the free meetings were not supported by the national or local 
assemblies of god swaggarts former denomination but many 
followers had already forgiven the baton rouge evangelist 
i came out to support him i feel as christians we really need 
to stick together said glorisdine smith an indianapolis 
schoolteacher who brought her two children im pretty sure other 
ministers are sinning they just havent been found out yet 
jerri smoot 24 made her yearly trip from danville ill with 
her husband and two children to see swaggart 
i have forgiven him when he got on tv and told the whole 
world to forgive him i think they did she said 
in february swaggart made a tearful televised confession that 
he had committed an unspecified sin against god and his family the 
confession was followed by allegations he hired a prostitute to 
perform lewd acts while he watched 
debra murphree the selfadmitted prostitute who contended 
swaggart paid her to perform lives in patoka ind 
swaggart captivated the crowd when he shook the bible and 
highstepped across the stage in moves reminiscent of his cousin 
rock singer jerry lee lewis 
i would love to be more calm were i talking about abraham 
lincoln but im talking about jesus he said 
he later directed followers who thought they had committed sins 
to the foot of the stage where he saved them 
donald rodgers 41 of indianapolis was among a handful of 
protesters outside market square arena before the revival some 
carried signs reading ban christianity and ban the bible 
he pays a prostitute gets caught gets thrown out of church 
and still wants to preach rodgers said he calls himself a 
christian the man is a hypocrite 
inside swaggart urged followers to contribute up to 100 in 
cash or checks promising every dime and dollar would help save 
his ailing television show that appears on few stations nationwide 
each cancellation of his show makes him feel like my heart has 
been ripped out swaggart said 
an extensive selection of swaggart albums tapes videocassettes 
and books was for sale during the crusade and volunteers promoted 
10 albums or five tapes for 20 
people never tire of hearing the word of god said a woman 
volunteer who declined to give her name 
no estimate on the value of fridays contributions and sales was 
available from crusade officials 
swaggart returned to the pulpit may 22 but was defrocked by the 
assemblies of god for refusing to abstain from preaching for a year 
while undergoing professional counseling he said his 
multimilliondollar global ministry could not survive such an 
absence 
swaggart 52 said the indianapolis crusade offered a fresh 
start 
ive changed an awful lot he said after a dress rehearsal 
im more keenly aware of the hurt and pain of other people im 
more aware of their weaknesses and despair

civilian government and appointed himself head of the army and home 
affairs minister in charge of internal security

heading up the investigation of the crash said there is little 
doubt that the plane ran out of fuel 
he said he is trying to find out if the crew sacrificed some of 
its fuel load to carry more cargo roth said he has received a 
report that the planes cargo was 22000 pounds and the fuel load 
was only 1800 gallons 
the fourengine propeller driven aircraft belonged to universal 
air equipment leasing inc of miami and was operated by fiorelli 
crews of miami according to a news release from taca airlines 
taca had chartered the flight to carry a payload of handicrafts 
seafood and other cargo from san salvador el salvador to new 
orleans

hundreds of faithful from across texas 
have been flocking to a cavernous underground church each week to 
hear parishioners report what they claim are messages of peace and 
hope from the virgin mary 
crowds have grown from a handful of worshipers into hundreds 
and are expected to swell to 20000 for a roman catholic feast day 
next month 
the largest gathering so far was monday night when 800 attended 
a mass and rosary service at st john neumann catholic church 
parish officials said 
the worshipers came to see three parishioners who knelt on the 
altar scribbling the messages in notebooks as the congregation 
recited the rosary which is a series of prayers counted off on a 
string of beads also called a rosary 
after the prayers the crowd fell silent as the first of the 
messengers read from his notebook 
my dear little children listen to me your mother i want to 
help you read mike slate i want you to be in heaven where we 
can pray and serve our father for all eternity yes my dear ones 
you must have signs and you will have these signs but it will 
be up to you to believe 
messages from slate a retired air force officer were followed 
by others from mary constancio a former hospital therapist and 
teresa werner a housewife and mother 
my children do not be sad read mrs constancio softly 
after first delivering the message in spanish have joy in your 
hearts have peace listen to the prayer that you ask for the lord 
will give it to you 
worshipers then crowded around the messengers seeking 
blessings the three laid their hands on those who said they were 
seeking help for physical or personal problems 
bob golec who journeyed to the service from midlothian texas 
in june said his chronic knee problems disappeared after mrs 
werner relayed a message from mary to him and the church pastor 
said a healing prayer for him 
i believe this special healing was a sign to strengthen my 
faith he said others attending the weekly monday night rosaries 
have also claimed healings or said they smelled roses or felt 
marys presence 
monsignor joseph james pastor of the church built partially 
underground during 1972 to save on energy bills said he and other 
parishioners began feeling marys presence after a trip in january 
to medjugorje yugoslavia they visited a spot where four 
visionaries have been reporting apparitions of the virgin since 
1981 
this has been lifechanging for me james said its much 
more lifegiving than any of the theological stuff ive read 
there have been skeptics but james said it doesnt bother him 
i cant say somebody has to believe this he said 
lubbock bishop michael sheehan is on vacation and has not 
commented publicly about the message reports 
james said he has interpreted many of the messages as indicating 
that something miraculous will happen aug 15 the day catholics 
celebrate the assumption of mary into heaven 
i think were going to see some beautiful beautiful thing 
experience her presence said the 56yearold priest 
david garza the parishioner in charge of planning for the aug 
15 rosary said the church is making plans with the city for crowd 
and traffic control for the event church officials said they are 
expecting 20000 people based on the number of calls they have 
received 
although james said many peoples lives have been touched by the 
reported messages and hundreds of people have discovered his 
church hes worried that the messages may stop 
you always have people jumping on the bandwagon james said 
the question is who will be there in the heat of the day whos 
going to be praying when there arent any messages

a newspaper reported today that an 
attack aboard a greek cruise ship that left nine people dead 
actually was a clash between palestinian terrorists and the israeli 
secret service 
the copenhagen bt paper said an abu nidal terrorist squad and 
agents of mossad israels secret service opened fire on each 
other on the liner city of poros on july 11 after mossad stopped 
the terrorists from hijacking the ship 
israeli and greek government officials had no immediate comment 
abu nidals group on thursday denied accusations it staged the 
attack 
the paper quoted danish intelligence officers and unidentified 
diplomatic sources as saying the abu nidal group started shooting 
after watching a television news report saying a car bomb detonated 
outside the greek port city of piraeus 
greek police said the car bomb went off prematurely six hours 
before the ship was due to dock and killed two people in the car 
bt said the terrorists planned to bring explosives from the 
car aboard the cruise ship when the vessel arrived in piraeus with 
471 passengers and that the explosives were to be used in a 
hijacking 
instead the explosives were detonated by mossad to avert the 
hijacking the newspaper said 
it said two of those killed in the attack on the city of poros 
are believed to be abu nidal terrorists ninetyeight people were 
wounded in the attack 
bt said danish intelligence is working on the case because 
libyan passport holder hejab jaballa identified by the greek 
government as the likely leader of the terrorist attack arrived in 
greece on a flight from copenhagen june 1 
jaballa previously has been identified as involved in the 
assassination of an egyptian newspaper editor for which abu nidal 
claimed responsibility 
anastassios sehiotis greek public order minister said 
wednesday that jaballas real name is khadar samir mohammed 
on thursday abu nidals fatahrevolutionary council said it had 
nothing to do with the ship attack and that mohammed has been dead 
since 1985 it did not say where or how he died 
abu nidal whose real name is sabry albanna has been blamed 
for many terrorist attacks including those on the rome and vienna 
airports in december 1985 in which 22 people were killed and more 
than 80 wounded

a judge fined a flamboyant parachutist 200 for 
jumping off a 43story skyscraper last fall but suspended a 30day 
jail sentence on condition that he make no more jumps this year 
but robin heid 34 who defended himself promised more jumps 
saying if he did not go to jail in the next year i would not be 
doing my job as a citizen and you can quote me on that 
denver county court judge brian campbell sentenced heid on 
friday after a sixperson jury convicted him of reckless 
endangerment a misdemeanor 
i guess we set a precedent against jumping off buildings 
said prosecutor henry cooper i dont know how much weight a 
county jurys decision holds 
heid whose first trial ended in a hung jury wore to court the 
same navy pinstripe suit he wore last sept 18 when he did a 
15second freefall from the top of the 1999 broadway building and 
then parachuted to a landing on a sidewalk 530 feet below 
it was all a part of a publicity stunt to sell his book two 
dozen of his skydiving buddies were waiting for him at a 
booksigning party 
cooper told jurors heid thumbs his nose at the law as shown in 
1979 when he saluted yosemite national park rangers while leaping 
off the 2200foot el capitan 
i was very polite heid said i told them have a nice 
day and then i jumped

winstonsalem nc ap workers in a building hit by a small 
plane say they tried to save a man screaming for help in the 
wreckage but the aircraft exploded before they could reach him 
all four people aboard died in the crash 
the flames were shooting 10 to 15 feet into the air bg 
melton a machinist at the manufacturing plant said friday night 
i ran back and alerted my coworkers by intercom 
none of the 23 people in the jepson burns corp plant were 
injured in the accident which happened about 930 pm shortly 
after the singleengine cherokee 180 took off from smith reynolds 
airport 
a greensboro pilot who declined to give his name said he 
watched the crash from the air 
we were on our final approach when we saw a big fireball i 
heard an airplane on the ground radio the tower and ask if they saw 
the crash he said the pilot said the plane appeared to stall 
during takeoff 
officials at the airport did not confirm the deaths but a 
firefighter who refused to identify himself told the greensboro 
news amp record that everyone on the plane was killed 
a spokeswoman for the national transportation safety board in 
atlanta said a team of investigators would be on the scene today 
a flight plan for such an aircraft is not required and no plan 
was filed said jack barker a federal aviation administration 
official in atlanta 
the plane had just fueled and reportedly was taking off for 
myrtle beach sc when it crashed through the roof of the plant 
a threebuilding complex that manufactures airplane seat covers 
officials said 
the workers inside the onestory building escaped safely said 
mike kingsbury an employee of jepson burns 
the plane went through the roof into the sewing department 
said kingsbury who saw the accident from a guards post about 200 
yards away 
the fire at the plant was extinguished within 20 minutes fire 
officials said five people were working inside the building the 
plane smashed into said billie melton a jepson burns employee 
they all went out the back door melton said 
theres a fire wall between where they were working and where 
the plane went down at smoke drove them out the other door he

a jury verdict awarding 700000 in damages 
to a confidential source whose name was revealed by two newspapers 
could open the door to scores of similar lawsuits a first 
amendment expert says 
the st paul pioneer press dispatch and the star tribune were 
ordered friday to pay 200000 in actual damages and 250000 each 
in punitive damages to dan cohen for a 1982 story that named him as 
the source of information about a political candidates shoplifting 
conviction years earlier 
cohen said reporters had promised him anonymity 
the jury decided that a promise of confidentiality was an oral 
contract 
its very important to keep your word a tearful cohen said 
after the verdict thats the hard currency of journalism thats 
the hard currency of politics when that currency is devalued we 
all suffer 
the verdict distressed journalists who have faced contempt 
charges and jail for not revealing sources and now could face 
damages if they do 
i believe this is absolutely unprecedented said floyd 
abrams a new york citybased attorney who has represented the new 
york times nbc and other media organizations 
if not reversed this decision opens the door for an enormous 
range of real or imagined sources to claim that in one way or 
another theyve been victimized by the press abrams said 
john finnegan senior vice presidentassistant publisher for the 
st paul pioneer press dispatch and tim mcguire managing editor 
of the star tribune said an appeal is likely of the hennepin 
county jurys 51 verdict 
what weve been saying is disclosure of an 11thhour dirty 
trick was at least as important as the 12yearold shoplifting 
record which cohen was revealing mcguire said 
finnegan said the punitive damages associated with a finding of 
fraud and misrepresentation ignores the fact that the editors 
involved handled the story honestly fairly and accurately 
in no way did we misrepresent nor were we guilty of fraud in 
our dealings with mr cohen finnegan said 
gary pruitt counsel for mcclatchy newspapers inc in 
california said the verdict was understandable because the judge 
did not instruct the jury on first amendment issues 
making a reportersource relationship a simple contract gives 
those who want to sue the press a new way to circumvent 
constitutional protections pruitt said 
the suit centered on a decision by editors at both newspapers to 
overrule their reporters and use cohens name at the time cohen 
was a spokesman for wheelock whitney an independentrepublican 
candidate for governor 
six days before the election cohen gave reporters documents 
showing that marlene johnson a democraticfarmerlabor candidate 
for lieutenant governor admitted shoplifting 6 in merchandise 
the documents were given on condition cohens identity not be 
revealed 
the day the stories appeared cohen was fired from his 
35000ayear job as a public relations executive with an 
advertising agency said his attorney elliott rothenberg cohen 
claimed he lost 725000 in wages and pension 
cohen now has his own public relations firm and made 93000 
last year according to testimony 
in a related development the star tribune began recalling all 
640000 copies of this weekends sunday magazine after a person 
quoted by name in the magazine said she had been promised anonymity 
executive editor joel kramer told the pioneer press dispatch 
that the cohen case figured in our thinking but im not saying 
thats our only reason he said publisher roger parkinson made 
the decision after editors concluded they werent sure whether a 
pledge of anonymity had been given by the freelancer who wrote the 
article

the oppositioncontrolled national 
assembly today passed bills aimed at forcing former president chun 
doohwan and his family to testify before the assembly on 
corruption charges 
the bills passed unanimously with controversial provisions 
rewritten in a compromise between the governing and opposition 
parties 
president roh taewoo vetoed earlier oppositionsponsored bills 
and urged the assembly to revise provisions empowering it to summon 
witnesses with writs of arraignment issued by courts 
under the new bills lawmakers can subpoena witnesses with 
nonbinding writs of summons issued by the assembly 
it was not immediately known if the writs would be effective in 
bringing chun before the assembly the opposition accuses rohs 
government of trying to protect chun but the government also is 
sensitive to public opinion 
the opposition controls 166 seats in the 299member assembly but 
lacks the twothirds majority required to override a presidential 
veto 
opposition lawmakers sought the bills to question the former 
president and his family who have come under public criticism for 
alleged involvement in financial scandals 
chuns younger brother chun kyunghwan has been on trial on 
charges of embezzeling millions of dollars in funds while head of 
the semiofficial saemaul undong development organization 
the opposition also accuses the former president brutality in 
ordering the military to quell a 1980 uprising in the southern city 
of kwangju in which about 200 people died 
despite continued government denials dissidents charge chun and 
his military followers with provoking armed clahes in kwangju as an 
excuse to seize power 
roh is one of former generals who helped chun seize power in 
1980 he has tried to distance himself from chun by carrying out 
substantial reforms since the former president left office in 
february

opposition lawmakers say prime minister margaret 
thatchers proposal to overhaul britians tightlipped security law 
still will allow the government to keep too many secrets 
parliament has been debating the plan to reform the official 
secrets act which was hastily passed during a germany spy scare in 
1911 
the act makes it a criminal offense for the governments 800000 
civil servants diplomats and defense industry employees to reveal 
any official information no matter how trivial without 
authorization 
opposition labor party spokesman roy hattersley acknowledged 
that the conservative governments proposal would loosen some 
restrictions 
but in the areas where open indeed honest government is 
tested the same illiberal rules apply some of them with 
greater forces and with few safeguards he said during a house of 
commons debate friday night 
the governments revisions propose to decriminalize trivial 
leaks give journalists more legal protection and confine secrecy 
mainly to defense intelligence and foreign affairs 
home secretary douglas hurd the cabinet member responsible for 
law and order said that except for two provisions in the revision 
every other move is in the direction of openness 
no one can seriously weigh these two marginal additions 
against the immense reductions we propose in the scope of the 
present law and conclude that on balance we are extending the 
law he said 
hurd said one of the proposals that would toughen the law is the 
provision that would make intelligence agents automatically liable 
for criminal prosecution for any disclosure 
the other provision would make all information on security 
defense and international relations which the government provides 
in confidence to other countries an automatic official secret 
hattersley complained that the provision calling for automatic 
criminal prosecution of looselipped intelligence agents is unfair 
he said when they disclose information the rule is absolute 
the criminal sanction is automatic no discretion there

representatives of australia and new zealand 
were given checks totaling 5 million to be distributed to those 
who were exposed to the herbicide agent orange during the vietnam 
war 
on hand to accept the checks friday were australian general 
consul christopher hurford and new zealand general consul paul 
cotton 
the checks were made out to the new zealand agent orange trust 
and the australian vietnam war veterans trust and were part of a 
240 million settlement of suits against the chemicals makers 
according to figures contained in 1985 court papers 48400 
troops from australia and 3842 troops from new zealand served with 
the united states during the war in vietnam 
the checks 45 million for australian veterans and 500000 
for new zealand were presented by us district judge jack b 
weinstein of brooklyn who oversees the agent orange litigation

the us military which hoped to deprive communist troops of crops

the herbicide contains the highly toxic dioxin and veterans 
contend that exposure to the defoliant causes cancer and other 
illnesses 
under a distribution plan 170 million of the fund will be used 
for cash payments to american veterans 52 million will finance 
social service projects to help vietnam veterans and their families 
and 17 million will pay for attorneys fees and administrative 
costs

ne win who wielded authoritarian power 
over burma for 26 years resigned today as chairman of the 
countrys only political party and called for a referendum on 
ending oneparty rule sources said 
five other veteran leaders also offered their resignations 
according to the sources who attended a party conference where the 
announcement was made 
the 78yearold ne win cited poor health for his decision they 
said but the dramatic announcement came in wake of bloody student 
rioting dawntodusk curfews and a worsening economy 
speaking to an extraordinary session of the governing burma 
socialist program party ne win said a referendum would be held 
before the end of september to decide whether the nation wanted a 
multiparty system or a continuation of singleparty rule the 
sources said 
if the congress accepts ne wins resignation which it is 
almost certain to do party rules call for the election of a new 
chairman at the same congress 
ne win resigned from the presidency in 1981 but retained the far 
more important party post he was regarded as the most powerful 
figure in burma 
the resignation announcement was made available from people 
attending the congress which was closed to foreign media and the 
public ne wins speech was scheduled for public release later 
today 
ne win who came to power in 1962 military coup has steered 
burma along an isolationist road his socialist economic policies 
have proved increasingly ineffective dissident viewpoints were 
quickly silenced 
but since october studentled demonstrations have three times 
rocked rangoon and other burmese cities resulting in violent 
deaths mass arrests and the closure of universities 
ne win also asked the congress to approve the resignations of 
san yu the party vice chairman and president of the country aye 
ko party secretary general and vice president sein lwin party 
joint general secretary and secretary of the council of state kyaw 
htin member of the partys central executive committee deputy 
prime minister and defense minister and tun tin central executive 
committee member deputy prime minister and finance minister 
there was speculation that the five would retain their 
government positions at least until the referendum is held 
about 1000 delegates are attending the threeday congress which 
opened earlier today at kyaikkasan grounds 
authorities announced the congress on july 7 two weeks after 
thousands of students and other demonstrators battled riot police 
in the streets of the capital leaving at least nine persons dead 
authorities have lifted a dusktodawn curfew that was imposed 
on rangoon following the rioting but violence spread to the cities 
of prome and taunggyi last week with at least four people reported 
killed 
earlier this week the government radio disclosed that 41 people 
who were packed into police vans during rioting in march suffocated 
on their way to prison min goung took responsibility for the 
tragedy and resigned from his posts as home and religious affairs 
minister and in the 17member party central executive committee 
the top policymaking body 
despite promises of economic liberalization last year the 
government in october withdrew three currency notes from 
circulation and offered no compensation this caused the first of 
the three major antigovernment protests 
western diplomats in rangoon and knowledgeable western observers 
said these outbursts after years of passivity reflected intense 
disillusionment with a government that has monopolized power for a 
quarter century while leading the resourcerich nation into 
economic ruin 
in the past ne win rooted out opponents and dealt harshly with 
the few occasions of open protest rarely seen in public never 
interviewed by the press ne win is said to be a superb and highly 
intelligent political infighter and strong nationalist 
regarded as potentially the richest nation in southeast asia 
burma with a per capita income of less than 200 is among the 
worlds 10 poorest countries 
once the worlds largeset rice exporter and oil producer burma 
has suffered spot food shortages and has had to import petroleum 
products recently although the state officially controls much of 
the economy most burmese rely on black market goods smuggled in 
from thailand china and malaysia 
foreign analysts and many burmese blame ne wins rigid 
socalled burmese way to socialism for these failures the 
system is an amalgam of a centralized economy oneparty 
militarybacked rule and buddhism 
probably as a result of burmas colonial past ne win also 
sought to exclude foreign influence

an official revision of the soviet criminal code 
greatly reduces the number of offenses punishable by death making 
execution possible only in cases of premeditated murder radio 
moscow reported today 
the staterun radio said the proposed revision of the 
28yearold code also frequently replaces imprisonment with fines 
and other means of punishment 
the new legislation will be more democratic and humane 
radio moscow said quoting a soviet professor ninel kuznetsova 
soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev a lawyer by training has 
spearheaded the revision of the soviet criminal code as part of his 
effort to rid his countrys economy and society of a stalinist 
legacy 
the current code permits the execution of people convicted of 
treason murder flagrant corruption war crimes and other 
offenses soviet media occasionally report on executions but have 
never indicated how frequently the death penalty is invoked 
people sentenced to death in the soviet union are shot by a 
firing squad 
under the revision the use of capital punishment will be 
curtailed radio moscow said in an international news broadcast 
death sentences will be issued to those who committed 
premeditated murder in aggravating circumstances 
the soviet radio also said that with a view to liberalizing 
legislation it was decided to replace imprisonment wherever 
possible with other disciplinary measures and fines 
radio moscow said the draft of the revised criminal code will be 
completed soon and that the result will be submitted for public 
discussion it said there are also plans to widen the role of 
defense lawyers during pretrial investigations and to increase the 
size of juries 
the typical soviet criminal trial is presided over by a judge 
and two peoples assessors although equal in theory to the 
judge the assessors commonly defer to his greater knowledge of 
jurisprudence 
gorbachev 57 named communist party chief in 1985 is a 1955 
graduate of moscow state universitys law school the nations most

the pickup truck driver indicted in a 
fiery bus crash that killed 27 people is relieved that the charges 
do not carry a possible death sentence his lawyer said 
he couldnt sleep the night before wondering if he would live 
or be put to death said william l summers attorney for larry 
w mahoney hes had that answered 
larry w mahoney 35 pleaded innocent on 27 murder counts and 
58 other charges filed by a carroll county grand jury friday 
prosecutors had said after the may 14 crash they would seek capital 
murder charges that could have led to a death penalty 
but state attorney general fred cowan said after 
investigating into the law and evidence we concluded it would not 
be appropriate to make this a deathpenalty case 
cowan indicated authorities did not feel the crime was 
premeditated 
mahoneys bond was set at 270000 cash the nonmurder counts 
include 44 counts of wanton endangerment 13 counts of assault and 
one count of driving under the influence of alcohol 
if mahoney had been indicted and convicted of capital murder he 
could have been sent to the electric chair the lesser murder 
charge carries a possible prison sentence of 20 years to life 
referring to the lesser charge summers said this has taken a 
burden off him the burden of what happened that night will never 
be off him 
cowan said if mahoney were sentenced to life on one murder 
count he would have to serve at least 12 years before being 
eligible for parole 
also friday the state medical examiner announced in louisville 
that the 24 children and three adults killed in the crash died of 
smoke inhalation after the bus and the truck which was going the 
wrong way collided on interstate 71 near carrollton the bus 
owned by the radcliff first assembly of god church was returning 
from an outing to an amusement park in ohio 
the examiner dr george nichols said that alcohol was found in 
the bodies of four children but he attributed this to a natural 
process and not drinking 
i believe the alcohol showed up because of the postmortem 
fermentation of blood sugar nichols said adding that the 
children probably had not drunk alcoholic beverages 
the recommendation for capital murder had been made by carroll 
county commonwealth attorney john ackman jr who suffered a heart 
attack shortly after the accident prompting the attorney generals 
office to take over the case 
paul richwalsky the cases chief prosecutor said he met with 
more than 40 relatives of the victims thursday night to explain the 
less serious charge 
asked if any of the families were disappointed with the 
decision richwalsky said i cant say that we had a frank and 
candid discussion if anyone was disappointed or disagreed they

a spate of mysterious fish attacks on 
bewildered swimmers at lake mendocino may be the result of hungry 
sexstarved catfish a state biologist says 
i think the fish might be a little cranky state fish and 
game biologist wendell jones said friday the fish are spawning 
real late and in the parts of the lake where the bites occurred 
there is a noted absence of food fish i think the fish are hungry 
and cranky because of the spawning 
at least a halfdozen attacks on bathers have been reported

after he cruised the lake on a boston whaler outfitted with a large 
fishshocker 
he said parts of the lake especially on the east side where 
fewer people go are full of healthy fish 
i dont know why but maybe its the weather jones said 
weve had some real crazy weather this year 
northern california has been experiencing droughtlike 
conditions and during the last week unusually high temperatures 
have been breaking records daily 
after reports that the fish were really biting at lake 
mendocino jones netted catfish bass bluegill and suckers

similar lakes he said he found no peopleeating monsters as had 
been rumored locally

democrats who began their quadrennial convention 
with the threat of discord headed home in dramatic unity to fight 
the fall battle for the white house 
this has been a great convention and it sets the stage for a 
great democratic win in november the star attraction michael 
dukakis told weary delegates gathered for one last party early 
friday 
his nomination was a given coming into atlanta but the 
atmosphere in which he would accept it was uncertain 
jesse jacksons bus caravan rolled in saturday with the 
runnerup in the primaries unsure whether he had a place at the 
table 
dukakis arrived sunday but refused to meet with the edgy jackson 
until he sat down with his trusted advisers to assess preliminary 
talks between the two camps 
republicans had a truth squad in town and took advantage of 
the apparent rift to boast of divided democrats and a nomineetobe 
powerless to control his convention but a show of unity just hours 
before democratic chairman paul kirk gaveled the partys 40th 
convention to order on monday night ended most talk of discord 
although republicans continued to assert jackson was stealing the 
show 
after a nearly threehour meeting monday dukakis and jackson 
declared their differences resolved with dukakis promising jackson 
a role in the fall campaign and jackson in turn promising his 
support 
we did not come here for fireworks we came here for noble 
works jackson said 
with that the convention opened to verbal fireworks all 
aimed at the republicans 
keynote speaker ann richards pumped up the more than 4000 
delegates with fiery rhetoric that lampooned george bushs claim of 
texas as his home state and portrayed the vice president as a 
donothing member of a disgraced administration 
i want to announce to the nation that in a little more than 
100 days the 
reaganmeesedeavernofzigerpoindexternorthweinbergerwattgorsuchlavellestockmanhaigborknoriegageorge 
bush era will be over the texas treasurer said to thunderous 
applause 
the redeemed jimmy carter made a primetime appearance too 
adding his call for moral government to a convention with a 
deliberate southern flavor 
jackson had his night tuesday declaring himself qualified for 
the presidency and predicting he would occupy the white house in 
the future while urging his backers to support dukakis in the fall 
in a show of respect many dukakis delegates gave up their hall 
passes to jackson alternates and supporters and dukakis placards 
were kept low while a sea of red proclaimed jesse 
despite that gesture not all of jacksons backers got into the 
omni convention hall thousands were kept out after atlantas fire 
marshal decided too many people had already been let in a problem 
that continued throughout the fourday gathering 
mondays detente had removed the potential for acrimony 
wednesday when dukakis won the partys blessing to take on bush 
all that was left was to crown the nominee and after the 
rousing speeches of richards and jackson there was some worry the 
star of the show might be upstaged 
but actress cousin olympia dukakis in a supporting role once 
again warmed the audience with an introduction of dukakis the 
frugal family man and when the standardbearer entered the hall he 
was filled with emotion that carried over into the speech of his 
lifetime 
his eyes welled and his voice cracked when he talked of the 
american dream of his late father a greek immigrant who arrived 
at ellis island with 25 and rose to become a wealthy doctor his 
smile was broad as he waved to his 84yearold mother herself an 
immigrant and his wife and children gathered in a skybox above the 
madefortv rostrum at a madefortv convention 
im a product of that dream dukakis said on his dream 
night my friends were going to forge a new era of greatness 
for america 
dukakis spoke forcefully about his themes of jobs and day care 
and health care and competence and sternly about his commitment to 
public service and his perceived lack of such in the reagan 
administration 
no stranger to television or teleprompters dukakis delivery 
was as carefully choreographed as the swirling lights and patriotic 
music that had entertained the delegates before him 
he ended with an athenian pledge to strength honesty and 
integrity but not before allowing screaming delegates to interrupt 
repeatedly with a chant democrats will surely take into the fall 
campaign where was george where was george a reference to 
bushs professed ignorance of administration blunders 
in the end dukakis was joined by his family then bentsen and 
his family jackson and his family the carters and other 
contenders in what began as a crowded race for the nomination and 
ended with the crowning of the man who likens the race to a 
marathon 
the confetti fell the balloons followed and the democrats went 
home happy

the weak dollar is not keeping hordes of 
americans from traveling abroad this summer but it has prompted 
many to seek cheaper destinations travel consultants and tour 
operators report 
although some foreign countries are getting more american 
tourists than a year ago overall foreign travel is running at 
about the same level as last summer the travel professionals say 
that was around 23 million americans up sharply from the 18 
million in the summer of 1986 when the dollars steep slide and 
terrorist incidents kept many at home 
the dollar has continued its downward trend despite a rebound 
earlier this month a dollar bought 131 japanese yen on friday 
compared with 151 yen a year ago while a british pound has risen 
to 174 from 161 
the big factor obviously is the purchasing power of the 
american dollar said james v cammisa a travel industry 
consultant in new york thats really the driving force 
europe still accounts for about half of all vacation travel 
overseas by americans and britain france west germany italy and 
switzerland remain the most popular destinations with britain the 
leader by far 
but the erosion of their buying power abroad has driven more 
americans to countries like spain portugal greece and turkey 
where the dollar goes further cammisa and others say costs in 
those countries are lower and their currencies have not risen as 
sharply against the dollar as others have 
its the value of the dollar and also the value of what the 
dollar buys said paul kerstetter vice president of sales and 
marketing for maupintour inc in lawrence kan one of the 
countrys largest tour operators 
that principle is keeping tourists away from japan kerstetter 
said us bookings to japan are down more than 30 percent from 
last summer people just cant afford to do it he said 
even when americans stick with their original countries many of 
them are cutting back their spending or staying for shorter 
periods experts say 
theyre buying down said robin prestage a spokesman in new 
york for the british tourist authority 
for some us travelers that means staying in a moderately 
priced hotel or even a bedandbreakfast instead of firstclass 
accommodations or cutting back or eliminating purchases of french 
perfume british china and other goods 
a typical sevenday european tour package including airfare 
hotels and some meals costs around 1350 per person this summer 
up about 70 from last year a room in a moderate european hotel 
runs about 150 a day compared with 100 a year ago while the 
average roundtrip plane fare to europe has jumped to about 800 
from 600 
another feature this summer more vacationers going abroad are 
using plane tickets obtained through frequentflier programs some 
travel agents estimate that as many as 25 percent of their 
customers for foreign travel are cashing in frequentflier awards 
that could be artificially inflating overseas travel figures for 
this summer since many of the frequent fliers might not have 
taken the trip without the free ticket 
the dollars slump coupled with recent terrorist incidents 
overseas led some potential travelers to delay booking overseas 
trips 
the shooting down of an iranian jetliner by a us navy warship 
raised some concern said david perlman president of dms 
travel in new york the incident which killed 290 people 
initially sparked fears of a retaliatory attack by iran perhaps 
aimed at a us commercial plane 
perlman said his agency received many inquiries about airline 
security after the persian gulf incident but things have since 
returned to normal 
likewise cruise ship operators say business is still steaming 
along despite a recent terrorist attack on a greek liner 
travel to israel however remains sharply below last years 
levels because of continuing clashes between police and 
palestinians in the israelioccupied west bank travel 
professionals say 
of course there are some reasons for travel that defy currency 
rates and international terrorism 
elias pandelaros waiting in a long line on a hot street to get 
into the passport office at new yorks rockefeller center said he 
would go to see his relatives in greece even if its a million 
dollars or its nothing

police in the holy city fired tear gas and shut 
down arab shops today after protesters hurled rocks and bottles at 
them during a tense weekend of both jewish and moslem holidays 
one palestinian was hit in the head by a bottle and an israeli 
was struck by a rock and taken to a hospital israel radio said 
police said four palestinians were arrested 
in another development foreign minister shimon peres closest 
aide sharply criticized israeli policymakers for refusing to talk 
to moderate palestinian nationalists in the occupied territories 
the aide outgoing foreign ministry directorgeneral yossi 
beilin singled out shmuel goren a defense ministry official in 
charge of the occupied territories for conducting a too 
simplistic carrotandstick policy in the occupied west bank and 
gaza strip 
hundreds of police reinforcements were deployed today in 
jerusalem to prevent disturbances as jews and moslems both prepared 
to mark holy days associated with the temple mount a site sacred 
to their faiths 
in the walled old city an associated press photographer saw 
police fire large quantities of tear gas to disperse protesters who 
threw rocks at them from the roofs of buildings in the citys 
christian quarter 
hundreds of shoppers and tourists some holding handkerchiefs to 
their noses streamed out of the citys damascus gate as the white 
tear gas floated over the streets 
the trouble started after 60 mourners marched in a memorial 
procession for 15yearold nidal fuad rabadi who was killed by 
israeli troops tuesday on the northern outskirts of jerusalem 
rabadis death caused several days of rioting throughout arab 
east jerusalem which israel annexed after capturing it from jordan 
in 1967 
after the procession police ordered the storekeepers to close 
their shops and fired tear gas to disperse the crowds 
merchants also accused police of overturning open air stalls 
lining the sidewalk near the damascus gate where the ground was 
strewn with vegetables and boxes of goods 
the us state department voiced concern friday over resurgent 
violence in the occupied lands over the past week nine arabs have 
died including the first israeli arab fatality since the 
palestinian rebellion began dec 8 
according to un figures 231 arabs have been killed in the 
uprising four israelis have also died 
israeli officials have said jerusalem is becoming a center of 
the violence after months of relative calm in the city 
todays incident took place while the old city was teeming with 
shoppers preparing for the fourday moslem eid aladha holiday 
which starts sunday the holiday marks abrahams sacrifice of his 
son isaac at the temple mount 
at sundown today jews start observing the tisha bav fast day 
which marks the destruction of the jewish temple by the romans 
2000 years ago

there were no riots no wild costumes no major 
protests no great slogans or chants or buttons no floor fights 
no surprises and even no smoking 
the fourday gathering crammed into the omni was the first 
true madefortelevision production from the democrats who have a 
long history of anything but bland and orderly affairs 
there was plenty of emotion once as jesse jackson stated his 
case for common ground and again as michael dukakis the son of 
immigrants accepted the presidential nomination 
but this party was all business 
delegates were wellbehaved inside and outside the hall dukakis 
signs went down when jacksons went up jackson banners disappeared 
when dukakis took the stage unity was the rule of the road and 
everything was more or less on cue from the delegates shuttle 
buses to the tiny american flags passed out at the finale 
youd think they were republicans or something 
sure some in the wisconsin delegation wore cheese heads and 
bounced an inflated cow up and down the rows but even the tropical 
flowers decorating hawaiis state sign were plastic 
ive been going to conventions since 1968 this is an amazing 
convention and one of the big factors is that everything 
everything is designed for television said rep lee hamilton of 
indiana 
on the sidewalks buttons offered little more radical than a 
likeness of george bush with the red universal no sign at the 
protest zone portapotties sometimes outnumbered the protesters 
and even the signs were predictable unions were against 
lorenzo district of columbians were for statehood iowans were for 
farmers georgians were for peaches more radical sentiment can be 
found at high school basketball games 
in fact everything in the omni was so carefully set up for 
television the buildings regular lights were left off in favor of 
a specially constructed lowhanging light system 
cant have that cavernous basketball arena look you see 
the salmoncolored paint decorating the podium appeared red on 
television workers never finished painting all of the podium but 
the bare spots were out of camera sight the spontaneous outburst 
for dukakis nomination was carefully orchestrated by a hollywood 
producer even the chant where was george had been rehearsed 
when dukakis finally appeared before delegates some three days 
and five hours into the convention he told them the presidential 
race isnt about ideology its about competence 
he could have said the same about the convention itself the 
democrats wanted to show they could be organized could look good 
and could be presidential 
by thursday night they seemed to genuinely like what they had 
done 
there was a caucus or reception for everyone women hispanics 
blacks state chairmen gays rurals urbans former cabinet 
members former carter white house staffers there was even an 
anticonvention convention down the street 
there were some unusual twists to life in atlanta last week the 
party of the poor sold tshirts for 15 a former white house chef 
taught a cooking class on nancy reagans orange flambe gary hart 
was a reporter lou grant ed asner was a politico and sam 
donaldson was a celebrity 
vendors tried to sell newspapers outside the convention complex 
even though they were given away inside the party of inclusion 
found itself locking out delegates and vips during the presidential 
roll call 
it didnt really matter the democrats wanted an efficient show 
horrigan whoever he is was running for president dukakis was 
running with glenn on some buttons the politics was all pretty 
predictable no brokered convention no mario scenerio 
the democrats werent fazed it was all according to plan 
this is the best convention weve run in a long time house 
speaker jim wright told the delegates 
right on cue

the navys highestranking admiral said the 
latin american drug smuggling network has thousands of boats and 
planes and is so extensive it is impossible to shut off cocaine 
shipments arriving in the united states 
adm carlisle ah trost said during a speech to the 
commonwealth club on friday that the only way to stop the drug flow 
is to cut off demand 
even if the entire resources of the us military and law 
enforcement could be thrown into the fight against drugs it could 
not stop the flow he said 
in a speech on the strategic value of latin america the admiral 
said americans do not realize the importance of latin america to 
the peace and security of the united states 
his audience probably expected him to talk about the persian 
gulf the pentagon procurement scandal or even the prospects of a 
certain large gray combatant wellknown in history might possibly 
make her home on a certain waterfront not far from here trost 
said referring to the possibility that the battleship missouri 
might be based in san francisco 
he said he was not going to monday morning quarterback the 
decision of the captain of the cruiser vincennes to shoot down an 
approaching iranian passenger plane that the captain said he 
mistook for a war plane mounting an attack 
it was clearly a tragic accident said trost

the sandinista government has taken 
another step toward putting a label on its political ideology 
socialist but questions remain about the brand of socialism the 
sandinistas have established 
for one thing nicaragua maintains a mixed economy rather than a 
completely socialist one with some market forces continuing to 
operate 
the latest sandinista statement on ideology came during a 
ceremony last week marking the ninth anniversary of the sandinista 
revolution president daniel ortega told the crowd that nicaragua 
had been a socialist state since 1979 
previously government leaders described themselves simply as 
sandinistas after augusto cesar sandino who fought a us marine 
intervention in the country in the late 1920s 
sandinismo is the nicaraguan application of three great 
currents of universal thought marxism christianity and 
nationalism bayardo arce one of the ruling partys hardliners 
once said in an interview with the sandinista newspaper barricada 
interior minister tomas borge and vice president sergio ramirez 
also have said that marxism is one ingredient of the sandinista 
philosopy 
in his speech ortega said socialism in nicaragua means defense 
of workers farmers and producers he said it means a mixed 
economy political pluralism and a nonaligned foreign policy 
our socialism is to protect all nicaraguan producers that 
really have the desire to produce to be efficient and share the 
riches with all he said this is all we ask and insist 
socialism in its purest form is public ownership of the means 
of production with all members of the community sharing in what is 
produced aspects of socialist economics are present in many 
systems ranging from those in sweden and britain to cuba and the 
soviet union such systems vary greatly however in the degree of 
social welfare they provide and the freedom of expression and 
political activity they permit 
the sandinista national liberation front maintains the ability 
to control almost all facets of life but keeps some trappings of 
an open society 
the sandinistas permit public political opposition for 
instance while maintaining control of the sevenparty national 
assembly eleven other parties exist most of them small and 
ranging from the ultraleft to the right the government points to 
the fractured opposition as proof of political pluralism 
but the sandinistas clearly define the limits on opposition 
activity 
the government controls permits for marches issues permits for 
buses or trucks to transport demonstrators distributes paper for 
newspapers and bulletins and licenses media 
in the economy the sandinistas in june withdrew strict wage and 
price controls saying a freemarket system would encourage 
production the government owns the banks however meaning it has 
control of credit loans distribution of scarce foreign exchange 
and regulation of all imports and exports 
the sandinistas recently nationalized the nations largest and 
oldest private enterprise the san antonio sugar refinery they 
said the measure was economic rather than political the refinerys 
board of directors said the government didnt allow the owners to 
buy sufficent dollars needed to keep the company going 
shortly after the sandinistas came to power in a 197879 
revolution they confiscated land as part of their agrarian reform 
program to give plots to the peasants 
according to government figures 48 percent of the nations land 
was owned by private individuals in 1978 by 1986 that figure had 
dropped to 292 percent 
some sandinista leaders have looked to cuba as an example of 
socialism but not necessarily as a model that should be 
immediately copied the 30yearold cuban government tolerates no 
other political parties no opposition media no private enterprise 
and virtually no criticism 
the sandinistas however have copied cubas revolutionary 
defense committees watchdog groups that monitor antigovernment 
activity almost to the letter in nicaragua the organizations are 
called sandinista defense committees 
nicaragua unlike cuba has faced a civil war since 1981 nor 
does nicaragua receive the heavy amounts of sovietbloc aid that 
cuba enjoys the soviet union is estimated to give cuba the 
equivalent of about 4 billion a year while nicaragua receives 
about 500 million annually not including military materiel 
the united states citing nicaraguas links to the soviet bloc 
cut off economic aid to nicaragua in 1981 and imposed an economic 
boycott in 1985 
president reagan frequently describes the nicaraguan leaders as 
communists who threaten us national security local opponents of 
the sandinistas agree saying that left unleashed nicaragua would 
be a closed marxistleninist state

for all their imagery of camelot revisited 
michael dukakis and lloyd bentsen cant rely entirely on the 1960 
electoral playbook written by john f kennedy and lyndon b johnson 
it is 28 years later years in which america has lost a war and 
a few presidents gone through a civil rights revolution seen the 
emergence of a twoparty south and swung with the ideological 
pendulum 
the america that will decide whether to vote for dukakisbentsen 
is far different from the one that narrowly chose kennedyjohnson 
the earlier massachusetts and texas combination 
i dont see that the analogy works other than its nice 
poetry said ed reilly a new york pollster and adviser to 
democratic candidates 
but they will be able to use some of the 1960 strategy that 
kennedy used in narrowly defeating richard nixon theyve already 
begun 
kennedy was stunned that johnson accepted the no 2 post since 
he had sought the presidential nomination himself but in his book 
the making of the president 1960 theodore white wrote that 
johnsons selection sealed the plan they would pursue 
the first of the kennedy strategies had been a regional one 
decided by the candidate alone on the night of his nomination by 
his choice of a vice president white wrote 
he felt he had new england locked up that he must campaign 
personally for the big northeastern industrial states that lyndon 
b johnson must be his lord constable for the old south these 
grand calculations worked 
in many ways this year dukakis aim is the same his selection 
of bentsen was an attempt to reclaim texas with its 29 electoral 
votes it also was an attempt to appeal to white swing voters in 
other southern states and to compel republican george bush to 
invest time and money in texas and the south 
john kennedys selection of lyndon johnson as his running mate 
turned out to be one of the crucial differences of the election in 
1960 recalled ted sorensen then a policy adviser to kennedy 
today a new york attorney and author of the 1988 democratic 
platform draft 
johnson helped carry texas and louisiana he helped keep 
north carolina and south carolina sorensen said in an interview 
a vice president is only a small reason but it is an additional 
factor to cause people to vote to return to their party 
robert healy associate editor of the boston globe recalled 
covering that 1960 race kennedy was facing hostility in the south 
and some other areas over his catholic religion 
the thursday before the election kennedy campaigned in oklahoma 
city in a futile attempt to hold a state so close to texas he was 
spit upon by the crowd healy recalled 
johnson had gone in and really met that sort of thing in texas 
for kennedy he said 
the kennedy campaign adopted an electoral strategy that focused 
on nine large states white recounted in 1960 new york 
pennsylvania california michigan texas illinois ohio new 
jersey and massachusetts together held 237 of the 269 electoral 
votes needed to win 
it was in these big states that kennedy invested the greatest 
part of his time and personal effort while nixon sought to spread 
himself over all 50 states of the union white wrote 
if those could be swept and if another 60 or 70 electoral 
votes could be added by lyndon b johnson in the old south and if 
a few more solid new england or midwestern states could be counted 
in then the election would be won handily white wrote 
kennedy carried all but two of those nine ohio and california 
he swept new england the most heavily catholic and his native 
region much of the south including texas and some border states 
and the small western states of nevada and new mexico 
his wins in texas and illinois were razor thin and its often 
noted that a shift of 4500 votes in illinois and 28000 in texas 
would have reversed those states and the election 
but he won 23 states and 303 electoral votes more than enough 
if dukakis and bentsen carried each of these same states this 
year they would win too but by a smaller electoral margin 
shifting populations have reduced the electoral votes of those 
states to 286 
that leaves very little margin of error moreover there are few 
safe democratic states any more and some of the kennedy states may 
be out of reach to dukakis 
on the other hand dukakis is considered competitive in parts of 
the farm and industrial middle west and big states like ohio and 
california where he will mount a challenge would make up for a 
lot of smaller states 
the south has seen both the emergence of a strong republican 
party that has dominated in presidential elections and the 
emergence of a large black vote that is reliably democratic 
kennedy won black votes in the south indeed became champion to 
blacks when he intervened to help get martin luther king jr out of 
a georgia prison two weeks before the election but black voter 
registration was low a fraction of todays 
there have been other changes too like the switch to public 
financing of campaigns that make a substantive comparison to 1960 
impractical 
but in the end if dukakis gets out of his bentsen choice what 
kennedy got out of johnson it may be all that matters 
if they win texas theyll all be geniuses and probably win 
the election said reilly if they lose texas they probably 
lose the election

the three major tv networks are remaking old 
series in a scramble to fill the fall schedule as the 
fivemonthold writers strike threatens their already slipping 
share of the audience 
their competitors arent ignoring the situation 
we think there is going to be a gaping hole on the dial 
said seth abraham home box offices senior vice president for 
programming operations we will pick up disenchanted viewers in 
droves 
said gerry hogan president of the turner entertainment 
networks were in good shape for the fall we do very well when 
the networks are out of original programming 
abcs decision to refilm 13 old episodes of mission 
impossible in australia symbolizes the peculiar efforts by the 
three networks to plug holes left by the 9000member writers guild 
of america strike 
theyre going to have a lot of trouble if they use australian 
actors and have cars driving on the wrong side of the road said 
william woodfield one of the original mission writers and 
producers and it isnt going to be cheap those shows cost 
500000 to shoot in los angeles 20 years ago to shoot them today 
in australia is going to cost a whole lot more 
the strike began march 7 over the issue of payments for reruns 
of onehour domestic shows and a bigger share in the increased 
foreign market 
abc admits privately that its fall schedule is a significant 
compromise from previous years 
its not the original programming we would have wanted said 
one abc programming executive speaking on the condition of 
anonymity but something has gotta be put on the air 
abc is not alone in making improbable programming decisions in 
the wake of the walkout that has left tv actors with time to do 
other things like tom bosleys return to the stage and bob 
newharts revival of his nightclub act 
nbc has plans to bring back with a new cast the hardy 
boys a detective show that lasted less than three seasons after 
it debuted on abc 11 years ago 
cbs which finished third in the ratings last season for the 
first time will bring back candid camera which hasnt been on 
network television in 20 years the program was so unpopular in the 
syndication market that it was recently withdrawn from sale 
nbc also will broadcast at least one news special from tv 
personality geraldo rivera and the network may convert the cartoon 
fat albert into a liveaction prime time series 
nbc also is fortunate to have television rights to the summer 
olympics and the world series 
cbs entertainment frequently at odds with cbs news is 
encouraging the news division to produce a variety of specials 
the executive producers have been asked internally to come up 
with some ideas and float concepts said tom goodman a spokesman 
for cbs news 
the strike hits the networks at a time when their share of the 
tv audience has slipped to its lowest level ever fewer than 60 
percent of viewers now tune in the networks when watching 
television according to the ac nielsen co 
hbo and tbs have devised fall promotion campaigns to lure 
unhappy network followers they both have sizeable movie libraries 
and their original programming is produced so far in advance that 
their schedules do not suffer immediately from the strike 
movie theaters and video stores also expect to benefit from the 
strike 
especially embarrassing for the networks they will be unable to 
mount much of a public relations blitz at the annual summer 
convention of television critics starting this week in universal 
city 
theyre going to have to use some smoke and mirrors to get 
through the first three months of the television season said art 
chapman tv critic for the fort worth startelegram and president 
of the television critics association 
some advertisers believe the networks may be forced to provide 
free advertising time called make goods in the industry when 
replacement programs fail to produce guaranteed audiences 
i think there will be a lot of make goods this fall said 
richard kostyra executive vice president and us director of 
media services at j walter thompson but i dont think of it in 
disaster terms 
in its forecast for the fall the new york advertising agency 
young and rubicam has predicted that only three of the networks 21 
new shows abcs roseanne and nbcs empty nest and dear 
john will be hits 
i think obviously its going to be a disruptive season 
said robert igiel senior vice president and director of 
programming at the advertising agency nw ayer in some cases 
these replacement shows may not work

writerproducer robert eisele says the only 
blessing of the 20week scriptwriters strike has been the 
opportunity to get acquainted with his infant daughter 
its been a wonderful time for bonding with marissa eisele 
said friday she was born march 26 nearly three weeks after the 
strike began 
but for eisele a writer and coproducer of cbs the 
equalizer its also been a time for frugal living and a return 
to earlier pastimes of writing poetry and plays 
im coping financially because i was raised in a sort of 
austere middle class existence he said ive always been 
frugal with my money ive never lived beyond my means i knew when 
i got into this industry in 1980 that it had a history of long 
strikes so i saved my money and bought a house i could afford 
i can pay the mortgage i can hold out for a long time but i 
have writer friends who are not so lucky im going to look at a 
friends sideboard that hes selling to pay the rent he said 
as a hyphenate the industry term for a person who performs 
several jobs in his case writing and producing eiseles salary 
was in the neighborhood of 200000 to 400000 a year 
the average writer who does not have a regular job and depends 
on freelance sales makes considerably less and the median income 
of working members of the writers guild of america is 43000 a 
year at any given time only about half of the guilds 9000 
members are employed 
the strike began march 7 over the issue of payments for reruns 
of onehour domestic television shows and a bigger share in the 
increased foreign market 
we are very well paid but we also create the product he 
said we are first among equals without our vision no one else 
can go to work i think because we do create the work we should be 
compensated with residuals 
the equalizer which has completed its third year on cbs is 
now a viable show for syndication 
if a show is syndicated then every episode ive written will 
bring in a certain amount of residuals over the years he said 
it becomes an annuity for a writer 
they want rollbacks in some areas but they arent flexible in 
the area of foreign residuals eisele said the foreign market 
is growing theres going to be an explosion in the foreign market 
for television 
eisele was playwrightinresidence at the american conservatory 
theatre in san francisco in 197576 his first film work was a 
lowbudget movie called breach of contract which starred peter 
coyote and cindy pickett 
in 1985 his friends terry louise fisher and steve brown asked 
him to write a script for cbs cagney amp lacey his script 
called ordinary hero won the humanitas award for 60minute 
drama 
he wrote the first show for the 198687 season for cagney amp 
lacey he was story editor of nbcs crime story before going 
to the equalizer this past season as coproducer 
during the strike he has written a script for pbs american 
playhouse called last light the story of the relationship 
between a condemned man and a prison guard public television is 
not affected by the strike 
he also is outlining a new play and has brought out some of his 
poetry to give it a polish and send it off to various journals 
im getting by because ive always had an old working boys 
outlook he said ive never tried to impress people with my 
wealth not that i have any i dont take to the hollywood glitz

democrats who began their quadrennial convention 
with the threat of discord headed home in dramatic unity to fight 
the fall battle for the white house 
this has been a great convention and it sets the stage for a 
great democratic win in november the star attraction michael 
dukakis told weary delegates gathered for one last party early 
friday 
his nomination and that of the man he picked as his running 
mate texas sen lloyd bentsen were guaranteed coming into 
atlanta but the atmosphere in which the ticket would be formed was 
uncertain 
jesse jacksons bus caravan rolled in saturday with the 
runnerup in the primaries unsure whether he had a place at the 
table 
dukakis arrived sunday but refused to meet with the edgy jackson 
until he sat down with his trusted advisers to assess preliminary 
talks between the two camps 
republicans had a truth squad in town and took advantage of 
the apparent rift to boast of divided democrats and a nomineetobe 
powerless to control his convention but a show of unity just hours 
before democratic chairman paul kirk gaveled the partys 40th 
convention to order on monday night ended most talk of discord 
although republicans continued to assert jackson was stealing the 
show 
after a nearly threehour meeting monday dukakis and jackson 
declared their differences resolved with dukakis promising jackson 
a role in the fall campaign and jackson in turn promising his 
support 
we did not come here for fireworks we came here for noble 
works jackson said 
with that the convention opened to verbal fireworks all 
aimed at the republicans 
keynote speaker ann richards pumped up the more than 4000 
delegates with fiery rhetoric that lampooned george bushs claim of 
texas as his home state and portrayed the vice president as a 
donothing member of a disgraced administration 
i want to announce to the nation that in a little more than 
100 days the 
reaganmeesedeavernofzigerpoindexternorthweinbergerwattgorsuchlavellestockmanhaigborknoriegageorge 
bush era will be over the texas treasurer said to thunderous 
applause 
the redeemed jimmy carter made a primetime appearance too 
adding his call for moral government to a convention with a 
deliberate southern flavor 
jackson had his night tuesday declaring himself qualified for 
the presidency and predicting he would occupy the white house in 
the future while urging his backers to support dukakis in the fall 
in a show of respect many dukakis delegates gave up their hall 
passes to jackson alternates and supporters and dukakis placards 
were kept low while a sea of red proclaimed jesse 
despite that gesture not all of jacksons backers got into the 
omni convention hall thousands were kept out after atlantas fire 
marshal decided too many people had already been let in a problem 
that continued throughout the fourday gathering 
mondays detente had removed the potential for acrimony 
wednesday when dukakis won the partys blessing to take on bush 
all that was left was to crown the nominee and after the 
rousing speeches of richards and jackson there was some worry the 
star of the show might be upstaged 
but actress cousin olympia dukakis in a supporting role once 
again warmed the audience with an introduction of dukakis the 
frugal family man and when the standardbearer entered the hall he 
was filled with emotion that carried over into the speech of his 
lifetime 
his eyes welled and his voice cracked when he talked of the 
american dream of his late father a greek immigrant who arrived 
at ellis island with 25 and rose to become a wealthy doctor his 
smile was broad as he waved to his 84yearold mother herself an 
immigrant and his wife and children gathered in a skybox above the 
madefortv rostrum at a madefortv convention 
im a product of that dream dukakis said on his dream 
night my friends were going to forge a new era of greatness 
for america 
dukakis spoke forcefully about his themes of jobs and day care 
and health care and competence and sternly about his commitment to 
public service and his perceived lack of such in the reagan 
administration 
no stranger to television or teleprompters dukakis delivery 
was as carefully choreographed as the swirling lights and patriotic 
music that had entertained the delegates before him 
he ended with an athenian pledge to strength honesty and 
integrity but not before allowing screaming delegates to interrupt 
repeatedly with a chant democrats will surely take into the fall 
campaign where was george where was george a reference to 
bushs professed ignorance of administration blunders 
in the end dukakis was joined by his family then bentsen and 
his family jackson and his family the carters and other 
contenders in what began as a crowded race for the nomination and 
ended with the crowning of the man who likens the race to a 
marathon 
the confetti fell the balloons followed and the democrats went 
home happy

two decades ago john mariotta worked with his 
hands in his toolanddie shop in the south bronx not far from 
yankee stadium he had two employees he eked out a living 
that was long ago before the dollar signs multiplied and then 
multiplied again before president reagan called him a hero of the 
1980s before his welbilt electronic die corp became wedtech 
now mariottas waiting for a jury to begin deliberations on 
charges that he and five codefendants including rep mario 
biaggi turned the company into a racketeering enterprise that 
dispensed millions in bribes to secure government contracts 
it took me 20 years to build this company and you 
intellectuals robbed my company from me mariotta said in federal 
court 
mariotta 58 is an illiterate who by dint of knowhow and 
enthusiasm turned wedtech into a success story 
my reading ability will go as far as a comic book is 
concerned dont ask me to read the times he said 
mariottas parents were natives of puerto rico and he was born 
in spanish harlem he dropped out of high school and joined the 
military once out he tried to start a business but it failed as 
did his next two businesses 
but by all accounts he is very good with his hands a mechanical 
genius and in 1970 he hooked up with fred neuberger a mechanical 
engineer 
together they built wedtech with mariotta as chairman and 
chief executive officer the company expanded obtaining pentagon 
contracts set aside for minorityowned companies on a nobid basis 
wedtech hired welfare recipients drug addicts gang members 
soviet emigres cambodian boat people indians blacks and 
hispanics all were represented among the employees and financial 
analysts joked that the company had to hire translators and hold 
its meetings at the united nations 
mariotta fired the company with his cando spirit he spoke to 
each new employee to infuse them with wedtechs 
upbyyourbootstraps philosophy 
when layoffs struck he delivered groceries to the workers an 
employee with a sick parent in puerto rico would receive time off 
and a ticket home 
after ronald reagan visited the south bronx during the 1980 
campaign and promised to do more to revitalize the area mariotta 
heard the call 
he attended about a dozen meetings of hispanic business leaders 
in washington and met with president reagan at a session devoted to 
finding ways to help poor neighborhoods 
the contracts rolled in eventually the company employed 1500 
people and did 100 million in business annually mariotta lived in 
the exclusive westchester community of scarsdale 
the president has pride in this firm said sen alfonse 
damato rny when he announced that wedtech had won a 242 
million navy pontoon contract in april 1984 it has a heart it 
has a soul 
a month before at a republican dinner in manhattan reagan 
saluted mariotta as a hero for the 80s and the next year an 
agency of the us commerce department named him minority 
entrepreneur of the year 
then it all came apart he was ousted as chairman and chief 
executive director in february 1986 wedtech eventually closed shop 
and sought protection under bankruptcy statutes 
neuberger pleaded guilty to bribery conspiracy and larceny like 
three other wedtech officials who also pleaded guilty he testified 
against mariotta accusing him of participating in a

nearly 4 million in wedtech stock in exchange for helping the 
company the defense maintains the stock was given to biaggis law 
firm to settle unpaid legal fees owed by wedtech 
mariotta argued that the company gave its stock to powerful 
figures like biaggi in gratitude for their help not as a quid pro

just before michael dukakis stepped onto the 
convention podium for the most important moment of his political 
life longtime friend paul brountas gave him two words of final 
advice go slowly 
he meant it despite a highly successful political career and 
three terms as governor dukakis carried to the stage at the 
conclusion of the democratic national convention a reputation for 
stepping on good lines and doing better at reducing political 
emotions than inspiring them 
brountas wanted his friend to avoid what he saw as a dukakis 
rhetorical pitfall of hurrying his speech of talking so fast the 
words carried no punch his friend listened 
he did it brountas said still beaming with the enthusiasm 
of the conventions final night as he headed out of atlanta and 
into the new democratic campaign he paced himself 
in so doing dukakis answered the doubters who questioned his 
ability to move an audience and to reveal enough soul to lead a 
political cause 
while the display of soaring rhetoric and moving delivery may 
prove shortlived dukakis achieved it on the night he most needed 
it claiming the democratic presidential nomination 
indeed at his first campaign stop the next day in mcallen 
texas dukakis seemed to revert to his sometimes bland and wooden 
delivery 
but dukakis aides believe that in atlanta last week they 
achieved all they could have a united convention a supportive 
jesse jackson and a moving primetime television hour in which the 
candidate revealed himself to the nation 
brountas the senior adviser and campaign chairman who has been 
dukakis friend since their days at harvard law school said the 
candidate seemed a little surprised by the emotion evoked in the 
convention hall and by his own success 
he said i walked out there and it exploded 
you know how many people get nominated for the presidency i 
dont think he quite knew what to expect brountas said 
in fact dukakis speech was a departure in style from the 
moment he stepped into view he walked slowly from side to side on 
the stage accepting the cheers by slowing raising one arm and then 
the other that modest wave was more expressive than dukakis had 
been all week 
he threw his hands up you know dukakis doesnt usually do 
that brountas said when he did that the whole place 
exploded 
dukakis used many of the lines he has used since the campaign 
began in iowa referring to his immigrant parents and invoking the 
imagery of john f kennedys election nearly three decades ago 
but with the aid of speechwriters ira jackson and bill woodward 
he dressed up those references in newer phrasing and in delivering 
them seemed to connect with his audience in a way that 
communicated more emotion than before 
most of it was michael dukakis language with better 
cadence better rhythm brountas said his closing remarks a 
reference to keynoter ann richards granddaughter to jesse 
jacksons five children and to his own expected grandchild were 
penned in by dukakis himself after tuesday nights speech by 
jackson according to brountas 
a day later he traveled to the convention hall and spent three 
and a half hours checking out the podium and rehearsing before a 
teleprompter in a private room that was a replica of the stage he 
stayed practicing for two hours more than he had scheduled 
when his speech was over thursday night aides and observers 
pronounced it as good as he had ever been dukakis had an 
explanation for his adviser brountas 
he said the crowd does it to you once in a while brountas 
said he was sort of choked

president reagan today decried the 
midnight in america rhetoric of democratic national convention 
speakers saying the country is in far better shape than democrats 
would have people believe 
our liberal opposition seems to think so much is bad in 
america to hear them talk you wouldnt think that america is in 
the longest peacetime economic expansion in history reagan 
said 
in his weekly radio address delivered from reagans mountaintop 
ranch near santa barbara the president took note of the 
justconcluded democratic national convention in atlanta saying 
americans should have been shaking your head at some of the 
statements 
it was reagans first public comment on the convention on 
friday white house spokesman marlin fitzwater seized the latest 
consumer price report as evidence of good news from a republican 
administration 
showing frustration with statements democrats made at their 
convention he told reporters the administration has given the 
american people the longest peacetime business recovery on record 
fitzwater disputed democratic assertions that the administration 
for nearly eight years has worked principally to enrich those who 
were already well off when president reagan came into office in 
1981 
reagan who watched michael dukakis deliver his speech thursday 
night accepting the democratic presidential nomination said today 
that growth and opportunity have been born again in america 
listening to the rhetoric you would never have guessed that 
americas economy is the strongest in decades the president 
said he did not mention dukakis other any other democrat by name 
reagan has been following the events in georgia from his ranch 
where he has been vacationing for the past week 
in his radio address a week ago reagan predicted that his 
economic policies would come in for heavy criticism at the atlanta 
gathering and told his listeners the country is better off 
economically than when he became president 
fitzwater cited the june consumer price index as proof of a 
stable economy the report said inflation rose at a moderate annual 
rate of 42 percent last month and that for the first six months 
of this year the pace was 44 percent the same as in 1987 
the data continued to show no significant acceleration of 
inflation from the 4 percent range that has prevailed in recent 
years he said more good news from a republican administration 
thats given you 68 straight months of economic recovery 
fitzwater a native of abilene kan a farming area suggested 
the administration needed to do more to tell its side of the 
economic story saying officials should quit hiding our bushel 
here 
asked if that meant he had adopted a strategy of using white 
house news briefings to take on the democrats the spokesman 
replied no although youve never seen me bashful to talk about 
the glories of our economic recovery have you 
meanwhile the white house announced that reagan had started the 
process of bringing trade sanctions against brazil 
fitzwater announced that reagan had invoked provisions of the 
trade act of 1974 to punish brazil for allegedly refusing to 
provide adequate patent protection to us pharmaceutical and 
chemical products 
he said the us government will bring sanctions against 200 
million worth of brazilian imports and there were indications 
these punitive measures would come in the form of tariffs rather 
than embargoes 
the administration said it remained to be decided which 
brazilian products would be affected 
adequate patent protection is the cornerstone of a healthy 
pharmaceutical industry fitzwater said in a statement by 
denying this basic commercial right brazil permits unauthorized 
copying of pharmaceutical products and processes that were invented 
by us firms this not only deprives american companies of sales 
it discourages investment in the research and development of new 
drugs 
the pharmaceutical manufacturers association a trade group has 
maintained that brazils policy on patents has cost the industry up 
to 150 billion in losses since 1979 
an administration official declining to be named publicly said 
it was likely the us trade office would settle on a damage figure 
of roughly 36 million a year since 1979 before public hearings 
aimed at determining which brazilian products would be included in 
the trade sanctions

and he wants the park to give back his multimillion dollar donation

for expansion and development of the park which is run by the 
dallas arboretum and botanical society 
voters approved 75 million in bonds to improve the 66acre

facility 
we cant afford to spend money on things like this now 
perot said there are no villains its the economic period were 
going through now we had a plan when we started it went from 
worldclass to a scaledback nice arboretum

democrats think they can lure more votes this 
year out of the cubanamerican republican stronghold as some miami 
cubans try to increase their conservative ethnic groups 
involvement in a national hispanic coalition 
we see the cuban community as an area of opportunity said 
jorge haynes a mexicanamerican who has been an aide to florida 
house speaker jon mills dgainesville and was spokesman here for 
the national hispanic caucus 
haynes said efforts to increase hispanics political clout by 
having mexicans puerto ricans cubans and other latins working 
together foundered with election of ronald reagan in 1980 
but the group held daily wellattended meetings last week 
during the democratic national convention haynes said 
coral gables banker luis lauredo a cubanamerican who was a 
carter administration aide was selected as a cochairman of the 
group 
simon ferro the 34yearold cubanborn attorney who heads the 
dade county democratic party said cubans traditionally havent 
been active in national hispanic groups 
their immigration story is different than those of the puerto 
ricans and mexicans the cubans fled a homeland where they had a 
comfortable standard of living because of communist takeover and 
have made anticommunist stands a major part of their politics 
ferro noted that in dade 97000 cubans are registered as 
republicans compared to 23000 democrats he said the figures 
dont include secondgeneration cubanamericans who were born in 
this country and the younger cubans are more likely to join the 
democrats and identify with other hispanic groups 
its been frustrating but its getting better ferro said 
he said cubans have seen that despite tough rhetoric president 
reagans cuba policies werent particularly strong 
ferro said he would emphasize that the democrats are closer to 
the cubans true best interests 
every time that something good happened to us the doors were 
opened the air bridge from cuba the social programs that helped 
us the democrats were in office ferro said 
cuba remains a priority but there are other issues that bind 
us together ferro added 
he said the cubans with their strong anticommunist interests 
can still fit into the democratic party just as do jews with their 
strong stands on israel and blacks with their antisouth africa 
interest 
i think other hispanic groups should defer to us on cuba i 
see no contradiction with the democratic party condemning cuba 
within the framework of human rights just as it condemns south 
africa ferro said 
campaign planners in the state for democratic presidential 
nominee michael dukakis say they wont concede the cuban vote to 
vice president george bush and probably will have dukakis and vice 
presidential nominee lloyd bentsen campaign among them both 
nominees speak spanish 
haynes from texas said bentsens popularity with hispanics in 
texas and his conservative stands might play well with cubans 
sen bob graham dfla said he received 25 present to 35 
percent of the cuban vote in his 1986 election after 1984 
presidential nominee walter mondale got about 5 percent 
i think there is the legitimate basis for a transition i 
dont think its going to happen overnight graham said 
tommy thomas a southern cochairman for the bush campaign and 
former florida republican party chairman said theres little 
chance dukakis will pick up cuban votes republicans will be 
emphasizing his liberal positions and opposition to aiding 
nicaraguan contra rebels 
our cubans are going to be wholeheartedly for george bush

in 1984 at age 13 evelyn 
lau was one of 12 winners in an essay contest who got to meet pope 
john paul ii at 16 she had become a runaway supporting herself 
and her drug habit with prostitution 
i told myself this wasnt prostitution its just give and 
take lau said it was there and i had about 25 cents in my 
pocket and i had an amazing capacity at first to just block it 
out 
then she realized that her writing was taking a back seat to 
drugs 
that totally destroyed me said lau 
after an unsuccessful suicide attempt she wound up in a 
hospital a year ago she decided to stop doing drugs and resume 
writing 
now at 17 she has a canada council grant for 13000 more 
than 10700 us for her writing and a contract with a toronto 
publisher for her first book to be called small lives the diary 
of a street kid 
she also has more dubious signs of success legal problems and 
lawyers fees over which she has little control because she is now 
a ward of the state 
she left home because of friction with her parents possibly the 
reason social caseworkers decided not to return her to her parents 
and since she was a juvenile not with her family canadian law 
required that she be made a ward of the state 
she said officials in the social services ministry have told her 
they are not sure she can handle the grant which comes out to 
about 1100 more than 900 us a month she is negotiating with 
public trustee steven rumsey and the ministry superintendent over 
how her grant should be paid 
its hard enough being a writer and not getting a paycheck 
every two weeks and the rewards are few and far between lau 
said after she learned of the award last week then when you get 
rewarded they take it away from you 
i felt like i was more of a human out there on the street 
than i am now at least i had some control 
im supposed to be jumping up and down but i feel like every 
time i do something that everybody should be happy about they have 
an anxiety attack she said theyre afraid im going to take 
the money and blow it which isnt even feasible 
if i went out and got a job that paid 1100 a month they 
wouldnt come after me and say youre making too much money so 
how is this different isnt this work she said 
we want to make sure the monies are used for the purposes 
intended by the grant rumsey said wednesday we would be 
responsible in looking after the funds as trustees 
lau also receives 480 a month in social assistance she pays 
300 for rent and uses the rest for writing expenses 
when i get my check i buy my supplies first paper ribbons 
stamps im constantly submitting my short stories and poems to 
magazines and im not going to give that up but its amazing how 
much it costs lau said 
her first encounter with the problems of being a ward of the 
state came when the public trustee hired lawyer bruce mccoll to 
review her contract with literary agent denise bukowski her book 
contract with collins publishers and her manuscript for any 
potential libel 
mccolls 175anhour fee is to be paid from laus advance on 
royalties from collins although the size of the advance was not 
known 
bukowski said the lawyer is unnecessary because the publisher 
has its own lawyers to check the manuscript butmccoll said he 
redrafted the agents contract approved the publishers contract 
we have a responsibility to protect the child rumsey said 
the publisher may well have counsel but that doesnt necessarily 
mean the best advice is going to go to the infant

hungarian leader karoly grosz eager to 
strengthen ties to the west as part of an ambitious reform program 
comes to washington this week on the first visit by a hungarian of 
his rank since the country came under communist rule 40 years ago 
since becoming premier in june 1987 grosz has moved decisively 
to pursue economic and political openings to the west where the 
image of hungary for years had been largely shaped by the soviet 
armys smashing of an antimoscow uprising in 1956 
groszs 11day us visit which began last week and took him 
to illinois california and new york has its high point wednesday 
when has a luncheon with president reagan during a white house 
visit 
he also will meet with secretary of state george shultz 
congressional leaders and democratic presidential nominee michael 
dukakis 
grosz who became communist party general secretary last may in 
addition to premier is the first warsaw pact leader to make an 
official visit to washington since 1978 when president carter 
received romanian leader nicolai ceaucescu 
grosz 57 is from the same generation as mikhail gorbachev and 
like the soviet leader he has called for a new era of openness and 
economic restructuring 
us officials insisting on anonymity said that grosz will be 
encouraged during his talks here to continue his announced policy 
of seeking increased trade with and investment from western 
countries 
to improve efficiency grosz has been pushing marketoriented 
approaches but this and other measures have increased unemployment 
levels in hungary another problem area for grosz is hungarys 11 
billion foreign debt 
among economic goals approved by the party since grosz 
accession are more foreign investment fewer restrictions on the 
ownership of foreign capital an expansion of private initiatives 
and a greater voice for consumers 
in chicago last wednesday grosz witnessed the signing of a 115 
million joint venture between a hungarian entity and guardian 
industries corp an illinoisbased glass manufacturer 
we have seen science and technology tear down borders between 
countries and even continents and those who come to recognize 
this will be in an advantageous position said grosz 
grosz also met with officials of macdonalds corp to discuss a 
larger presence in hungary for the fast food giant the firm 
already has a thriving operation in budapest 
grosz has been courting west european leaders as well he was 
received warmly on visits to bonn and london and three weeks ago 
hungary became the first communist country to reach an agreement 
with the european community 
the accord will gradually allow expanded hungarian exports to 
western europe by removing present tariffs and quotas between now 
and 1995 
still hungary is intent on maintaining its traditional role as 
a member of the sovietled warsaw pact more than three decades 
after the soviet invasion of hungary an estimated 65000 soviet 
troops are deployed there 
us intelligence officials recently received indications that 
the soviets were planning to withdraw these forces but thus far 
there has been no announcement

here is the text of president reagans weekly 
radio address given from his ranch near santa barbara calif 
my fellow americans this week there was a certain meeting in 
atlanta and maybe like me you just couldnt help hearing a few 
things about it and shaking your head some people just dont seem 
to learn 
the american people want to hear straight talk about where our 
leaders plan to take the country not personal attacks for all our 
history we americans have debated our differences vigorously but 
like two of the earliest political adversaries in our history 
thomas jefferson and john adams while weve always fought hard 
for our differing opinions weve honored each other for taking 
part in the democratic process 
this weeks convention speakers seemed to forget this american 
tradition but beyond that there was something amazing about what 
we heard our liberal opposition seems to think so much is bad in 
america 
to hear them talk you would never have guessed that were in 
the longest peacetime economic expansion on record that america 
has created over 17 million jobs in the last five years or that a 
greater proportion of americans in the work force has jobs today 
than ever before in our history 
you would never have guessed that after dropping by three 
percent when their party was last in the white house the real 
income of the typical american family has grown by more than 10 
percent since the current expansion began 
you would never have guessed that our cuts in tax rates and 
recent tax reform have done exactly what we said they would do 
americans with the most income pay more of our total income taxes 
than before many americans at the bottom of the scale no longer 
pay any income tax at all and growth and opportunity have been 
born again in america 
most of all you would never have guessed how much our expansion 
has meant to all americans for example one respected economic 
writer noted that for black americans the year 1982 to 1986 
represented in his wordson every front jobs income even 
household wealth the best five years in black history 
no listening to the rhetoric youd never have guessed 
americas economy is the strongest in decades to them its 
midnight in america its the same sad song they sang four years 
ago 
they say they want to turn america around when their party left 
the white house eight years ago inflation was at one of the 
highest levels in american history now its under control do 
they want to turn that around 
 
when they left office americas industrial productivity was 
stalled our competitiveness was slipping and technological 
research the key to our industrial future appeared to be on hold 
today manufacturing productivity is rising strongly some rate 
us as the most competitive nation for manufacturing costs in the 
industrial world and were again the worlds leader in developing 
new technology do they want to turn that around 
and when their party turned over the keys to the white house 
the soviet union was going forward with the biggest arms buildup 
in history we were cutting back and the soviets had invaded 
afghanistan today we have the first treaty in world history to 
eliminate an entire class of us and soviet nuclear missiles the 
soviets have pulled troops out of afghanistan and americansoviet 
relations are better than theyve been for a good long while do 
they want to turn that around too 
they said america can do better with that i wholeheartedly 
agree but the people also know that the last time our opponents 
were in charge america did a heck of a lot worse what do your 
opponents really want to do well again and again weve heard from 
the press that our opposition just wont say weve heard that they 
dont want to level with the country because when theyve done that 
in the past the country hasnt liked what its heard so this 
year theyve learned one lesson theyre covering their tracks 
youll never hear that l word liberal from them theyve 
put on political trenchcoats and dark glasses and slipped their 
platform into a plain brown wrapper but while theyre saying that 
government needs to do more of this or more of that will they also 
pledge not to raise taxes 
while theyre talking about reducing the danger of nuclear 
weapons will they also pledge to go forward full speed with our 
strategic defense initiative the one practical way of reducing the 
threat of those weapons once and for all and while theyre talking 
about the war on drugs will they also support the death penalty 
for drug kingpins 
the american people expect straight talk about real issues 
thats what they deserve and thats what they ought to get 
until next week thanks for listening and god bless you

m danny wall the nearly bald regulator of 
the nations savings institutions is known as an optimist by the 
comb he still carries 
a year ago wall pushed hard for and was appointed to the 
chairmanship of the federal home loan bank board a job only a 
cockeyed optimist would want at a time of unprecedented industry 
losses and mounting sampl failures 
to prove his credentials he had only to pull out his pocket 
comb and make a rueful reference to the few wispy strands of hair 
on the top of his head 
despite a year filled with criticism and difficulties wall said 
in a recent interview we havent had any surprises and asked 
about his comb he said smiling i still have it 
the 48yearold former republican staff director of the senate 
banking committee enjoyed something of a honeymoon after he took 
office last july replacing edwin j gray an aloof administrator 
disliked by his staff the industry and congress 
a big part of grays problem was outside his control his agency 
was out of money and couldnt do much to stop the savings industry 
from sliding into a morass 
wall came in with a number of pluses a squeaky clean image a 
reputation for candor and enthusiasm and most importantly money 
to work with congress last august provided for a 108 billion 
industryfinanced infusion over three years into the federal 
savings and loan insurance corp which guarantees deposits up to 
100000 in 3100 institutions 
now the honeymoon is drawing to a close and there is no 
shortage of critics but even the critics acknowledge the bank 
boards herculean task insolvent institutions account for more 
than 10 percent of the industry and losses in 1988 are expected to 
top the 76 billion postdepression record of last year 
i think he has the toughest job in the us government and 
everything has to be seen in that context said eric hemel a 
former bank board economist now an analyst for first boston corp 
earlier this month the house banking committee put wall through 
a grueling session when he revealed he had more than doubled his 
estimate of the cost of closing or merging insolvent sampls in texas 
the state where the industry is sickest 
in may wall was being criticized for being too optimistic by 
insisting it was too soon to tell if his agency needed more money 
while private analysts were calling for a taxpayer bailout 
democrats were suggesting there were political motivations for 
pushing debate over the problem into the next administration 
walls refiguring less than two months later boosted the 
pricetag for cleaning up the entire industry nationwide from 227 
billion to 309 billion more in line with the 26 billion to 36 
billion estimate of the general accounting office and within range 
of the 40 billion to 75 billion estimated by private analysts 
but he was still criticized for the change 
now you see it now you dont complained a frustrated rep 
fernand j st germain dri chairman of the house banking 
committee 
wall in the interview said the new estimate was based on new 
information adding were trying to present a realistic view of 
the problem were trying to keep everyones fever in proper 
perspective 
despite the higher projected pricetag wall is still saying the 
fslic could have enough money to handle the problem but to do 
that he has had to offend another important constituency 
executives of the industry he regulates 
savings institutions were already disturbed by walls support of 
legislation extending by one year the moratorium preventing them 
from converting from fslic membership to the federal deposit 
insurance corp the healthier fdic insures deposits in commercial 
banks charging member institutions less than half of the 
assessment charged by fslic 
industry executives objected when they found out wall intended 
to cover the cost of his his newly increased estimate of costs by 
extending the special assessment thrift institutions are paying to 
recapitalize fslic to 1998 originally it was scheduled to be 
phased out by 1991 
br beeksma chairman of interwest savings bank in oak harbor 
wash and vice chairman of the us league said the extension 
would be misguided 
whats necessary for this industry to survive in the long run 
is the ability to attract new capital recently the entire 
profits of our business have been made available to solve the 
problems of fslic yet we simply have to have profits because we 
cant attract capital unless we have them he said 
wall has also been criticized for moving too slowly in closing 
or finding buyers for insolvent institutions in texas which alone 
accounted for 35 billion of the industrys 38 billion loss in 
the first three months of this year 
its just taking too long to get the deals done said bert 
ely an alexandria va consultant and by being so slow they 
are reducing the number of people who are even willing to look at a 
deal 
were critical of ourselves in that regard wall said but 
he pointed to three large transactions in the state in may and june 
and promised the pace would pick up 
since money began flowing into fslic coffers in october wall 
said his agency has closed merged or otherwise resolved the 
problems of 65 sampls 
and conservatively he said the board would resolve the cases 
of another 100 institutions by the end of this year about one 
third of the sampls considered insolvent under regulatory rules 
if you had asked me about three months ago i would have said 
were getting a lot of great promises but not much action said 
james butera chief lobbyist of the national council of savings 
institutions a trade group but in the last three months he has 
really come through

ne win who was blamed for leading burma 
into isolation and economic ruin during 26 years of authoritarian 
rule quit saturday as chairman of the nations only political 
party and announced a referendum on oneparty rule 
speaking to a special session of the ruling burma socialist 
program party the 77yearold leader cited bloody antigovernment 
rioting in march and june as a main reason for his resignation 
five veteran party leaders including the nations president and 
vice president less important positions than the party 
chairmanship also resigned 
since i am indirectly responsible for the march and june 
affairs and because of my adanced age i am resigning from both 
party chairmanship and also as a member ne win told 1000 
delegates in remarks broadcast on state radio and television 
bloodshed in march and june showed the lack of trust and 
confidence in the government ne win said to find out whether 
the majority or the minority are behind the demonstrators a 
referendum must be held so the people can choose between the 
existing oneparty system or a multiparty system 
he said the referendum would be held no later than the end of 
september until which the current government would continue its 
functions 
if a multiparty system is chosen ne win said general 
elections must be held even if voters chose to retain a oneparty 
state there should be necessary modifications he said 
whatever the results of the referendum and whatever the new 
government i will completely retire from politics ne win said 
the party congress was expected to choose a new chairman monday 
maung maung kha prime minister since 1977 was seen as a likely 
candidate 
since coming to power in a 1962 military coup ne win led burma 
into isolation from the world community the nations economy 
deteriorated and political and personal freedoms were curtailed 
studentled demonstrations have rocked rangoon and other burmese 
cities thre times since last october resulting in deaths mass 
arrests and the closure of universities 
ne win resigned from the presidency in 1981 but retained the far 
more important party post he was the most powerful figure in burma 
authorities announced the convening of the threeday party 
congress on july 7 two weeks after thousands of students and other 
demonstrators battled riot police in the streets of the capital 
leaving at least nine people dead 
a daytime curfew imposed on rangoon following the rioting was 
lifted but violence spread to the cities of prome and taunggyi 
last week and at least four people were reported killed 
state radio disclosed last week that 41 people who were packed 
into police vans during rioting in march suffocated on their way to 
prison 
despite promises of economic liberalization the government in 
october withdrew three currency notes from circulation and offered 
no compensation triggering the first of the three major 
antigovernment protests 
western diplomats in rangoon and other western observers said 
the outbursts after years of passivity reflected intense 
disillusionment with the government 
regarded as potentially the richest nation in resources in 
southeast asia burma has a per capita income of less than 200 and 
ranks among the worlds 10 poorest countries 
once the worlds largest rice exporter and an oil producer 
burma has suffered food shortages and has had to import petroleum 
products 
although the state officially controls much of the economy most 
burmese rely on black market goods smuggled in from thailand china 
and malaysia 
most foreign analysts and many burmese blame ne wins rigid 
socalled burmese way to socialism for these failures the 
way is an amalgam forged during ne wins early years in power 
of a centralized economy oneparty militarybacked rule and 
buddhism 
probably as a result of burmas colonial past ne win also 
sought to exclude foreign influence including direct involvement 
by private foreign companies in recent years tourists have been 
allowed to enter the country but only on sevenday visas 
the five leaders who resigned wth ne win were san yu party vice 
chairman and president of the country aye ko party 
secretarygeneral and vice president sein lwin party joint 
general secretary and secretary of the council of state kyaw htin 
party central executive committee mamber deputy prime minister and 
defense minister and tun tin central executive committee members 
deputy prime minister and finance minister 
they are to retain their government positions until a new 
government is formed

iran said iraqi forces today moved across 
huge sections of iranian territory and bombed targets with chemical 
weapons 
the fighting reported by both countries came as a un team

the drought is even beginning to interfere 
with good clean fun 
officials of the annual derby days festival said the dry 
conditions this summer made it difficult to find enough frogs to 
compete in the 33rd annual state frog jumping contest this weekend 
last year 300 frog trainers ranging in age from 2 to 99 years 
entered their leapers but not everyone comes to the competition 
with their own frog so contest organizers sell locally raised 
jumpers for 1 
jane abbott 76 a contest organizer said marshes are dry this 
year and theres been a dramatic decline in the frog population 
usually by this time of year we have lots of frogs hopping 
around croaking and just having a good time abbott said but 
not this year 
contest organizers called local companies that use frogs for 
research and asking them to donate competitors abbott said 
the woman at one company said we have some but theyre all 
bull frogs i told her i dont care what the frogs are full of 
i just want frogs abbott joked 
abbott who has judged the competition for 33 years said 
participants have no shame about the way they go about trying to 
win 
once a frog is put in the jumping circle and the timer is 
ticking owners often drop to their knees and coax cajole and 
even sing ballads trying to persuade their green athletes to jump 
she said 
it is anything but dignified she said frogs are funny 
you know sometimes theyll jump forward and then just turn around 
and jump back again

a man who was rehired by honeywell inc after 
serving four years in prison for strangling a coworker has been 
charged with killing another coworker a woman he allegedly 
stalked and threatened for weeks 
randy don landin who surrendered after the first slaying in 
1979 turned himself in again friday in the shotgun slaying of 
kathleen nesser saying hed heard wed been looking for him 
said sgt jeff mcfarlane of suburban new hope 
police had launched a search for landin after nesser 25 was 
slain early tuesday outside her new hope home where she lived with 
her 18monthold daughter 
honeywell spokesman tim morin said he didnt know the specifics 
of landins rehiring but the philosophy we have is that we dont 
discriminate when it comes to hiring practices 
police had been trying to get the victim to file a complaint 
about threats allegedly made by landin if i knew then what i know 
now i guess we probably would have tried to move heaven and earth 
to prevent what happened said mcfarlane 
landin 31 was charged with murder and jailed on 1 million 
bail 
in 1980 he pleaded guilty to murdering his girlfriend nancy 
miller he was released from prison in 1984 after serving 4 years 
of an eightyear sentence reduced for good behavior and a year 
spent in jail awaiting trial 
landin who worked for honeywell from 1977 to 1979 when he was 
indicted in millers death was rehired a few weeks after his 
release 
police said nesser befriended landin at honeywells facility in 
the suburb of st louis park where they were maintenance workers 
landin told nesser that millers death was an accident police said 
but landin began stalking nesser after she rebuffed his romantic 
advances harassing her with phone calls police said a death 
threat note found on her locker about a month ago read one more 
day dead mcfarlane said 
st louis park police found only nessers fingerprints on the 
locker door mcfarlane said saturday 
some residents of new hope said nesser was scared to death of 
the man who frequently visited her home neighbors said they 
heard her phone ring unanswered for hours 
on june 30 nesser complained to her supervisor that she was 
being harassed by another worker on july 1 honeywell officials 
went to police with nessers concerns and six days later she was 
reassigned to the companys plymouth plant mcfarlane said 
nesser also changed her telephone number 
landin telephoned his supervisor on july 7 and resigned 
mcfarlane said 
mcfarlane said police asked nesser to make a statement about the 
incidents so they could arrest landin on charges of making 
terroristic threats she was scheduled to make the statement 10 
days before she was killed but failed to show he said 
mcfarlane who talked to nesser the friday before her death 
said she was getting kind of complacent because there hadnt been 
any threats for almost a week since she changed her phone number 
she got some breathing space after her transfer to plymouth 
and she felt that if she charged him it would make things worse 
and she was feeling better he said 
on monday mcfarlane said st louis park police told him they 
had not heard from nesser and had not been able to contact her 
because her number had been changed 
if you want to assess real blame were all guilty he said 
he was convicted he got a sweet deal for no reason he got out 
honeywell hired him back this is just a whole series of errors 
that culminated in a tragedy 
in a statement issued friday through honeywell nessers mother 
patricia nesser said we are relieved that a suspect in kathys 
murder is now in custody i have no hate for him it is not in me 
to feel malice for him at least not now

st elizabeths hospital wants to allow 
presidential assailant john hinckley jr to leave the mental 
institution for a supervised recreational day trip with other 
patients a district of columbia official said saturday 
the secret service however is opposing the proposed outing 
saying that the 33yearold hinckley remains a threat to president 
reagan and other federal officials that it protects 
hinckley was committed to the hospital in 1982 after he was 
found innocent by reason of insanity in the march 30 1981 
shooting of reagan white house press secretary james brady a 
secret service agent and a dc policeman 
the proposed outing would except for court appearances be 
hinckleys first trip off the hospital grounds since dec 28 1986 
when he received a 12hour pass to have dinner with his parents 
hospital staffers escorted him 
dr raymond patterson administrator of the forensic services 
division of the dc commission on mental health said a review 
board at st elizabeths has approved hinckleys participation in an 
outing to a museum park or other public place 
patterson who declined to say when or where the day trip might 
occur said that such outings are routine for st elizabeths 
patients once physicians decide they are capable to participating 
in such activities 
these activities are considered therapeutic and allow 
physicians to see how patients are able to handle themselves 
patterson said in a telephone interview 
he said outings generally last from two to 12 hours and that 
there is always at least one staff member for every five patients 
on a trip 
federal prosecutors have asked us district judge barrington 
parker to hold a hearing on the proposed day trip parker who 
presided at hinckleys trial was not consulted about the 1986 
pass and hospital officials agreed to inform him in advance of 
such activities 
patterson said that st elizabeths does not inform the courts 
about impending day trips by other patients committed there as a 
result of criminal proceedings 
mr hinckley will benefit therapeutically from participation 
in this activity the hospital said in a letter to parker it 
has also been clinically determined that he can participate in this 
activity without posing a danger to himself or to others 
secret service spokesman richard adams said the agency disagrees 
we dont believe he should be released under any conditions 
adams said we believe him to be a threat to our protectees and 
will continue to believe that theres nothing thats been shown to 
us to indicate hes any different 
the last time st elizabeths sought permission for an 
offgrounds activity for hinckley was for an easter 1987 visit with 
his parents the request was dropped after it was disclosed that 
hinckley had corresponded with theodore bundy a convicted serial 
killer

a national conference sponsored by the 
american bar association called saturday for major changes in the 
nations guardianship system including expanded legal rights and 
representation for the old and disabled 
fortyfour experts including attorneys psychiatrists judges 
researchers and government officials also cautioned that judges 
and lawyers were often quantitatively and qualitatively 
inadequate in performing their guardianship duties and 
recommended greater awareness of flaws in the system 
aba officials attending the national guardianship symposium a 
response to the associated press inquiry said the meeting was a 
result of growing concerns about the nations guardianship system 
including the findings of the aps 50state investigation of abuses 
in courtordered guardianships 
its the perception of many professionals that the 
guardianship system is not meeting the needs of some people and may 
be abusing the rights of others as demonstrated by the information 
in the ap report said nancy nevelowf dubler a commissioner with 
that abas commission on the legal problems of the elderly 
last years ap series found many of the 300000 to 400000 
elderly under guardianship in this country are stripped of their 
rights and placed under the power of a guardian without the same 
court protections given those facing criminal charges 
an ap review of 2200 case files also found the courts often 
failed to do their job monitoring guardianships leaving elderly 
wards prey to financial and physical abuse at the hands of their 
guardians 
the threeday conference issued 36 recommendations for change in 
the system among them 
legal representation for all those facing guardianship the 
group said attorneys should represent the wishes of clients the ap 
investigation found lawyers often dismiss the rights of their 
clients facing guardianship 
the elimination of age economic status medical diagnosis or 
eccentricity as sole reasons for placing someone under 
guardianship while many state laws permit guardianships for 
reasons of age alone the conference stressed that guardianship be 
used only when the person can no longer care of themselves 
greater efforts by judges lawyers and court personnel to 
understand the problems of the elderly the courts were urged to 
tailor proceedings for those with poor eyesight or hard of hearing 
attempts to find alternatives to guardianship in cases where 
it does not serve the interests of the proposed ward the ap study 
found people are often placed under guardianship to assure payments 
to nursing homes or limit liability to hospitals 
david wexler a university of arizona law professor and chairman 
of the abas commission on the mentally disabled said the 
recommendations come at a time when the guardianship system is 
coming under greater scrutiny 
as the population ages and a larger number of people has 
experience with this system it has to grow in importance he said 
john perry commission director said the recommendations would 
go on to various aba groups for review with hopes that state 
legislatures and individual courts would amend laws and practices 
its one of the first volleys being fired in this issue he 
said 
since the aps series last fall some 20 states have either 
passed or considered legislation to reform guardianship systems in 
their courts 
rep claude pepper dfla has drafted legislation setting 
federal guardianship standards for the courts rep don bonker 
dwash also has drafted recommended standards for the system 
the conference was sponsored by the abas commission on the 
mentally disabled and commission on legal problems of the elderly 
and was hosted by the johnson foundation

a group of traditionalist priests and seminarians 
have broken with renegade archbishop marcel lefebvre and are 
setting up their own organization loyal to the papacy according to 
a roman catholic magazine 
in an interview with the monthly 30 giorni abbe joseph bisig 
said 16 priests and 20 seminarians have joined the group and many 
others are expected 
the interview to appear in the magazines august issue was 
released to the media saturday 
bisig a former official in lefebvres st pius x fraternity in 
switzerland said the new organization called the priestly 
fraternity of st peter was being set up in hauterive switzerland 
lefebvre an 82yearold frenchman who heads an 
ultratraditionalist movement opposed to modernizing the roman 
catholic church was excommunicated after he consecrated four 
bishops without papal approval on june 30 the consecration led to 
the first schism in the church in more than a century 
the vatican warned lefebvres followers that they also will be 
excommunicated if they adhere to his movement but pope john paul 
ii promised to meet their traditionalist needs including wider use 
of the 16th century latin mass if they remained loyal to the 
papacy 
we want to be tied to the spiritual and liturgical tradition 
in the church thus with peter bisig was quoted as saying we 
want to show our brothers that have created the rupture with rome 
that they can remain traditionalist catholics within the church 
bisig said he met with the pope and other vatican officials in 
rome in early july to discuss the new traditionalist fraternity he 
said he was promised by cardinal joseph ratzinger the popes 
guardian of orthodoxy that the group would receive official 
vatican recognition by september at the latest 
it is absolutely not our intention to fight with the st pius 
x fraternity bisig was quoted as saying we are actually very 
grateful for everything lefebvre has done apart from the schism 
he fought against progressivism and modernisn that is also our 
objective but we want to do it within the church

kathy foster a thirdyear student at tufts 
university school of medicine was caring for a 10yearold boy 
with cancer last year when she noticed his depression over being 
tutored while other youngsters were out playing 
i thought thats something medical students could do help 
kids with their school work while theyre at the hospital 
undergoing chemotherapy said foster in an interview saturday 
foster organized a group called kids in chemotherapy support 
kics and passed out a questionnaire to other students to find out 
how many might want to donate their time she was amazed by the 
response more than 75 tufts medical students signed up 
in order to link young cancer patients with medical students 
foster contacted dr lawrence wolfe assistant professor of 
pediatrics at tufts medical school and chief of pediatric 
hematologyoncology at the new england medical center so far 
seven kics students and patients have been matched 
the program is similar to the big brotherbig sister 
organization but the medical students help the children through 
the kind of difficulties most kids fortunately dont face 
the older kids are really concerned about their appearance 
such as hair loss or being too thin or their faces may be swollen 
from steroids said foster 
students learn to help the kids cope with their problems 
cautiously 
you cant just come right out and ask them how they feel about 
losing their hair she said but after playing a board game 
with them four or five times a lot of kids will confide in you and 
say theyre afraid of cancer 
many children spend their eight hours of chemotherapy in the 
hospital alone with family or friends foster said she is helping 
a 15yearold vietnamese girl who has oriental cholangitis a rare 
gastrointestinal disorder the girl lives with her grandmother and 
other relatives who attach a social stigman to her illness foster 
said 
chris aho spokeswoman for the medical school said school 
officials were surprised at the number of students who signed up 
for the program 
part of it is theyre so anxious to be with patients said 
aho they want to help so much theyre looking for that 
humanitarian aspect in people 
the students and the children often go on group outings last 
spring they attended a red sox baseball game at fenway park the 
highlight of the game said foster wsa watching sevenyearold 
derek walsh a kics child enjoy the game 
walsh had a wilmss tumor on his kidney but following surgery 
and chemotherapy he is cancerfree at this point he was strong 
enough to play baseball this spring 
foster said many of the students have formed close bonds with 
their young friends and their families 
when you are assigned to a child you have that childthe whole 
time they are undergoing chemotherapy said foster some 
parents have even invited students over for dinner the students 
involved in these programs just love it they wouldnt give it up 
for anything

ne win a onetime military hero and 
burmas undisputed ruler for 26 years relinquished his grip on 
power in a country shaken by mounting political unrest and economic 
decline 
citing antigovernment rioting and advancing age ne win 
announced saturday he was resigning as chairman of the countrys 
sole political party the burma socialist program party 
ne win whose name means brilliant as the sun in burmese 
called for a referendum on ending oneparty rule that could shake 
the very political foundations he established after seizing power 
in a 1962 military coup 
born shu maung on may 14 1911 in the central burmese town of 
paungbe he took the name ne win after entering revolutionary 
politics in what was then a british colony 
ne win worked briefly as a postal clerk after failing in medical 
studies he joined the antibritish movement and became one of 
burmas thirty comrades who traveled secretly to japan for 
military training in the early days of world war ii 
returning to burma ne win and his comrades fought first 
alongside the japanese against the british but then turned against 
their teachers after realizing that japan would also colonize 
rather than liberate the burmese 
ne win rose quickly in the military and became chief of staff of 
the burmese armed forces in 1949 the year after burma gained 
independence 
he came to the political forefront in 1958 when the military 
pushed aside an ineffective prime minister and established a 
caretaker government in a country wracked by poverty and ethnic 
division 
as promised elections were held in 1960 nu soon to become ne 
wins archrival won the post of prime minister ne win who had 
the makings of a popular leader staged a coup in 1962 jailed nu 
and vowed to lead his country on a neutralist egalitarian and 
moralistic burmese road to socialism 
once known as a playboy and gambler ne win banned gambling 
closed nightclubs and preached strict traditional morality this 
did not stop him from enjoying horse racing or from marrying six 
times 
he moved quickly toward socialism private businesses were 
nationalized generally with little or no compensation and the 
central government attempted to run everything from the vital rice 
trade to light manufacturing 
foreign private investment ceased and foreigners were carefully 
screened before being allowed into the country some charged that 
burmese leaders including ne win could not shake a postcolonial 
syndrome that included xenophobia 
ne win became president under a constitution written in 1974 
although he retired from the military in 1972 ne win maintained 
effective control of the capable wellorganized armed forces that 
served as his chief instrument of control 
when antigovernment riots erupted from time to time ne win 
moved ruthlessly to suppress them thousands of dissenters were 
jailed although most were later releaed there have been 
persistent allegations of human rights violations 
fearing assassination ne win rarely appeared in public 
traveled under tight security and never gave a press conference he 
became a recluse and spent much of his time in a heavilyguarded 
lakeside villa on the edge of rangoon 
about the only time rangoon residents could catch a glimpse of 
their leader was inside his heavily guarded limousine on the way to 
play golf 
he also kept potential rivals at bay by firing or jailing 
upandcoming leaders and demanding loyalty from subordinates 
burmese say ne win is both a shrewd calculating political 
tactician and a personality given to sudden outbursts of anger 
his moves were rarely foreshadowed 
his resignation from the presidency in 1981 was unexpected as 
was saturdays announcement that he would step down from his one 
remaining post the chairmanship of the party 
he cited poor health on the first occasion and advancing age on 
saturday there have been unconfirmed reports of heart kidney and 
stomach problems but after 1981 ne win gave no indication that 
declining health had lessened his grip on power

american tourists grumble about prices in italy even 
as they pitch coins into the trevi fountain the symbolic gesture 
is supposed to guarantee a return to rome but that is something 
fewer americans can afford to do 
weve been traveling for a month and this is the most 
expensive place weve been said caroline faris of wilson nc 
paris and nice were cheaper and thats surprising 
italian tour operators arent surprised they say italy is 
pricing itself out of the market with exorbitant rates and inferior 
service the government predicts that compared to last year us 
tourism will drop by more than 6 percent or 112000 people 
tourism from other countries is on the rise and students and 
backpackers from the united states still jam the streets of 
florence and the ferries in the venice lagoon the dropoff is 
among the big spenders 
we are one of the most expensive countries in the world for 
hotels and restaurants and this comes with a very low level of 
service quality said isabella di montezemolo a spokeswoman for 
american express travel services here 
our country is very rich in natural and historical beauty but 
people are getting a bit tired of the services she said they 
feel they are being taken for a ride 
our tourist services are 30 years old they are too old too 
small and not competitive anymore said enzo poli the president 
of a federation of 2700 italian travel agents and tour operators 
giovanni colombo the president of the federation of italian 
hotels said that compared to last year the number of foreign 
tourists in italian hotels has increased by 5 percent ms di 
montezmolo cited a 47 percent increase this year in japanese 
tourism due to a favorable exchange rate 
but industry officials are concerned about the drop in the 
number of americans who traditionally are among the biggest 
spenders 
this year americans wont be the big spenders and they will 
shorten their vacations in italy said franco cesaretti of the 
aviatur travel agency in rome 
franco paloscia spokesman for the italian national tourist 
office said his government spent about 92 million over the past 
two years to promote italys image 
his office predicts americans will account for 6 percent of 
foreign tourism this year and at least 10 percent of the revenue 
in 1985 americans made up about 7 percent of the tourists and 17 
percent of the revenue 
that was before the rise of middle east terrorism in europe and 
the fallout from the chernobyl nuclear plant accident in the soviet 
union sent vacationing americans elsewhere 
the italian tourism industry discounts the theory that recent 
acts of terrorism in europe such as the killing of a us diplomat 
in greece and an attack on a tourist ship there are factors in the 
declining number of us tourists 
terrorism is not scaring american tourists anymore said 
paloscia terrorism pollution strikes are problems which 
tourists learn to live with 
ms di montemezelo agreed blaming instead the weak position of 
the dollar 
this is not connected to terrorism she said the decrease 
is due mainly to the dollar bookings are done mainly in november 
and november was the lowest point reached by the dollar 
the dollar has rebounded from a value of 1208 lire in november 
to about 1365 lire but officials say that is not enough for 
people to change their plans 
italy is extremely expensive it is one of the most expensive 
countries in the world said cesaretti of the aviatur travel 
agency he said that in rome the average price of a night in a 
firstclass hotel is 184 to 220 while in madrid it is 95 to 
110 
an american express spokeswoman in london who asked not to be 
identified said a 14day holiday in spain at a threestar hotel 
with breakfasts some dinners and sightseeing tours would cost 965 
while a comparable tour in italy would cost 1495

president zia ulhaq on saturday 
accused the soviet union of sending thousands of troops back into 
afghanistan to defend the capital of kabul but moscow called it a 
sheer lie and said its pullout is continuing 
the official soviet news agency tass reported meanwhile that 
afghan rebels fired six rockets into residential areas of kabul 
saturday killing two people including a 3yearold girl tass 
said six people were wounded and several homes destroyed in the 
third rocket attack on kabul in a week 
zia the pakistani army chief of staff said the soviets 
decided not only to stop their withdrawal but they have also 
brought in something like 10000 troops back from the soviet union 
into kabul because kabul was under threat 
zia speaking at a news conference refused to reveal the source 
of his information other than to say it came from a very reliable 
source 
the soviets agreed in april to withdraw more than 100000 troops 
backing the kabul government in its war with usbacked moslem 
guerrillas 
in moscow tass quoted marshal sergei akhromeyev chief of 
staff as saying the pullout continues he described the claims of 
bringing in 10000 troops as a sheer lie 
the us state department said there were conflicting reports 
about a possible reintroduction of soviet troops in afghanistan 
and cited akhromeyevs statement saturday that the withdrawal is 
still in progress 
the geneva accords are clear that the soviets are to have half 
their forces out by aug 15 and the rest by feb 15 1989 we 
expect them to comply with this obligation and their commitment to 
us said the state department statement made available saturday 
at the white house press office in santa barbara calif 
earlier last week western diplomatic sources claimed soviet 
troops were taking the lead in the defense of kabul after a series 
of guerrilla attacks 
diplomats speaking on the usual condition of anonymity said 
unconfirmed reports from usually reliable sources claim 4000 
guerrillas have massed on the western edge of the capital and 
fighting is reported tense on all fronts 
rockets blasted the city tuesday and wednesday official radio 
kabul said 15 people were killed tuesday and diplomats put the 
toll at 17 casualty figures for wednesdays attack were not 
available 
on friday rebels shelled the afghan city of jalalabad killing 
a woman a child and two other people according to tass the news 
agency quoting its afghan counterpart bakhtar said nine people 
were wounded in the attack 
tass quoted the afghan president najib as calling in a 
televised speech saturday for an end to the bloodshed and 
fractracide the agency said najib blamed pakistan a guerrilla 
ally for the increase in attacks 
soviet troops entered afghanistan in december 1979 to help the 
government fight the guerrillas in the unbrokered geneva 
agreement signed in april the kremlin agreed in april to withdraw 
its troops but the rebels who did not sign the agreement vowed to 
fight on 
zia denied pakistan has violated the geneva accords the afghan 
government has lodged almost 55 complaints with a un monitoring 
team accusing pakistan of harboring guerrillas supplying them 
with weapons and allowing a resistance government to establish 
itself on pakistani soil

danbury moved from fifth place to the top of the list because of 
a lower crime rate slightly better schools and its proximity to 
new york citys museums theaters and topflight hospitals money 
said in its august issue 
danbury with 60470 residents is about 55 miles northeast of 
new york 
i think its great it makes us feel good said robert d 
kennedy chairman of union carbide corp which is headquartered in 
danbury 
but a shopper on danburys main street questioned the ranking 
i dont know why said the woman who identified herself 
only as barbara its boring when we want to do something we go 
into the new york city 
the rating also was questioned in atlantic city which came in 
last 
its almost a laughing matter to me said mayor james usry 
i think some of the data or statistics or research they used is 
faulty i have made my home here and im proud of the progress 
being made here 
new york city was rated 19th up from 82nd last year 
naturally we would still think its too low because we 
think its no 1 said rose marie conors spokeswoman for mayor

in order the top 10 regions are danbury central new jersey 
norwalk conn new yorks long island san francisco nashua los

the resignation of a top official 
charges of corruption and internal squabbling are hampering efforts 
to recover billions of dollars that ferdinand marcos allegedly 
stole during his 20 years in office 
there are even calls for scuttling the presidential commission 
on good government or pcgg which president corazon aquino created 
two years ago to recover up to 10 billion in assets that marcos 
and his associates are accused of taking 
the commission is fighting for control of bank accounts stock 
and real estate scattered throughout the united states europe and 
asia including about 350 million in new york real estate 
but so far the commission says it has gained control of only 
300 million in various assets in the philippines all but 60 
million worth are subject to lengthy litigation 
one commission member jose laureta told reporters that at the 
current pace it might take 100 years to retrieve the money if 
were lucky 
if were unlucky 300 years he added 
only marcos and his wife imelda are laughing wrote 
columnist vicente albano pacis in the philippine daily inquirer 
the present difficulties of the pcgg must have been the first 
good news the marcoses have received since they arrived in hawaii 
the marcoses have lived in exile there since his ouster from the 
presidency in february 1986 
the crisis in the fivemember commission reached a climax 
tuesday when mrs aquino announced the resignation of its chairman 
ramon diaz 
diaz a former insurance executive with an untarnished 
reputation for personal honesty quit in disgust after 
solicitorgeneral francisco chavez accused the commission of 
incompetence and a trail of corruption 
chavez made his accusation in the wake of a graft charge against 
commission member quintin doromal who allegedly used his influence 
to win a government contract for a firm owned by his family 
doromal who denied the charge is to be arraigned before an 
antigraft court early next month 
diaz said in a letter to his staff that he resented being 
toyed around he also claimed that relatives of unnamed 
powers that be interfered with the commission to free assets 
seized by the commission 
diazs replacement adolfo azcuna already has come under fire 
because he was a partner in a law firm once retained by benjamin 
romualdez younger brother of marcos wife imelda and former 
ambassador to the united states during his brotherinlaws 
administration 
romualdezs assets were among those seized by the commission 
following diazs resignation mrs aquino ordered an audit of 
all assets taken over by the commission they range from 
businesses stock real estate bank deposits planes automobiles 
and jewelry some of the last three have allegedly disappeared 
members of the house of representatives have called for a 
separate probe speaker ramon mitra said the house is to debate 
several bills calling for scuttling the commission or curbing its 
powers 
the commission has long been accused of corruption in the 
handling of companies or shares of stock seized on suspicion they 
were illegally acquired by the marcoses or their associates 
the commission was responsible not only for tracking down and 
identifying companies controlled by marcos and his associates but 
also with administering them critics say that has given corrupt 
officials the opportunity to rake off corporate funds 
commission officials have acknowledged corruption among some of 
the commissions 200 fiscal agents and have filed charges 
against six of them in one case members of a company board of 
directors appointed by the commission allegedly voted themselves 
car loans using corporate funds another case involves the 
disappearance of hundreds of head of cattle from a sequestered 
ranch 
the current crisis complicates what was already an awesome task 
of unraveling a web of dummy companies laundered funds and aliases 
allegedly used by marcos and his associates to loot the treasury 
newspaper columnist belinda cunanan described the corruption 
charges against the commission as exaggerated but she acknowledged 
its reputation had been so tarnished it deserves a mercy 
killing 
motives aside i think congress should really abolish the pcgg 
at this stage mrs cunanan said the exit of ramon diaz and 
his replacement even on a temporary capacity by presidential 
legal adviser adolfo azcuna just about shattered whatever 
credibility is left of the pcgg

iran said iraqi troops backed by tanks 
warplanes and chemical weapons pushed nearly 40 miles across the 
border saturday and it called on all ablebodied fighters to rush 
to the front 
iraq said its aim was to capture a large number of prisoners 
before ceasefire talks in new york it said it had no intention of 
keeping iranian territory 
a later report from the iraqi news agency said the iraqi forces 
began withdrawing from freshly captured iranian territory after 
moving captured iranian war equipment and prisoners behind the 
lines 
it gave no figures on the number of prisoners taken or 
casualties but said the iraqis attacked a military camp in hamid 
and inflicted huge losses in men and equipment 
the agency said other iraqi forces in iran also would withdraw 
after achieving similar objectives 
the reports of fighting came as un teams prepared to visit the 
warring nations to work out implementation of a ceasefire in the 
nearly 8yearold war the military observers were expected to 
arrive in tehran the iranian capital sunday 
irans islamic republic news agency monitored in cyprus said 
iraqi troops crossed into southern iran and headed toward the oil 
city of ahvaz irna said iranian forces blocked another iraqi 
advance 15 miles to the west 
the heaviest battles were around the towns of hamid jofair and 
khushk west of ahvaz as well as shalamcheh a little farther north 
and the northern suburbs of the iranian port city of khorramshahr 
irna said 
iranian television broke into its regular newscast to announce 
that our moslem combatants forced the iraqi forces to retreat 
from those towns 
irna said iraqi troops had been pushed back in the shalamcheh 
region with the bodies of hundreds of iraqi soldiers scattered 
on the battlefield 
it said the tankled iraqi invasion was backed by heavy 
artillery fire chemical weapons jet fighters and helicopter 
gunships and was aimed at occupying khorramshahr and ahvaz 
the iranian dispatch said 5000 iraqi soldiers were killed or 
wounded and 200 tanks or armored personnel carriers were captured 
irna said the town of gilane gharb 20 miles inside iran and 
about 110 miles northeast of baghdad fell to iraqi troops who used 
chemical weapons 
the aggressors also captured sare pol zahab garrison using 
the same dastardly tactic the agency said 
the towns are in a disputed border area claimed by iraq under 
the terms of a 1975 agreement with iran 
all we want is to liberate our occupied areas iraqi 
information minister latif jassem was quoted as saying we have 
no aggressive intentions against iran 
jassem quoted by the iraqi news agency said iraq also aimed to 
take as many iranian prisoners as possible to facilitate the 
achievement of a lasting and comprehensive peace 
there were no iraqi comments on the iranian claims that it used 
chemical weapons in the fighting iraq has in the past admitted 
using the outlawed weapons but said iran used them first iran 
denied that 
president saddam hussein has said the capture of a large number 
of iranians would help in negotiations on a ceasefire based on 
un security council resolution 598 iran announced last week that 
it was accepting the resolution adopted one year ago 
on friday both countries accepted an invitation by javier perez 
de cuellar the un secretarygeneral to send their foreign 
ministers to new york this week for meetings on the resolution 
which provides for a ceasefire withdrawal to recognized borders 
a prisoner exchange and peace talks 
the resolution also calls for an investigation of which side 
started the war

prisoners in fighting friday according to figures released last 
week by the international red cross iraq holds about 13000 
iranian prisoners while iran holds about 50000 iraqis

fronts the radio said

morning heavily bombing iraqi positions in the southern and 
central areas

the southern front and the aircraft disintegrated in the air

the rev jesse jackson headed home to chicago 
saturday leaving town in a decidedly more lowkey manner than he 
entered and maintaining that his failed presidential campaign made 
history at the democratic national convention 
the civil rights leader refused to speculate on whether he would 
seek public office again saying that his priority now is to work 
for the democratic ticket in the fall presidential race 
my focus now is on the fall campaign he told reporters as 
he left a downtown atlanta hotel well be spending a lot of time 
organizing for voter registration issue interpretation involving 
people many for the first time and a big turnout for the fall 
campaign 
of his postelection plans jackson said well have to 
determine what will happen based on the outcome of the campaign 
but we take this journey one phase at a time 
jackson took members of his family campaign staffers and 
journalists who covered his bid for the democratic presidential 
nomination to paschals a wellknown blackowned hotel and 
restaurant for lunch 
the entourage then headed for fulton county airport west of 
atlanta where a chartered jet took off shortly after 2 pm 
jackson dressed in cuffed blue jeans sandals and a red white 
and blue shirt appeared at ease accepting wellwishers and posing 
for photographers a few reporters and photographers covered his 
departure and about 10 people gathered at the airport to bid 
jackson farewell 
the casual scene contrasted sharply with the thunderous entrance 
to atlanta made by jackson one week earlier 
a motorcade of buses brought the jackson campaign to atlanta 
july 16 two days before the start of the democratic convention he 
addressed thousands of cheering supporters in piedmont park 
asserting that massachusetts gov michael dukakis then assured of 
the nomination must give jackson a stronger voice in the party 
dukakis jackson and vice presidential nominee sen lloyd 
bentsen of texas met on monday and peace was made though jacksons 
name was placed in nomination at the convention he later pledged 
support for the dukakisbentsen ticket 
jackson said saturday his campaign made great gains in atlanta 
he said blacks and others previously outside the party 
mainstream will have unprecedented involvement in the fall 
campaign and he noted that several jackson platform positions were 
adopted 
we can leave atlanta with a real sense of inspiration because 
of the expansion of the democratic party more inclusion 
involvement in the campaign at all levels vertically and 
horizontally and also helping to determine the course the 
priorities being in the room where poilicy is debated and 
priorities are set 
this is a trmemendous moment for us he said

as many as 10000 serbs rallied 
saturday to demand constitutional changes that would give serbia 
yugoslavias largest republic more control belgrade radio and 
witnesses said 
the rally in pancevo backed serbias communist leader slobodan 
milosevic who wants the republic to be given greater authority 
over two of its provinces vojvodina and kosovo 
those two provinces were granted wide autonomy by the yugoslav 
constitution adopted under the late president josip broz tito 
the demonstrators most vojvodina serbs had expected to be 
joined by serbs from kosovo for the rally in pancevo a vojvodina 
town 12 miles northeast of belgrade 
belgrade radio said the kosovo serbs decided against attending 
the demonstration to comply with a call by the yugoslav communist 
party presidium wednesday for an end to the protest rallies 
two weeks ago kosovo serbs held a rally in vojvodinas capital 
of novi sad but received little support from vojvodina serbs 
vojvodinas leadership last week claimed milosevic was behind 
the novi sad demonstration 
the state news agency tanjug said the rally in pancevo ended 
peacefully 
tanjug said about 30 serbs and montenegrins from kosovo who did 
come to pancevo met with local officials and organizations 
it quoted pancevo mayor radomir dangubic as saying the town 
supported the demands made by the kosovo serbs 
about 90 percent of the population in kosovo are ethnic 
albanians and some 25 percent of vojvodinas inhabitants are ethnic 
hungarians who traditionally fear serbian dominance

annexation demand but yerevan residents and the staterun media 
have indicated people were generally ignoring the strike call

here is the text of the democratic response to 
president reagans weekly radio address given this week by rep 
beryl anthony of arkansas 
good afternoon this is congressman beryl anthony jr from the 
fourth congressional district in arkansas 
as chairman of the democratic congressional campaign committee 
id like to visit with you about the renewed spirit within the 
democratic party as democrats leave atlanta where we held our 
national convention this week and scatter from one corner of our 
nation to the other the enthusiasm for the democratic party is 
spreading like wildfire across the prairie 
its a spirit we havent felt since john kennedy and lyndon 
johnson filled us with hope and provided opportunities to all 
working men and women in 1988 we have another massachusettstexas 
team just as dedicated and just as capable of getting the country 
back on the right track 
in atlanta we nominated a presidential ticket of massachusetts 
governor michael dukakis and senator lloyd bentsen of texas today 
the dukakisbentsen team will carry its message of hope and 
opportunity to the valley of central california and then move on 
to the plains of north dakota 
in atlanta democrats recaptured a sense of party unity that has 
been missing for too long and while we celebrated solidarity we 
also debated 
democrats in 1988 can debate without becoming divided for a 
simple reason we share a deep commitment to fulfilling the needs 
and challenges of all americans not just our closest friends 
after eight years of a republican administration fueled by 
selfish and sometimes unlawful motives the american people are 
looking for a return to the basic values of common respect 
compassion and concern for all and as michael dukakis promised 
we are determined to forge a new era of greatness 
this fall the republicans will brag about low unemployment low 
inflation and sustained growth but you and i know weve paid a 
big price for their bragging rights ohio and michigan have paid 
dearly with plant shutdowns in our heartland its a daily 
struggle for farmers to keep their farms and if you brag about 
sustained growth in oklahoma and louisiana the folks there would 
laugh or maybe cry 
george bush was right eight years ago when he called ronald 
reagans policies voodoo economics he seems to have forgotten 
that and forgotten the needs of the working men and women of this 
country soon mr bush may begin to feel like a voodoo doll when 
he is stuck with explaining his administrations legacy of debts 
and deficits 
voters who supported reagan and bush are now disillusioned 
because this administration couldnt keep its promises george bush 
will pay the price as many of these supporters return home where 
they belong to the democratic party were already hearing from 
these folks from desha county arkansas a farmer friend called me 
recently 
he said beryl im sorry i voted for reagan and bush ill do 
it again now i need your help my reply was simple theres 
no need to apologize just remember how empty those promises were 
and that george bush will try to hoodwink the public again 
throughout most of the 1980s democrats in the congress were the 
safety net for the american people we fought to protect your basic 
rights it was difficult at times but our efforts have paid off 
it was democrats in congress who crusaded far and fast for 
catastrophic health insurance 
it was democrats in congress who initiated in fast trade 
legislation to protect american jobs for opening more world 
markets it was democrats who said its only fair and decent to 
give workers 60 days notice when they lose their jobs and 
democrats even cooperated with the president in strengthening our 
national defense 
but reagan and bush took it too far to the point where crime 
corruption and greed set in clearly the priorities of the last 
eight years served the interest of ambitious reagan appointees and 
the elite of our society 
this administration favors missile systems over school systems 
and supports payments to international drugtraffickers but 
doesnt fund programs to stop drugs at our borders i think youll 
agree its time to straighten out our priorities 
national security is no longer simply a debate over missiles and 
troops its a concern for the american family its a renewal of 
the dream that our children will have greater opportunities every 
american deserves the right to share the same hopes and dreams 
the hope that all of our children will receive quality education 
that adequate health is available for all that all our children 
will be able to afford to buy a house and that all our childrens 
children will have a better quality of life 
these hopes will remain just dreams if you my fellow americans 
dont get involved in the political process the 1988 election will 
be one of the most important ones in our lifetime its the 
democratic commitment to invest in our most precious natural 
resource the american people that will propel this nation into 
the next century 
dont ever forget your vote is important in november vote 
democratic our future depends on it thank you for listening

a softdrink distributor who maintains he should 
get some of the profits from commercial products derived from his 
blood and body tissues says he is pleased by a court ruling that 
may lead to that 
to me this ruling is the ultimate vindication of the 
rightness of what were trying to do john moore said friday 
after learning the california 2nd district court of appeals 
reinstated his suit against the university of californialos 
angeles 
moore 43 claims dr david golde of ucla never informed him of 
the value of his blood while using it to develop a product that 
scientists say offers considerable hope for treating cancer and 
aids 
his attorney in los angeles jonathan zackey said the ruling 
was unprecedented 
this is the first time an appellate court has ruled that a 
patient has an interest in the unique properties of his genetic 
material and that commercial exploitation without the patients 
consent entitles the patient to sue for damages zackey said 
private research companies paid ucla 500000 for exclusive 
access to moores cells zackey said golde received benefits worth 
about 15 million and trade sources have indicated the full line 
of treatments that could be developed from the cells might be worth 
more than 3 billion the lawyer added 
an attorney for ucla allen wagner said he might seek 
reconsideration of the ruling or seek an appeal 
twelve years ago moore learned he had a rare blood disease 
called hairycell leukemia and in a relatively common treatment 
golde removed his spleen 
from that organ golde discovered moores blood possessed a 
previously unknown capacity for fighting disease and for the next 
seven years he had the seattle man frequently return to los angeles 
to draw more blood 
moore said he never was told that researchers used his blood and 
tissues to patent what they called the mocell 
the product was developed by copying a unique characteristic 
found in moores cells a property that boosts production of 
certain white blood cells which in turn stimulate the bodys 
first line of defense against some diseases 
when patients consent to the removal of organs they also 
consent to disposal of the organs including their use in research 
so moore had abandoned any interests in the therapeutically 
removed tissue wagner said 
since his spleen was removed moore has undergone no further 
treatment and says the disease appears to be in remission

spurred by reports that land mines are maiming and 
killing vietnamese children five veterans intend to return to 
southeast asia to help clear mine fields they laid 20 years ago 
i dont consider myself a rambo type and i dont consider 
myself a jane fonda former cpl frank noe said saturday i did 
what i had to do what i was told to do during the war 
and im doing what i feel is right to do now 
noe a 39yearold firefighter in stoughton mass and four 
fellow veterans of the 11th marine combat engineering battalion 
have received the vietnamese governments approval for a twoweek 
humanitarian mission in january 
they plan to point out the perimeters of the fields they laid 
provide technical expertise on mines and if necessary comb the 
jungle with metal detectors and probe the dirt with knives 
noe said they realize their actions may be dangerous and have 
asked the marine corps to reduce the risk by turning over maps of 
the fields 
but a marine corps spokesman said the maps either never reached 
the pentagon or were tossed out long ago 
if we kept everything back that far this city would be buried 
under paper said lt col frederick c peck of the marine corps 
public affairs office in washington 
if that means the veterans have to rely on memories two decades 
old so be it said former lance cpl nathaniel genna 40 of 
boston 
i wont remember all the fields but ill remember the ones i 
worked on genna said youd be surprised how well you recall 
when you had ears on the back of your head and eyes on your rear 
end 
plans for the trip emerged from a september 1987 reunion in 
chicago where genna showed his companions a newspaper article in 
which the vietnamese government estimated 3000 people many of 
them children died from grenades bombs and land mines between 
1975 and 1985 
former sgt eugene t spanos of rosemont ill who organized 
the reunion said the news hit him hard 
i turned to one former battalion commander and said sir did 
you take the mine fields out and he said no 
so i turned to the other battalion commander who relieved him 
and i said did you and he said no so i said my god all 
these years have gone by and were still killing people over 
there recalled spanos 
after the reunion spanos 40 contacted the vietnamese mission 
to the united nations wrote to other veterans and found an 
anonymous donor willing to support the mineclearing expedition 
which the veterans estimate will cost 30000 
besides spanos noe and genna the veterans who have volunteered 
are william johnson of manchester conn and michael wallace of 
langdon kan all five served in vietnam between 1967 and 1970 
the groups translator and guide will be retired marine lt col 
robert j dalton who went to hanoi last fall to help plan the 
mission 
im supporting them because its a humanitarian effort i agree 
with dalton said i see this as an act of a reconciliation 
between two governments that have been at odds for a long time 
and who better to do it than the young men who were sent to fight 
the war in the first place

a bomb blew up saturday on a road 
near the irish border and killed three members of a family headed 
home after a vacation in the united states police said 
the outlawed irish republican army fighting to end british rule 
in northern ireland admitted it was their bomb but that it 
detonated prematurely and was meant for british soldiers not 
civilians 
the blast blew a crater in the road and left bodies and luggage 
scattered on the main road between dublin and belfast witnesses 
said 
killed in the explosion were robert james hanna and maureen 
patricia hanna both 44 and their son david 6 
they were driving to their home in hillsborough 12 miles south 
of belfast when the explosion occurred at about 10 am near 
newry about a mile from the irish border police said it was not 
immediately known where they vacationed in the united states 
three people in nearby cars were slightly injured 
the explosion brought to 21 the number of people killed in 
explosions in northern ireland this year police said 
the ira is fighting to drive the british out of the 
predominantly protestant province and unite it with the roman 
catholic irish republic 
the ira issued conflicting statements explaining the bombing 
in a statement issued to journalists in northern ireland the 
south armagh brigade of the ira said the hannas were the 
unfortunate victims of mistaken identity it said the attack 
was a carefully planned military operation that ended in tragic 
and unfortunate circumstances 
a later ira statement said british scanning devices may have set 
off the device which was planned for british soldiers 
this bomb which was to be detonated by remote control exploded 
prematurely tragically killing three civilians it said 
we are in a position to state that all volunteers in command 
of the explosives did not detonate the device without shirking 
responsibility for this tragedy we are investigating the 
possibility that the explosion could have occurred as a result of 
british forces who were in the vicinity using electronic scanning 
devices the ira said 
officials speculated the ira mistook the familys jeep for a 
land rover used by british security forces security forces 
regularly patrol the area 
the royal ulster constabulary denounced the ira statement 
police described hanna as a company director they said the 
couple had a 17yearold son and an 19yearold daughter who were 
not traveling with them 
the hanna family in a statement later saturday said they were 
stunned and hurt and wished to mourn in private 
british security forces sealed off the area 
when i came out from getting petrol i saw parts of bodies 
lying all over the road a witness said a jeep was blown 
into a field and two other cars were damaged another witness 
said 
from what i could see there were a couple of cars lying in the 
crater there was debris everywhere said another witness all 
spoke on condition of anonymity 
a nearby abandoned house was demolished in the explosion 
the blast occurred near the spot where a northern ireland judge 
and his wife were killed by an ira bomb 15 months ago three years 
ago four royal ulster constabulary officers were killed by a bomb 
at almost the same spot 
jim nicholson a former legislator in the protestant unionist 
party said the ira would react with another sickening apology 
for the deaths of three innocent people 
on july 8 the ira apologized for killing two civilians who 
died along with a british soldier and an ira guerrilla during two 
bombings and two mortar attacks an ira statement said the 
operation went tragically wrong 
gordon mawhinney of the nonsectarian alliance party described 
the bombers saturday as savages and said they could only be 
defeated if the community act against terrorism

a group of intellectuals prayed and 
fasted saturday to pressure authorities to ease travel 
restrictions news reports said 
the reports of the hunger strike followed an announcement by 
premier karoly grosz earlier last week that his communist 
government was preparing to lift such restrictions on people 
sentenced for participating in the 1956 anticommunist uprising 
the rebellion was put down by soviet tanks 
grosz who became national communist party leader in a major 
reshuffle in may began a 10day us visit on tuesday the hunger 
strikers started tuesday and reportedly intended to carry out their 
protest for the duration of his visit 
the magyar nemzet daily newspaper carried an interview with the 
hunger strikers and a popular saturday afternoon radio news 
program allowed them to broadcast their grievances the reports did 
not say how many people were taking part in the protest 
magyar nemzet also quoted ferenc koeszeg editor of the 
underground journal beszeloe as saying the strikers wanted to 
appeal to public opinion after repeated applications for passports 
were refused 
the saturday radio news magazine 168 hours reported that the 
hunger strikers had addressed a letter to the justice minister and 
intended to send another to the government asking that citizens 
rights be better guaranteed 
the news media were taking advantage of a new government policy 
initiated under grosz allowing greater dissent it is similar to 
soviet leader mikhail s gorbachevs policy of glasnost or 
openness 
hungary liberalized some travel laws jan 1 granting most 
citizens passports for unlimited travel in east and west provided 
they have needed funds 
koeszeg was quoted as saying friday that the hunger strikers 
welcomed the move to abandon restrictions related to 1956 
however he told the newspaper that only one protester jenoe 
fonay would be affected the journalist said fonay was associated 
with the leaders of the 1956 revolt 
the other strikers were denied passports under a regulation 
allowing police to refuse exit to hungarians deemed to have 
violated unpublished regulations governing behavior on previous 
trips abroad koeszeg said

police were looking saturday for a 
creamcolored pickup truck that may be linked to an explosion that 
damaged the east entrance to loogootee high school 
the friday night blast created enough force to destroy a metal 
door and hurl pieces of the bomb up to 100 yards away police said 
no injuries were reported in the 945 pm explosion which was 
heard over the entire town 
damage was estimated by police at 500 
an older model pickup truck which had a darkercolored stripe 
along the side was seen near the school at the time of the 
explosion state police dispatcher richard weintraut said 
were waiting on an indiana state police bomb investigator to 
come up this morning for further investigation said loogootee 
chief of police john hunt 
on july 5 13 improperly wired time bombs were found in salem 
about 50 miles east of loogootee in southern indiana there was no 
evidence the two incidents were related hunt said 
the salem incident involved dynamite improperly wired to timed 
fuses none of those bombs exploded the loogootee bomb was a fused 
pipe bomb that was lit by someone shortly before it went off hunt 
said 
the only similarities were that neither bomber knew how to wire 
a bomb correctly hunt said 
whoever made these bombs here didnt know what they were 
doing he said the state investigator said whoever made the 
bomb was real lucky it didnt explode while they were making it 
earlier this month police discovered an unfinished pipe bomb in 
the center of an intersection about a block from the school 
it looked like someone had made it and it fell out of a 
vehicle or something hunt said it looked like someone had 
been experimenting trying to make something like a homemade bomb 
but didnt get it finished it didnt have any powder wasnt 
fused 
the school teachers are starting to get worried hunt said 
they dont know if they want to go back to school or not 
police talked to several teachers and neighbors saturday but 
none reported receiving any threats he said

teachers could earn up to 64000 under a tentative 
contract agreement with dade county that a schools spokesman 
describes as one of the nations most progressive and raises 
salaries 28 percent 
the threeyear contract which the teachers union and school 
board must still approve sets average pay for the new academic 
year at 33066 dade county school spokesman andy gollan said 
saturday average pay nationally is 28031 according to national 
education association figures 
we believe this is very far reaching aside from salary 
considerations gollan said after negotiators reached a 
settlement theres an increased voice for teachers in a number 
of areas for example in the selection of principals we believe 
this to be the most progressive teacher contract in the united 
states 
with 255000 students in 260 schools dade county has the 
fourthbiggest school district in the nation behind new york los 
angeles and chicago 
dades school system with 15000 teachers received national 
attention earlier this year because of a program that gives local 
schools more autonomy and lets teachers councils help make 
decisions 
the program also aims to improve innercity schools by involving 
various community organizations offering saturday classes and 
various professional growth initiatives 
gollan said the school system enthusiastically favors generous 
raises so that overall salaries would average 33066 in the first 
year of the contract 36042 in the second and 39646 in the 
third 
a new teacher would receive 23000 yearly and an educator with 
14 years of experience and a doctorate who teaches summer school 
could earn up to 64000 under the proposed pay scale he said 
its a nationally recognized idea that teachers should be paid 
more for the work they do gollan said

george bush declared saturday that he 
would win both the south and the southwest despite concentrated 
efforts in the region by the new democratic team and a shortage of 
campaign funds that he called troublesome 
standing on the bank of the droughtdepressed mississippi river 
the republican vice president proclaimed if we are successful in 
getting the truth out there they democrats will be unsuccessful 
in drawing the traditional southern democrats and southwest 
democrats back into the fold 
i have to help get the truth out there he added both 
regions went solidly for the reaganbush ticket in both 1980 and 
1984 
the truth the prospective gop presidential nominee said he 
wants to spread would be his major philosophical differences with 
michael dukakis whom he called a traditional liberal 
however bush said he does not see similar differences with 
democratic vice presidential nominee sen lloyd bentsen of texas 
he said he agrees with bentsen on most issues 
bush is on a twoday campaign swing through the south and 
southwest to try to seek to regain momentum lost to the democrats 
during their convention democrats are expected to make a major 
effort to win back the region beginning with heavy campaigning by 
dukakis and bentsen 
dukakis while campaigning in modesto calif was asked to 
comment on president reagans characterization during his weekly 
radio address of the democratic convention message as midnight in 
america 
the democratic candidate said he had no response but said we 
want to stress a positive message thats the idea they 
know were going to have a chance 
in their second day of campaigning together dukakis and bentsen 
attended a rally of several thousand people in modesto and then 
moved on to minot nd 
addressing a law enforcement group in tampa fla bush 
reiterated his call for stricter enforcement of drug laws and for 
the death penalty for drug kingpins 
weve heard a lot of tough talk about drugs from the liberals 
in congress but when are we going to see some tough action bush 
asked we need more money for prisons and prosecutors and we 
need tougher penalties for criminals 
at an airport news conference in tampa bush said the bump in 
the polls dukakis got from the democratic convention had served to 
keep him in the position of underdog 
but he said i like being behind i like fighting back i 
remember iowa bush referred to his loss to sen bob dole 
rkan in the iowa caucuses 
the vice president was scheduled to campaign in albuquerque 
nm on sunday 
the bush campaign has all but used up the entire 27 million it 
is permitted in preconvention spending bush has only been able to 
travel in recent days by coupling campaign events with gop 
fundraising events such as a luncheon he attended here and 
another dinner scheduled for tampa 
the funds are being raised for the national party for the fall 
election with some of the money channeled back to pay for bushs 
current travel 
however this limits his ability to take long trips and most of 
his recent campaign appearances have been confined to day trips 
with returns to washington most evenings 
this has had an inhibiting effect on campaign travel 
particularly to distant states bush conceded in a conversation 
with reporters traveling with him on air force two 
it is troublesome bush said 
once republicans hold their convention in august his campaign 
will be infused with more than 43 million in public funds 
bush was briefed on the condition of the mississippi river 20 
feet lower than its usual height at this time of year although 
bush was told that the river is expected to rise by about six feet 
in the next week or so 
bush said he joined with the us corps of engineers in opposing 
a plan to divert more great lakes water into the river claiming it 
would not help that much and could cause environmental problems 
he told a news conference that he would soon begin screening 
potential gop vice presidential candidates possibly as soon as 
next week with financial disclosure forms to be sent to those he 
will put on a long list 
bush also said his campaign would conduct private polls to 
determine the votedrawing appeal of various candidates 
but he said he would not conduct interviews or do anything 
else that would be demeaning or elevate hopes of the people he 
would be considering 
claiming he wanted to announce his choice at the gop convention 
bush said i will not leak my decision to anybody but if i talk 
in my sleep and my wife finds out about it im in for serious 
trouble 
ive told barbara this is to be a real personal decision 
asked about the declaration of california gov george deukmejian 
on friday that he wanted to take himself out of consideration bush 
said i really havent had time to sort that one out 
i have enormously high regard for our duke bush said of 
deukmejian 
he also went out of his way to praise to tennesseans who are 
frequently mentioned as possible running mates former sen howard 
baker and former gov lamar alexander but again said he 
currently had no short list of favorites 
bush brushed aside a profile of dukakis in the soviet communist 
party newspaper pravda which appeared to suggest that the 
democratic nominee was more intelligent than bush 
im going to send soviet leader gorbachev a photostat copy 
of my phi beta kappa key quipped the 1948 yale graduate

the condition of a 2yearold ukrainian girl 
whose mother believes her brain tumor was caused by the chernobyl 
nuclear accident was upgraded from critical a hospital spokeswoman 
said saturday 
hanna andrievna sverstiuk who had a brain tumor removed at 
childrens hospital of philadelphia was listed in stable condition 
in the intensive care unit said spokeswoman martha phan 
shes doing real well phan said 
neurosurgeons removed the core of hannas brain tumor during a 
nearly sixhour operation friday and awaited test results to 
determine whether the growth is benign or malignant phan said the 
results are expected by monday 
hannas mother maria sverstiuk has said she believes the 
walnutsized tumor that was at the base of the childs brain stem 
resulted from the radiation of the chernobyl nuclear disaster 50 
miles from kiev in the soviet union 
hanna was born in kiev five days after the april 26 1986 
explosion and fire that killed at least 31 people and released a 
cloud of radioactive material that eventually circled the globe 
two months ago hanna was diagnosed as having a brain tumor 
dr leonard a bruno a neurosurgeon said it is unlikely that 
exposure to chernobyls radiation would cause a solid tumor the 
type of growth removed from hannas brain in an infant 
radiation can be the cause of tumors of any kind he said 
however the type of radiation one would get from a situation 
like chernobyl has a much longer latency period 10 to 20 years 
the toddlers trip to the united states followed efforts of 
ukrainian communities on both sides of the atlantic and 
negotiations between officials in washington and moscow

the chairman of indias atomic energy 
commission on saturday denied reports that india has illegally 
imported heavy water for its nuclear plants a news agency said 
mr srinivasan said india has been producing heavy water since 
the 1960s and it has been selfsufficient for her needs the 
united news of india reported there is no question of importing 
illegally in fact at one stage we had exported to belgium 
he spoke at a news conference at poona near bombay 
newspaper reports in the united states europe and india have 
said india may have received the water in shipments secretly 
diverted from norway the soviet union and romania opposition 
party members in west germany have charged that some of the 
norwegian heavy water was diverted with the help of a west german 
firm 
the shipments allegedly were diverted in the early 1980s india 
has not signed the nuclear nonproliferation treaty and reports 
have suggested the heavy water could have been used to produce 
plutonium for making nuclear weapons 
heavy water or deuterium oxide looks like ordinary water but 
has an extra neutron it is used to cool a nuclear reactor by 
moderating the speed of neutrons released in a chain reaction 
india has six plants that manufacture heavy water and two more 
are under construction two of indias three nuclear power plants 
require heavy water 
the government says it plans more such plants to reduce its 
dependence on fossil fuels

an american mercenary received one 
days probation and a 50 fine after pleading guilty to violating 
the federal neutrality act by plotting to send civilian fighters to 
help the contras 
us district judge norman roettger refused to comment on the 
sentence he gave on friday to joe sam adams one of seven men 
indicted earlier this month for activities aiding the nicaraguan 
rebels known as contras 
if roettger gave a sentence like that what does it tell 
you said rick goldman one of adams attorneys obviously the 
sentence reflects the judges feelings about the indictment 
the neutrality act prohibits american citizens from trying to 
overthrow a nation at peace with the united states 
but attorneys for the defendants scoffed at the notion that the 
united states is at peace with the sandinista regime in nicaragua 
the original federal inquiry that started about two years ago in 
florida helped expose the irancontra affair but the seven 
indicted this month were not major players in the underground 
contra aid network 
attorneys for the defendants have said their clients were 
singled out to silence those in the network who had become critics 
of the administration while those who gave the orders were not 
prosecuted 
a spokesman for the christic institute which is appealing a 
24 million civil lawsuit relating to contra aid efforts alleged 
gunsfordrugs deals and other covert activities said the light 
punishment for adams was no big surprise 
this conforms with our experience that one can violate the law 
to aid the contras in the southern district of florida without fear 
of punishment christic spokesman peter dykstra said saturday 
we are upset but our anger lies more with the impunity thats 
apparently afforded to those in washington who gave the orders to 
violate the law thats why we intend to bring our case back 
through the appeals process 
adams pleaded guilty to the main charge of the indictment that 
the defendants conspired to overthrow a foreign government while on 
us soil adams could have faced three years in prison 
assistant us attorney jeffrey feldman said i indicated to 
the judge that i thought the sentence was fair 
before appearing in roettgers court adams pleaded innocent 
before us magistrate lurana snow he was released on 25000 bond 
minutes later adams changed his plea to guilty and he and his 
lawyers stood before roettger for sentencing 
adams 38 of st louis is a marksman and professional weight 
lifter as well as a former bodyguard for adolfo calero a contra 
leader he has said that he fought with the contras in nicaragua to 
overthrow the countrys leftist sandinista government 
i think certainly the judge sees this case for what it is and 
i think he recognizes how inappropriate the charges are said 
john mattes an assistant federal public defender who has 
criticized the july 13 indictment for going after the foot 
soldiers rather than the generals 
five men named in the indictment have pleaded innocent 
the sentence is absolutely phenomenal said doug jones the 
lawyer for tom posey an alabama businessman named in the 
indictment i am sure that mr adams and his attorneys are very 
pleased 
one of the accused mercenaryturnedwhistleblower jack 
terrell is expected to plead on monday 
others indicted were mario calero brother of adolfo calero 
jose coutin a miami cuban and former civilian materiel assistance 
liaison here alex martinez a cubanamerican stockbroker and maco 
stewart a former assistant state attorney general and state 
representative in texas

up a twoday visit to the persian gulf that was conducted under 
extraordinarily tight security

see the troops it was balls first trip to the area since 
becoming navy secretary this year and it was not announced by the 
pentagon in advance 
during the visit ball boarded the flagship coronado the 
destroyer john hancock and the mine sweeper conquest three of the 
approximately 16 american warships now in the gulf

terrorist acts in the aftermath of the july 3 downing of an iranian 
jetliner by the us missile cruiser vincennes all 290 aboard the 
plane were killed 
us officials meanwhile said they recovered a letter bearing 
10000 signatures and expressing support for the vincennes captain 
and crew that was supposed to have been delivered to the warship 
two days ago 
the signature campaign was organized last weekend in san diego 
the vincennes home port by rep bill lowrey rcalif 
the letter which reportedly weighs about 50 pounds and is 1000 
feet long had been mishandled on its way to the gulf through an 
express delivery service said karl higgins a lowrey aide 
higgins in a telephone interview from his home in san diego said 
the letter was found in a london cargo terminal saturday and was 
shipped to bahrain 
higgins said the letter would be delivered to the ship sunday 
the vincennes sailed out of the gulf three days ago and is in 
the arabian sea according to a spokesman at us central command 
headquarters in tampa fla 
although there has been speculation that the 9600ton cruiser 
might be withdrawn from the region as a gesture toward reducing 
tensions military sources who asked not to be identified said 
they had seen nothing to indicate the ship would leave before its 
scheduled departure in late august 
balls visit had been planned before irans announced acceptance 
last week of a un ceasefire plan for ending the 8yearold war 
with iraq according to us officials who spoke on condition of 
anonymity

anthony less commander of the joint task force middle east met 
with bahrains defense minister sheik khalifa bin ahmed al khalifa 
in keeping with the strict security officials refused to 
disclose the navy secretarys destination after the gulf other 
than to say it was not in this area 
the united states is expected to reduce its naval force in the 
persian gulf if the ceasefire is implemented however us 
officials here and at the pentagon say it is too soon to speculate 
on a timetable for a cutback 
naval sources asking not to be further identified said that 
neither balls visit nor the departure on saturday of two us 
warships was related to any reduction in force 
the destroyer obrien and the missile frigate john h sides left 
the port of manama and headed toward the strait of hormuz toward 
home after completing their threemonth duty tours 
the sources said both will be replaced by other warships now en

president zia ulhaq on saturday 
accused india of provoking ethnic violence in pakistans southern 
province of sind 
we have fundamental proof evidence to show to our friends in 
india that they have been interferring in sind by trying to 
isolate sind from the rest of pakistan zia said in a statement 
he did not elaborate 
more than 40 people have been killed in ethnic fighting in sind 
during the past two months 
in the latest incident on july 17 the mayor of hyderabad was 
wounded in an assassination attempt and a hyderabad city councilman 
was killed in the attack the shootings were followed by riots in 
which seven people were killed 
much of the violence has involved moslem immigrants who fled to 
pakistan from predominantly hindu india in 1947 after the indian 
subcontinent received independence from britain and was partitioned 
into india and pakistan 
the immigrants are demanding recognition as a fifth ethnic group 
pakistan is ethnically divided into four major groups pathans 
in the northwest punjabis in the eastern province of punjab 
baluchis in the western province of baluchistan and sindhis in sind 
zia noted the immigrants have been in pakistan more than 40 
years and said why is it that now they have come all of a sudden 
as a group demanding its rights because it has been provoked as 
such as a parochial element in order to advance political 
reasons 
zia denied indian allegations that pakistan is adding to the 
violence in indias northern punjab province india claims pakistan 
is aiding militant sikhs who are demanding an independent homeland 
in that province bordering pakistan 
sikhism is an offshoot of the hindu religion pakistan is mainly 
moslem and zia in midjune invoked islamic law saying it took 
precedence over existing legislation and that pakistan must become 
an islamic nation 
he said saturday anyone who considers that this is going to 
be a secular state or a state in which you can have islam as a 
religion between man and god only is wrong

showed off and then waved to the crowd 
kept off to the side was a noisy group of several dozen 
antiabortion protesters 
in his speech dukakis threw in greek spanish and portuguese 
phrases and got cheers from those groups but his main pitch was to 
economic issues and to what he called progressive values of 
thrift and hard work combined with help from the government 
including expanded health insurance programs 
he promised to find new uses for agricultural products and to 
fight what he said was 12 percent unemployment in the modesto area 
the economic expansion of the reagan administration was built on 
a fiscal house of cards standing on the huge federal debt that 
more than doubled during the past eight years he said 
reagan in his weekly radio address on saturday said the 
democrats dont want to level with the american people trying 
to hide their liberal politics 
to hear them talk you would never have guessed we are in the 
biggest peacetime expansion in history he said when the 
democrats last controlled the white house he said america did a 
heck of a lot worse 
the democratic candidates were in the second day of a threeday 
post convention swing across the country with a strong 
middleamerica theme 
on friday they campaigned in bentsens home state of texas 
sundays plans included events in st louis and erie pa before 
returning to dukakis native boston 
the rally was in the congressional district of rep tony coelho 
the thirdranking democrat in the house who said the ticket of 
dukakis and texas sen lloyd bentsen could wrest from the 
republicans two central valley voting groups which had strayed to 
the republican side in presidential elections 
dukakis appealed to the families of ethnic immigrants running 
mate bentsen himself from a rio grande valley farm family 
appealed to those who moved to the rich agricultural valley from 
texas oklahoma and other states hit by the dust bowl of the 
1930s he said 
if we can win the central san joaquin valley we can win the 
state said coelho california with 47 electoral votes has more 
than any other state the democrats have not won it since 1964 
coelho former chairman of the democrats national congressional 
campaign committee said bush would probably neutralize the appeal 
of the democratic ticket in california if he chose gov george 
deukmejian as his running mate

president reagan accused democrats 
saturday of ignoring the accomplishments of his republican 
administration and singing the same sad song they sang four years 
ago 
to them its midnight in america reagan said in his first 
comment on the democratic national convention that ended thursday 
in atlanta 
to listen to the rhetoric you would never guess the american 
economy is the strongest it has been in a decade he said

republican party thinks the way to win an election is basically to 
tear the other guy down day after day believe me running mate

from painful experience that if the other side essentially runs a 
negative campaign you have to respond and believe me senator

white house eight years ago inflation was at one of the highest

two youngsters pulled a prank on their 
mom saturday but it backfired and no one laughed especially not 
authorities who believed an 8yearold had been kidnapped 
the older of the boys age 12 told their mother his younger 
brother was picked up by somebody in a red car who took off 
said constable stephen williamson of the roxbury town police 
department 
the 12yearold and his mother approached williamsons patrol 
car and both of them were crying the officer said the 
mother was hysterical all the kid told me was that a car pulled 
up and took my little brother 
williamson alerted the delaware county sheriffs department and 
the state police in oneonta and margaretville on his radio then 
headed toward margaretville because he the boy said they went 
that way 
the sheriffs department in turn notified the local radio 
station in this small town about 80 miles southwest of albany 
they wanted us to tell listeners to be on the lookout for a 
red car headed to the roxbury or margaretville area from grand 
gorge said kevin wright the disc jockey at station wdla 
the station interrupted programming and broadcast the warning on 
its am and fm frequencies at least seven times said wright 
meanwhile authorities set up roadblocks and williamson returned 
to question the childrens mother it was then he learned it was 
all a joke devised by the children intended only to scare their 
mother 
the 8yearold child had been in the woods near the home the 
whole time and hed come back home williamson said 
his 12yearold brother was crying the kid realized what he 
did the constable said 
williamson refused to release the names of the children or their 
mother 
in a way it was sad but i was glad it wound up being like 
that cause nobody really was hurt williamson said then he 
speculated about what would happen to the 12yearold boy saying 
i think maybe his mother will warm his bottom

the roman catholic patriarch of jerusalem 
called on israeli authorities saturday to renounce repressive 
measures in dealing with the palestinian uprising 
michel sabbah a palestinian told vatican radio violent 
measures used by the israeli authorities repressive measures will 
never lead to calm and even less to peace because violence 
encourages violence and an ever stronger resistance 
what should be done is to try to understand the desires of 
these people calling for their rights to talk with them and above 
all to treat them like human beings 
the patriarch is the spiritual leader of the 65000 latinrite 
catholics in israel the israelioccupied territories jordan and 
cyprus sabbah was the first arab named to the post 
the jerusalemborn priest became patriarch in january a month 
after the palestinian uprising in the west bank and gaza strip 
began more than 230 palestinians and four israelis have died in 
the violence 
what can the church do sabbah asked i dont think the 
authorities listen i dont think many others will listen i 
address myself to the israeli leaders and call on them to renounce 
repressive measures 
he also said he feared the violence connected with the uprising 
would grow worse since it seems that until the elections this 
november authority will rest in the hands of the military and no 
politician wants to take any responsibility

mexican lawmen stalking drug 
traffickers mistakenly shot and killed a news anchorwoman her 
motherinlaw and a family friend saturday authorities said 
police officers mistook the journalists car for one spotted 
near a clandestine airstrip where a plane believed to have been 
carrying colombian cocaine had crashed the official government 
news agency notimex reported 
notimex said federal attorney general sergio garcia ramirez 
ordered an investigation and the detention of the four police 
officers involved in the shootings 
xhijtv said its anchorwoman linda bejarano 28 was killed 
along with lucresia martinez de gomez 58 and carlos alfonso 
garcia 25 
ms bejaranos husband manuel gomez said he was in the car 
with the other three when they were shot about 330 am near 
downtown juarez but he was uninjured 
gomez a coanchor at the station told reporters later saturday 
that the four were driving near downtown when a car carrying four 
men tried to pull them over he said the men identified themselves 
as federal judicial police officers but that he didnt stop 
because he was afraid they would rob him 
he said he was carrying about 12000 in cash raised by the tv 
station at a circus 
when gomez didnt stop the men started shooting the car with 
machine guns about 40 to 45 bullet holes were found in the car 
officials said 
gomez said he was taken in for questioning and then released 
state judicial police commander ramon olivas said a car similar 
in description was found later abandoned with 40 kilograms of 
cocaine 
the judicial police cowardly killed my wife and my mother 
gomez said his voice shaking i hope the police dont hide and 
protect these men 
notimex identified the four police officers responsible for the 
shootings as joaquin garcia mendez a federal judicial police 
officer and city police officers santos robles pena roberto gomez 
jilguero and noel librado zavala 
federal judicial police officials told the tv station in this 
border city across from el paso texas that the gunmen were 
madrinas uncommissioned officers who often carry guns and act 
as surveillance agents 
xhij spokesman gustavo aguirre said police told him the officers 
were trying to track a similar car that supposedly was laden with 
80 kilograms of cocaine when the shootings occurred 
they said it was a mistake aguirre said thats all they 
say they thought that they the victims were narcotics 
traffickers because the car was the same type they were looking 
for 
carlos armendariz spokesman for the federal judicial police 
said the four people involved in the shooting were arrested and 
added these are embarrassing lamentable deeds that were not 
going to permit and those responsible will be punished 
aguirre said he did not think the fact that bejarano was a 
journalist had anything to do with the incident he said ms 
bejarano had not been covering any stories on alleged malfeasance 
in government 
ivan sanchez shift commander at red cross hospital told juarez 
daily el mexicano that several men drove up to the hospital about 6 
am identified themselves as federal judicial police agents left 
the three bodies on the parking lot and drove away

saturday evening news program called columnas semanal weekly 
column she taped the last show at 6 pm friday and before 
saturdays airing a woman on the brink of tears appeared on the 
television and read a letter from the management of the station 
its lamentable that she lost her life by mistake the 
unidentified woman read her voice trembling we hope the 
judicial police seek justice we all of us at channel 44 
feel much pain tonight 
she said ms bejarano was three months pregnant she had two 
daughters alejandra 6 and carla 4

lingling the nations famed female giant 
panda may be pregnant again a zoo spokesman said saturday 
laboratory tests show the same hormonal pattern that was 
observed when lingling was pregnant last year said zoo spokesman 
mike morgan 
a lot of people are feeling positive but no one will say for 
certainty that lingling is pregnant he said there are 
reservations 
if she is pregnant she probably would give birth during the 
last couple of days of july or the first week of august he said 
she has given birth to four cubs at the zoo all of which have died 
lingling and her panda partner hsinghsing the star 
attractions at the national zoo mated three consecutive days 
during the second week of april he said 
a sophisticated lab analysis of her urine shows the same pattern 
of hormonal changes as scientists observed last year when she was 
pregnant which has led a lot of people around the zoo to believe 
the panda is pregnant morgan said 
but the people familiar with the analysis are telling people 
that although the pattern is there there is a lot of room for 
error because we have only one accurate predecessor of this years 
results and a false pregnancy could produce the same results he 
said 
however morgan said were proceeding like she is pregnant 
weve installed a sophisticated tv monitoring system and have 
aroundtheclock volunteers watching for any signs of impending 
birth 
we dont want to do anything to upset the panda he said 
we want business as usual as much as possible

the us food and drug administration said 
saturday it has begun allowing aids patients to import treatment 
drugs that have not been approved for sale in the united states 
speaking to a hostile crowd at a conference on gay and lesbian 
health issues fda commissioner frank young unexpectedly announced 
that the government last wednesday officially began allowing the 
import of some unapproved treatments for acquired immune deficiency 
syndrome 
all of us are dealing with a time line that is fierce young 
told a crowd of about 300 people who heckled him throughout his 
speech 
under the terms of the new policy aids patients can import 
drugs from other countries if the product is purchased for personal 
use and not for sale young said the fda maintains the right to 
deny any drug shipments into the country 
young said the fda was moved to change its policy in part to 
control the shipment of aids treatments because some drugs have 
been imported illegally 
he said some of the drugs have been shown to have applications 
to help combat the disease which is caused by a virus that damages 
the bodys immune system leaving victims susceptible to infections 
and cancer 
young defended the fdas record saying the agency had worked 
hard to gain approval for the drug azt which federal government 
scientists consider the most promising treatment developed to date 
to prolong the lives of those with the virus he said federal money 
and personnel devoted to aids have increased dramatically 
despite the announcement protesters charged the government with 
failing to do enough to permit the use of drugs to help treat aids 
victims 
he announced the policy because he heard there were going to 
be protests and he wanted to placate us said debbie levine of 
the new yorkbased aids coalition to unleash power but were not 
going to be placated with just dribs and drabs 
the demonstrators most of the crowd attending the speech at the 
10th national lesbian and gay health conference and aids forum 
held aloft watches with alarms ringing to illustrate that people 
with aids cannot wait while drugs are put through years of testing 
before use 
levine said several drug treatments for aids being used in 
europe japan and elsewhere have been proven to be effective and 
should be legalized in the united states 
weve had other epidemics such as toxicshock syndrome and 
legionnaires disease which have been addressed swiftly said 
alan klein of actup but after eight years the commissioner of 
the fda is still talking about hope and we only have one drug 
azt which is highly toxic 
young said he wanted the meeting at the conference to mark the 
beginning of an effort to build bridges between federal 
regulators and aids activists 
the fda shares your concern for the individuals who are 
suffering from this devastating disease and is painfully aware of 
their desperate efforts to seek treatment young said over 
protesters shouts which often drowned out his speech 
no higher priority exists for us than to work together to 
alleviate their suffering he said the fda shares your 
frustration on the lack of effective therapies available but we 
also know that research is providing many new candidates some of 
which will be successful 
as of june 15 the fda had approved 178 applications for testing 
of drugs and other therapies to treat aids young said 
later saturday us reps barney frank and gerry studds two 
massachusetts democrats who are openly gay were presented awards 
from both the national lesbian and gay health foundation and the 
association of physicians for human rights for their work on behalf 
of the gay community and to combat aids 
frank urged conferees to vote in the upcoming election we 
have a country that is not informed about aids and what we can do 
about it part of it is due to a failure of political will and 
partly it is due to the failure of the executive branch he said 
we would have more money for health issues if it werent for 
increased defense spending said frank who received three 
standing ovations 
studds criticized the reagan administrations response to aids 
this president seems to think the answer to this disease is 
monogamy and marriage he said 
other speakers included cheryl crane the openly lesbian 
daughter of actress lana turner and broadway actress elaine 
stritch 
about 1500 homosexual men and women are attending the weeklong 
conference which ends tuesday 
homosexual or bisexual males account for 62 percent of the 
68220 us aids cases counted by the government since june 1981 
there have been 38541 deaths or 56 percent of the total cases 
the centers for disease control reported last week 
aids is spread most often through sexual contact needles or 
syringes shared by drug abusers infected blood or blood products 
and from pregnant women to their offspring

president jose sarney on friday 
criticized as unfair a us decision to impose economic sanctions 
on brazil for refusing to recognize patents for foreign 
pharmaceutical products 
president reagan started a process friday that will lead to 
sanctions on 200 million worth of yet unspecified brazilian goods 
the united states is the no 1 market for brazilian exports 
sarney issued a communique calling the decision unfair and 
discriminatory he said it violates the most elementary 
principles of international law and the gatt referring to the 
general agreement on tariffs and trade the genevabased body that 
promotes fair trade practices 
sarney said the us government was caving in to the special 
interests of the american pharmaceutical industry and warned the 
action tends to undermine bilateral trade relations 
the united states claims american drug companies lose about 36 
million a year because brazil permits unauthorized copies of 
pharmaceutical products and formulas 
sarney denied that us companies were being jeopardized he 
said 85 percent of the brazilian drug industry is foreignowned and 
that american companies were the market leaders with a 35 percent 
share 
he added that brazil may demand reparations under gatt 
provisions for damages caused by the sanctions 
the sale of medical drugs in brazil totaled 11 billion in 
1987 according to the brazilian pharmaceutical industry 
association about 73 percent of that total was by foreignowned 
multinationals 
of the 500 pharmaceutical companies in brazil 69 are 
foreignowned the association said 
the us decision had been expected by the drug industry in 
brazil said jorge raimundo president of the angloamerican 
pharmaceutical industry chamber 
only the government didnt see it coming brazil has not shown 
any willingness to negotiate raimundo said in a telephone 
interview 
raimundo who also is an executive of the brazilian subsidiary 
of the britishowned glaxo drug company said the sanctions would 
immediately hurt brazilian exports 
it already is having an effect the american importer and the 
brazilian exporter dont know what products will be on the list so 
trade stalls he said 
the united states came close to slapping 105 million in trade 
sanctions on brazil earlier this year but backed away in march 
when that country responded to complaints about its policies 
regarding importation of software products

cuba canceled visas of a us congressional 
delegation to express its objections to a meeting between american 
diplomats and cuban dissidents the cuban news agency prensa latina 
reported friday from havana 
it said the foreign ministry issued a statement charging the 
july 15 meeting was organized to make it possible for american 
diplomats to instruct their counterrevolutionary servants and was 
not a normal diplomatic activity rep dan mica dfla chairman 
of a house foreign affairs subcommittee was to travel to cuba with 
several aides to inspect us diplomatic facilities the united 
states maintains no formal diplomatic ties with the communist 
caribbean nation but has a special interest section in havana 
cuba revoked the visas tuesday night 
mica wrote to president fidel castro expressing shock and 
astonishment over cubas decision micas letter was dated 
thursday and released friday 
the havana government statement said the july 15 meeting 
represented interference in cubas internal affairs and called the 
gathering a gross provocation 
prensa latina monitored in mexico city quoted the ministry as 
saying the meeting was held at the home of an american diplomat in 
cuba with a score of former counterrevolutionary prisoners and 
other enemies of our process 
it said the cubans were advised how to act during a visit to 
cuba by a delegation of the un human rights commission planned 
later this summer 
mica wrote if the mere fact that members of the cuban 
committee on human rights attended a party results in punitive 
action against the united states one can hardly imagine that the 
cuban people would feel free to meet and provide information to 
representatives of the un human rights commission 
he called on castro to make it clear to the people of cuba that 
they are free to speak openly to the commission members

a federal judge listened to more than two 
hours of legal arguments friday then delayed ruling on a news 
media request to unseal documents in a major investigation of 
suspected fraud in military contracts 
it seems to me there is just no way to properly render a 
decision from the bench us district court judge david kenyon 
said 
he said he had not received complete copies of the documents 
sought until friday and wanted to study them before ruling and 
added im not at all sure what decision will be rendered 
the request pending in los angeles is one of a number of similar 
efforts by news organizations to see affidavits related to the 
coasttocoast probe of the relationship between defense industry 
consultants pentagon officials and weapons manufacturers 
before leaving the bench kenyon asked government prosecutors 
how long they planned to keep the material sealed if he ruled in 
their favor prosecutors had asked kenyon to overturn a decision by 
us magistrate joseph reichmann who ruled last week that the 
public has a right to see the documents now 
i cant give you a date but i hope it would be reasonably 
soon responded us attorney robert bonner he said it would be 
released when the government no longer feared harm to its 
investigation 
but attorney rex heincke representing the los angeles times 
argued the government failed to show that any harm could come from 
documents in an investigation that is already in headlines 
anyone who is going to destroy evidence has done it by now 
he said 
attorneys for the los angeles times copley newspapers nbc and 
cbs sought release of the documents detailing searches at the 
offices of litton industries teledyne electronics and northrop 
corp and the los angeles home of consultant fred lackner 
the most vehement opposition to unsealing the documents came 
from a battery of attorneys representing unnamed employees of 
companies mentioned as targets of the probe they argued that the 
reputations of these clients referred to as mr x would be 
harmed by a mention in the documents even if they are never 
charged with a crime 
it would be totally destructive of these individuals to unseal 
the affidavits said attorney george oconnell 
among the newspapers seek release of similar documents are the 
washington times the washington post st louis postdispatch 
newsday published in long island ny and new york city the st 
paul minn pioneer press dispatch the star tribune of 
minneapolis and the hartford conn courant 
in minneapolis on friday a federal magistrate took under 
advisement a request to see documents allowing a search of unisys 
corp offices in minnesota 
patrick schiltz lawyer for the star tribune told us 
magistrate earl cudd that keeping the search warrants and 
affidavits sealed is pointless because any reasonably informed 
observer could make a good guess as to what is involved in the 
investigation simply by reading newspapers 
but assistant us attorney thor anderson told the magistrate 
the fact the information was printed in newspapers doesnt make 
it accurate 
on thursday the hartford courant filed a motion seeking 
documents related to the search of pratt amp whitney offices in 
washington dc earlier in the week the newspaper had asked a 
federal judge to unseal affidavits related to the search of three 
connecticut offices of norden systems and the home of a norden vice 
president 
both pratt amp whitney and norden systems are divisions of 
hartfordbased united technologies corp connecticuts largest

a canadian provincial court in a landmark ruling 
on friday rejected an edmonton mans bid to prevent his former 
girlfriend from having an abortion 
but justice joanne viet of alberta court of queens bench 
acknowledged the rights of a father of an unborn child by ruling 
that randy mock 25 could sue 18yearold michelle brandanburg for 
damages 
mock obtained a temporary injunction to prevent ms brandanburg 
from proceeding with the abortion but that injunction expired on 
thursday 
when it did ms brandanburgs lawyer told reporters her client 
went to the united states and got an abortion 
its devastating said mock who had claimed fathers rights 
and wanted to raise the child on his own 
he said he would pursue the case for damages ive come this 
far ive just lost my child and its not going to die in vain 
the decision came as parliament wrestled with the abortion issue 
following a controversial supreme court decision last january 
striking down canadas restrictive abortion law 
prime minister brian mulroneys conservative government said 
debate will begin next week on compromise legislation that would 
permit easy access to abortions early in a pregnancy but impose 
restrictions in later stages 
antiabortion and prochoice groups had used the edmonton case 
to back their arguments and both sides claimed victory 
every step along the way in cases like this are important for 
women said defense attorney donna oliver dyck who represented 
ms brandanburg and argued that a woman should have control of her 
own body 
mocks lawyer rosanna saccomani said the judge acknowledged 
the merits of her clients case by saying he had the right to sue 
for damages 
ms saccomani told the court the couple lived together 18 months 
and had a verbal agreement as a commonlaw couple last february to 
stop using contraceptives so they could have a child 
there was an intention to create a child that was what the 
parties wanted she should continue with her obligations 
she said the relationship broke up in june because of opposition 
from ms brandanburgs family by then ms brandanburg was 
pregnant her lawyer argued that mocks request for a permanent 
injunction to prevent the abortion was ludicrous since he had 
no rights as the father of an unborn child

cardinal john oconnor offered prayers and 
new york mayor edward koch talked politics friday as 1000 
americans gathered in this land of fog and bog on a pilgrimage for 
peace in northern ireland 
i hope to do nothing but be a pilgrim i hope to do nothing 
but pray oconnor said at an airport ceremony explaining why he 
would not delve into political specifics 
the cardinal the roman catholic archbishop of new york said he 
was visiting ireland in a totally nonpolitical 
nonambassadorial position the only contact we want to make is 
with god 
the allusion was to his lack of meetings over the issue of 
northern ireland 
koch a selfdescribed jewish soldier in the cardinals 
army was less reticent 
he repeated his belief that the british should eventually leave 
northern ireland and said the british should release a government 
report on police violence against nationalists in the province 
the mayor said that by not releasing the report compiled by 
veteran investigator john stalker the british government loses 
any credibility for the future and that means that theres even 
more bitterness 
at knock koch joined the pilgrims and embraced oconnor who 
kidded him youre all over the papers a reference to a 
photograph of koch pouring a pint of ale in a dublin pub 
the pilgrims gathered at the shrine of our lady of knock which 
commemorates the evening of aug 21 1879 when 15 people said they 
saw a vision of mary mother of jesus 
the apparition was a rare sign of hope in a region that had been 
devastated by famine and emigration the shrines success as a 
tourist destination was ensured when pope john paul ii visited it 
in 1979 
knock is still a village of less than 400 people but now it 
boasts three hotels and as many policemen more than a dozen pubs 
and an airport with an 8000footlong runway 
despite a turnout that was lower than expected the basilica in 
knock was only half filled for his first mass in ireland oconnor 
said he was not concerned 
not only am i not disappointed i am overjoyed by the number 
that did come oconnor said 
in a conclusion to his sermon oconnor said this is the 
beginning of a series of pilgrimages that will captivate the world 
all hearts all minds will turn toward the sufferings in 
northern ireland 
the mainly catholic irish republican army is fighting to push 
the british out of protestantdominated northern ireland join it 
with the republic of ireland and set up an allireland socialist 
state the ira is outlawed on both sides of the border its legal 
political wing is sinn fein

mikhail s gorbachev told former prime minister 
yasuhiro nakasone of japan on friday that japans alliance with the 
west blocks return of four disputed islands a japanese official 
said 
the soviet leader reiterated the kremlins longstanding 
position on the islands under soviet control since world war ii 
his stance allowed no progress on what tokyo considers the main 
obstacle to improved relations with moscow the japanese official 
said speaking on condition of anonymity 
the soviet union occupied four islands off northern japan at the 
end of world war ii the dispute over ownership of the territory 
has prevented the two nations from concluding a peace treaty for 43 
years 
nakasone told gorbachev some of the area was occupied illegally 
by former dictator josef v stalin nakasone argued that as part 
of the current soviet drive to acknowledge and correct past wrongs 
committed by stalin the territory should be returned to japan the 
japanese official said 
in a 1956 joint declaration between the two nations the soviet 
government announced its willingness to return two of the islands 
upon conclusion of a peace treaty to officially note the end of 
world war ii 
however gorbachev reminded nakasone that the kremlin amended 
that position in 1960 because japan decided to conclude a new 
security arrangement with the united states the official said 
paraphrasing gorbachev 
he reported that despite the impasse on the issue nakasone was 
pleased with the visit that began here wednesday nakasone was due 
to leave monday and return directly to moscow 
we didnt find anything particularly new in the messages sent 
by the soviet side said the government official who was present 
at the meeting between gorbachev and nakasone but what was more 
interesting was the extent to which we were able to get our message 
across to the soviet side 
nakasone left the office of prime minister late last year but 
has been considered during the soviet visit as an envoy of his 
successor prime minister noboru takeshita japan officially 
considers nakasones visit private though he belongs to the diet 
or parliament 
the japanese official contrasted what he described as a new 
soviet receptiveness with conditions four years ago when all 
mention of the disputed islands was censored from japanese speeches 
carried by soviet media 
the official said nakasone and gorbachev expressed mutual 
interest in improving relations between their countries but that no 
specific agreements were concluded during the visit

british union leaders fumed friday as the famed 
luxury liner queen elizabeth ii was shipped back abroad to be made 
shipshape 
this could have been avoided if the work had gone to a british 
shipyard in the first place said alex ferry general secretary 
of the confederation of shipbuilding and engineering unions 
the ocean liner also known as the qe2 will get a new propeller 
system in west germany where it underwent a costly refitting last

werft shipyard in bremerhaven west germany the shipping firm said 
no british shipyard would accept the sixmonth deadline with 
penalties reported at 17 million a day

diesel engines had been excellent

about 8000 people rallied friday 
to support four slovenians on trial for allegedly disclosing a 
military secret the state tanjug news agency reported 
the meeting was organized in a park near ljubljana the 
slovenian capital by an unofficial committee formed to defend 
journalists janez jansa david tasic and franci zavrl along with 
ivan borstner a noncommissioned army officer 
the four were charged by the military court in ljubljana with 
possessing a classified document allegedly dealing with the 
deployment of army units in slovenia yugoslavias most developed 
republic 
protesters said the closeddoor trial which started monday was 
seen as an attempt to crack down on democratic tendencies in 
slovenia 
several speakers including intellectuals and war veterans 
criticized the military and yugoslav federal authorities for 
wanting to usurp the sovereign rights of the slovenian people 
tanjug said 
zavrl the only defendent not in custody also addressed the 
meeting describing the trial a shameful humiliating court 
proceeding the report said 
all three journalists have in the past sharply criticized the 
army and particularly former defense minister branko mamula 
accusing him of promoting sales of yugoslav arms to third world 
countries and of misappropriating public funds 
earlier friday yugoslavias presidency rejected an appeal by 
the slovenian leadership that the trial be conducted in the 
slovenian language instead of serbocroatian 
the republics leadership has earlier demanded that the trial be 
conducted openly that the accused be defended by civilian lawyers 
and that they be released from custody 
the army rejected the requests citing what they called the 
sensitive nature of the classified documents

china said saturday the idea of a meeting with 
the soviet union to discuss how to bring peace to cambodia is still 
under discussion 
chinas foreign ministry was replying to reports out of 
washington that deputy foreign minister zhu qizhen and his soviet 
counterpart igor rogachev would meet in beijing in august to work 
out a peace settlement on cambodia 
a us official speaking on condition of anonymity said us 
secretary of state george p shultz was informed of the planned 
meeting during a visit to china a week ago 
the cambodian question has been taken up in recent sessions of 
chinesesoviet political normalization talks held twice a year but 
the august meeting would be the first devoted solely to the 
subject the foreign ministry called such a meeting still under 
consultation 
it did not elaborate 
china has said cambodia is the main obstacle to normalizing 
relations with moscow relations have been strained since the two 
communist giants split over ideological and strategic differences 
in the early 1960s 
china which backs the khmer rouge and other forces fighting 
vietnamese troops in cambodia says the soviet union financial 
supporter for the hanoi government must use its influence to end 
vietnams nineyear occupation of cambodia 
the main factions in the cambodian conflict the threeparty 
resistance coalition the vietnambacked hun sen government in 
phnom penh and vietnam are scheduled to gather in jakarta next 
week to set an agenda for peace negotiations 
vietnam battered by economic crisis and natural disasters at 
home has pledged to withdraw 50000 troops this year and remove 
its total force of about 120000 by 1990 
but prospects for peace are clouded by squabbling within the 
resistance coalition the resignation of coalition leader prince 
norodom sihanouk and the future role of the khmer rouge which 
ruled cambodia from 1975 to 1978 under khmer rouge rule hundreds 
of thousands of cambodians were killed 
soviet and chinese involvement is considered crucial if peace is 
to last in the southeast asian nation 
a settlement to the cambodian question would also set the stage 
for the first chinesesoviet summit in 30 years 
chinese senior leader deng xiaoping and soviet communist party 
chief mikhail gorbachev have expressed interest in a summit but 
deng has stressed that the kremlin must first remove what china 
calls the three obstacles particularly the problem of cambodia 
the soviet union has moved to remove the other two obstacles by 
beginning a withdrawal of its troops from afghanistan and easing 
tensions along the chinese border by reducing its troop strength in 
mongolia

the weak dollar is not keeping hordes of 
americans from traveling abroad this summer but it has prompted 
many to seek cheaper destinations travel consultants and tour 
operators report 
although some foreign countries are getting more american 
tourists than a year ago overall foreign travel is running at 
about the same level as last summer the travel professionals say 
that was around 23 million americans up sharply from the 18 
million in the summer of 1986 when the dollars steep slide and 
terrorist incidents kept many at home 
europe still accounts for about half of all vacation travel 
overseas by americans and britain france west germany italy and 
switzerland remain the most popular destinations with britain the 
leader by far but the erosion of their buying power abroad has 
driven more americans to countries like spain portugal greece and 
turkey where the dollar goes further experts say costs in those 
countries are lower and their currencies have not risen as sharply 
against the dollar as others have

in the dusty days of summer when 
temperatures hover above 100 degrees for days on end new delhi 
rejoices at the coming of the monsoon and its cooling rains 
in the west the rains are depressing in india they are a 
time of great joy release beauty and romance says khushwant 
singh a noted author and journalist 
as the rains come the dust settles parched gardens suddenly 
turn green temperatures come soothingly down and so do tempers 
but the monsoon has its sad side 
the rains that started early in july ended two years of drought 
in northern india promising good crops at last but they also 
unleashed floods that three weeks later had left at least 370 
people dead around the country of drowning or disease spread by 
contaminated water the death toll in new delhi from contaminated 
water approached 100 a city official said more than 7100 others 
had been treated in hospitals for cholera or gastroenteritis 
for new delhi the downpour broke the stifling heat but 
telephones went dead potholes multiplied or grew deeper and 
disease became a danger as tainted water seeped into pipes and 
wells 
at the first delicious moment of the monsoon though the 
nourishing rain kept such troubles distant 
the monsoon for most indians is not only the source of 
life but also their most exciting contact with nature says 
authorjournalist singh 
when the clouds first burst open over new delhi dozens of 
halfnaked children danced gleefully in the downpour and splashed 
in puddles in one impoverished neighborhood along the yamuna river 
its always like this said gulab an elderly woman watching 
the fun the children love to play in the rain but they 
invariably get sick 
more than 5300 people have been treated this year for 
gastroenteritis and cholera in new delhi at least 75 have died 
most of them children 
maya rao a university teacher who has lived in new delhi for 
many years described new delhis monsoon this way 
there is muck and mud all over mosquitoes attack you in 
hordes diseases spread like vice its impossible to get to places 
on time given the state of the roads and calling people on the 
phone is such a nuisance half the phones are dead 
then she added theres the humidity 
the moment the rain stops you sweat to death 
even so ms rao went on she cant imagine life without the 
monsoon 
what could be more delightful than eating bhutta roasted 
cornonthecob on your terrace as the greypurple skies melt into 
rain 
one city official who insisted on anonymity said he could do 
no work during the monsoon 
its too beautiful just to relax sit and watch the rain he

when they hear talk that corporate insiders 
are bullish on the stock market these days many investors take the 
message skeptically 
after all this supposedly savvy group of chief executives 
directors and major shareholders gave no warning whatsoever last 
year that the market was headed for a crash 
nevertheless since that debacle insiders have been buying 
stocks of their companies at a furious pace and the market has 
recovered some of the ground it lost last fall 
the rally has now progressed for more than half a year 
observed norman fosback editor of the investment advisory letter 
the insiders which defines its subjects as americas most 
knowledgeable investors 
throughout this recovery fosback adds the insiders have 
correctly been flashing bright and clear signals that the market 
outlook was bullish 
insiders tend to acquire much of the stock they hold in their 
companies through private arrangements such as corporate incentive 
plans thus their activity in the open market which they must 
publicly report is skewed toward sales rather than purchases 
by fosbacks insider indicator the normal level of 
insiders buying is 35 percent of their total open market 
transactions a particularly bullish reading occurs whenever the 
percentage gets to 50 or more 
immediately after the crash it surged above 90 percent and at 
the end of 1987 it stood at 79 
since those onthemoney buy signals the insider barometers 
have gradually eased to around 50 percent fosback says 
but an objective reading shows that they now stand very close 
to the levels that signaled many a major market rally in the 1970s 
and early 1980s the outlook today in other words is bullish 
most headlines about insider trading focus on stories of illegal 
buying or selling based on information that hasnt yet been made 
public the activity fosback and other analysts track however is 
legal and presumably reflects the special sensitivity insiders 
have to their companies prospects 
aaron feigen who publishes a newsletter known as the insider 
outlook adds that insiders are forced to look beyond shortterm 
market fluctuations 
insiders are the only group of investors who are required by 
law to be longterm investors he says government regulations 
dictate that insiders must hold their purchases for at least six 
months before selling them for a profit 
because of this regulation insiders cannot take into 
consideration the current mood or direction of the market instead 
when they buy they are focused on the special situations at their 
companies 
they expect to make substantial future capital gains more 
than they could get elsewhere and with more certainty and they 
have an excellent track record for doing this successfully 
if any outsiders want to base their investment strategies on 
what insiders are doing feigen suggests they need to be prepared 
to be patient for an indeterminate and sometimes very long time 
although you can be certain that the insider is investing in 
anticipation of a profitable return at some time in the future you 
cant tell what timetable he has in mind for achieving his 
profits feigen says 
there is no pattern that narrowly defines the length of time 
that all insiders follow when accumulating their stock 
in many cases the insider buying is concentrated within a 
relatively short time period a year or less but other times it 
can go on for years

with his name and a birthplace like salzburg 
austria you might expect comedian bill kirchenbauer to talk like 
arnold schwarzenegger 
on request kirchenbauer does a pretty fair schwarzenegger but 
his otherwise unaccented speech reflects his peripatetic upbringing 
as an army brat 
i went to 13 schools in 12 years he said in just one 
year i went to four schools i was always the new kid i was also 
the class clown they cant get mad at you if youre funny 
kirchenbauer is still funny both as a standup comedian and as 
the star of the abc comedy show just the 10 of us the show a 
spinoff of growing pains made its debut in the spring and will 
return in the fall he had originally auditioned for another role 
on growing pains which he didnt get but they liked him so 
much they offered him the role of coach 
he plays coach lubbock who loses his job at dewey high school 
on growing pains and is forced to uproot his large family and 
take a new job at an allboys prep school in a small town he and 
his wife played by deborah harmon have five daughters two sons 
and one child on the way 
coach lubbock was probably named after the city in texas 
said kirchenbauer i lived there too when dad was in the army 
i was born in salzburg then i lived just about everywhere from 
alaska to florida i think that had a lot to do with my becoming a 
standup comedian i moved so much i became the class clown to get 
along i began to look at each class as an audience i said if you 
squint it does look like an audience 
my father was a sergeantmajor although hes now retired the 
first place i can remember was fort benning ga we lived on 
ingersol loop my mother called me billiker boop from ingersol 
loop ive never been in the army myself i dont take orders very 
well except from a director 
he said he had been an entertainer for as long as he could 
remember when i was 5 i began working with puppets he said 
i always put on a show before christmas i had a jerry mahoney 
puppet my parents gave me then around 12 they started looking like 
dolls so i quit 
in my teens i started doing impressions i did shows at the 
american legion and places like that but doing impressions is very 
limited all you can do is take people out of context and so many 
people did impressions better than me then i began to do 
impressions of things like garbage trucks and typewriters and 
roller deodorant 
he had a job selling video editing equipment but about 10 years 
ago he quit and worked fulltime as a comedian 
kirchenbauer had previously worked with alan thicke when he 
produced fernwood 2night and america 2night kirchenbauer 
played egotistical singer tony roletti 
he said he sees coach as a man whos idealistic about the way he 
raises his family he just wants the american dream for them 
he said my wife says hes like me a bossy knowitall but a 
sweet kind of guy who would return a wallet if he found it 
kirchenbauer said the thing he likes most about the show is that 
he doesnt have to travel as much i enjoy doing the standup but 
the travel gets you down he said some people get rowdy in the 
clubs i had to knock out a guy in st louis i was using a big 
flashlight in my act and i hit him over the head with it people 
think its a game you yell at the comedian and he yells back at 
you 
kirchenbauer has been appearing on nbcs tonight show for 
eight years the first time he was asked to be on the show he 
turned it down hed won a competition in san francisco for standup 
comics and he got the call after his picture ran in the los angeles 
times his manager told him he shouldnt go on the tonight show 
on a gimmick 
i played the coach for six weeks on just the 10 of us and 
now people think thats all i can do he said ive been doing 
comedy for more than 10 years

more likely cooper says atampt could set an umbrella price high 
enough to make big profits while letting mci and us sprint survive 
in that case consumers would be overpaying 
atampt strongly disagrees with that theory saying that there is 
vigorous competition in longdistance mci and us sprint also 
disagree but they do say atampt needs to remain regulated for now 
we have to make a transition from a monopoly to competition 
thats a long slow process if atampt wanted to crush competitors

reports for the second quarter to give the market a lift 
true to expectations results achieved by many companies for the

motors profits up 54 percent from the comparable period last year 
but the market chose to concentrate its attention on 
disappointing earnings at a succession of hightechnology companies

announcing the discouraging news investors have responded each 
time by selling stocks throughout the hightech sector 
the state of the overall stock market meanwhile received

lost 724 to 38735 and the american stock exchange market value 
index was down 320 at 30611 
volume on the big board averaged 15013 million shares a day 
against 17520 million the week before 
normally in declining markets at least the bears get a chance 
to feast by reaping profits on short sales 
this timehonored strategy calls for borrowing stock from a 
broker selling it and then buying it back later at a lower price 
for return to the broker the difference minus commissions goes 
into the shortsellers pocket 
but it hasnt worked out that way lately for one recent favorite 
target of shortsellers the japanese stocks traded in this country 
in the form of american depositary receipts 
many of these familiar names such as honda matsushita and 
sony rebounded from the 1987 crash this year to new highs 
lately they have been much discussed on wall street as a way to 
play a break in the tokyo market which by us standards has 
returned to very inflated levels 
however it looks now as though the shorts were caught in a 
squeeze when the stocks failed to decline and they scrambled to buy 
stock to cut their losses for example honda which closed the 
previous friday at 141 soared as high as 179 by thursday 
somewhere on wall street there is presumably someone who safely 
traversed this minefield by owning the japanese stocks and shorting 
the technology issues but otherwise few have happy tales to tell 
right now

major farmlending banks are weathering the 
drought of the midwest and south remarkably well 
the big debtrating services say the protracted drought 
conditions that have dried up the profits of some farmers have left 
virtually no wrinkles on the quality of these banks credit 
the reason savvy bankers left nothing to chance following the 
farm crisis of the early 1980s most already had reduced their 
exposure to agriculture loans by paring down their portfolios and 
increasing reserves to cover possible losses noted recent studies 
by standard amp poors corp and moodys investors service 
the previous farm crisis also weeded out inefficient and highly 
indebted operations while those that remained emerged stronger 
more disciplined with the help of farm insurance and government 
intervention including price supports and disaster relief the 
reports said 
if anyone is feeling any pain its likely to be smaller 
unrated institutions which normally dont rely on the credit 
markets for additional capital said fay wang a moodys analyst 
and coauthor of its droughtbank report 
both sampp and moodys recently reaffirmed the credit ratings of 
bank holding companies with the largest exposures to agriculture 
loans since the possibility of a drought or other problems already 
had been factored into their ratings but they warned that if the 
same hot dry weather conditions persisted next year credit 
quality could suffer 
a good credit rating translates into cheaper borrowing costs in 
the public sector 
their banks access to the credit market helps them on an 
ongoing basis to expand in a diversified and less expensive 
manner said nancy stroker coauthor of sampps report 
these days credit raters are more concerned with broader 
problems facing banks such as their exposure to loans to less 
developed countries and for real estate ms wang said 
banks with over 50 percent of their equity tied up in farm loans 
are most vulnerable although only a handful of institutions fall 
into that category according to sampp first amarillo bancorp inc 
whose senior debt has been rated noninvestment grade had the 
biggest exposure in relationship to its size with its 167 million 
in agriculture loans representing a whopping 871 percent of its 
equity sampp said 
the banks with the largest overall farmloan exposure according 
to sampp were the large western banks bankamerica corp which has 
about 950 million in agriculture loans security pacific corp 
850 million wells fargo amp co 630 million and first interstate 
bancorp 596 million norwest corp with 440 million in loans 
is the largest agriculture lender in the midwest 
all of these big banks loans are manageable because they 
represent under a third of their equity base sampp said

the orange juice supply squeeze that has raised retail prices 
and propelled futures prices to record highs should ease next month 
as shipments of frozen concentrate from brazil resume experts say 
but consumers may not see a drop in retail prices of frozen 
concentrate until next year after the new florida orange crop has 
been harvested and processed 
once we get into the end of the year you get concerns about 
florida freezes so it might be a while before consumers begin to 
see orange juice prices fall said judith ganes orange juice 
market analyst for the new yorkbased investment firm shearson 
lehman hutton inc 
were not looking for a substantial break to occur until the 
end of the winter she said 
although us imports of frozen brazilian juice have declined 
steadily as floridas citrus groves have recovered from a string of 
freezes in the early 1980s imports from brazil still account for 
about 40 percent of us consumption ms ganes said 
brazil says it exported the frozen equivalent of about 77 
million gallons of orange juice to the united states from last july 
through this past may about 40 percent less than in the same 
period a year ago 
the declining us dependence on brazilian imports has been 
offset to some degree by rising brazilian exports to europe and 
brazil virtually sold out of orange juice during its latest 
julyjune marketing year 
the new florida orange crop wont be ready for processing until 
late fall or early winter so us orange juice packers caught 
between two harvests were forced to dig deeper into their frozen 
stocks and raise their prices 
processing of the rapidly maturing new brazilian crop will begin 
in two weeks or so and shipments to the united states should 
resume before the end of august analysts said 
the resumption of imports should bring down prices for future 
delivery of frozen concentrated orange juice which rose to a 
record 204 a pound july 18 on the new york cotton exchange 
orange juice for september delivery settled friday at about 188 a 
pound 
wholesale orange juice prices generally lag behind futures 
prices by two or three months ms ganes said so retailers who 
are now paying about 165 a pound for frozen concentrated orange 
juice compared with about 130 a pound a year ago may see even 
higher prices this fall 
consumers may not see significantly lower prices until next 
year but competition among producers and retailers may keep a lid 
on prices at the retail level she said

tumultuous events in the longdistance phone 
business this past week show the continuing strains of the nations 
transition away from a monopoly phone network 
as things stand american telephone amp telegraph co is the 
dominant carrier but losing market share mci communications corp 
has returned to predictable profitability and us sprint 
communications co is poised at a crossroads between prosperity and 
trouble 
here is what happened in a rapidfire week for the longdistance 
business 
atampt blamed spiraling expenses for a 03 percent decrease in 
its secondquarter profits and announced a companywide hiring 
freeze the first since the 1984 breakup of the bell system it 
said it was moving 3000 managers into sales and marketing 
mci reported a surprising ninefold quarterly profit increase 
setting records for both profit and revenue less than a week after 
revealing it would buy back the 162 percent stake held by 
international business machines corp 
us sprint lost another 112 million before taxes in the latest 
quarter its parents said gte corp said it would reduce its stake 
to 199 percent early next year leaving the rest in the hands of 
the smaller united telecommunications inc 
you put these events together and you really have a snapshot 
of the longdistance industry said eric arnum an analyst for 
international resource development inc in norwalk conn 
atampt had 72 percent of the longdistance market last year 
followed by mci with 93 percent and us sprint with 56 percent 
according to the yankee group a bostonbased consulting firm 
from here the battle of the longdistance carriers is expected 
to focus on big corporate accounts traditionally a stronghold for 
atampt but an area where the newcomers can build a track record that 
carries over to other businesses analysts said 
the biggest question at weeks end was us sprint if the company 
fulfills its promises of profitability gte will look foolish for 
having backed out and united telecommunications will have the look 
of genius 
william t esrey its new 48yearold chief is coming to work 
at 6 am and staying into the evening analysts call him 
intelligent and committed to the goal of turning us sprint around 
on the other hand analysts say some corporate customers are 
reluctant to use us sprint for other than secondary service because 
of questions about whether it can blot its red ink losses total 
176 billion since the company was formed on july 1 1986 
investors seemed willing to give united telecommunications the 
benefit of the doubt the stock ended the week at 3325 a share 
scarcely below the 3362 that prevailed before it announced plans 
to pay gte about 600 million for 301 percent of us sprint 
new yorkbased atampt has lately lost some of the big jobs that it 
once routinely won a sign that it is losing its aura of 
invincibility among major customers 
washingtonbased mci has nailed down contracts from merrill 
lynch amp co the social security administration united airlines 
and the defense department while us sprint has gotten work from 
the state of illinois westinghouse electric corp and smithkline 
beckman 
atampt chairman robert e allens drive to hold costs down while 
putting more salespeople on the road seems to be at least partly a 
response to concerns about long distance even though long 
distance remains highly profitable for the company covering losses 
in the computer business 
one analyst compared atampt to the new york mets loaded with 
talent but possibly lacking in desire 
mci in contrast is looking hot lately after hundreds of 
millions of dollars in losses in 1986 its stock has doubled in the 
past year its founder william mcgowan is back on the job after a 
heart transplant last year its recent earnings report reflects 
inroads into corporate accounts as well as 800 service and 
worldwide direct dialing all atampt strongholds 
us sprint based in kansas city mo has some obvious 
advantages including a highquality nationwide fiber network that 
will eventually cost roughly 3 billion said steven reynolds an 
analyst with link resources in new york 
its problems include two years of billing snafus which it is 
only now getting under control also us sprint lacks some of the 
expertise in assembling networks that atampt has and mci is quickly 
gaining 
us sprint is trying to prove its mettle in that area by taking 
more advantage of the expertise at telenet a unit that is the 
nations biggest network for data transmission 
telenet about the only profitable part of sprint has pretty 
much gone its own way for the past two years a situation that us 
sprints new chief vows to change 
i dont think weve done as good a job as we ought to there 
said esrey who is chief executive of united telecommunications 
and took on the added role of us sprint chief executive when robert 
snedaker abruptly retired this past week 
esrey predicted us sprint would be profitable in the 
nottoodistant future but after steadily pushing back its 
timetable for profitability he has stopped naming dates

it was a mixedbag session said john azarow a trader with 
shearson lehman hutton inc 
early trading was dominated by events in the persian gulf 
azarow said 
traders became pessimistic about the impact the proposed 
ceasefire between iran and iraq could have on already abundant 
world oil supplies azarow said both countries could step up oil 
production adding to the glut as they try to repair their 
economies following the war he said 
traders were thinking maybe the outbreak of peace is not that 
good for prices after all azarow said 
contracts then fell to their lows with the september west 
texas intermediate contract sinking to 1612 after reports of an 
iraqi attack on iran azarow said 
but when prices did not fall further the session turned around 
on technical factors azarow said 
new buyers felt confident because the market showed some 
support he said

the stock market failed to shake its recent slump despite an 
encouraging government report that consumer prices rose a modest 
03 percent in june 
the dow jones average of 30 industrials fell 2560 points friday 
to 206099 stretching its loss for the week to 6846 points that 
marked the biggest weekly decline for the closely watched average 
since it dropped 7626 points april 1115 
despite the favorable consumer price report and a modest decline 
in interest rates investors still showed little enthusiasm for 
stocks analysts said 
in another dose of good economic news the treasury department 
said a surge in quarterly income tax payments by companies and 
individuals gave the federal government a rare 95 billion surplus 
in june that left the cumulative red ink for the first nine months 
of the fiscal year below last years levels 
on the chicago board of trade meanwhile uncertainty about the 
weather outlook for the weekend and beyond in the droughtparched 
farm belt pushed most crop futures prices lower 
soybean prices for nearterm delivery fell for the fifth 
straight day bringing the august contract to just over 830 a 
bushel the lowest price for nearmonth delivery since june 2 
the labor departments report said the 03 percent june rise in 
consumer prices worked out to a moderate annual rate of 42 
percent with the effects of the drought showing up clearly only in 
poultry and egg prices 
food price rises held to a 06 percent gain despite the biggest 
surge in poultry and egg prices since august 1986 when the nation 
was in the midst of another drought 
offsetting increases on grocery shelves were a 02 percent 
decline in energy prices and a 03 percent drop in clothing costs 
id say the report is good news it clearly shows that 
inflation is not getting out of hand it has accelerated over the 
last year or so but very gradually and very unevenly said 
lawrence chimerine chairman of the wefa group a bala cynwyd pa
