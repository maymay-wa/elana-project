next time how about a little coffee with 
the cremora 
state health officials were called in last weekend when a white 
powder coated cars and homes in this northern south carolina 
community but officials from the department of health and 
environmental control said there was nothing to worry about 
its just cremora said joe faris jr 
borden inc manufactures powdered coffee creamer and 
occasionally air vent driers inside the plant become clogged 
sending clouds of cremora drifting through the vents on the 
companys roof 
faris said bordens occasional accidents cause aesthetic 
problems 
but to the people who live and work near the plant the white 
powder is a source of aggravation 
the coffee creamer mixes with dirt and pollen and settles in a 
grimy layer over siding and windows residents complain when 
moistened by morning dew it hardens like concrete on car windows 
grace dover whose home is just a few yards from bordens back 
door said she has stood on her back porch and watched the creamer 
fall just like snowflakes 
on saturday she said the stacks out yonder were belching 
like a volcano 
bordens plant manager don seltz did not return telephone 
calls seeking comment

with hooker styles at angelo tarlazzi and wild 
lampshade hoop skirts at thierry mugler some fashion shows failed 
to resemble their purpose readytowear 
but with all the craziness in thursdays shows for next winter 
there existed quiet and sporty moments at houses like cerruti 
castelbajac and even comme des garcons 
japanese rei kawakubo at comme des garcons concentrated on 
drawstringparka looks and bubbly silhouettes coupled with minis 
or long skirts the bunchy parkas or anoraks were often in black 
white or lame with the drawstrings all over the place 
kawakubos new discovery was bonded or unwoven fabrics with 
a light shimmery quality sometimes crimped or in gray with a 
mosaic or snakeskin quality 
they looked appealing in shades of brown gold or caramel or 
spring colors like robinsegg blue and some iridescent velvety 
fabrics were striking for dressier moments 
shapeless tunics dangling extra sleeves and bunching in odd 
places were the usual kawakubo trademarks that appeal to her many 
fans in japan 
yohji yamamoto went in for red and black in a big way and 
offered fun if somewhat complicated styles in bicolored outfits 
with petallike skirts under cute fake fur wraps 
he also used curvy bell shapes to advantage in longerskirted 
models with quilted skirts and sleeves paired with fitted bodices 
the bubbly skirts and tops gave it all a modernmedieval look 
in sexier readytowear angelo tarlazzi showed a lot of 
provocative skintight knit minis in hot colors or navy some with 
draping and buttons at the skirt with hems way up to high thigh 
topped with loose little jackets and worn with long satin 
shirts these looked reasonably wearable by the younger set 
his lateday clothes in stretch satins and crepes featuring 
quilted satin hearts on derrieres and busts and his draped sizzling 
satin bodyhugging numbers were tarty in an echo of what ungaro did 
several seasons ago they looked zingy on the runway but couldnt 
be safely worn by polite society 
jeancharles de castelbajac had some great ideas in the sporty 
line starting with his huge mohair tartan overcoats topping tiny 
bright minis and tights all in his preferred primary colors 
bright new mohair and ribbonwoven fabrics mixed with quilted 
leather made for interesting jackets topping leather shorts with 
colorful tights 
a witty feature was the rolled windowblind panels on coats worn 
over shortie kilts there were rafts of duffel coats full shorts 
bunched at the waist and some striking burnoose coats with hoods 
unforgettable were the vast trapeze coats in plaid on the 
outside and white fake fur linings turned out to make cape collars 
this special doublefaced plaid fabric especially made in 
southwest france is basically what the old french concierges 
bedroom slippers are made of said castelbajac 
nino cerruti kept his show relatively quiet with soft and loose 
hooded duster coats over narrow jersey pants and some good dark 
windowpane plaids in blazers over lean draped asymmetrical skirts 
or jumpsuits with full pants 
in the lateday line he stuck to things like pants in shades of 
bronze lurex split up and flapping to show the whole leg and a 
raft of sexy black tuxedo outfits some with shorts others 
with long skirts and backless 
thierry mugler ended the day with several shows so crowded with 
waiting journalists and buyers there were nearriots his main 
theme as usual was slightly kinky sex 
this time he flaunted it with lots of black vinyl tight pants or 
tiny minis with flared hems and neon colors in lateday dresses 
the ball gowns had lampshade hoop skirts cut very high up 
front 
aside from some beautifully fitted long jackets and anklelength 
coats with full skirts there wasnt much to wear on the street 
one spectactor remarked those hoops would be hard to fit into 
a taxi

thursday by the group that calls itself islamic jihad for the 
liberation of palestine 
the handwritten statement in arabic translated by the 
associated press said 
the organization of islamic jihad for the liberation of 
palestine denounces media reports about humanitarian moves to free

march 17 is just another day in lafayette county fla the 
nations most irish county 
the county seat is named mayo but there will be no st 
patricks day parade no green line painted down main street no 
green beer at the hideaway tavern no st pats day cards at wests 
drugs no corned beef and cabbage at the mayo cafe 
no shamrocks not even a leprechaun faith n begorra yall 
a few folks will wear the green but only because they heard 
about it on television according to emmett howell a local 
historian 
residents in fact were surprised to learn that in the last 
us census 177 percent of lafayettes 4035 residents declared 
irish ancestry the highest percentage of any county in the united 
states 
they werent the only ones 
i was shocked until i found out what happened there said 
james allen a california state university professor who spent 
seven years studying the census data 
in their eightpound demographic atlas we the people allen 
and fellow geographer eugene turner explain that lafayettes irish 
descend not from roman catholics who left ireland after the famine 
in the middle of the 19th century but from protestants who 
migrated from northern ireland years earlier 
these immigrants traced their own roots back to scotland which 
their ancestors left in the 1600s to colonize northeastern ireland 
but many moved on to america where they led the first wave of 
transappalachian settlement 
most of the counties with the highest percentage of irish 
ancestry in the 1980 census were in rural and smalltown sections 
of the southeast the area where the scotchirish settled and which 
now has more than a third of the american irish 
smith miss is the nations third most irish county and 
houston tenn its fifth numbers two and four are norfolk and 
suffolk counties in and around boston whose irish are typically 
catholic and more likely to have descended from postfamine 
immigrants 
the scotchirish whose descendants account for about half of 
the 40 million americans of irish descent have retained a sense 
albeit a weak one of an irish heritage according to allen 
mayo shares its name with the famously bleak county in western 
ireland but the town actually was named after a confederate 
officer with only two traffic lights one a mere blinking caution 
signal and a population around 1000 mayo would be hard pressed 
to celebrate st pats day in style even if it wanted to 
which it doesnt 
at west drugs harriet west said she used to stock st patricks 
day cards but it wasnt worth her while didnt sell moren one 
or two she explained this week 
at the mayo cafe thelma driver said there would be no corned 
beef and cabbage on the menu because st pats is not a real big 
deal here 
asked if she knew anyone who was irish she said no ones 
said they were irish she paused and added my husbands part 
irish 
if there was any real irish spirit in town surely it would be 
found at an establishment called the hideaway tavern run by a man 
named sullivan 
is what a big day lewin sullivan asked during a telephone 
interview 
st patricks day 
not particularly he said drawing the word out in his 
panhandle drawl most of em dont ever think of it 
well youre irish right 
i figure i must be from the name but how much i dont 
know 
it seemed there could be no less irish place than the most irish 
county in america other than one of the least irish counties in 
america 
in morgan county utah only about 32 of 4917 residents claimed 
irish ancestry 10 years ago people there mostly mormons of 
english descent are as unexcited about st patricks day as 
lafayette residents 
ive never heard anyone boast of being irish said linda 
smith secretary of the county historical society it just isnt 
discussed 
morgan city a community of 2000 just northeast of salt lake 
city is as bleak as mayo no green line down commercial street no 
corned beef at the spring chicken inn jeff london chairman of the 
board of commissioners flipped through the telephone book looking 
for irish surnames and came up only with an odriscoll 
exiled children of erin however can take heart on saturday 
the country cafe will have green beer on tap and irish decorations 
like fourleaf clovers said manager beverly dahlquist 
sure youre a fine colleen beverly but a shamrock has three 
leaves

angry irishamerican groups are calling for a 
withholdin of the green cash that is from a chicagobased 
card company they accuse of printing offensive st patricks day 
cards 
several organizations and individuals want a boycott of recycled 
paper products whose march 17 offerings included cards that show a 
drunkard inside a bottle marked irish whiskey and a naked 
woman with a shamrock across her buttocks 
im all for the first amendment but this stuff goes way over 
the top said niall odowd publisher of the weekly newspaper 
irish voice i dont mind some of the things theyre done in 
reasonable fun but this 
the newspaper encouraged its readers to call or write in protest 
to recycled an irish radio personality the ancient order of 
hibernians and other irish groups called for a boycott of the 
company and stores selling the cards 
the company said it was aware of the complaints and might remove 
some of the cards before next year but such talk failed to appease 
angry irishamericans 
i was totally revolted just revolted beyond belief after 
seeing some of the cards said adrian flannelly whose radio show 
claims 12 million new york cityarea listeners each weekend 
while greeting cards may seem like a small thing the money they 
make could raise irish eyebrows st patricks day is the ninth 
most popular holiday for exchanging cards and the industry 
estimates that 20 million go back and forth 
recycled is well aware of this executive secretary karen 
thompson says her company is just catering to the marketplace we 
have different types because people want different types at no 
time did we want to offend anybody or pick on any groups 
but such talk didnt calm nick murphy one of 250000 members of 
the ancient order of hibernians 
on st patricks day were all supposed to be drunk and 
thats all we do said murphy past president of the hibernians 
a lot of people look upon st patricks day as a religious 
holiday 
its not the first time the company has been attacked for its 
st patricks day cards last year the national ethnic coalition 
of organizations awarded recycled paper products a golden pit 
award for a card illustrated with a vomiting bishop 
that card has since been discontinued said ms thompson the 
irish groups hope the same happens to the rest of the offending 
cards 
well definitely be using the airwaves to make sure nobody 
buys anything from these people said flannelly

the emergence of neonazi 
groups and black leader nelson mandelas embrace of yasser arafat 
have frightened south africas jews who fear the country may be 
facing a wave of antisemitism 
south african jewish leaders are concerned south africas tense 
political situation is giving neonazi and other antisemitic 
groups more opportunity to operate and increase their support 
the south african government has expressed concern over a recent 
rash of incidents 
these extremist acts of desecration have no place in a 
civilized society foreign minister pik botha said in a statement 
swastika flags and antijewish slogans have become prominent at 
extreme rightwing rallies an israeli flag was burned at a 
rightwing meeting in pretoria in february and vandals left a 
severed pig head and a swastika on a synagogue door in johannesburg 
in march 
members of the neonazi afrikaner resistance movement wear khaki 
uniforms and insignia reminiscent of the stormtroopers of nazi 
germany antisemitic slogans and placards are becoming more common 
at the groups meetings 
south africas jewish community also was shocked when mandela 
embraced palestine liberation organization leader arafat in zambia 
mandela said his african national congress and the plo were allied 
freedom fighters 
told his action had worried south african jews mandela said it 
was too bad according to local press reports 
gerald leissner chairman of the south african jewish board of 
deputies said the antisemitic incidents were worrying we would 
like to live in a society in which there is no racial hatred 
unfortunately it seems these incidents are becoming more 
frequent he said 
the right wing has been gaining strength in south africa because 
of fears among some whites over the governments plan to end 
whiteminority rule and share political power with blacks 
while the main rightwing parties publicly denounce 
antisemitism some of their supporters have openly paraded with 
swastika flags more extreme rightist groups are attracting support 
and neonazi groups are starting to operate in the open according 
to jewish leaders 
aleck goldberg national executive director of the south african 
jewish board of deputies the main jewish leadership said the wave 
of antisemitic incidents had frightened many south african jews 
the nazis are crawling out of the woodwork he said in an 
interview up until now theyve been underground they havent 
come forward in the past 
goldberg said nazi groups were claiming that jews are part of a 
racial conspiracy to end whiteminority rule jews were being 
singled out because many are prominent liberals who have fought 
against apartheid he said 
the nazi groups appear small with no more than a few hundred 
supporters but jewish leaders want the government to take action 
to ensure they do not become a serious threat 
we would hope because of the inflamatory nature of what 
theyre doing that the authorities will take strong action against 
them goldberg said 
the jewish community also was worried about that black 
nationalist groups might be antisemitic jewish leaders did not 
see mandela as antisemitic but were worried about the ancs ties 
with the plo goldberg said 
there is concern because arafat is regarded as a menace he 
said 
south africa and israel had close ties for many years because of 
the international isolation both nations faced israel has cut 
support for south africa in recent years including economic and 
weapons assistance because of us pressure to isolate pretoria 
because of its whiteminority rule 
south africas jewish community still had close ties with israel 
and wanted south africa to remain a friend of israel whatever the 
ideological complexion of any future government goldberg said

secretary of state james a baker iii is about 
to venture into his first round of onsite african diplomacy a 
task that draws less attention than the arabisraeli dispute in the 
middle east but can be as complicated 
after a 25hour flight bakers aging us air force jet will 
land monday in namibia the newly independent former south african 
colony and he and other world figures will attend ceremonies for 
the new nation 
thats the easy part the united states during the reagan 
administration played a leading role in the establishment of 
namibia and is prepared to provide 78 million in aid next year to 
help the new country get on its feet 
as the us representative baker can take pride in his 
countrys help in ending a long and difficult guerrilla war 
but once the ceremonies are over baker may feel as if he is 
still trying to bring israelis and palestinians together 
that effort went into suspension this week amid an israeli 
government crisis over bakers formula for negotiations it could 
be months before the united states resumes its mediator role 
in africa though baker will be instantly hipdeep in the 
struggle over apartheid he has invited black activist nelson 
mandela to meet with him in windhoek the namibian capital and he 
has made arrangements for talks in cape town with president f w 
de klerk of south africa as well as black opponents of racial 
separation 
mandela who was freed by de klerk last month after spending 27 
years in prison is demanding that the bush administration cut its 
diplomatic ties to south africa and stiffen economic sanctions 
but state department policymakers would rather keep the current 
sanctions and use relations with pretoria such as bakers 
fivehour visit to cape town next thursday as leverage to steer de 
klerk into accelerating change 
de klerks freeing of mandela from prison and the legalization 
of the african national congress were viewed as positive even 
courageous steps by the bush administration but a 3year state of 
emergency still exists and there are up to 300 political prisoners 
whose release is a prerequisite to lifting us sanctions 
president bush in the euphoria over mandelas release invited 
de klerk to the white house but baker is likely to do a diplomatic 
softshoe away from the subject he is under pressure from american 
critics of apartheid to hold out for the dismantling of racial 
segregation first 
randall robinson executive director of the black lobbying group 
transafrica says the oval office carries with it a special 
meaning and that de klerk has not earned that recognition 
so baker will be walking a tightrope as he tries to nudge south 
africa toward more reform 
baker also may try some mediation between rival parties in 
angola 
he has invited president jose eduardo dos santos to see him in 
windhoek and jonas savimbi the leader of the usbacked unita 
rebel movement in zaire at the end of the week 
the united states has no relations with the angolan government 
and provides an estimated 45 million to 50 million a year in 
covert aid to savimbis guerrillas 
the 14year war settled into a stalemate after government forces 
captured part of mavinga a savimbi stronghold in southeast angola 
in late december 
diplomacy sometimes operates most effectively in a stalemate a 
negotiated settlement appears more attractive when neither side can 
gain the upper hand 
savimbi has ties to south africa and is a favorite of 
conservative members of congress dos santos has the support of 
cuban troops but about half of the 50000 who were in the country 
have withdrawn under the agreement that produced independence for 
namibia the rest are supposed to leave by next year 
the united states is alone among major western countries in not 
recognizing the angolan government despite ties to the soviet 
union and cuba and its marxist trappings the country is developing 
a private economy and exports about 75 percent of its oil to the 
united states through two american oil companies chevron and 
conoco 
last year dos santos accepted an invitation from 36 members of 
congress to visit the united states but he wanted to be received 
as a head of state which is impossible because of the lack of 
usangolan diplomatic relations 
so baker will have to try some fancy footwork on angola too 
while looking for openings to promote a peaceful solution

federal officials say theyve been unable to 
figure out how to seize khun sa the admitted opium warlord of 
burma now facing federal drugtrafficking charges 
a 10count indictment returned in december against khun sa was 
unsealed thursday as attorney general dick thornburgh announced the 
charges 
the charges stem from the largest heroin seizure in history 
1086 kilograms seized in february 1988 in bangkok thailand 
before they were to be shipped to new york 
khun sa is probably the largest heroin producer in the 
world said ed heath who until recently headed the drug 
enforcement administrations heroin desk 
the burmese government has been unable to apprehend khun sa 
after years of fighting his private army 
khun sa also is charged with importing or attempting to import 
more than 3500 pounds of heroin into new york between september 
1986 and february 1988 according to the indictment returned in 
us district court in brooklyn ny 
the indictment was kept sealed for several months while the dea 
explored every option that we could to determine if it was 
feasible to apprehend khun sa dea spokesman frank shults said 
thursday 
we thought that by watching his travel it might be possible 
to apprehend him in another country shults said we explored 
all those other possibilities and it was determined that that was 
not a feasible approach so the indictment was unsealed now 
the indictment was revealed just weeks after the state 
department announced a substantial increase in worldwide production 
of opium from which heroin is derived 
the worldwide total the department said was 4209 metric tons 
last year up from 2433 to 3308 tons in 1988 in burma alone 
opium production increased to 2625 tons last year up from 770 to 
1100 tons in 1988 
dea administrator jack lawn said the current us consumption of 
heroin is just over 5 metric tons a year it takes 10 tons of opium 
to make 1 ton of heroin 
lawn estimated that up to 45 percent of the heroin consumed in 
the united states comes from the burmese section of the golden 
triangle an area of southeast asia where thailand burma and laos 
meet khun sa is reputed to control as much as 90 percent of the 
heroin from burma 
the dea believes khun sa has been targeting americans as 
customers of his drug business for decades lawn said 
we believe that khun sa was predominantly responsible for the 
flow of heroin to our military forces in vietnam and in thailand 
during rampr rest and relaxation as a means of retaliating against 
the us forces for the damages they wrought during the war 
itself lawn said 
thornburgh denounced khun sa as the prince of death and 
sought to play down the difficulties of bringing him to trial in 
the united states 
khun sa leads the private shan united army a force estimated at 
4000 to 16000 guerrillas who have been battling the burmese 
government since 1958 when it broke a promise to allow the shan 
state to secede 
usburmese relations have been strained since us aid was cut 
off two years ago following several massacres and the installation 
of a military government 
but thornburgh said the two governments were united in their 
desire to apprehend khun sa and added he may be subject to 
delivery by his own forces if someone decides to betray him 
khun sa has offered repeatedly to abandon the drug trade if the 
united states would pay him millions of dollars a year for six to 
eight years to buy out the opium crops such an annual fee has been 
reported recently as ranging from 100 million to 300 million 
the us government has rejected such offers 
the last thing to do is to pay the extortionist lawn said

a rams horn sounded and a cantors 
melancholy psalms went out from the mound where 800 years ago 
today the jews of york committed mass suicide to escape an 
antisemitic mob 
it is sometimes called the english masada this most 
infamous incident of jewhatred in british history 
like the jews who killed themselves on the desert fortress of 
masada rather than fall slaves to rome the memory of york jewrys 
fate has survived through the ages still strong enough eight 
centuries later to draw several hundred jews and a handful of 
christians to a memorial service thursday at the place where it 
happened 
the service opened a fourday program of lectures concerts and 
exhibitions organized by jewish and christian groups and the city 
of york to commemorate the slaughter of march 16 1190 
no one knows exactly how many died but historians reckon the 
death toll was about 150 
the story was told in compelling detail by william of newburgh 
a contemporary historian who lived near the northeast england city 
antijewish feeling grew in england with the religious fervor of 
the crusades the attempt by european christians to win control of 
the holy land from the moslems by march 1190 york was close to 
exploding 
egged on by the local noblemen who thought they could clear 
their debts to jewish moneylenders by killing them a mob set out 
to hunt down the jews 
the jews fled to a castle where they were entitled to royal 
protection the mob surrounded the fortress the constable went out 
of the castle perhaps to reason with the crowd when he returned 
the frightened jews would not let him back in he called in the 
sheriff who ordered the door broken down 
the mob read this to mean royal assent to a pogrom while the 
jews assumed all hope was lost 
rabbi yomtob of joigny turned to his people and according to 
williams account told them we ought to prefer a glorious death 
to an infamous life for if we should fall into the hands of the 
enemy we should die according to their pleasure and amidst their 
mockery therefore let us willingly and devoutly with our own 
hands render up to him that life which the creator gave to us 
first to act was a man named josce who killed his wife and 
children yomtob then killed him then each head of family killed 
his loved ones and was in turn killed by yomtob yomtob died last 
those who chose not to die accepted the mobs offer of life if they 
accepted baptism but when they came out they too were killed 
finally the mob broke into york minster where the documents of 
their debts were kept and burned the papers in the vestry 
although the monarch of the time king richard the lionheart 
was furious and sent a senior official to mete out punishment the 
perpetrators were never caught and although jews continued to live 
in york many came to believe it was an accursed city 
that sentiment persists as reflected in lines by the northern 
english poet jon silkin the event has the frigid persistence of 
a growth in the flesh a gross tumor and a sense of such growth 
haunting the flesh of york 
today fewer than two dozen jews live in york and they are used 
to the surprised reactions they get from other jews 
ben sugar a retired economics lecturer who has lived in york 
since the 1930s says many jews believe a rabbinical edict forbids 
them to live here 
its a myth that has developed over the generations he said 
in an interview 
after lunch at a york hotel and a lecture on the massacre the 
jews walked through town to the bleak mound in the middle of a car 
park and up a flight of steep stairs 
they crowded into the circular stone cliffords tower built 
long after the massacre to listen to services conducted by 
anglican archbishop of york john habgood and rabbi norman solomon 
from birmingham 
psalms were read the cantor sang the dirge el malei 
rachamim god full of mercy and the crowd recited kaddish

removing the tropical rain forest from the 
amazon river basin of south america would change forever the 
climate of that region and could affect the global weather a new 
study says 
once the trees are felled said jagadish shukla a professor of 
meteorology at the university of maryland the famed dense jungle 
forest along the amazon river will be gone forever 
you will never be able to regenerate the forests once you have 
cut them said shukla the coauthor of a study appearing today 
in the journal science 
shukla said wiping out the amazon river forest probably also 
would affect the worldwide climate because it would change the 
temperature of waters near the mouth of the river and perhaps 
disrupt weather patterns affected by those waters 
the scientist said a computer model of the effects of 
deforestation along the amazon river shows that rainfall would 
decline by more than 26 percent the average area temperature would 
rise and evaporated moisture in the amazon basin atmosphere would 
decline by 30 percent 
loss of the trees would not turn the area into a desert 
although shukla noted in an interview we were tempted to say 
that but we didnt go that far 
the amazon basin gets about 97 inches of rainfall a year 
killing the tropical forest he said would reduce the annual 
rainfall by about 25 inches 
once this new drier pattern is established the loss of the 
amazon basin forest would be irreversible shukla said 
global climate also could be affected he said 
the amazon river dumps huge amounts of fresh water into the 
atlantic ocean which affects the delicate distribution of heat in 
the ocean and in the atmosphere 
by reducing the amount of rainfall over the amazon basin shukla 
said the amount of water carried to the atlantic also would be 
reduced 
there would be tremendous changes in the chemistry and ecology 
of the oceans he said it is very likely that there will be 
very significant global effects on the climate 
it is not known precisely how the worlds weather might change 
however he said 
shukla and two colleagues at marylands center for 
oceanlandatmosphere interactions created a computer program that 
tests the effects of amazon deforestation the computer model 
enables the scientists to make the complex calculations necessary 
to predict what would happen if the amazons trees were gone 
the amazon rain forest is the largest forest in the world and is 
being destroyed at what shukla called a devastatingly fast rate 
about 14000 square miles of forest are cleared annually and 
about 12 percent of the forest already is gone most of the 
clearing is by slashandburn farmers who replace the trees with 
crops and pasture 
if deforestation were to continue at this rate most of the 
amazonian tropical forests would disappear in 50 to 100 years 
shukla wrote 
he said clearing the forest affects the regional climate in 
three ways removing the trees causes sunlight to heat up the soil 
surface loss of the trees significantly lowers the rate at which 
water is evaporated into the atmosphere and loss of the trees 
disrupts the wind patterns that carry moist air over south america 
from the oceans 
about half of the amazon basin rainfall comes from water that 
has evaporated from the vegetation of the forest once the forest 
is gone shukla said it would close off this source of water vapor 
for the rain clouds 
shukla said there werent enough weather records in the area to 
determine if the climate has already been changed by the 12 percent 
of the trees that have been removed however studies have shown 
that soil temperatures increased in the cleared areas and that 
forest fires are more intense in periods of reduced rainfall 
what is the critical size beyond which the climate changes and 
we cant recover the forest we simply dont know shukla said 
our study is limited to the total deforestation 
the study was coauthored by carlos nobre and piers sellers 
also of the university of maryland at college park 
science is the journal of the american association for the 
advancement of science

an attorneys assurance that thrift owner 
charles h keating jr had federal regulators right where you 
want them in 1988 is being cited as new evidence that he exerted 
undue influence 
the letter strongly suggests the fix was in for the owner of 
lincoln savings and loan association said rep henry b gonzalez 
dtexas the house banking committee chairman who released it 
thursday 
margery waxman an attorney with sidley amp austin in washington 
telecopied the letter to keating on may 10 1988 to prepare him 
for a meeting with officials of the federal home loan bank board 
you have the board right where you want them and you should be 
able to reach an agreement which will completely satisfy you 
she said waxman added that she had successfully put pressure 
on m danny wall then chairman of the bank board and chief 
regulator of thrift institutions 
banking panel aides refused to say how they obtained the letter 
wall who quit earlier this month after harsh congressional 
criticism of his handling of lincoln said he had never met with 
waxman concerning keating her letter was a lawyer trying to 
justify a fee he said 
the treasury departments office of thrift supervision which 
succeeded the bank board as sampl regulator said the letter was 
riddled with errors and false conclusions 
waxmans law firm denied in a statement that it applied 
political pressure to the bank board or its employees it said the 
only pressure it exerted was advising the bank board that keating 
was considering filing a lawsuit 
the letter indicates what has been generally understood for 
some time that is there were intensive negotiations going on at 
the time with regard to a memo of understanding between lincoln and 
the bank board said leonard bickwit a washington attorney 
representing keatings holding company american continental corp 
keating is chairman of american continental owner of irvine 
califbased lincoln the thrift was seized by regulators last 
april and is expected to require the nations costliest sampl bailout 
at about 2 billion 
at the time waxman wrote keating was fighting federal efforts 
to rein in his institution bank board examiners based in san 
francisco had recommended that the government take over lincoln 
and keating had appealed to authorities in washington 
as you know i have put pressure on wall to work toward 
meeting your demands and he has so instructed his staff waxman 
wrote they all know the wednesday meeting is crucial to their 
future if they mess up this time it is all over 
wall however said i would not under any circumstances 
threaten anybody with their job that is not my character that is 
not my way of doing business 
the letter was written five days after a divided bank board 
decided to move the lincoln case from the jurisdiction of its san 
francisco office to washington and on the same day wall had a 
telephone conversation with keating 
waxman outlined what she expected to be the result of the 
meeting including a new examination of lincoln and memorandum of 
understanding between the institution and regulators which was 
executed five days later 
san francisco is finished she assured keating there is 
no going back to san francisco and nothing can be done to follow up 
their exam 
in the new exam she said nothing will be done that you 
are not aware of in advance 
also she told keating that bank board personnel will not be 
able to enforce any violation of the memorandum of understanding 
without going to the board first this will give you two 
bites at the apple before the board and in court if necessary 
gonzalez the house banking committee chairman said the letter 
tracks with amazing accuracy the actions taken by the board 
actions which were interpreted publicly as clamping down on 
lincoln 
in reality as the letter carefully explains the actions were 
to be shams designed not to punish but to allow keating an escape 
route he said 
rep jim leach of iowa a republican member of the banking 
panel said its clear from the law firms memo that keating 
had undue and unprecedented influence on the board this memo 
would appear to put wall at the center point of directing in a 
powerful if not coercive way his employees to abide by his 
decision to go easy on lincoln

reluctance by the house to change the 
distribution system for federal rural development money has 
temporarily sidetracked a bill designed to give new life to 
decaying villages and towns 
agriculture committee chairman kika de la garza said an 
amendment approved thursday by the house killed the heart of the 
bill as it exists now 
but he said we can regroup 
the debate was inaccurate in many instances de la garza 
said the inaccuracies have to be corrected 
he said the members of the house are still committed to rural 
development he said the bills supporters would take some time 
to educate colleagues before seeking a final vote 
the house agriculture subcommittee on rural development led by 
chairman glenn english dokla and ranking republican tom coleman 
of missouri spent nearly two years working on the legislation 
hearings were held throughout the country and in washington to 
determine the needs of residents of areas where consolidation of 
farms has caused small businesses to suffer and population to 
decline 
however the big problem lawmakers faced was a lack of money to 
infuse into these dying communities 
their answer was to pool three existing funds water and sewer 
which contains about 500 million to 600 million this year 
business and industry development about 100 million and 
community facilities about 100 million 
the states could decide their own needs spending all of their 
allocation from the three funds on one area if necessary 
but rep charles rose dnc contended the provision gave too 
much power to the agriculture secretary and offered an amendment 
that froze the three funds prohibiting pooling 
under the original legislation state review panels would set 
priorities on projects but the agriculture department would have 
the final say on use of the money 
rose said that if his amendment were not adopted the 
agriculture secretary would have unprecedent uncontrollable 
authority to transfer money without input from congress 
rep jamie whitten dmiss chairman of the house 
appropriations committee and well known for his power over 
agriculture programs did not speak during the floor debate but 
said earlier that pooling was a serious step backward that his 
panel would write provisions to avoid if necessary 
rep robin tallon dsc said the bills provision constituted 
a modified block grant proposal this scares me because 
traditionally block grants have died a slow withering death 
after an hour of debate the house approved roses amendment 
204193 
english said the system that roses amendment preserves has 
shown tremendous inequity among the states 
he said that if a state doesnt use all of its share of water 
and sewer money for example the funds go back to the federal 
government and become available to any other states that apply for 
it 
english said the aggressiveness of the local farmers home 
administration directors has had a lot to do with how much of the 
money a state gets 
there are some fmha directors who philosophically dont like 
these programs so they spend very little of it the available 
money english said after the vote 
de la garza said time has been set aside next week for further 
action on the bill but did not say whether sponsors would try 
again that soon or take more time to try to persuade members to 
change their opinions

this was going to be the year that the abortion battle ran 
headon into the state legislatures the irresistible force 
meeting the immovable object 
so far the immovable object is winning 
of more than 150 abortionrelated bills introduced in 
legislatures so far this year just one has been signed into law 
dozens more have been killed or are dying a slow death in 
legislative committees 
after all the predictions of sweeping changes following last 
years supreme court ruling in missouris webster case after all 
the demonstrations and counterdemonstrations and teethgnashing 
what happened 
the issue is so hot so controversial in many states that 
legislators just dont want to deal with it in an election year 
said kate michelman executive director of the national abortion 
rights action league a washingtonbased lobbying group they 
want this issue to go away they wish they could escape it 
spokeswoman nancy myers of the national right to life committee 
the largest antiabortion lobbying group agreed 
she added however that legislative timidity has nothing to do 
with the supreme court decision in missouris webster case last 
july the case allowed states to limit access to serivces without 
removing the federal right to abortion 
politicians would just as soon avoid the issue and that was 
no different before webster its always been that way she said 
abortion explained ohio senate president stanley aronoff is 
a nowin issue in an election year for that reason there is 
almost no chance that ohio will pass an abortion bill this year 
although two have been introduced 
the story is similar elsewhere 
oklahoma legislators rejected 10 abortion bills in a single day 
last month leaving just one bill and it isnt expected to pass 
in missouri 11 bills have been introduced none is expected to 
pass nine have been introduced in new york all are expected to 
die in iowa three bills have been killed two others are given 
little chance 
the problem is this issue is so emotional said iowa state 
rep jane svoboda there is no opportunity for the two sides to 
reach any kind of compromise in the meantime everybody suffers 
and everybody loses 
i really wonder about the national course were on she 
added this is not a black and white issue 
thats not to say that battles have been avoided in every state 
abortion has been a major issue this year in michigan south 
carolina minnesota and idaho 
it would have been in pennsylvania except that legislators 
there passed the most sweeping abortion restrictions in the nation 
late last year 
the michigan legislature approved a measure requiring minors to 
get a parents consent or a judges waiver before an abortion 
gov james blanchard vetoed it leading antiabortion groups to 
launch a petition drive to take the issue to voters 
south carolina gov carroll campbell signed a similar bill the 
one abortion bill that has made it into law nine other bills in 
south carolina have remained stuck in committees 
idaho has been the biggest battleground lately and may 
represent the best opportunity for antiabortion forces to get the 
supreme court to reconsider roe vs wade the 1973 ruling that 
forced states to legalize abortion 
an idaho bill would outlaw abortion as a form of birth control 
allowing it only in cases of rape incest profound and 
irremediable fetal disabilities or to preserve the mothers 
health 
a state house committee voted wednesday to postpone action on 
the bill until today so it can hear from more experts on the 
constitutional issues involved in the bill 
ms myers said the national right to life committee is 
cautiously optimistic about prospects for the bill which she 
said would surely be challenged in court if passed 
ms michelman of the abortion rights action league agreed 
saying we may lose there she said the idaho legislation is 
designed to chip away at roe or overturn roe completely 
not all legislation has been proposed by abortion foes slightly 
more than 25 bills this year have been supported by the 
abortionrights side 
but abortion rights advocates have fared no better than their 
opposition 
their best shot may be in new hampshire where the house of 
representatives passed a bill repealing preroe laws that outlawed 
abortion and ensuring the unrestricted right to an abortion through 
the 24th week of pregnancy 
even if that bill passes the senate gov judd gregg is expected 
to veto it 
few bills across the nation will reach the governors desk ms 
michelman credits the high mortality rate to the webster ruling 
which she said awakened the sleeping giant of the 
abortionrights movement 
ms myers not surprisingly sees it differently she said the 
antiabortion movement never expected easy sledding after the 
ruling 
were not expecting a whole lot of legislation to pass this 
year she said theres a lot of legislation out there but 
legislation takes a long time and were in it for the long haul

when willie mae newberry moved to bostons inner 
city in 1968 after a lifetime spent in a small georgia town she 
was hoping for a better life instead shes seen her family 
devastated by violent crime 
since 1987 two of her daughters and a soninlaw have been 
gunned down another son died mysteriously in boston in 1974 
the day after her daughter delores 33 was shot to death this 
week newberry 65 sat in a corner of her living room staring at 
a flickering tv screen she was surrounded by the grandchildren she 
must now raise on her own 
its something you cant describe she said about the 
violence that has caused bostons murder rate to soar some of 
them can cope with it and some of them cant 
newberry showed no emotion as she gazed out her apartment 
window her grandson shariff 15 sat to one side her 
granddaughter shahera 10 on the other 
the childrens mother delores newberry gandy was fatally shot 
tuesday night while wielding a pitchfork trying to protect her 
children from suspected gang members who were trying to set fire to 
her apartment their father percy gandy was shot to death in a 
roxbury housing project last summer 
mrs gandy was the mother of five children ranging in age from 
18 months to 17 years and the grandmother of two infants 
its hard to explain shariff said about his feelings for 
his mother he fingered a pencil and stared at the tv she used 
to take us places and stuff she watched out for us 
his sister did not want to talk she slumped in an armchair 
playing with an infant toy 
but willie mae newberry said shes become almost hardened to the 
violence she didnt even flinch she said when a nurse from the

didnt crack when she had to go down to the hospital to identify

the deep political and emotional disagreement 
over abortion divided a congressional panel as it opened hearings 
into recent state restrictions on a womans right to end her 
pregnancy 
the chairman of the house panel rep don edwards dcalif 
drew opposition thursday when he refused to allow an antiabortion 
witness to show videotapes of a fetus inside the womb edwards is a 
sponsor of a bill that would write broad guarantees of abortion 
rights into federal law 
an antiabortion member rep james f sensenbrenner rwis 
challenged edwards ruling and after losing on a partyline vote 
walked out of the meeting he denounced this charade and 
accused majority democrats of gagging the witness 
edwards judiciary subcommittee on civil and constitutional 
rights held its first hearing on the socalled freedom of 
choice bill with a look at the effect of a missouri law 
restricting abortions 
the supreme court upheld that law in a ruling last year that 
energized the political debate on abortion 
appearing on a panel of abortionrights supporters a missouri 
woman and a physician testified that the restrictions have left 
some women unable to obtain safe abortions even when they face 
lifethreatening complications 
maralee dinsdale of carrollton mo described three difficult 
and unsuccessful pregnancies including a third last year when 
tests revealed she carried an anencephalic baby a fetus that had 
not developed a skull or brain and would not live long if brought 
to term and delivered 
i was denied a needed medical procedure that could save my 
life she said 
she said she also had a history of bleeding and other 
complications and decided to have an abortion because of the 
missouri law she said her doctor was denied permission to perform 
the abortion at the two hospitals where he practiced and referred 
her to a clinic not a hospital in neighboring kansas 
there mrs dinsdale said she suffered heavy bleeding and other 
complications after the abortion and was rushed to a hospital 20 
miles away where she recovered 
i was emotionally drained and scared to death but i felt i 
had no choice she said no hospital would help me my doctor 
had more or less abandoned me and i truly felt it would endanger 
my life more by carrying the baby to term in a sense for 
nothing 
the missouri law prohibits abortions from being performed at 
public hospitals bans tax dollars from being spent for 
encouraging or counseling women to have abortions and requires 
doctors to determine when possible whether a fetus of 20 or more 
weeks is capable of surviving outside the womb 
mrs dinsdale said she was denied an abortion at private 
hospitals even though the missouri law bans them only at public 
institutions 
dr howard i schwartz a kansas city mo obstetrician and 
gynecologist said that because of the law both private and public 
hospitals often refer women seeking abortions elsewhere even when 
the fetus has major abnormalities or the woman suffers diseases 
that could be lifethreatening if she remains pregnant 
the subcommittees dispute arose when a second panel of 
witnesses all abortion opponents testified 
sharleen r richard a radiologic technologist from michigan 
wanted to show examples of a new sonograph technology providing 
highquality images of the fetus at an early stage of pregnancy 
i have personally seen many women change their mind after they 
see that little baby in the womb she said 
but edwards said the subcommittee had a general rule against 
showing videotapes sensenbrenner protested the panel had no such 
rule and invited mrs richard to turn on her videotape machine and 
television when she moved to do so edwards ruled her out of order 
the subcommittee plans more hearings although sponsors have not 
decided whether to seek a vote on the bill similar hearings are 
scheduled in the senate

every city police officer will receive a list 
bearing the names of 105 hardcore violent gang members with 
outstanding warrants against them under a new attack on urban crime 
proposed by mayor raymond flynn 
jolted by the recent crime wave that has pushed the citys 
murder rate 50 percent higher than the same period last year more 
than two dozen state city and federal officials joined flynns 
call for a crackdown on inner city drugs and violence at a hastily 
called summit thursday afternoon 
flynn organized the meeting following the rash of violence 
tuesday night that left three dead and several other people 
wounded thirtytwo people have been murdered in boston this year 
up from 21 during the same period last year the mayor proposed a 
program to combat violence centered on a plan to find and arrest 
gang members who have defaulted on court appearances 
he also recommended eliminating loopholes in a law mandating a 
oneyear sentence for criminals in possession of illegal weapons 
reducing delays in bringing to trial those accused of drug crimes 
or violent crimes expanding prison space and offering drug 
treatment on demand 
gov michael dukakis who also attended the meeting suggested 
the appointment of a task force including one federal 
representative to meet daily to close in on gang members 
flynns plan was prompted in part by a report issued by the 
boston bar association thursday that said the state criminal 
justice system lacks the resources to fight the war on drugs

astrologer joan quigley says she didnt intend 
to write a book about her influence in ronald reagans presidency 
until she read what nancy reagan said about it 
it reads like fiction and much of it is evasive she wrote 
in her new book about nancys book what she has left out would 
fill a book 
no political decision was ever made based on it mrs reagan 
said in my turn of mrs quigleys readings of the moon the sun 
and the planets 
through nancy i had a direct line to the president said 
ms quigley in her memoirs what does joan say 
said donald regan the fired presidential aide who first 
revealed in his memoirs for the record that mrs reagan was 
consulting an astrologer virtually every major move and decision 
the reagans made during my time as white house chief of staff was 
cleared in advance with a woman in san francisco who drew up 
horoscopes to make certain that the planets were in a favorable 
alignment for the enterprise 
here are excepts from the three books on the question of ms 
quigleys role

nancy reagan seemed to have absolute faith in the clairvoyant 
powers of this woman who had predicted that something bad was 
going to happen to the president shortly before he was wounded in 
an assassination attempt in 1981 
there was no choice but to humor the first lady in this 
matter but the presidents schedule is the single most potent tool 
in the white house because it determines what the most powerful 
man in the world is going to do and when he is going to do it by 
humoring mrs reagan we gave her this tool or more accurately 
gave it to an unknown woman in san francisco who believed that the 
zodiac controls events and human behavior and that she could read 
the secrets of the future in the movements of the planets

my relationship with joan quigley began as a crutch one of 
several ways i tried to alleviate my anxiety about ronnie after 
the march 30 1981 attempt on his life within a year or two it 
had become a habit something i relied on a little less but didnt 
see the need to change 
i want to state one thing again and unequivocally joans 
recommendations had nothing to do with policy or politics ever 
her advice was confined to timing to ronnies schedule and to 
what days were good or bad especially with regard to his 
outoftown trips

landings of air force one i picked the time of ronald reagans 
debate with jimmy carter and the two debates with walter mondale 
all extended trips abroad as well as the shorter trips and oneday 
excursions the announcement that reagan would run for a second 
term briefings for all the summits except moscow although i

ronnies evil empire attitude has to go before he can meet 
with mikhail gorbachev at geneva i told her gorbachevs 
aquarian planet is in such harmony with ronnies youll see i

gorbachev meet theyll get along famously better than you can

some folks in this hardluck railroad town 
dont think much of the walkout by west virginias teachers 
people around here cant really relate to the supposed plight 
of a person making 22000 a year if youre making that much 
youre well above the average person around here and thats for 
nine months work said thomas m mason owner of a local 
remodeling business 
this mountain town of about 6000 about 110 miles southeast of 
pittsburgh has seen union and confederate raiders fighting over 
its once vital rail hub but the railroad jobs are all but gone 
shuttered businesses line main street and coal does little to spark 
a sputtering economy 
now graftons schools the towns largest employer are idle 
teachers here were among the first to walk out a week ago when 
thousands of west virginias educators struck over the states 
refusal to grant pay raises 
only south dakota and arkansas pay teachers less than west 
virginia according to the national education association 
teachers in 47 of the states 55 counties remained on strike 
thursday despite threats by state officials that they would be 
fired if they dont return to work 
mason said he doesnt think taylor countys 205 teachers have 
much to complain about in an area where unemployment reached 11 
percent two months ago and the average salary was 8650 in 1987 
some might think theyre doing pretty good mason said 
annual salaries in the district range from 16109 for a 
starting teacher with a bachelors degree to 29123 for a teacher 
with 20 years experience a masters degree plus 30 additional 
credits according to the west virginia education association 
enrollment in the district has dropped 23 percent since 1980 
the average man on the street is going to have a bluecollar 
job around here said guy linda moyer a speech pathologist for 
the school district this strike is about people who have 
invested thousands of dollars in an education in order to get their 
jobs 
we have different aspirations and goals than they have ms 
moyer said thats not to say ours are any better just 
different 
the people are pretty much divided said ln thorp 68 as 
he sopped up a breakfast of biscuits and gravy at a local diner 
theres a lot of people who are against the strike and 
anything they think is going to cost them even 10 cents more on 
their tax bill but i think theres more people for the teachers 
than against them said thorp who retired from csx corp after 
40 years as a freight car inspector 
television game shows and afternoons at the playground have 
replaced reading writing and arithmetic for debra lyons 
7yearold twins 
theyre driving me crazy right up the wall arent they ever 
going to go back to school ive had it mrs lyons said as she 
separated her roughhousing firstgraders jason and jessica 
some enterprising pupils are making a few dollars during the 
strike 
seventhgrader andi peters 13 is earning 15 a day watching 
two children 
im going on a trip to the virgin islands this summer and this 
will help pay for it she said its fun but i wish the 
teachers would go back theyre taking our education away they 
should find another way to get what they want 
in charleston 115 miles southwest the focus of the strike 
moved from the governors office and picket lines to the courts as 
state officials sought judges orders to force teachers back to 
work 
schoolchildren were off thursday and today after state school 
superintendent hank marockie called a statewide cooling off 
period in the strike

an astrologer claims she was responsible 
for revising ronald reagans attitude toward the soviet union and 
timing everything from press conferences to the former presidents 
cancer surgery 
ronnies evil empire attitude has to go before he can meet 
with mikhail gorbachev at geneva joan quigley nancy reagans 
astrologer for seven years claims to have advised the former first 
lady gorbachevs aquarian planet is in such harmony with 
ronnies youll see theyll share a vision 
ms quigley also claims in a new book released thursday that she 
changed mrs reagans image encouraging her to stop talking about 
fashion and devote herself to the antidrug campaign 
she said in an interview wednesday that former white house chief 
of staff donald regans book for the record which disclosed 
mrs reagans consultations with an astrologer was the first 
part of the trilogy and nancys book my turn tried to sweep 
it all under the carpet 
in her book ms quigley says my turn reads like fiction 
and much of it is evasive 
mrs reagan wrote that while ms quigley was helpful and 
comforting a kind of therapist she had influence solely on 
reagans schedule 
asked for a comment on quigleys book a spokesman for the 
reagans in los angeles mark weinberg said we will not have 
anything to add to what is in mrs reagans book 
ms quigley said in her new book that she had a direct line to 
the former president through his wife 
i was responsible for timing all press conferences most 
speeches the state of the union addresses the takeoffs and 
landings of air force one she wrote in what does joan say 
i timed congressional armtwisting the second inaugural oath 
of office the announcement of anthony kennedys supreme court 
nomination i delayed president reagans operation for cancer from 
july 10 1985 to july 13 and chose the time for nancys 
mastectomy 
ms quigley said that before reagans first summit with soviet 
leader gorbachev she worked three hours to persuade mrs reagan 
that her husband could trust him she said she battled her to the 
mat to get reagans view of gorbachev changed 
gorbachevs chart leads me to believe that he is different 
from past soviet leaders ms quigley said she told mrs reagan 
the placement of his ruler mercury in the tenth house of power 
and position convinces me that gorbachev came to power not only 
because he had been favored by powerful older men but also because 
of his high degree of intelligence 
after working for free for the reagans during the first 
presidential campaign quigley said she agreed in 1981 to help mrs 
reagan improve her public image and was paid each month through a 
friend 
quigley writes that she advised mrs reagan to focus on her two 
pet programs drug rehabilitation and foster grandparents and to 
play down all her privileged social connections 
at the end of the tutoring though when mrs reagan couldnt 
give a reporter an example of something she had found particularly 
touching in the course of her antidrug work quigley concludes 
my pupil was a consummate actress but i couldnt help feeling 
that while she had worked hard and studied diligently she had 
never really understood the reason for taking the course

president bush says he remains generally 
optimistic about the us economy but there are some signs that 
worry me 
among other problems the nations bulging deficit is making it 
impossible to give new democracies in eastern europe and central 
america the aid they deserve bush said 
i sometimes wish as president that there were more funds 
readily available read that less of a deficit he told a group 
of newspaper executives on thursday 
theres a great deal that we have to do to keep this expansion 
going bush said the economy at this moment isnt as robust as 
id like to see it 
he asserted that congressional approval of his proposals for a 
lower capital gains tax and educational reforms would help make the 
nation more competitive aboard 
if were successful then were going to have not a peace 
dividend but a growth dividend bush told members of the national 
newspaper association 
the president rejected the notion that america was in decline 
we still have the highest standard of living in the world 
he said so i am not that pessimistic and yet i dont want to 
stand here with some pollyannnish attitude about the economy there 
are some signs that worry me 
economic growth as measured by the gross national product 
slumped to an anemic 09 percent in the final three months of 1989 
and many economists also are projecting a slow first quarter of 
1990 american manufacturing has been in the doldrums for months 
appearing before the congressional joint economic committee on 
thursday white house budget director richard darman said the 
economys poor performance in the final quarter of 1989 would add 
62 billion to the projected budget deficit for next year 
the added red ink would be in the 12 billion to 15 billion 
range if the economy rebounds only gradually he said 
before the new economic performance figures became available 
the administration had estimated that the shortfall for fiscal 1991 
which begins next oct 1 would be 1005 billion 
bush in a speech earlier thursday to the national association 
of manufacturers said our economy is not perfect and i dont 
want to paint an unrealistic picture 
but he added that democratic upheavals in the world present the 
opportunity for us companies to capture new markets changes in 
eastern europe and central america mark the triumph not only of 
free ideas but also of free markets he said 
on other subjects in his meeting with newspaper executives bush 
praised soviet president mikhail s gorbachev as a reasonable 
man and said he was not concerned because gorbachevs powers have 
been strengthened by the soviet parliament he said there was 
much less of a danger today from the kremlin than in the past 
expressed irritation with american volunteers in nicaragua who 
he said were intent on keeping the outgoing leftist government in 
power now theyre picketing in front of the us embassy 
because in their view the wrong people won the election 
said that last weeks speculation that an american hostage in 
lebanon might be released frankly confused me because there are 
no negotiations going on involving the us government i wish i 
could tell you that there was a serious immediate effort that 
would pay off but that isnt the case he said 
expressed opposition to suggestions that us aid be cut to 
israel and egypt to make money available for emerging democracies 
in eastern europe i dont want to suggest cutting to good 
friends the president said adding that he would like greater 
flexibility to disburse foreign aid 
bush was not asked about a fire that caused extensive damage at 
a libyan plant the united states suspects of making chemical 
weapons however he answered with a firm no earlier thursday 
when asked at a picturetaking session in the capitol if there was 
any us involvement in the libyan fire 
administration officials said the plant had been knocked out of 
commission by a serious fire we dont have any idea who did 
it said presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater

a peace corps official says the agency may 
send volunteers to panama to help that country rebuild from the 
december us invasion and nearly three years of economic sanctions 
discussions are going on with the panama government jody 
olsen chief of staff for the agency said thursday night 
we are assessing the possibility of sending in a few 
volunteers to work in rural areas with other aid specialists as 
part of an overall panama aid package she said 
a peace corps team will visit panama next week to study 
logistics of how many volunteers could be used where they might 
work and what they might do said olsen 
the bush administration has asked congress for 500 million in 
aid for panama this fiscal year and 300 million for nicaragua two 
countries in central america making the transition to democracy 
the december us invasion that overthrew gen manuel antonio 
noriega in panama was succeeded by the usbacked administration 
of guillermo endara which has expressed interest in peace corps 
volunteers 
but the sandinista government defeated in the feb 25 elections 
is not scheduled to leave office under april 25 and ms olsen said 
it was too early to tell whether nicaragua would seek peace 
corps detachments 
olsen was responding to questions about a remark made by 
president bush earlier in the day when asked if he would send peace 
corps teams to see that aid gets to the poor villagers of those 
countries 
yes bush answered im strongly in favor of the peace 
corps ive talked to our peace corps director its not you 
know its not quite right there 
the president then complained about americans who have gone to 
nicaragua allegedly to help the people of nicaragua and now 
theyre picketing in front of the us embassy because in their 
view the wrong people won the election 
they ought to stay down there if theyre acting in this 
philanthropic way and try to help as the peace corps does the 
president said his remarks never returned to plans for the peace 
corps 
dennis marker director of a churchbased group known as witness 
for peace said bush apparently was talking about his organization 
we have had us citizens demonstrating in front of the 
embassy since 1983 marker said the reason people are 
demonstrating is not because of who won the election we are 
demonstrating against continued us interference in nicaragua

a steady decline in tuberculosis has all but 
stopped amid the continuing threat of tb for the aidsinfected 
federal health researchers say 
in 1988 the last year for which complete statistics are 
available 22436 us tuberculosis cases were reported down 04 
percent from 1987 the national centers for disease control 
reported thursday that slight drop compares with an average annual 
decrease of 67 percent from 1981 to 1984 
one reason for the slowing of progress in wiping out tb is the 
increasing occurrence of tb in persons infected with hiv the 
virus that causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome the cdc said 
aids leaves the body susceptible to a number of serious 
illnesses including tb and studies have found that about 4 
percent of aids patients also are listed as tb patients 
if the 67 percent average annual decline had kept up through 
the late 1980s an estimated 14768 fewer tb cases would have been 
expected during 19851988 the cdc said in its weekly report 
tuberculosis was down 87 percent among whites in 1988 as 
compared with 1985 but up 91 percent among blacks and 176 
percent among hispanics two groups with proportionately higher 
rates of aids cases 
in 1988 7720 new tuberculosis cases were reported in whites 
compared with 8280 in blacks and 3637 in hispanics the tb rate 
among blacks was 283 per 100000 compared with 183 for hispanics 
and 41 for whites another 2371 tb cases were reported among 
asians and pacific islanders in the united states for a rate of 
363 per 100000 
the cdc estimates that 10 million americans are infected with 
the bacteria that cause tuberculosis an infection of the lungs 
the vast majority will never become ill 
but the number of new cases is only part of the toll from 
tuberculosis the cdc said in 1987 more than 115000 americans 
were under tb treatment 20000 new patients plus 95000 people 
labeled highrisk and on preventive therapy 
tuberculosis which is curable in most cases with drug 
treatment killed 1755 americans in 1987

teams of workers armed with gaspowered 
weed cutters are destroying clandestine plots of coca seedlings 
reflecting a policy change by peru following the drug summit in 
colombia last month 
peruvian police and us antidrug agents are supervising the 
smallscale operations in the cocarich upper huallaga valley 
targeting isolated fields of young plants before they can be 
transplanted to larger areas 
the move to destroy the coca fields marks a renewal of a 
government policy suspended more than a year ago an alarming 
increase in acres planted has prompted the government to renew the 
eradication program according to us embassy spokesman gene 
bigler 
the peruvian government has asked us for our support in 
eradication and of course were delighted bigler said 
president alan garcia had temporarily halted joint antidrug 
operations and threatened to boycott the february drug meeting with 
president bush and the leaders of colombia and bolivia because of 
the us invasion of panama in december he later attended 
the eradication teams operate out of the usbuilt base at 
santa lucia 265 miles northeast of lima in the upper huallaga 
valley the worlds richest source of coca leaf 
about 350 eradication workers are stationed in the area along 
with about 120 peruvian police and 30 to 40 us drug agents 
contracted american helicopter pilots and mechanics 
ten uh1 helicopters on loan from the state department ferry the 
workers from the base to clandestine seedling plots hidden under 
the dense jungle canopy throughout the valley 
despite a drastic drop in price over the last six months for 
peruvian coca leaf the raw material for cocaine peruvians 
continue to move into the valley hoping to get rich off the cocaine 
trade 
theyre cutting down all the trees said gen juan zarate 
head of perus drug police from the back seat of a huey helicopter 
cutting through the heavy jungle air 500 feet above the valley 
floor 
zarate pointed out new coca plantations carved out of the jungle 
hillsides creating a haphazard patchwork of emerald hues up and 
down the valley 
theres going to be so much environmental damage he said 
zarate was taking reporters to visit a herbicide test site 
where government scientists were studying the environmental effects 
of applying the herbicide spike to illegal coca fields 
spike is one of a number of eradication methods under study 
us officials favor its use saying testing so far indicate it 
does not cause ecological damage but the peruvian government has 
said more tests need to be done before it would consider using the 
chemical 
the cartagena accord signed during the summit by president bush 
garcia and the presidents of bolivia and colombia linked 
eradication to development aid and the opening of us markets to 
crops such as coffee cocoa and palm oil to give the coca growers 
alternative means of support 
however the bush administration has said it is reluctant to 
fund development projects with perus 3000 percent inflation and a 
growing leftist insurgency by maoist shining path guerrillas who 
operate freely in much of the valley 
since september the police have conducted raids against 
airstrips and jungle laboratories used by smugglers to transform 
the leaves into a semirefined paste and ship it to colombia where 
it is made into cocaine 
the police have destroyed about 125 labs since september 
according to an embassy official 
but despite interdiction efforts in peru and colombia where 
authorities have confiscated hundreds of airplanes used by the

estate executive to serve on the board overseeing the savings and 
loan bailout 
robert c larson chief executive officer of the taubman company 
in bloomfield hills mich was named thursday to one of two vacant 
seats on the fivemember resolution trust corp oversight board 
treasury secretary nicholas f brady who heads the board said 
he expects the white house to announce the fifth member next week 
federal reserve chairman alan greenspan and housing secretary jack 
kemp also are members 
the board sets policy and controls the purse strings of the 
bailout agency created last august 
congressional democrats have complained that bush waited until 
after most of the bailout policies were in place before naming the 
public members of the board who were supposed to balance the 
influence of the government officials 
brady said the appointments were slow because the administration 
was looking for people experienced in real estate disposal that 
complicated clearance checks for possible conflicts of interest he

lodging expenses for healthrelated travel are 
taxdeductible only if they are needed to obtain a physicians 
care the us tax court has ruled 
merely traveling on a doctors recommendation to a more 
favorable climate to alleviate a specific ailment is not enough to 
justify a deduction the court held instead the travel must be 
essential to care provided by a doctor in a hospital or similar 
facility 
the ruling earlier this week was the first time the court had 
considered a 1984 law that in certain situations allows lodging 
costs to be included in deductible medical expenses 
the court case involved earlene polyak of trenton mich who 
suffered from chronic heart artery and lung problems following 
her doctors advice she began spending winters in florida living 
in a travel trailer while her husband stayed at their home in 
michigan 
her physicians did not refer mrs polyak to any doctors in 
florida and she visited a doctor only twice during her five months 
there 
she and her husband claimed a medical deduction for 1426 they 
spent to rent a campground lot for the trailer but were turned down 
by the internal revenue service 
the new law was written to benefit people who must travel away 
from home because specialized care is not available locally or in 
the case of some chemotherapy treatment for cancer for example 
may be obtained on an outpatient basis at a considerably lower cost

hong kong will move a group of vietnamese boat 
people to a holding center in the philippines to help ease 
congestion at camps in the british colony a government official 
said today 
britain and the philippines agreed on the relocating the 
vietnamese under an international plan financed by britain and 
other countries said mike hanson hong kong refugee coordinator 
he said britain has pledged 487 million to the plan 
we hope the first small group can go by the end of this 
month hanson said 
the plan is a new effort to relieve congestion in the squalid 
refugee camps in the british colony where clashes have broken out 
with authorities and between rival groups of vietnamese 
in december hong kong forcibly returned 51 vietnamese to their 
communist homeland under a plan that provoked sharp criticism from 
the united states and human rights organizations the program was 
then put on hold 
the philippine camp at morong about 50 miles west of manila is 
operated by the un high commission for refugees for vietnamese 
for boat people who have been classified as refugees and have been 
accepted for resettlement in third countries 
there are about 55000 vietnamese boat people in hong kong and 
authorities fear their numbers will increase this summer when 
vietnamese have normally fled their communist homeland for other 
countries 
of the vietnamese in hong kong about 44000 arrived after june 
1988 when hong kong began to classify arriving boat people as 
illegal immigrants unless they can prove they face political 
persecution in vietnam 
those classified as illegal immigrants can be repatriated back 
to vietnam 
the remaining 11000 vietnamese in hong kong arrived either 
before the cutoff date or have classified as genuine refugees 
entitled to resettlement in other countries 
a hong kong government spokeswomen said refugees at the camp in 
the philippines will be given vocational and language training to

the 198990 flu season could turn out to be the 
worst in five years the national centers for disease control says 
and the dominant strain is one that hits especially hard against 
older people who probably are not vaccinated according to a cdc 
report thursday 
the cdc said the winter flu season has been marked by a flu type 
especially troublesome for older people the type researchers know 
as ah3n2 
in the average influenza season the flu kills about 20000 
americans but in 198485 the last year in which ah3n2 was so 
predominant about 57000 people died 
this year looks to me like the worst year since 8485 said 
dr walter gunn a cdc flu specialist 
the us flu season which peaked in late january and early 
february featured almost exclusively a type ah3n2 flu strain 
dubbed the shanghai flu one of three components in the 
current flu vaccine recommended for people older than 65 or 
patients with ailments such as diabetes or kidney disease 
the recommended flu vaccine is up to 75 percent effective in 
preventing complications and death from flu in older people the 
cdc said in its weekly report 
but a survey of medicare beneficiaries found that only 43 
percent had received flu vaccinations for the 198889 winter flu 
season the cdc reported thursday nine out of 10 who werent 
vaccinated fell into the olderorill group for whom shots are 
recommended 
we still have quite a ways to go in immunizing americans 
against influenza said the cdcs dr mary ann sprauer 
the most commonly cited reason for not being vaccinated 54 
percent considered themselves healthy and not in need of 
vaccination the atlantabased agency reported 
thirty percent cited concerns about side effects from the 
vaccine and 30 percent were concerned about illness associated 
with the shots 
the cdc stressed that the medicare survey is not a 
representative national sample and may not reflect the nations 
older population 
but the findings among medicare participants were somewhat more 
encouraging than previous surveys showing the vaccination rate 
among people over 65 to be 23 to 32 percent 
we took a little heart in the fact that it seemed to be a 
little higher sprauer said but the national goal for the 
nation in 1990 was 60 percent among those recommended for the 
vaccine wed like to see it up there around 60 or 70 percent if 
not higher

in combating cuts in the states education budget 
at the student councils request the school committee voted 
wednesday to exempt the class of 1990 from the annual yearend

children have to worry about things we never had to worry 
about when we were students committee member nancy rubenstein 
said they have to worry about fighting for education 
they deserve it 
not everyone agreed

the government has given final approval 
to the 8 billion atomsmasher expected to shed new light on the 
subatomic particles that are the universes fundamental building 
blocks 
the energy department on thursday approved the siting of the 
54mile ring w henson moore deputy secretary of energy told a 
gathering of more than 600 representatives from government 
industry and science who will build the superconducting super 
collider 
the announcement allows texas to begin a landbuying binge 
outside of dallas with some of the 1 billion it pledged in a 
successful effort to lure the project and enables scientists to 
begin planning construction that could take a decade 
start your engines and start your land buying moore said 
the bush administration decided to support changes that would 
make the super collider more effective and more expensive bringing 
the price tag up from the original estimate of 59 billion 
the unanimous position was to go with the best science 
moore said 
morton meyerson head of the texas national research laboratory 
commission said his agency armed with a 250 million bond issue 
is ready to move now that the site plan finally has been approved 
the big flag goes down meyerson said now we begin land 
acquisition and thats the toughest hardest most intense project 
we have the one that will affect the most people 
hundreds of individual land purchases will have to be negotiated 
in rural ellis county outside of dallas he said 
the ring will be built underground and is intended by its 
backers to be the worlds premier highenergy physics laboratory 
it will hurl streams of protons guided by powerful 
electromagnets through the ring at almost the speed of light until 
they smash together and break up into even smaller particles 
critics of the super collider have complained it will absorb too 
much of the nations scientific funding 
backers say it will increase interest in science 
john toll president of the 77university association contracted 
by the us government to operate the super collider said the 
knowledge generated by the super collider will be shared with 
schools and industries around the world 
he also said the projects mammoth size has already aroused 
curiosity that he hopes will lead more students into scientific 
careers 
the project is expected to spend 370 million annually when 
completed it will create 2500 permanent jobs and 4500 temporary 
construction jobs 
congress approved 225 million in the current fiscal year for 
startup costs and the bush administration which has indicated it 
will spend up to 8 billion on the super collider is asking for 
318 million for the upcoming year

almost onethird of the 44000 women expected 
to die of breast cancer this year could be saved if more doctors 
urged their patients to have mammograms a cancer specialist says 
the whole point of mammography is you can find the breast 
cancer two years before you can feel it cori vanchieri director 
of the national cancer institutes early detection education 
program said thursday 
scientists say if women got mammograms as often as they 
should we would see a 30 percent reduction in the breast cancer 
death rate she said 
only 19 percent of us women are regularly screened for breast 
cancer said dr sandra swain of the lombardi cancer center at 
georgetown university 
the cancer specialists were in new orleans for the american 
college of radiologys 24th national conference on breast cancer 
where findings from numerous studies on breast cancer are being 
presented this week 
mammography xray examination of the breasts is a widely 
accepted and often recommended method of early detection according 
to the american cancer society 
the society recommends a mammogram for women between the ages of 
35 and 39 mammograms combined with a physicians examination every 
one or two years for women between 40 and 49 and annual mammograms 
and exams for women over 50 
but doctors are not recommending mammograms for their patients 
with regularity ms vanchieri said in 1989 37 percent of doctors 
surveyed said they were referring women for screening based on the 
cancer societys guidelines thats up from 11 percent in 1984 but 
still inadequate she said 
doctor referral seemed to be the most important factor for 
getting women to have the checkups according to a recent study 
ms vanchieri said 
eighty percent said they would have gone if a doctor told them 
to she said 
early screening could improve cancer detection rates by 50 
percent said dr daniel kopans an associate professor of 
radiology at harvard university and director of breast imaging at 
massachusetts general hospital in boston 
doctors to a certain extent are at fault for not recommending 
screening he said 
they give a number of reasons for not recommending xray 
screening including cost dispute over the beginning age and 
frequency for testing and a lack of information kopans said 
believe it or not a lot of physicians are just not aware of 
the value of mammography kopans said 
a mammogram costs about 100 but screening is not covered by 
all insurance companies ms vanchieri said twentysix states have 
laws requiring insurance coverage for such checkups she said 
the big issue for them doctors is whether patients can 
afford it ms vanchieri said but women say cost is not a 
primary concern for them 
medical groups are working with radiologists and insurance 
companies to increase coverage and reduce expenses ms vanchieri 
said

former president jimmy carter today said 
chances seem better than ever for the release of foreign hostages 
in lebanon and that president hafez assad repeated vows to help win 
their freedom 
carter made the comments to a news conference in the syrian 
capital on the fifth anniversary of the kidnapping in west beirut 
of american reporter terry anderson the longestheld of the 18 
westerners missing in lebanon 
my own conviction is that more opportunities exist now for his 
release than ever before carter said 
he spoke shortly before he left syria for jordan the third leg 
of a tour that carried him earlier to egypt and will later take him 
to israel 
carter said he did not know if there were any secret us 
dealings on the matter but noted there are statements being made 
from tehran that to me are encouraging 
i think now theres a growing desire on the part of the 
iranian government and the us government to work out the problems 
between us he said theres no doubt that iran has influence 
on those holding the hostages although not complete control 
recent newspaper articles in iran had suggested the hostages 
should be freed sheik mohammad hussein fadlallah spiritual guide 
of lebanons hezbollah or party of god said in a sermon last 
month that a humanitarian means of freeing the hostages must be 
found 
carter said the saudi arabianbrokered taif accords for peace in 
lebanon were a very constructive factor in the release of the 
hostaeveral powerful factions in lebanon 
when its no longer necessary for lebanon to be fragmented 
with different militia groups jealously guarding their weapons and 
their prerogatives then i think its very likely the hostages will 
be released carter said 
the tour sponsored by the cater center of emory university in 
atlanta is his fourth visit to the region since he left office in 
1981 
carter said he discussed the hostage issue during a meeting of 
several hours with assad on thursday 
he said assad and other syrian officials are using their good 
offices they have assured me in every way possible to both locate 
the hostages and convince those who might be holding them they 
should be protected and released 
although syria has about 40000 troops in lebanon under an arab 
league peacekeeping mandate it has little influence with the 
iranianallied groups believed to be holding the hostages 
carter said he supported the right of soviet jews to emigrate 
freely to israel a position at odds with that of syria but said 
he agreed with president bush that they should note allowed to 
settle in the occupied west bank gaza strip golan heights or east 
jerusalem territories captured in the 1967 middle east war

the cabinet resigned today to give 
president roh taewoo a free hand to reorganize the government 
following the merger of his party with two of the three main 
opposition groups 
government officials said roh is expected to announce a new 
cabinet on saturday after consultations with his two fellow 
governing party leaders kim youngsam and kim jongpil 
a cabinet change has long been anticipated after roh merged his 
governing party with two centrist opposition groups led by the two 
kims to form a giant conservative party last month 
government officials have indicated a sweeping cabinet change 
would be needed to inject fresh air into national politics 
following the merger 
they had said a change could be made after the national assembly 
ended a special session today 
local newspapers quoting unidentified government sources 
reported the reorganization would probably affect nearly twothirds 
of the 22member cabinet 
the national news agency yonhap said with up to 18 posts 
likely to be affected the change would be the largest since roh 
took office in the spring of 1988 the previous shakeup in december 
1988 affected 16 posts 
almost all newspapers reported roh would retain kang younghoon 
as prime minister but replace deputy premiereconomic planning 
minister cho soon and most of other economic members 
cho and his economic team have been criticized for a series of 
policy failures that aggravated land speculation increased 
inflation and slowed exports 
exports in the first two months of this year decreased 25 
percent to 87 billion from a year ago 
roh a former army general was elected president in december 
1987 following a split of two opposition parties he replaced chun 
doohwan who called the vote following mass demonstrations to 
demand democratic reforms and an end to autocratic rule

a rare blood disorder linked to the recalled 
dietary supplement ltryptophan may be due to a natural chemical 
breakdown in the body rather than contamination researchers said 
the overthecounter healthfood supplement used to treat 
sleeplessness depression and other problems was pulled from store 
shelves last year after hundreds of people using it fell ill of 
eosinophiliamyalgia syndrome 
no contaminant has been found and natural chemical processes in 
the body during the breakdown of ltryptophan could be behind the 
painful blood disorder said the researchers at georgetown 
university medical center 
arguing against the contamination theory is that in spite of 
the fact that people have been searching for the contaminant it 
hasnt been identified said dr paul katz chief rheumatologist 
at georgetown 
also the ltryptophan implicated has been traced to three 
different manufacturers he said thursday from washington that 
argues a little bit against there being a commonsource 
contaminant 
ltryptophan is an amino acid a building block of protein 
found in many foods 
fourteen people who took ltryptophan have died in recent months 
and more than 1200 others have fallen ill with 
eosinophiliamyalgia which in milder cases causes aches rashes 
and fever 
a study of the problem by the georgetown researchers was 
published in todays journal of the american medical association 
katz and his colleagues believe ltryptophan supplements under 
certain conditions contribute to a buildup of serotonin a 
naturally occurring substance that helps nerves communicate with 
each other in the brain 
abnormally high levels of serotonin have been shown or suggested 
as factors in disorders similar to eosinophiliamyalgia syndrome 
the researchers said serotonin is a byproduct of the breakdown of 
ltryptophan 
katz said when you get away from the contamination theory 
which is still the leading theory people who develop this 
syndrome may have some intrinsic abnormality of ltryptophan 
metabolism 
the blood disorder may have occurred often in the past and 
diagnosed as something else katz said 
the number of people who have gotten this syndrome is 
relatively small compared to the number of people who take it 
ltryptophan katz said adding he could not estimate how many 
people have taken ltryptophan supplements sold for years over the 
counter 
the food and drug administration on nov 17 requested a 
voluntary recall of ltryptophan supplements and five days later 
extended the recall to include a ban on imports 
fda spokesman chris lecos said thurday that federal researchers 
have analyzed hundreds of ltryptophan samples including some from 
people who fell ill and have failed to identify a specific 
chemical or microbial contaminant responsible for the outbreak 
he added however that the research didnt change the agencys 
advice against taking ltryptophan

hardliners today launched efforts to overthrow 
caretaker prime minister yitzhak shamir as leader of the rightwing 
likud bloc after a parliamentary noconfidence vote toppled his 
governing coalition 
the yediot ahronot daily said shamir was considering retirement 
from political life following thursdays defeat another newspaper 
maariv quoted the premier as saying i see no reason to resign 
israel radio said likud leaders met in shamirs office this 
morning for a discussion of the partys future 
sahi alnegbi a likud member of parliament said on israel 
radio mr shamir will have to resign eventually because he 
cannot form a narrow government 
when the time comes he will have to realize he has to pass 
the leadership to someone else 
he said the likely candidates to succeed shamir are former trade 
minister ariel sharon foreign minister moshe arens and david levy 
the housing minister and deputy prime minister 
senior shamir aides were not immediately available for comment 
labor party leader shimon peres meanwhile launched contacts to 
form a new government hoping to cash in on the support from a 
swing religious party that yielded the 6055 victory against shamir 
it was the first time an israeli premier was formally ousted by 
a noconfidence motion past prime ministers have resigned before a 
vote was held when they appeared sure of losing 
shamir remains caretaker prime minister until a new government 
is formed a process that could take months 
the dispute that brought down shamirs government centered on 
us proposals for middle east peace that included involving east 
jerusalem arabs and palestinians deported by israel in peace talks 
labor supported the moves but likud objected that including 
east jerusalem arabs could call into question israels control of 
jerusalem and deportees could indirectly involve the palestine 
liberation organization in the process 
peres a leftofcenter politician and former premier appeared 
to have the best chances of being asked to form a new government 
israeli reports said today 
but the complexities of reconciling demands of the religious 
parties and his allies in leftwing factions could force labor and 
likud reluctantly into a broadbased government or bring about 
early national elections 
according to maariv and the hadashot daily peres has offered 
the utraorthodox shas party the important finance ministry in a 
new government five of six shas leaders helped labor thursday by 
being absent from voting 
another wouldbe labor ally is the ultraorthodox agudat israel 
faction which voted against likud hadashot said this party may be 
assigned the housing and welfare ministries 
the two religious parties hold a critical 11 seats in the 
120member parliament which when added to 15 held by arab and 
leftwing factions would give the 39member labor a majority of 65 
likud holds 40 seats the threatened end of its 13year 
dominance in government touched off new infighting in the fractious 
party with supporters of levy urging the removal of the 
74yearold shamir as party chairman 
the reality shows that as long as we dont unite around one 
person it will be fateful for likud levy supporter and 
legislator reuven rivlin said on the radio today we have to 
unite around one person who can lead us to forming a government 
rivlin said levy supporters met thursday night after the vote 
but no decisions were made levy has been an ally of sharon the 
retired general who quit in february to protest the governments 
peace policies 
shamir supporter and minister of arab affairs ehud olmert also 
hinted there was talk of shamir stepping down 
what is in the realm of the possible is difficult to 
predictolmert said concerning yitzhak shamir i think thats 
something he must decide and i think we will speak about it in the 
next couple of days 
peres told reporters he was confident labor would lead the next 
government and would move toward peace 
palestinians have waged a 27monthold uprising against israeli 
rule of the occupied west bank and gaza strip at least 663 
palestinians have been killed by israeli soldiers or civilians in 
the revolt fortythree israelis also have been slain

jail officials cannot deny a female inmate 
visits with her lesbian lover merely because of her homosexuality 
a federal judge ruled 
the ruling from us district judge d brooks smith came on a 
lawsuit filed by the american civil liberties union on behalf of 
the prisoner identified only as jane doe 
the woman in blair county prison since may claimed she was 
denied visits with her lover even though jailhouse visits were 
permitted between heterosexual inmates and their spouses and lovers 
smith ruled wednesday that the ban was unconstitutional he 
cited a 1980 pennsylvania supreme court decision that the state 
cannot control the conduct of consenting adults in private marion 
damick a spokeswoman for the aclus pittsburgh chapter said 
thursday 
all visits at the jail in hollidaysburg take place in a room 
where prisoners and guests are separated by windows 
the lawsuit named warden gary sparks and the blair county prison 
board as codefendants during testimony before smith in december 
sparks defended the decision to prohibit the visits saying a 
prisoner identified as a homosexual could become the target of 
assaults and abuse by other inmates 
if the prison board files an appeal visits between the inmate 
and her lover would not be permitted until an appeals court rules

have killed wounded or captured more than 13000 government troops 
half of them since sunday and damaged several aircraft and 
tanks during an offensive

radio broadcast that 6500 of the casualties were inflicted between 
sunday and wednesday

been put out of action and the dergue has lost three burnt fighter 
planes eight tanks and four antiaircraft carrier vehicles the 
broadcast said

but ethiopias air force flies sovietmade mig17s 21s and 23s 
in the last 20 days the dergue has lost more than 13500 
soldiers as dead wounded and aptured the broadcast said

acknowledged that claim but admits the port has been closed by 
fighting it says continues in and around the city it has 
acknowledged many casualties but has not given a figure 
the government is also fighting a second but smaller force the 
tigre peoples liberation front the tigreans have been fighting 
for 14 yeears and virtually control eritreas southern neighbor 
tigre province 
the tigreans seek mengistus ouster and the establishment of a 
government patterned after that of albania the last hardline

a dangerous game called elevator 
surfing blamed in the death of a college freshman has been a 
problem for years in highrise buildings officials say 
also called elevator action or piloting an elevator the 
hazardous sport involves climbing atop elevator cars either 
through trapdoors in the roof or by jamming doors open and riding 
on the roofs 
weve taken it terribly seriously weve been fighting it for 
a long time said val coleman public information director for 
the new york city housing authority 
coleman worked on a recently released cautionary videotape on 
the issue called children are too young to die there have been 
10 deaths and more than 50 injuries reported in new york during the 
past five years he said 
at the otis elevator co the largest elevator manufacturer in 
the united states officials have been concerned about the 
dangerous game for some time said michael jordanreilly spokesman 
for the hartford connbased company 
this is one of our major concerns he said 
susan beckett a student at the university of massachusetts 
told the campus newspaper the collegian that students ride atop 
elevators usually on the weekends when people are drunk 
at ms becketts school 18yearold joel mangion of newton was 
found dead sunday at the bottom of an elevator shaft friends said 
he had been jumping from one car to another in the double shaft 
about a year ago a student suffered serious injuries after 
falling 30 feet in an elevator shaft university officials said in 
the early 1970s a student died after riding in a chair tied to the 
bottom of an elevator car 
joseph zannini executive director of housing at the university 
said he has heard of the game occasionally during his 25 years in 
college administration 
theres so many unfortunate ways that young people sometimes 
lose their lives because they just dont think he said 
jordanreilly said the problem has probably existed as long as 
there have been elevators and as long as there have been people who 
want to try something dangerous 
in bridgeport conn police and firefighters spent two tense 
hours in january rescuing a 13yearold girl who was wedged between 
an elevator car and the shaft after she slipped and fell off the 
roof of the car in a public housing shelter police said the girl 
and her sister were playing on top of the elevator 
donald a robinson director of environmental health and safety 
for the massachusetts school said officials are looking for new 
ways to discourage elevator surfing 
the message needs to be made very clear how elevators should 
be used and not misused and to really emphasize the obvious 
significant consequences he said

contamination received 16 million of a 78 million court 
settlement for medical monitoring

military police battled opposition leaders 
in the gardens of the presidential compound today broke up a 
planned sitin and dragged the politicians away 
the officials of the democratic progressive party had demanded 
to see president lee tenghui but presidential aides said lee was 
in a meeting and could not meet them 
todays clash with police was the latest since tuesday by 
opposition supporters who have protested a proposal to strengthen 
the national assembly the opposition fears the assembly dominated 
by aging rightwing chinese nationalists who have ruled taiwan 
since 1949 will hinder democratic reforms 
chang chunhung the opposition partys secretarygeneral said 
the party wanted to meet lee because they were concerned the 
assembly taiwans electoral college would pass the proposal to 
meet annually to review bills passed by the legislative yuan 
the assembly now meets every six years primarily to elect 
taiwans president there are fears the proposed legislation will 
expand the national assemblys powers and hinder future democratic 
reforms in taiwan 
on thursday the legislative yuan passed a resolution 
threatening to freeze approval of the national assemblys budget if 
the proposed legislation is passed 
witnesses said the opposition leaders were angered when about 
100 police surrounded them and forced them to leave the 
presidential office building through a side gate rather than the 
main gate 
as citizens we only wanted to leave decently from the front 
gate said party chairman huang hsinchien 62 
the opposition leaders then tried to stage a sitin in the 
presidential office gardens but were eventually dragged away by 
police 
the democratic progressive party leaders told reporters they 
were kicked and clubbed by police police said they were the ones 
who were attacked but neither group reported any serious injuries 
the 752seat national assembly is dominated by elderly deputies 
most of them members of the governing nationalist party who were 
elected on the chinese mainland before 1949 when the nationalists 
lost a civil war and fled to taiwan 
the aged politicians have been frozen in office to support a 
nationalist claim to be chinas legitimate government they have 
rejected demands they retire 
all 11 democratic progressive party deputies in the national 
assembly have been barred from taking their seats since tuesday for 
refusing to pledge allegiance to the republic of china the name 
under which the nationalists founded their nation in 1911 
they have instead pledged their allegiance to the people of 
taiwan the democratic progressive party taiwans main opposition 
group was formed three years ago and most of its members are 
native taiwanese 
the party claims its 11 delegates have been barred to allow the 
aged lawmakers to ram through the controversial legislation and 
other bills including one that would allow the aged assemblymen to 
decide on their retirement 
the aged lawmakers also have been accused of using political 
blackmail over president lee because they dominate the national 
assembly which will elect taiwans next president march 21 
lee 67 is the sole candidate for the post but he angered the 
aged assemblymen earlier by rejecting their choice of chiang wego 
the sole surviving son of nationalist leader chiang kaishek to be 
his running mate 
lee became the first native taiwanese to head the nationalist 
government in 1988 when he was elevated from the vice presidency 
following the death of president chiang chingkuo

britains ambassador to iraq returned to london 
today after prime minister margaret thatcher recalled him to 
protest the baghdad governments execution of a londonbased 
reporter accused of spying 
while the thatcher government stopped short of imposing economic 
sanctions opposition lawmakers called for sanctions and an arms 
embargo to protest the hanging of farzad bazoft 31 who iraq said 
was spying for britain and israel 
mrs thatcher recalled ambassador harold walker and ordered the 
expulsion of six iraqi military trainees from britain 
walker arrived in london this morning and said relations with 
iraq had suffered a terrible blow in the shortterm but that 
the longterm damage depends more on the iraqis than ourselves 
the british government also announced a freeze on visits by 
government ministers to iraq and canceled a trade mission 
but it did not break diplomatic relations or impose economic 
sanctions on iraq britain has nearly a 500 million trade surplus 
with iraq 
britains expulsion order against the iraqi military trainees 
does not affect about 1000 other iraqi students in britain 
a group of opposition labor party lawmakers introduced a motion 
in the house of commons calling on britain and the european 
community to impose economic sanctions and an arms embargo on iraq 
until the respect for human rights in that country has reached an 
acceptable standard 
such motions allow lawmakers to go on record with an opinion no 
vote will be taken on the proposal unless it is presented as 
legislation 
governmentrun newspapers in iraq today reported that 
authorities plan a mass demonstration in baghdad on saturday to 
protest the british measures 
iraq will not bow to any form of pressure or extortion and 
will pay no attention to any measures taken by british 
authorities one of the staterun newspapers alshaab wrote 
australias foreign minister gareth evans also called the 
hanging barbaric but today ruled out sanctions on iraq western 
european governments press and human rights groups also denounced 
iraq the united states said it regretted that pleas for clemency 
had gone unheeded 
bazoft an iranianborn reporter who worked for the weekly 
newspaper the observer was arrested while trying to check out 
reports of an explosion at a iraqi military complex bazoft who 
had lived in britain since 1975 was convicted and sentenced by a 
military court saturday after a closed trial 
bazofts colleagues in london insisted he was not a spy just an 
enthusiastic reporter going after a scoop 
arab governments kept silent on the execution even jordans 
king hussein who joined with the palestine liberation organization 
in seeking clemency for bazoft would not condemn iraqi president 
saddam hussein 
in a development late thursday night the british domestic news 
agency press association quoted unidentified british government 
sources as saying bazoft had served a jail term in britain for 
robbery 
the report quoted the sources as saying that bazoft was 
convicted at the crown court at northampton in central england in 
august 1981 of robbing a savings and loan office of 760 
he was reported to have walked into the office with a fake bomb 
and threatened to blow up the building if he was not given cash 
the news agency quoted the sources as saying that he was 
sentenced to 18 months in jail but was freed because of good 
conduct after a year 
the report quoted the sources as saying the judge at the robbery 
trial recommended bazoft should be deported from britain but that 
the recommendation was revoked following bazofts appeal in which 
he said his life would be in danger if he returned

has an unquestioned gift for survival and even the us officials 
who announced the indictments thursday said there was little chance 
he would be apprehended 
the worlds no 1 heroin producer maintains his business in 
southeast asias jungles despite repeated thai and burmese military 
strikes clashes with rival drug armies and rumors of fatal 
illness estimates of the size of his private army run from 4000 
to 16000 fighters 
he once told a journalist that the secret of his health was 
tending his garden patch growing cabbages and carrots 
burmas military government said today that it would cooperate 
in the international war on drugs but western narcotics experts in 
thailand charge that some senior burmese officials are actively 
involved in trafficking 
little reliable information is available on khun sa who is said 
to have been born in 1933 to an ethnic chinese father and a mother 
of burmas shan ethnic minority 
certainly he has been extensively involved since the 1960s in 
the narcotics trade in the golden triangle where the borders of 
thailand laos and burma converge to form a rugged and lawless 
nomans land 
he invited reporters to his lair in early 1987 and threatened 
then to increase opium production in shan state areas under his 
control from 600 to 900 tons that year it was suggested at the 
time he was angered by a justlaunched burmese program of aerial 
spraying of poppy fields with aid from the us government 
khun sa admitted to the reporters that there were many mobile 
heroin refineries in his areas the bangkok post newspaper said it 
quoted him as saying he made about 76 million in 1986 including 
revenue from taxing traders transiting his territory to smuggle 
gems cattle and narcotics 
but khun sa has largely played down the narcotics connection and 
instead insisted he was fighting for greater autonomy for the 
shans just as a dozen other insurgent groups were fighting for the 
rights of other burmese minority groups 
i am a nationalist not a trafficker he told a reporter who 
visited him in 1986 
partly because he masqueraded as a freedom fighter and partly by 
links with corrupt thai officials khun sa built up his operations 
and his shan united army at ban hin taek in the hills of chiang 
mai province in northern thailand bordering burma 
thai forces launched a major strike that killed large numbers of 
his soldiers and drove him into the jungles of shan state in 
january 1982 but he rebuilt the army in a short time and extended 
his influence into new areas of the frontier 
the burmese government said that its troops backed by air 
strikes and artillery overran his shan state headquarters in may 
1984 
but by all accounts the opium warlord remains active and news 
reports have said he has set up refineries in laos in more recent 
years 
the us charges stem from the largest heroin seizure in history 
about 2300 pounds seized in february 1988 in bangkok before they 
were to be shipped to new york 
analysts said there now is little hope of ferreting him out 
since the rangoon government has little authority in shan state 
western officials have charged rangoon authorities with 
profiting from the drug trade rangoons commitment to fighting 
drugs became more suspect after the military seized power in 
september 1988 killing hundreds of prodemocracy demonstrators 
the united states responded by ending aid including the joint drug 
suppression effort

the government said today it would not 
tolerate threats against germans living in libya following a blaze 
at a suspected chemical weapons plant there 
the libyan leader col moammar gadhafi said an investigation 
was under way to determine whether west german intelligence agents 
had anything to do with wednesdays fire at the rabta plant which 
suffered extensive damage 
west germany denied responsibility 
juergen chrobog chief spokesman for the foreign ministry said 
he knew of no specific threats against west germany or its 
citizens but an angry crowd gathered in front of the west germany 
embassy in tripoli on thursday 
we expect there will be restraint from all threats against 
german citizens in libya chrobog said 
the united states and west germany say the plant had begun 
producing poison gas but libya insists the factory was making 
pharmaceuticals west germany eventually acknowledged that west 
german companies helped build the plant 
west germans ard television network has said its cairo office 
received a statement from a previously unknown group of libyan 
dissidents claiming responsibility for the blaze 
the federal government decisively rejects the libyan attempt 
to blame the federal republic of germany for the fire at ratba 
chrobog said today we especially denounce any attempt to rouse 
up libyans against us 
a day earlier a demonstration by libyans briefly blocked access 
to the west german embassy in tripoli the west german foreign 
ministry summoned a highranking libyan diplomat in bonn and 
formally protested the action 
west germany is one of libyas biggest trading partners 
another goverment official in bonn said on condition of 
anonymity that it appeared gadhafi blamed west germany for the fire 
because of bonns efforts to promote an international outcry 
against the plant 
foreign minister hansdietrich genscher had recommended the un 
security council look into any chemical weapons production at the 
rabta plant 
the bonn official said genscher also sent letters to secretary 
of state james a baker iii and to the foreign ministers of france 
and britain pressing for international pressure to close the rabta 
plant 
for more than 14 months the united states has accused libya of 
using the plant to make chemical weapons including mustard and 
nerve gases last week the white house said the plant was 
dangerous and should be shut down the white house refused to rule 
out the possibility of military action to close it 
libya was accused of using chemical weapons in a war against 
chad 
charges by the united states that german companies helped build 
the rabta plant caused a major scandal in west germany a little 
more than a year ago west germany at first denied the us claims 
but later acknowledged them

two former hostages in lebanon today put on 
blindfolds and chained themselves to a tree outside the iranian 
embassy to protest the captivity of terry anderson the us 
journalist abducted five years ago 
jeanpaul kauffmann and roger auque were among 10 french 
hostages released by their captors in lebanon between 1986 and 1988 
the two were silent during their protest but said in a 
statement we have taken this action so people know how terry 
anderson is living at this moment he is chained he wears a 
blindfold over his eyes he must be silent this is how we were 
this is how he is today 
what for us is an unpleasant simulation is for him an ordeal 
that has lasted for five years we are chained up in broad 
daylight while he hasnt seen the sun for years we can hear the 
noises of the city but he lives in a lifeless world his cell its 
windows boarded up is totally sealed 
the statement said the protest was not intended as a hostile 
action against iran but added we know the role played by 
certain iranian officials in our tragedy 
our action is more an appeal for help directed at a country 
which also was responsible for our freedom and which holds the keys 
of freedom for terry and the others 
anderson 42 chief middle east correspondent for the associated 
press was abducted march 16 1985 and is the longestheld of 18 
western hostages 
the hostages are believed held by moslem extremists loyal to 
iran 
after todays hourlong demonstration kauffmann said the tree 
was a special symbol for him 
free men dont pay much attention to trees he said terry 
anderson and the others have not seen a tree for five years 
the lights were on inside the stone fourstory embassy but no 
one was seen at the windows and no one came outside during the 
demonstration the embassy issued a statement later saying iran 
condemned all actions of a nature to put innocent lives in 
peril 
both men said later that the public silence about the western 
hostages in lebanon did not help them 
it is this silence that is prolonging the ordeal of the 
hostages said kauffmann who spent three years in captivity 
before his release in may 1988 he has frequently said that 
continued pressure from the french press during his detention 
helped in his release 
when was the last time anybody talked about terry anderson 
he asked well last year on march 16 his family is talking into 
a vacuum

chinas leading daily newspaper today accused 
western journalists of biased reporting and rejected their 
complaints that they have been followed and harassed by undercover 
police 
the official peoples daily said that some foreign reporters 
distort facts spread rumors maliciously attack the chinese 
government and deliberately jeopardize the security of the 
country 
the allegations came one day after guy dinmore a correspondent 
for the british news agency reuters was called into the foreign 
ministry and told that claims by foreign reporters that they are 
being followed and harassed by chinese police were absolutely 
unfounded 
the newspaper commentary reiterated the foreign ministrys 
position that some journalists who claim to have been spied on were 
oversensitive while others were trying to cover up illegal 
activities 
their purpose is none other than to whip up media opinion so 
as to provide some antichina forces with a stick to beat china and 
try to facilitate their own illegal activities in the future the 
newspaper said 
the government has provided no details of any such illegal 
activities 
correspondents from nearly a dozen countries including the 
united states and the soviet union said they have been followed by 
plainclothes police in recent weeks 
they said police intimidation has interfered with their work and 
that their chinese contacts have been questioned by security 
officials and told not to meet foreign reporters

east germanys communist premier urged 
cautious steps toward reunification but a new survey today 
suggested that nearly half of all east germans favor an immediate 
joining after their first free election sunday 
i am for a united fatherland not for a hasty fatherland 
premier hans modrow told the newspaper berliner zeitung he added 
that unification should be step by step to guarantee europes peace 
a nationwide survey conducted jointly by the central institute 
for youth research and the institute for market research in leipzig 
said that 71 percent of the people are optimistic about their 
future a 10point increase since a similar poll in february 
nearly 50 percent of those questioned wanted immediate 
unification with west germany and 60 percent favored the new state 
to be militarily neutral the institutes said the institutes did 
not say how many people were polled and gave no margin of error 
among those cautious about quick unification were mostly members 
of the communist party according to the poll modrow remains the 
most popular east german politician with an approval rating of 75 
percent 
modrow praised the work of his outgoing caretaker government 
which included 13 other parties and groups he also said the former 
communists expect to be in the opposition and would make 
constructive proposals to serve the people 
modrows communistled government said thursday it has succeeded 
in pulling east germanys economy back from the brink of collapse 
the news about the economy came as candidates for the 24 parties 
and groupings made campaign appearances before sundays election 
for a new 400member parliament about 123 million east germans 
are eligible to vote 
overall the government has been able to lead the german 
democratic republic onto the way out of its crisis government 
spokesman wolfgang meyer told a news conference 
meyer assured east germans that the economy had stabilized and 
there was a light upward trend he offered no examples of which 
sectors of the economy were improving 
to some extent people have become aware of avoiding a 
headoverheels rush to unification he added 
the communists and smaller leftwing parties say citizens could 
lose the social safety net to which they have grown accustomed 
though the west german government provides social benefits 
early this year the economy was reported near collapse sapped 
by warning strikes and a continuing westward exodus of dissatisfied 
east germans mainly workers in their prime nearly half a million 
east germans have fled to their rich western neighbor since last 
year 
but some west german businessmen recently have said the gloom 
may have been exaggerated 
the rush of west german companies into east germany to position 
themselves for eventual unity has led to hope the countrys economy 
will recover but fear that modernization of the obsolete factories 
will cost tens of thousands of jobs 
modrows government which took office in november after the 
ouster of hardline communist erich honecker includes eight 
ministers from prodemocracy organizations 
together they have been asking east germans to slow the rush 
toward unity arguing there are still positive elements in the 
socialist system 
the daily outflow of 2500 east germans has strained relations 
with west germany which has said it will close centers for the 
resettlers 
aftershocks were felt following the resignation of a senior 
conservative candidate who admitted he worked for the now virtually 
disbanded secret police 
the affair sparked rumors that other politicians could have 
collaborated with the once allcontrolling force and the 
leftofcenter social democrats denied that they had informants in 
their top ranks 
following the first scandal involving one of the new parties a 
minister in the caretaker government was named new chief of the 
democratic awakening a conservative party 
protestant clergyman rainer eppelmann 47 replaced wolfgang 
schnur a lawyer who resigned wednesday after admitting he 
collaborated with the hated secret police or stasi now virtually 
disbanded schnur was expelled from the party thursday 
democratic awakening is in a threeparty election alliance that 
has received enormous support from west german chancellor helmut 
kohl

on thursday the islamic jihad for the liberation of palestine 
said in a statement that it is holding agents and spies against 
our people and they will be executed if the american administration 
fails to meet our demands 
the group did not specify its demands it previously offered to 
trade professors robert polhill 55 of new york city alann steen 
50 of boston and jesse turner 42 of boise idaho for 400 arab 
inmates of israeli jails israel said no and the reagan 
administration refused to pressure israel

24 1987 from the campus of the usaffiliated beirut university 
college 
a handwritten statement in arabic was delivered to the 
independent newspaper annahar accompanied by a new photograph of 
steen a statement to a western news agency was accompanied by a 
recent picture of polhill 
steen and polhill are among 18 westerners including eight 
americans held hostage in lebanon 
in its statement the islamic jihad also accused the united 
states of responsibility for the emigration of soviet jews to 
israel after pressure on the soviets who succumbed and 
collaborated in this big conspiracy 
the statement warned our people shall not stand handcuffed in 
front of this conspiracy we shall not at all suffice ourselves by 
watching but shall begin taking the adequate measures to prevent 
the arrival of the soviets 
all airports facilitating the transport as well as airlines 
their jetliners and offices will be direct targets for us this is 
a warning and a threat 
the kremlin has lifted restrictions on jewish emigration and 
hundreds of thousands of soviet jews now are expected in israel 
the issue has provoked a storm of protest in the arab world 
arabs fear the soviet jews will settle in the occupied west bank 
and gaza strip where palestinians hope to create a homeland 
the letter from the islamic jihad which is believed comprised 
of shiite moslem zealots loyal to iran said people and 
organizations that recently said the hostages should be freed on 
humanitarian grounds should stay out of the matter the group 
denounces media reports about humanitarian moves to free the 
hostages and close this case the statement said 
the tehran times newspaper in iran which has close ties to 
iranian president hashemi rafsanjani said in recent editorials 
that the hostages should be freed on islamic humanitarian grounds

sheik mohammad hussein fadlallah spiritual guide of lebanons 
hezbollah or party of god said in a sermon last month that a 
humanitarian means of freeing the hostages must be found

officials said today 
the national aeronautics and space administration said the 
shuttle was bolted to its pad at kennedy space center at 432 am

time is purging from its membership doctors who have been convicted 
of felonies sold illegal drugs or in other ways behaved in 
unethical ways 
the ama recently revoked the membership of 31 physicians 
general counsel kirk johnson said the ama did not identify the 
doctors most of whom had already lost their license to practice 
medicine 
the reason we started this program was as much as anything a 
symbolic gesture said johnson but we did want to send a 
signal that the ama was not afraid of expelling members 
johnson said loss of membership can be costly to physicians who 
can still legally practice in some states he said expelled 
doctors cant buy malpractice insurance from state medical 
associations 
purged doctors can appeal the amas decision he said

with the organizations leader over a global strategy for combating 
the fatal disease 
dr jonathan mann has led whos fight against acquired immune 
deficiency syndrone since 1986 his resignation takes effect in 
june 
mann said his decision to resign was prompted by differences 
with whos directorgeneral dr hiroshi nakajima 
we have created the foundation and the structure of whos 
critical and ongoing role in global aids prevention and control 
he wrote nakajima in his letter of resignation 
however on the basis of my experience during the last two 
years i have now come to the conclusion that there is a great 
variance between our positions on a series of issues which i 
consider critical for the global aids strategy and the who global 
program on aids he wrote 
his letter of resignation and a memorandum to his program staff 
gave no details of those differences 
the letters came after weeks of rumors about low morale among 
whos 4500staff with many blaming nakajimas management style 
critics have complained of autocratic methods and of sudden 
transfers without prior notice the netherlands mission to the 
un in a confidential letter quoted by dutch newspapers earlier 
this year reportedly said that work at the agency was fast 
deteriorating 
nakajima 61 took office in 1988 the first japanese to head a

in history at harvard joined who in june 1986 the program then 
consisted of mann and a secretary with funds coming from the 
regular who budget 
the program now has a staff of close to 200 and a special budget 
that has tripled in the past three years to 109 million 
mann 42 has traveled throughout the world to push a worldwide 
campaign to control the aids epidemic that has spread to more than 
150 countries since it was first identified in 1981 
more than 220000 cases were registered worldwide by the who as 
of last month and mann estimates that there will be 6 million 
cases by the year 2000 
mann has said that the huge increase will come when millions of 
people who have already been exposed to aids develop the disease 
aids is spread most often through sexual contact needles or 
syringes shared by drug abusers infected blood or blood products 
and from pregnant women to their offspring

rising social and political unrest contributed 
to the killings of at least 53 journalists in 1989 more than 
double the number slain because of their work in the previous year 
a study says 
twothirds of the killings occurred in latin america including 
14 in el salvador alone said the committee to protect journalists 
it labeled the slayings censorship by death 
the report was released thursday the same day iraq hanged 
farzad bazoft a londonbased reporter accused of spying bazoft 
had been investigating reports of mass deaths in an explosion at a 
military complex 
sonia goldenberg executive director of the committee said 
today that the hanging combined with her groups report and the 
fiveyear captivity of associated press reporter terry anderson in 
lebanon are striking evidence of how many journalists are 
murdered and imprisoned for doing a job we take for granted 
goldenberg said the bazoft hanging was the committees top 
priority and that it will do more than its usual practice of 
sending letters of condemnation 
if we dont raise a protest in the loudest terms we are 
afraid that other countries might take this example and we cannot 
allow this goldenberg said at a washington news conference she 
did not disclose what steps the organization will take 
another group freedom house has put the number of journalists 
killed last year at 73 the two monitors could not explain the 
difference but noted that each uses its own sources of information 
and methods of confirmation 
the committee to protect journalists said harassment expulsions 
and arrests of reporters also increased with 60 expelled from 
countries where they were working at least 250 arrested and about 
90 assaulted 
the 53 who were slain was about double the 26 killed in 1988 a 
number that had held roughly steady for several years the 
committee said 
in addition to those killed in el salvador which is torn by 
guerrilla war latin america recorded 11 journalist deaths in 
drugscarred colombia five in peru two in brazil and one each in 
ecuador and guatemala 
one journalist was killed in crossfire in the us invasion of 
panama while that seemed accidental and motives for some killings 
were unclear most apparently were politically motivated or the 
work of organized crime the committee said it did not count 
killings that clearly were not workrelated 
a sinister practice of censorship by death is crippling press 
freedom in latin american democracies goldenberg said in a 
statement in other countries such as china ethiopia and romania 
expulsions were the preferred method of silencing correspondents 
she said 
the report listed 16 countries as cases of concern because 
of their treatment of journalists they included lebanon where 
anderson the aps chief middle east correspondent has been held 
hostage for five years as of today and china where editor wei 
jingsheng has been jailed 11 years

president mikhail s gorbachev invited radical 
reformers to a highlevel communist party debate today on further 
political changes which one top official warned could destroy the 
party 
in the first challenge he faces in his new more powerful post 
as president gorbachev also tried to calm the heated emotions over 
lithuanias attempt to secede from the soviet union 
gorbachev began his first full day as president by chairing 
todays communist party central committee meeting in response to 
this weeks legalization of alternative political parties the top 
communists are considering changing the partys structure they 
also are debating a bill they plan to propose on the regulation of 
political parties 
in the current wording the law could place obstacles to the 
active work of the party in workplaces complained moscow party 
chief yuri prokofiev 
the text of the law was not available 
radicals say real political freedom cannot emerge while 
communist party groups remain in government agencies farms army 
units police precincts and virtually every other institution 
those units give the party control over soviet life and an 
advantage over any new political party 
in remarks carried by the official news agency tass prokofiev 
added that in the proposed law there exists a real basis for 
liquidating the party organizations in businesses and institutions 
this could bring the organizational destruction of the party and 
we have the sad experience of the polish united workers party right 
before our eyes 
he was referring to polands communist party which was the 
first to lose power in the revolution that swept eastern europe 
last fall 
prokofiev also said the new law should limit the activities of 
political parties and create a process for abolishing them if they 
advocate something dangerous like nationalism or incite racial 
hatred 
the president of kirgizia a dzhumagunov warned party leaders 
that some people are calling for the party to leave the political 
arena to throw to oblivion our fundamental science 
marxismleninism 
the party for decades has been run with strict control by its 
highest leaders and a promotion system ensured that they and their 
supporters would remain in charge 
gorbachev has suggested allowing local party organizations to 
decide how to choose their delegates to a critical party congress 
which he said should start july 2 party reformers want 
secretballot elections in which they could force out the old guard 
radicals want even more urging the abolishment of communist 
party cells in government agencies farms army units police 
precincts and virtually every other institution those cells give 
the party a control over soviet life and an advantage over any new 
political party 
gorbachev brought to the central committee meeting 
representatives of about 40 groups of rankandfile communists 
according to the soviet news service interfax 
among the groups represented was the radical democratic 
platform which threatened to form a competing social democratic 
party if the communists fail to reform from within it was denied 
access to a central committee meeting in early february in which 
party leaders agreed to abandon their monopoly on power and permit 
legalization of alternative parties 
the democratic platform was formed in january by a group of 
progressive members of congress and members of communist party 
clubs that have brought reformers together in cities across the 
country it also supports independence for the republics 
individual communist parties in each one and abolition of the 
privilege system that provides the party elite with 
chauffeurdriven cars special food and summer homes 
gorbachev on thursday held only his second news conference in 
moscow and promised to hold a respectful dialogue with the 
people of lithuania and their government this is what the 
lithuanians are seeking given the complexity of trying to sever 
relations after 50 years of soviet rule 
a resolution passed by the congress of peoples deputies stated 
clearly the soviet intention of ignoring any attempts by lithuania 
to back its defiance with actions until the conflict has been 
resolved it said the soviet constitution and laws remain in effect 
in the baltic republic 
but gorbachev asked the deputies to drop the most 
confrontational rhetoric and simply direct him to protect the 
rights of soviet citizens and the soviet union in the baltic 
republic pending resolution of the conflict 
gorbachev ignored a demand from one deputy that he immediately 
impose presidential rule on lithuania and a threat from another to 
search out growing numbers of lithuanian deserters from the red 
army 
the one lithuanian who took the floor nikolai medvedev was met 
with scattered cries of enemy of the people when he spoke the 
epithet was widespread during the witchhunting days of dictator 
josef stalin 
medvedev accused bolshevism of causing hundreds of thousands of 
deaths in lithuania in stalins repressions and mass deportations 
he warned that the original more harshly worded draft of the 
resolution would only make the situation in the republic worse 
gorbachev the communist party chief was elected his nations 
first westernstyle president by the congress thursday morning and 
immediately took the oath of office he promised his first actions 
would include radical reforms to keep the soviet union from 
crumbling under the weight of economic and ethnic crises

the state supreme court today upheld a 
lower court ruling ordering striking teachers in one county back to 
work 
attorney general roger tompkins said he would file papers 
immediately to apply the 40 court ruling to striking teachers 
throughout the state 
the strike which began march 7 over pay and benefits has idled 
about half of the states 328000 students and up to twothirds of 
its 22000 teachers 
it is clear the involved teachers have existing employment 
contracts which cover their wages hours and other conditions 
of employment said the opinion written by justice thomas miller 
we are not aware of any court which has held that 
teachers who are presently under contract of employment could not 
be enjoined from engaging in a work stoppage or strike for higher 
wages the court said 
the ruling with justice thomas mchugh not participating 
upholds a jefferson county circuit court order telling striking 
teachers in that county to return to work 
the west virginia education association the states largest 
union with 16000 members had sought to block that order the west 
virginia federation of teachers which joined in the argument 
declined to comment 
kathy mcquarrie a spokeswoman for the wvea said the strike 
would continue despite todays ruling were not going to 
comment the court will do what the court will do she said 
mcquarrie said the association is continuing its efforts to meet 
with legislative leaders to come to a meeting of the minds on how 
to resolve this crisis 
meanwhile a spokesman for the wvea said the union isnt 
satisfied with a 27 million equity pay plan the legislature 
approved thursday night 
the money goes toward meeting a 1984 court order that teacher 
pay be equalized throughout the state under the plan every 
teacher will receive at least a 535 a year raise while those in 
the poorest counties will get up to 1500 more a year which 
legislators said is an average 4 percent raise 
nationally salaries are rising 6 percent said wvea 
lobbyist perry bryant its a little over half of the commitment 
of the rest of the country we need to have a special session of 
the legislature for additional compensation and to address a 
longterm solution 
schools were closed thursday and today by the state education 
superintendent for a coolingoff period gov gaston caperton has 
encouraged county school boards to fire or otherwise punish 
teachers who refuse to return to work monday 
also thursday the state board of education voted to start its 
own court action seeking orders requiring teachers to return to the 
classrooms monday 
the states teachers earn an average 21904 a year according 
to the national education association less than teachers in every 
state except arkansas and south dakota 
wvea president kayetta meadows said her group has obtained 
enough signatures on a petition from house of delegates members to 
call a special legislative session to address teacher pay the 
state constitution requires a threefifths majority of the 
100member house and 34member senate to call a special session 
bob brown executive director of the west virginia federation of 
teachers said just 12 senators had signed the petition by late 
thursday 
caperton has said the only way he can provide teacher pay raises 
is to raise taxes which he said the public opposes the teachers 
received a 5 percent pay raise earlier this year along with other 
public employees 
in preparation for hiring replacement teachers the state board 
has approved emergency certification procedures for people who have 
at least a bachelors degree 
meadows called the firing threat ludicrous because the state 
cant find enough certified teachers to fill the vacancies it 
already has

a teenage record store clerk is facing a 
felony charge for allegedly selling the sexually explicit rap 
recording as nasty as they wanna be to an 11yearold girl 
officials said 
chauncey reese a 19yearold employee at sarasotas tracks 
record store was arrested thursday on a complaint by the girls 
stepmother about the recording by the miami group 2 live crew 
conviction on the charge of selling harmful materials to minors 
carries a maximum prison sentence of five years and a 5000 fine 
said assistant state attorney donald hartery jr 
hartery said he filed the felony charge rather than a 
misdemeanor count of obscenity after listening to the tape given 
to police by the girls stepmother ann skolnick 
the tape is just outandout sex said ms skolnick 35 
they use words like anal sex and how women want it a child 
does not need to be hearing that 
the tape bears a label warning of explicit language in the 
lyrics ms skolnick said 
reese who is accused of selling the tape to the girl in 
january was released on his own recognizance telephone messages 
left late thursday at his home were not immediately answered 
sarasota police spokesman russ nugent said he did not know of 
any other arrest in the state involving the rap groups recordings 
the platinum doublealbum nasty was pulled from store 
shelves across the state last month after gov bob martinez asked a 
state prosecutor to consider branding the record obscene the 
prosecutor said however that ruling would have to come from local 
officials 
a judge in broward county later said there was probable cause to 
rule the record obscene and deputies there told store owners they 
would be prosecuted if they didnt pull it from shelves 
prosecutors will have to prove that reese was aware of the law 
and knew the record contained harmful material said milton 
mandell the chairman of the sarasotamanatee chapter of the 
american civic liberties union 
no warning was given to local record shops that the album was 
obscene as was the case in broward county mandell said

two mothers convicted of letting men 
repeatedly rape their children were sentenced today to 40 years in 
prison on another conviction of forcing two of the children to have 
sex 
circuit judge george corsiglia sentenced carolyn wilson 42 and 
annette sanford 34 each to 10 to 40 years in prison on one count 
of firstdegree criminal sexual conduct 
corsiglia also sentenced wilson to 20 to 40 years and sanford to 
18 to 40 years on a second rape count the sentences are to run 
concurrently sanford would be eligible for parole after serving 14 
years seven months officials said and wilson would be eligible 
for parole after 16 years three months 
the women were convicted in january of forcing wilsons 
then11yearold son and sanfords then9yearold daughter to have 
sex in 1987 while the mothers watched 
you took our societys most precious resource and 
destroyed their innocence for your own distorted gratification 
corsiglia said god knows how many generations of abuse you have 
inflicted on these children because we know abuse begets abuse 
on wednesday a separate jury convicted the women of another 
count of firstdegree criminal sexual conduct and one count of 
thirddegree criminal sexual conduct for lining their children up 
and allowing men to choose among them for sex 
they face up to life imprisonment when they are sentenced on 
those convictions on march 23 
officials say the women routinely allowed men to visit the home 
they shared from 198588 authorities believe drugs or money 
changed hands in exchange for access to the children one man has 
been charged 
defense attorneys for the women said the children concocted the 
stories of sexual abuse once in foster care because they didnt 
want to be returned to an admittedly abusive and neglectful home

john poindexter didnt trust congress and 
preferred not to deal with the legislative branch of government a 
former white house aide testified today at poindexters trial 
admiral poindexter was skeptical of the congress said 
ronald sable who was a legislative liaison at the reagan white 
house he had not had much to do with congress and that was his 
preference that he would just as soon not deal with them he 
said 
he indicated he didnt trust them sable said 
what about whether he liked them asked irancontra 
prosecutor howard pearl 
that fell in the same category as not trusting them said 
sable 
sable said that he had a difference of opinion with 
poindexter on dealing with congress sable said he told the 
national security adviser that if i was to continue to work for 
him his view of things would have to change 
poindexter is accused of conspiracy two counts of obstructing 
congress and two counts of making false statements to congress the 
government alleges that he covered up oliver norths assistance to 
the contras and the us role in a november 1985 hawks shipment to 
iran 
according to testimony thursday poindexter told the fbi three 
days after he resigned from government that he had no working 
knowledge of 1985 arms shipments to iran 
poindexter said during the 15minute interview with two agents 
that he had no direct knowledge of the diversion of iran arms sale 
money to the contras fbi agent ellen glasser testified thursday 
the former national security adviser told the fbi he knew only 
that his aide ollie north was up to something glasser said 
six months after the fbi interview poindexter told congress in 
sworn testimony that he had approved the diversion at norths 
request and that he had been involved in a november 1985 shipment 
of hawk antiaircraft missiles to iran 
glasser said poindexter agreed to the questioning in the living 
room of his rockville md home on nov 28 1986 after i told 
him we were trying to learn about the arms transactions and 
the diversion 
poindexter who is accused of purging more than 5000 messages 
from his computer files told the agents that he did not know 
of any destruction of documents pertinent to the irancontra 
affair the fbi agent said 
on nov 22 1986 there were more than 5000 messages at 
poindexters computer terminal but at 9 am on nov 24 there 
were zero glasser testified 
this massive deletion occurred in november 1986 she 
insisted under crossexamination by defense attorney richard 
beckler beckler suggested the deletions might have occurred at 
some other time 
poindexter was logged onto the computer system for a 15hour 
span nov 24 1986 starting at 430 am said kelly williams who 
was in charge of the computer software section at the white house 
communications agency that was the day before poindexter resigned 
a defense lawyer joseph small angrily moved for a mistrial 
saying irancontra prosecutors had doctored documents on the 
computer system that contained poindexters name the government 
denied smalls assertion 
i dont want you to pull this kind of stunt again us 
district judge harold greene admonished small in denying the motion 
williams said poindexters identification code was the one used 
to gain access to the computer when the files were deleted 
prosecutor louise radin asked if deleting the files would be 
comparable to taking a manila envelope and just throwing it 
away 
yes that would be the effect williams replied 
poindexter is accused of deleting files from his computer in an 
attempt to conceal from congress the us role in the delivery of 
the hawk missiles the cia assisted the shipment from israel to 
iran 
glasser said she showed poindexter chronologies of the iran 
initiative that concealed the us role in the missile shipment 
she said poindexter said he recognized them and that they had been 
prepared by north for congressional hearings 
the agent said she then asked whether they were accurate and 
he replied that they were 
north was convicted last april of aiding and abetting an 
obstruction of congress in connection with the chronologies the 
last version of the document stated that no one in the us 
government knew about the missile shipment until january 1986 
poindexter is accused of conspiracy two counts of obstructing 
congress and two counts of making false statements for the alleged 
coverup of the arm shipment and norths military assistance to the 
contra rebels in nicaragua

labor leader shimon peres parliament victory 
that unseated hardline prime minister yitzhak shamir signals a 
turn toward greater flexibility in negotiations on the palestinian 
question 
but both israeli and palestinian commentators doubt peres 
ability to make significant concessions or deliver a peace pact 
without a larger more stable majority in parliament 
peres said the government he hopes to form would hold a dialogue 
with palestinians and that israel will be able to keep our 
momentum toward peace 
his remarks indicated he would move quickly toward convening 
israelipalestinian talks proposed by secretary of state james a 
baker iii 
the parliament or knesset on thursday sided with peres in a 
6055 vote of noconfidence against shamir head of the rightwing 
likud bloc shamir had balked at bakers proposals particularly 
over including arabs from east jerusalem in any dialogue 
even now however convening talks may not be possible for many 
months because of peres involvement in the lengthy process of 
horsetrading with small factions to build a new ruling coalition 
the 66yearold peres who was prime minister from 1984 to 1986 
and has served as foreign and defense minister is a master 
tactician who enjoys the intricacy of diplomatic maneuvering 
peres has dismissed as antiquated ideas rightwing fears 
that dialogue with palestinians would encourage unrest or lead 
israel into making territorial concessions 
but he may lack the backing from parliament to make much 
headway even if he quickly patches together a coalition it is 
likely the conservative religious factions would bolt over issues 
such as the status of jerusalem 
peres has six weeks to forge a coalition or lose the mandate to 
likud 
if both parties fail elections could be called or a new 
coalition sought with likud the process could take months and in 
the event of new israeli elections serious peace talks would not 
be likely for months 
in addition mark heller a political analyst at tel aviv 
universitys jaffee center for strategic studies said the 
pressures on peres will make it difficult to reach agreement in 
cairo on israels proposal to hold elections in the occupied lands 
if peres heads a government israel will probably go to cairo 
more or less on bakers terms heller explained but i dont 
think there would be room for an agreement in cairo about 
elections except along the original israeli lines 
israel has refused to negotiate with the plo which it calls a 
terrorist organization and conservatives in israel oppose allowing 
arabs from east jerusalem to participate in the proposed elections 
peres has invested so much political capital in bringing down 
shamir that he has been forced into the defensive on these issues 
heller said without plo flexibility it would be difficult to come 
to agreement in cairo he said 
furthermore heller said a cairo meeting might intensify 
internal palestinian debate with radicals using more violence to 
prevent concessions 
writing in the conservative maariv newspaper commentator moshe 
zak also warned that unrealistic expectations had arisen in israel 
that if the cairo meeting took place the 27monthold palestinian 
uprising would fade away 
on the contrary the plo will try to accompany the meeting 
with increased actions of hate against israel in order to press its 
claims and to break the national consensus in israel on

a study indicates the number of new aids cases 
each year will decline in the united states but two federal 
researchers say the conclusion is flawed 
the study carried in todays journal of the american medical 
association says emerging cases will continue to decrease to a 
stilltobedetermined but probably low endemic level before the 
year 2000 
the work of dennis bregman and alexander langmuir of the 
university of southern california was criticized in two editorials 
in the journal written by researchers for the federal centers for 
disease control and the national cancer institute 
the editor of the journal dr george lundberg said today that 
while it is unusual for the journal to carry two editorials 
criticizing a study experts in the field felt the bregman and 
langmuir study warranted consideration 
three worldclass peer reviewers urged us to publish the 
bregman paper lundberg said we think theres at least a 
possibility that this historic approach could be right only time 
will tell 
however because we anticipated a great uproar especially 
from the political community if we published this paper we 
published two editorials criticizing the work 
bregman and langmuir used a statistical model called farrs law 
of epidemics first used in 1840 the model states that epidemics 
tend to rise and fall symmetrically in a normal bellshaped curve 
using data from the atlantabased cdc bregman and langmuir say 
920 cases of aids were reported in 1982 followed by increases in 
new cases of aids each year until 1987 the last complete year 
available for statistics with 19333 new cases 
using farrs law they then project 21978 new cases in 1988 
21604 in 1989 and 18363 in 1990 using farrs law the number of 
new cases would continue declining reaching 921 in 1995 they 
project 200000 cases of the deadly disease by 1995 
nationwide through january the cdc has reported 121645 cases 
of aids since reporting began in 1981 the disease has killed 
72580 of those patients 
bregman said the findings suggest a need for reevaluating aids 
strategy 
if you continue to focus on the increasing number of cases 
then it draws attention away from focusing on the emerging 
persistent endemic problem in our community he said in a 
telephone interview from los angeles 
mitchell gail an epidemiologist at the national cancer 
institute in rockville md said in an editorial that farrs law 
may be inapplicable to the aids epidemic 
gail and coauthor ron brookmeyer of johns hopkins university 
said cdc surveys and other indicators have noted as many as 1 
million americans carry the aids virus 
if a large fraction of those infected go on to develop 
clinical aids as is consistent with available data on the aids 
incubation distribution then the estimate of 200000 cumulate 
cases will fall seriously short they wrote 
gail said farrs law would be applicable with a closed 
population as in the case of a measles outbreak on an island in 
which no one was coming or going 
the incidence of measles will go up sharply but then down 
sharply gail said does that analogy apply to aids is the 
population closed i dont believe so 
gail said bregman and langmuirs findings could have dangerous 
implications for future health care 
to read their paper youre left with the impression that the 
number of future aids cases will be easily managed in an affluent 
society i dont think thats necessarily a realistic perception 
gail said 
acquired immune deficiency syndrome is caused by a virus that 
damages the bodys immune system leaving victims susceptible to 
infections and cancer it is spread most often through sexual 
contact needles or syringes shared by drug abusers infected blood 
or blood products and from pregnant women to their offspring

the government said today it 
would begin talks with nelson mandela and exiled african national 
congress leaders on april 11 to clear the way for formal 
blackwhite negotiations on a new constitution 
president fw de klerks office said in a statement that the 
president and his cabinet would meet anc leaders to deal with 
obstacles perceived to obstruct the process toward negotiations 
there was no immediate comment from the anc the main black 
group fighting the white government however the organization said 
last month it wanted to hold preliminary talks with de klerk as 
soon as possible 
de klerks statement gave no additional details on the 
unprecedented talks leaders from the ancs exile headquarters in 
zambia are expected to be part of the delegation de klerks office 
said 
the government has made clear that the anc would be only one of 
several blackled organizations it would invite to formal talks on 
a new constitution 
among others the government has said that leaders of south 
africas 10 black homelands such as mangosuthu buthelezi 
political leader of the zulus also would be present 
the relatively conservative buthelezi a proponent of 
capitalism has long been at odds with the anc over its use of 
violence and support for economic sanctions against south africa 
the anc was banned from 1960 until last month and many anc 
leaders will be making their first trip to south africa since 
heading into exile more than a quartercentury ago 
de klerk legalized the anc and more than 60 other antiapartheid 
groups feb 2 nine days later he freed mandela who had been 
imprisoned for more than 27 years for helping to launch the anc 
sabotage campaign 
mandela was in sweden today wrapping up a weeklong visit 
during which he saw anc president oliver tambo who is recovering 
from a stroke he was not available for immediate comment but was 
due to address a rally later today he is expected to return to 
south africa this weekend 
mandela recently was elected the ancs deputy president which 
makes him effective leader of the organization while the 
72yearold tambo recuperates 
de klerk says he wants to negotiate a new constitution that will 
bring blacks into the national government however he opposes the 
oneman onevote system that the anc and other leading 
antiapartheid groups favor 
de klerk envisions some mechanism that will allow whites to 
maintain veto power on major policy decisions 
the anc has said it will meet with the de klerk government but 
will not open formal talks on a new constitution until the 
president lifts the state of emergency and releases all political 
prisoners 
on thursday opposition leaders said a wave of unrest sweeping 
through south africa was threatening government efforts to open 
negotiations on powersharing 
officials say the wave of violence is the worst to hit south 
africa since the mid1980s about 300 people have been killed in 
fighting during the past month mainly in black townships 
police said today that three people died in black townships when 
residents spread false rumors that a rival group of blacks was 
planning an attack causing mass panic 
thousands of women and children in several townships south of 
johannesburg fled their homes thursday evening for refuge at 
hospitals police stations and trade union offices after hearing a 
rumor that a group of zulus would attack the police said men 
remained at home arming themselves and setting up roadblocks 
in one of several incidents a 40yearold white man driving his 
luxury car past the black residential area of sebokeng south of 
johannesburg was killed when local residents stopped his car and 
hit him in the head with a machete police said drivers who failed 
to stop at the roadblocks made of huge rocks had their cars 
stoned by a mob that numbered in the hundreds they said 
police also said two township residents in the same area 
apparently died of shock after hearing the rumors of an impending 
attack 
the zulus one of several black tribes in south africa come 
from the southeast part of the country most blacks in the 
johannesburg area belong to other tribes 
elsewhere a black man was killed in an exchange of gunfire with 
army troops in a township outside the port city of durban police

postmaster general anthony frank is defending 
post office spending on travel and bonuses in the face of criticism 
from a senator and a member of the commission that rules on postal 
rates 
sen david pryor dark took the postal service to task for 
sending officials to conferences in various parts of the country 
including hawaii and florida and john crutcher of the postal rate 
commission told washington newspapers hes upset that top post 
office managers received performance bonuses ranging from 3000 to 
11000 in 1988 
just last week the post office announced plans to seek an 
increase in postal rates citing a fiscal outlook that could 
present the agency with its largest dollar loss ever in this year 
the new rates including a 30cent firstclass stamp would take 
effect next year if approved by the independent postal rate 
commission 
commission member john crutcher complained to washington 
newspapers about the bonuses paid to postal managers saying 
surely some of them are so bad some should be fired instead of 
getting an award 
managers are awarded bonuses for superior performance those 
who achieve or exceed specific goals in numerous categories are 
compensated accordingly and those who dont are not frank 
responsed thursday 
pryor meanwhile cited a general accounting office report that 
said the postal service spent more than 6 million last year on 
travel for administrators attending conferences 
at a time when the postal service is crying about its fiscal 
crisis and threatening to reduce service unless it can raise 
postage rates its nothing short of an outrage to find it has been 
spending money this way pryor said in a statement 
frank said the meetings and conferences were necessary for the 
proper conduct of our business 
participants always spent more than eight hours a day in these 
meetings despite the sometimes exotic locations room rates ranged 
from 63 to 98 dollars a day but some meal costs appear high 
frank said in a statement 
he did not elaborate on the meal costs but added that there 
is room for improvement 
the postal service which no longer receives tax subsidies was 
established as a semiindependent agency in 1971 and directed to 
operate like a private business

latin american democracies proved the most 
dangerous places for journalists to work last year according to a 
report released friday 
the 53 killings in 1989 included many murders where 
journalists were killed in retaliation for what they had written or 
to prevent what they were going to write sonia goldenberg 
executive director for the committee to protect journalists said 
friday 
the formal release of the report at a news conference came a day 
after iraq hanged a londonbased journalist it accused of spying 
it came on the fifth anniversary of the day terry anderson the 
chief middle east correspondent for the associated press was 
kidnapped in lebanon 
the death toll last year was more than double the 1988 total of 
26 dead the committee reported it called the slayings 
censorship by death 
goldenberg said expulsions which she called another form of 
censorship also doubled to 60 she said journalists were most 
frequently expelled from china ethiopia and romania 
the committee also counted 325 journalists arrested and 102 
physically assaulted in 1989 figures it said were higher than the 
previous year 
the report listed 16 countries as cases of concern because 
of their treatment of journalists they included lebanon where 
three journalists including anderson are being held hostage and 
china where editor wei jingsheng has been jailed 11 years 
however twothirds of last years killings occurred in latin 
america the committee said including 14 in el salvador where a 
civil war is raging there were 11 deaths in colombia five in 
peru two in brazil and one each in ecuador and guatemala 
we are talking about democracies goldenberg said she and 
others said journalists need to make sure the public knows about 
atrocities and the us government feels pressure to ensure its 
foreign aid recipients observe human rights 
the trend toward greater violence and censorship was broken by 
good news at years end from the emerging democracies of eastern 
europe goldenberg cited the freeing of imprisoned journalists and 
new press freedoms in several countries 
alexandr kramer a prague writer said he was visiting the west 
to relearn his craft with several colleagues under a united 
states information agency program he said many czech journalists 
must learn how to break a long habit of selfcensorship 
we dont have many complaints in czechoslovakia nowadays 
kramer said there is a boom of new periodicals everyone can 
write what he thinks 
farzad bazoft who was reporting for the observer of london was 
hanged thursday after the iraqi government convicted him of spying 
he had been investigating reports of mass deaths in an accident at 
a military complex goldenberg said his execution will be a top 
priority for the committee this year 
if we dont raise a protest in the loudest terms we are 
afraid that other countries might take this example and we cannot 
allow this she said she did not disclose what steps the 
organization will take 
another group freedom house has put the number of journalists 
killed last year at 73 the two monitors could not explain the 
difference but noted each uses its own sources of information and 
methods of confirmation 
one journalist was killed in crossfire in the us invasion of 
panama although that seemed accidental and motives for some 
killings were unclear most apparently were politically motivated 
or the work of organized crime the committee said it did not 
count killings that clearly were not workrelated 
the 16 countries cited by the committee as cases of concern 
are china colombia cuba el salvador iraq israel kenya 
lebanon liberia peru romania singapore south africa the 
soviet union sri lanka and turkey

prime minister yitzhak shamir has no plans to 
step down as leader of the rightwing likud bloc despite his 
governments defeat in a parliamentary noconfidence vote a shamir 
aide said friday 
shamir met with likuds government ministers friday housing 
minister david levy and economics minister yitzhak modai who have 
been trying to engineer shamirs ouster for months did not attend 
the session 
labor leader shimon peres shamirs rival said he hopes to form 
a new government with the backing of 70 members of the 120seat 
knesset or parliament 
some likud parliament members suggested friday shamir would have 
to step down as party leader since several leaders of religious 
parties have accused him of breaking promises to support religious 
legislation 
but asked if shamir was thinking of resigning yossi achimeir 
director of the prime ministers office replied i didnt even 
hear a hint coming out of his mouth he will continue to lead as 
long as the party wants it 
under israeli law president chaim herzog decides who should 
form the next government he scheduled meetings sunday with labor 
and likud leaders but israeli newspapers reported the 66yearold 
peres was the likely choice 
shamir 74 whose government was israels first to be turned out 
in a noconfidence vote remains caretaker prime minister until a 
new government is formed that could take months 
both labor and likud already have begun wooing ultraorthodox 
religious parties that hold the balance of power 
achimeir conceded likuds chances for leading a new government 
were not bright after five of the six knesset member from the 
ultraorthodox shas party abstained in thursdays vote giving 
labor its victory 
he said he did not exclude a challenge to shamirs leadership 
i believe that mr shamir will eventually decide to resign 
because he cannot form a narrow government as long as agudat israel 
opposes his leadership said lawmaker tzahi hanegbi referring to 
an ultraorthdox faction that backed labor on thursday 
hanegbi said possible replacements could be levy former trade 
minister ariel sharon or foreign minister moshe arens 
sharon quit the cabinet last month to protest the governments 
peace policies arens is a protege of shamir and would be a 
compromise replacement 
opposition to shamir was expected from likud rebels such as levy 
and sharon but even some of the prime ministers supporters raised 
the prospect of replacing him 
concerning yitzhak shamir i think thats something he must 
decide and i think we will speak about it in the next couple of 
days said ehud olmert the governments arab affairs adviser and 
formerly a staunch shamir backer 
the dispute between likud and labor was over secretary of state 
james a baker iiis plan for israel to accept east jerusalem arabs 
and deported palestinians in a delegation to talk peace with 
israel shamir had argued that including them might threaten 
israels sovereignty over jerusalem 
likud has 40 seats and labor 39 in the knesset with the backing 
of the 11 agudat and shas lawmakers and 15 allies in leftwing and 
arab parties labor could have a majority of 65 it was not 
immediately clear how peres would attain the backing of 70 members 
thursdays vote was 6055 against shamir

us officials removed a small amount of american 
rice from an international food exhibition near tokyo on friday at 
the request of the japanese government because the rice violated 
japanese trade law officials said 
also friday two japanese automakers pledged to boost their 
purchases of american semiconductors after the us commerce 
secretary took his appeal for more balanced trade directly to 
company executives 
in an indication of the sensitive issue of japans trade surplus 
with the united states a dispute broke out in the cabinet over 
us demands that japan repeal a law that protects its small 
businesses prime minister toshiki kaifu cut off debate and it was 
unclear if the issue was resolved 
one of the sponsors of the fiveday food fair nobuo ogawa 
executive vice president of the japan management association said 
the american trade office recalled six types of usmade rice 
displayed at the us rice councils booth 
food agency officials said the display violates the food control 
law which bans virtually all imports of rice for sale in japan 
japanese rice is about four times more expensive than us rice 
but the country insists on selfsufficiency in rice its staple 
food 
we as the organizers were annoyed by the rice exhibit that 
is in conflict with the japanese law ogawa said 
a us embasssy spokesman said there had been no public sampling 
or tasting of the rice which was displayed only to illustrate 
the different varieties of rice available in the united states 
officials at the rice councils booth and the american trade 
office were not available for comment despite repeated telephone 
calls 
in 1988 both houses of japans parliament unanimously adopted a 
nonbinding resolution against opening the nations rice market to 
foreign imports it said rice production affects local communities 
the preservation of land and japanese culture 
aout 900 companies and groups from 41 countries are 
participating in the international food exhibition foodex an 
annual event in chiba state 21 miles east of tokyo 
us commerce secretary robert mosbacher spent four days in 
tokyo to follow up on talks two weeks ago between president bush 
and kaifu in palm springs calif 
mosbacher received very positive responses to his direct 
appeal to executives from toyota nissan honda matsushita sanyo 
sharp victor and sony to buy more us semiconductors us 
officials said 
the president of honda motor co tadashi kume pledged his 
company would buy 10 percent of its semiconductors from the united 
states in 1991 said the assistant us secretary for trade 
development michael skarzynski that would be an increase from 1 
percent last year 
toyota motor corps president shoichiro toyoda said his 
company would set a goal of buying 25 percent of its 
generalpurpose semiconductors from american manufacturers the 
officials said 
such highvolume generalpurpose chips are generally less 
profitable than custommade semiconductors 
in a 1986 semiconductor agreement japan and the united states 
set a 20 percent goal for foreign chips in the japanese market by 
june 1991 
us officials say the figure was a commitment by japan while 
japanese officials say it was only a target so far japanese firms 
have boosted their foreign chip procurement to 129 percent from 
86 percent in 1986 
skarzynski said us executives also have to do their part 
to work for a higher market share 
in recent trade talks the us government demanded that japan 
change aspects of its economy to help reduce its 49 billion trade 
surplus 
the cabinet dispute friday indicated that a consensus within the 
government on trade issues has yet to be reached 
the dispute between the ministers of trade and home affairs is 
over how to handle us demands that japan review legislation 
regulating large retail store openings under current law japan 
protects small businesses by limiting where large stores are built 
us officials say an increase in large stores would boost sales 
of imported goods because they generally stock more foreign 
products than small stores 
home affairs minister keiwa okuda criticized the trade minister 
kabun muto for proposing that the law only be modified he told 
the cabinet that japan should eliminate the law a home affairs 
ministry official said 
kaifu cut short the discussion before muto could respond and 
the three met afterward the official said it was not clear 
whether the dispute was resolved 
cabinet disputes are seldom reported in the japanese media but 
this one was covered prominently by television news

lithuanias diplomatic representative to the 
united states said friday that soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachev has opened a little door that will lead to 
negotiations on the future of his homeland despite the kremlins 
rejection of independence 
in an interview in the fivestory mansion the lithuanian 
legation has continued to occupy throughout the soviet occupation 
of his homeland charge daffaires stasyz lozoraitis welcomed 
gorbachevs call for a respectful dialogue with the people of 
lithuania 
this is already a little door he is opening lozoraitis 
said it will take some time it will take some pressure but 
with the help of the respectful dialogue we will go on and we will 
try to convince gorbachev 
the veteran diplomat said he believed the resolution passed 
thursday by the soviet parliament invalidating lithuanias 
declaration of independence would have little effect 
we had expected a rather harsh reaction he said what is 
said publicly i dont think has a very great importance probably 
something else is going on and probably mr gorbachev will 
understand that there is no other way we must sit down and 
negotiate 
lozoraitis said the negotiations should embrace the other baltic 
republics latvia and estonia which also have maintained legations 
in the united states since their countries were swallowed up by 
josef stalin in 1940 as part of the nazisoviet pact 
gorbachev has accepted the idea that the baltic states have 
been illegally occupied so the logical consequence should be that 
he accepts the idea of these three states separating themselves 
he said 
lithuania declared its independence march 11 and immediately 
called for negotiations with moscow but gorbachev said we 
cannot talk about negotiations you carry out negotiations with a 
foreign country 
the united states has never recognized the forced annexation of 
the three republics but has indicated it will not grant full 
diplomatic recognition to lithuania unless negotiations with moscow 
give it the attributes of a nationstate 
it will be a tough negotiation said lazoraitis gorbachev 
mentioned mutual respectful dialogue all right i hope the 
dialogue will really be respectful we will not get violent we 
will not get disrespectful we have shown we are a peaceful people 
when gorbachev came to lithuania he could just walk in the streets 
and nobody did anything to him although we dont like him very much 
as long as he is in lithuania or his troops

a colorful male pheasant darts into a 
cornfield and several hens leave the grassy roadside ditch to fly 
into the blue sky over glenn kingdons farm a model for wildlife 
preservation 
five years ago you wouldnt see a pheasant nowhere kingdon 
said as he walked through rows of pine trees planted to protect the 
birds and rows of corn left to feed them 
its a lot different now 
now he sees 75 to 100 pheasants on his 420acre central 
illinois farm 40 miles east of peoria and it didnt happen by 
chance 
kingdon buys baby pheasants raises and releases them to an 
environment that includes both shelter and food in addition to 
planting trees and leaving a few rows of corn unharvested he 
limits mowing of roadside ditches and fence rows 
he was one of 168 people honored under successful farming 
magazines farming in the flyways program for providing habitat 
for waterfowl and wildlife within their agricultural operations 
these farmers have established wetlands planted windbreaks 
preserved virgin prairies and adopted other conservation practices 
sometimes at their own expense and sometimes with government 
financial help 
instead of mowing or burning we preserve natural areas to 
provide nesting spots for birds and small wildlife said cherrie 
anderson who was among those honored 
and we plant sweetcorn and leave some sunflowers standing to 
feed deer raccoons birds whatever comes 
she and her husband bernard of warwick nd farm 1000 acres 
near devils lake and devote about 300 acres in little pieces 
here and there to geese and ducks and other wildlife 
the main goal of farming in the flyways was to find out from 
farmers themselves what wildlife conservation practices and 
policies actually are working out on the land said john walter 
conservation editor for the des moinesbased magazine 
the program was announced a year ago and farmers were invited 
to send in descriptions of their conservation efforts the magazine 
selected winners and profiles of the farmers with the best ideas 
were published in the february issue 
two private conservation groups ducks unlimited inc and the 
national fish amp wildlife foundation and american cyanamid which 
makes farm chemicals cooperated in the program to provide awards 
to the farmers 
the top prize an heirloom shotgun worth an estimated 7000 
was presented to ray mccormick of vincennes ind who floods a 
112acre grain field in the fall for waterfowl and plants soybeans 
into standing wheat to encourage quail 
its one of the best examples of how to increase net return 
while conserving soil water and wildlife mccormick said the 
wheat cover crop makes excellent nesting habitat while helping 
control weeds and soil erosion 
rick van etten of a long grovebased conservation group called 
ducks unlimited said the flight index for waterfowl has dropped 
from 100 million birds in the mid1970s to about 65 million as 
land plowed for farming has replaced nesting areas for wildlife 
now he said some farmers are leading the effort to establish 
and protect wildlife habitat 
kingdon who estimates he spends less than 1000 a year on his 
pheasant program said farmers need to change their practices if 
they want to preserve wildlife for their grandchildren to enjoy 
we tore out all the fences the tree breaks and we mowed the 
roadsides like front yards he said we brought this on 
ourselves 
mrs anderson said she and her husband have done commonsense 
things and hope other farmers will follow their example 
its nothing expensive we dont have the money for that

president bush issuing an appeal for peace in 
northern ireland on the eve of st patricks day said friday that 
theres no place for violence in that nation 
the president made brief remarks on the continuing strife in 
northern ireland as he received a bowl of shamrocks from visiting 
irish deputy prime minister brian lenihan at a rose garden ceremony 
there is one thing all of us here all americans are united 
in and that is our desire for peace and tranquility in northern 
ireland bush said 
we cant forget the suffering and the tragedy that plagues st 
patricks island and theres no place for violence in creating a 
new future for northern ireland 
lenihan presented the shamrocks to bush telling him the 
shamrock itself three leaves on one stem is a symbol of unity 
the essential unity between the american and the irish peoples that 
has been celebrated in this manner since the time of the first 
president of the united states george washington 
bush wearing a bright green tie and a gray suit reached into 
the bowl and scooped out a handful of shamrocks he stuffed them 
into in his breast pocket like a handkerchief 
first lady barbara bush wearing a green dress also attended 
the brief ceremony 
your children are making ireland young again creating hope 
and opportunity for the future rebuilding a strong economuy and a 
peaceful existence bush told lenihan here in the united 
states 43 million americans are of irish ancestry and i expect

once youve had a glass of guiness with a man in ireland as i 
have with brian lenihan why youre friends

genetic tests on women with breast cancer 
could determine the risk of recurrence for some patients improving 
the chance of treating women generally thought to be safe a 
researcher said friday 
cancer specialists also report that the use of lumpectomy and 
radiation therapy appear to be promising alternatives to breast 
removal for a common form of early breast cancer 
the scientists findings are being presented this week at the 
american college of radiologys 24th annual national conference on 
breast cancer 
genetic or dna tests are run on some women usually those with 
large tumors to reveal whether cells are dividing rapidly and the 
cancer is expected to spread said dr eva rubin chief of the 
mammography section at the university of alabama in birmingham 
but a new study shows that similar genetic irregularities 
indicating aggressive cancer show up in large and small tumors a 
finding that could signal doctors to begin additional treatment to 
fight recurrence rubin said 
currently women with small cancerous breast tumors that have 
not spread to the lymph nodes have surgery or a lumpectomy with 
radiation therapy rubin said most do not receive followup 
chemotherapy or hormonal therapy but 30 percent of those patients 
later die from recurring cancer she said 
the birmingham test was designed to determine if dna test 
results were different for larger tumors that can be felt and 
nonpalpable cancerous tumors she said 
of the 21 palpable and 24 nonpalpable cancers we reviewed we 
found that dna characteristics of small tumors are the same as 
larger tumors rubin said 
a dna test on tissue taken in a biopsy can show if the cells are 
rapidly dividing and if the dna has more or fewer chromosomes than 
the normal 46 if the tumor is growing and the dna test is 
abnormal the patients cancer is likely to be aggressive rubin 
said 
the study does not mean that all patients with breast cancer 
should have the dna test to find out whether the tumor is 
aggressive rubin said adding that more research and tests are 
needed before recommendations are made 
yale university researchers meanwhile said they found that a 
lumpectomy removing a cancerous tumor and some surrounding tissue 
combined with radiation therapy can be a good alternative to a 
mastectomy 
traditionally the treatment for early cancer limited to the 
ducts in the breast has been to remove the breast said dr bruce 
haffty of yales department of therapeutic radiology 
but a study of 58 patients at new haven hospital shows a high 
success rate using the less radical surgical procedure he said 
only three of the patients had recurring cancer 
the women studied had received treatment from two to 10 years 
earlier the median followup time was four years after treatment 
though we feel it is highly unlikely we have compromised 
patients in using this more conservative treatment we will need to 
follow them for 10 to 20 years he said 
if the cancer returns after a breastsaving lumpectomy is 
performed a mastectomy could still be an option haffty said 
some physicians are reluctant to use the breastsaving treatment 
for early duct cancer believing that the breast should be removed 
if there is any chance that the cancer could recur 
the yale study so far does not bear out this concern haffty 
said 
a main message here is that its important for women to be 
screened by mammography so these tumors can be picked up earlier 
treated more conservatively and this will give the patient a much 
better prognosis he said

when 12yearold michael thiel son 
of a top communist party official stood up for his father in 
school recently he was beaten up by classmates who broke his 
glasses 
it has been a long way down for the party that ruled east 
germany like a fiefdom for 40 years until its leaders were toppled 
by a popular rebellion in the fall 
there is a lot of hatred against the party and the children 
pick it up from their parents said michaels father frank 
deputy chief of the communist party in leipzig the city is an 
anticommunist stronghold where the protests that led to the 
nationwide movement began 
nearly 2 million party faithful have fled the party since the 
uprising the 600000 who remain have renamed themselves the party 
of democratic socialism and have frantically tried to convince 
voters before sundays election that they have moved from dogma to 
democracy 
we no longer want to shape man in the image of socialism we 
want to create a kind of socialism that man can live with said 
the 38yearold thiel a physics professor and party member for 20 
years 
but most east germans have had enough after four decades of 
secret police terror corruption travel restrictions and empty 
store shelves they are bitter about wasted lives in a drab society 
that squashed all individual ambitions 
we dont trust the communists anymore said andreas orlik a 
28yearold plumber from leipzig orlik stood in a crowd of 300000 
in the main karl marx square cheering west german chancellor 
helmut kohl and his promises of affluence for all in a united 
germany 
orlik said he would vote conservative in hopes that a 
freemarket economy will finally reward his hard work 
for the past eight years i have lived in a damp apartment with 
crumbling walls and they wouldnt even let me install a bathtub 
even though im a plumber orlik said i worked overtime for 
three years to buy a 17yearold car on the black market for 10000 
marks 1960 
the average monthly salary is 1100 marks about 215 
such sentiments are shared by many east germans the most 
optimistic forecasts say the revamped communist party will gain 
only 18 percent of the vote sunday 
party leaders are aware of their outcast status and acknowledged 
that they expect to be relegated to the political hinterlands 
a strong opposition for the disadvantaged read one campaign 
poster in leipzig 
thiel said the partys main objective in the new 400parliament 
would be to block a reunification plan under which east germany 
would agree to adopt west germanys constitution such a proposal 
is backed by the conservative alliance for germany a likely 
coalition partner in a new government 
we want to negotiate unification as a sovereign state and not 
simply be swallowed up by the west germans said thiel other 
leftist parties share this position but even they have refused to 
negotiate with the democratic socialists on a possible alliance in 
parliament 
the pds emerged from the communist party and therefore the 
other parties keep their distance said thiel he said his main 
reason for joining the communists as a teenager was to belong 
the party is not only being shunned in the political arena 
party members accustomed to a privileged life under the old 
regime now face widespread hostility and even violent attacks 
democratic socialist volunteers have been beaten up and windows of 
campaign headquarters have been smashed 
today i cant tell anybody that im in the party said 
mathias rulf a leipzig police officer patrolling in karl marx 
square he said he was one of just a few party members left in the 
once solidly communist police force 
these are lawless times muttered rulf in his 30s he 
watched the kohl supporters waving west german flags and streaming 
into the square for the rally 
party chief gregor gysi has warned of a new intolerance 
citing complaints by high school graduates that they are being 
barred from university because of party membership in the past 
party membership was a virtual prerequisite for admission to a 
university or job advancement 
amid this atmosphere of hostility the democratic socialists are 
trying hard to show voters they are no longer a party run by dour 
and dogmatic septuagenarians 
in a publicity stunt the 42yearold gysi performed a parachute 
jump the first in his life he quipped afterward you see from 
above how beautiful this country is and that there is no reason 
to just give it away 
the partys slogans are upbeat by east german standards 
borrowing freely from western commercials dont worry take 
gysi said one 
thiel claimed the changes are not just cosmetic most oldtime 
functionaries have quit or been fired since the peaceful revolution 
to make room for rankandfile members with new ideas he said but 
both thiel and the partys top candidate in leipzig dietmar 
keller were already functionaries under the old regime

its perhaps the oldest cliche in the charity 
business give a man a fish you feed him for a day teach him to 
fish and you feed him forever 
but the cliche took on a certain poignancy when nina belyaeva 
of the soviet union used it friday during a twoday international 
conference on nonprofit groups 
belyaeva one of 400 participants from around the world was 
referring the new growth of the voluntary third sector in her 
homeland where state economic power is diminishing and private 
industry encouraged 
belyaeva says her countrys fledging grassroots organizations 
must acquire western technical expertise in philanthropy how to 
raise funds how to organize how to network not necessarily 
western grants 
what our independent sector needs now is to learn how to 
fish she said during a panel discussion that included 
representatives from nonprofit sectors in west germany argentina 
australia and japan 
all eastern europeans are saying that said virginia a 
hodgkinson vice president of research for independent sector a 
10yearold nonprofit coalition of 650 corporate foundation and 
voluntary organizations which sponsored the conference 
it makes a whole lot of sense she said in an interview 
if you suppress the voluntary sector then only a certain few 
people develop those skills so what is necessary is to share 
experiences and to have experiences 
even for us groups long used to writing grant applications 
and staging yearly fundraising drives contact with the world 
nonprofit community is a very selfrenewing experience for all 
of us hodgkinson said 
the eighth annual conference brought in representatives from 
organizations such as the girl scouts environmental activists 
bible studies societies and charitable arms of major corporations 
tadashi yamamoto of the japan center for international exchange 
told a panel of his efforts to involve japanese corporations in the 
united states in philanthropic actions that go beyond public 
relations 
when the other panelists were asked if they would welcome 
japanese foundations operating in their countries all answered yes 
the panelists spoke of various frustrations in operating 
charities in their countries including encouraging government tax 
deductions 
in argentina there is a system of deductions for nonprofit 
organizations said andres thomapson of the national council of 
scientific research in argentina the trouble is there isnt a 
tax system

marked his fifth year as a captive in lebanon today as president 
bush pledged to pursue all legitimate opportunities to win the 
release of the hostages 
i intend to keep open lines of communications with all 
parties including iran who have influence over hostage takers 
the president said in a letter to peggy say andersons sister 
mrs say met privately with bush and his wife at the white 
house then addressed a ceremony across the street at lafayette 
park directing her remarks to the captors of her brother thousands 
of miles away she said you complain that your story has not 
been told and yet the man who would tell it has been chained to a 
basement wall for five years 
i dont want to punish them i dont want to hunt them down i 
just want my brother back but im not going to pay them for doing 
so she said 
anderson 42 the chief middle east correspondent for the

lebanon all told 18 westerners are believed to be captives there 
including eight americans 
speaking at the sunsplashed ceremony louis d boccardi

this point the greatest gift we can give him is to press on to not 
falter to find an honorable way to get the job done if you know 
terry thats what hes thinking too 
bush did not attend but said in a radio interview that every 
day im president i have a heavy heart when i think of the 
hostages

a courageous woman she has suffered for five long years and 
i just got to thinking that barbara and i would like to hold her

martin jenco a former hostage who spent time locked up with 
anderson before his release in the summer of 1986

love while many americans feel powerless about helping the 
hostages the ceremony was a symbol that we are doing at least a 
little something we will not rest until the hostages are 
home he said 
in contrast with the days springlike weather anderson has 
been held in terrible isolation and has endured brutality 
rather said among other things he has not seen his daughter who

i can to get those hostages out of there 
bush viewing cherry blossoms along the tidal basin with his

political parties made their final campaign 
pitches friday two days before east germans elect their first 
democratic parliament and complete the transition from 40 years of 
communist rule to a democracy 
sundays first free vote in east german history could also be 
the last as the two german states rush toward unification 
unification has been a central issue in the election which was 
forced on the government by last falls peaceful rebellion that 
ousted hardline communists opened borders and led to the creation 
of opposition parties 
the makeup of east germanys new 400seat parliament could 
decide the pace of unification some conservatives urge quick 
unification while some leftists favor a more cautious approach 
all major parties support unification 
a nationwide survey published friday suggested nearly half of 
all east germans favor immediate unification although a third of 
the electorate would prefer a slower joining of the two germanys 
the poll found that 84 percent favored unification in general 
according to a survey conducted jointly by the central institute 
for youth research and the institute for market research in leipzig 
the institutes did not say how many people were polled or list 
the surveys margin of error 
about 123 million east germans are eligible to vote sunday 
selecting from 24 parties and groupings parties include the 
communists independent groups and those allied with west german 
political parties theres even the beer drinking union which 
wants better ventilation in beer halls an end to closing hours and 
a lifting of strict drunken driving laws they also dont want too 
much thin foreign beer 
the communists ruled east germany with an iron fist after the 
country was founded in 1949 from the zone occupied by soviet troops 
in world war ii 
but the communist leadership collapsed in october under popular 
pressure and east germany has been run since then by a broad 
coalition caretaker government headed by premier hans modrow a 
reformminded communist 
the parliamentary election originally had been scheduled for 
may but with state authority collapsing rapidly the ballot date 
was moved up 
most political parties staged their final rallies across the 
country on friday following a recommendation by east germanys 
election commission but one or two parties planned rallies for 
saturday as well 
dozens of television networks from throughout europe have set up 
mobile satellite transmission stations in the parking lot in front 
of the parliament building in east berlin to prepare for election 
day 
campaign posters are all over east berlin one of them put up 
by a coalition of conservative parties proclaims never again 
socialism 
east german tv freed from strict communist control has given 
equal time to election spots by all parties and has interviewed the 
candidates most east german newspapers are backed by political 
parties and have supported their own candidates 
according to recent polls the frontrunners are the leftist 
social democrats and the alliance for germany a coalition of three 
conservative parties 
the alliance has received campaign backing from west german 
chancellor helmut kohl who is a christian democrat 
the social democrats also have help from west german 
politicians who have taken to the road en masse to speak at 
election rallies the bonn government poured in 118 million to 
help major east german parties mount campaigns 
the east german election is seen by many as a dress rehearsal 
for west german elections in december and west german politicians 
have worked hard to build up an east german base for the time when 
unification comes 
kohl on friday called east germanys elections a destiny 
vote on the road to german unification and promised to protect 
east germans from hardship during their nations economic overhaul 
but as kohl assured east germans west german states demanded an 
immediate halt to special aid for east germans resettling in the 
west 
ernst albrecht the governor of lower saxony said any future 
east german resettler cannot expect that the states will keep a 
made bed ready for him 
more than 130000 east germans have moved to west germany this 
year alone joining more than 340000 who came last year the 
exodus is bleeding east germanys economy and has seriously 
burdened west germanys social security net and job and housing 
markets

britain said friday its outrage at iraqs hanging 
of a londonbased journalist was not diminished by news of his 
robbery conviction but some lawmakers said it raises questions 
about his background and whether he was a spy 
the questions of any incidents in the past are irrelevant to 
the charges he faced in iraq said a foreign office spokesman 
our dismay at the execution has been made quite clear by the 
government and remains unchanged 
iraqi president saddam hussein ignored international appeals for 
clemency and ordered 31yearold farzad bazoft hanged thursday for 
spying for britain and israel 
britain recalled its ambassador to iraq ordered all six iraqi 
military trainees out of britain and canceled ministerial visits 
it did not break diplomatic relations or impose economic sanctions 
in iraq weekend demonstrations were planned to protest the 
british measures governmentrun newspapers said 
the main demonstration will be saturday outside the british 
embassy in downtown baghdad the papers said 
the ruling baath party called on its hundreds of thousands of 
members to participate 
this poisoned campaign against iraq cannot hide the dirtiest 
type of politicial hypocrisy to undermine iraqs lawful and sound 
decision to hang bazoft the baath newspaper althawra said 
condemnation was universal in the iraqi press with one 
newspaper going so far as to claim britain was an ally of iran 
during the 198088 iraniraq war so that it could regain 
sovereignty over the region 
bazoft a stateless iranian worked as a freelance reporter for 
the weekly observer newspaper and traveled on british papers he 
said at his trial that his televised admission of spying was made 
under duress 
he told a british diplomat shortly before his execution that he 
was just a journalist in search of a scoop when he went to the 
aliskandaria military complex south of baghdad in september to 
check reports of an explosion 
conservative party lawmaker rupert allason who writes on 
espionage said it was highly likely bazoft was a spy for 
israel but highly unlikely he was working for british 
intelligence in view of his criminal record 
i think that bazoft knew that the moment his criminal 
conviction became known to the observer he would have been out on 
his ear he probably capitalized on the time he was there and his 
background by offering himself to the israelis he said 
allason also claimed to reporters that bazoft offered himself 
four times to the british police in recent months as an informer 
scotland yard made no comment 
observer editor donald trelford said if mr allason has a 
single scrap of evidence that farzad spied for anyone let him 
produce it if not he should keep his fevered speculation for his 
books 
the masscirculation sun newspaper reported the robbery 
conviction on its front page friday quoting unnamed security 
sources 
bazoft then a student was sentenced to 18 months in prison at 
the crown court at northampton in central england in august 1981 
for robbing a savings and loan office of 764 the prosecution said 
he walked into the office and threatened to blow up the building 
he was carrying a fake bomb 
the journalists landlady penny brain said he robbed the money 
to pay his rent he robbed the building in the morning paid 
me what he owed me at lunchtime and shortly afterward the police 
took him away she recalled 
freed after a year with remission for good behavior bazoft won 
an appeal against deportation on grounds his life would be in 
danger in iran 
conservative lawmaker anthony beaumontdark said there now 
arises an incredible story of mystery and enigma surrounding the 
background of this fellow 
beaumontdark said nothing alters the cruelty of the sentence 
carried out by this inhuman regime but he said it was highly 
irresponsible of the observer to send an iranianborn journalist 
to iraq on such a dangerous assignment 
meanwhile five opposition labor party lawmakers urged britain 
and the european community to impose economic sanctions and an arms 
embargo on iraq saying it has one of the worlds worst human 
rights records 
british companies have lucrative contracts in iraq which is 
rebuilding following the persian gulf war with iran 
the foreign office said friday that bazoft sent a final message 
of apology to british nurse daphne parish 53 who was sentenced to 
15 years in prison for driving him to the military complex 
trelford said publication of the conviction and the allegation 
that he spied obviously helps the iraqis justify their bestial 
act 
michael mifsud a journalist and friend of bazoft claimed on 
independent television news 
somebody somewhere is trying to tone down public reaction in 
his favor for the purposes of maintaining a degree of stability in 
the iraquk situation

exxon valdez skipper joseph hazelwoods 
defense asked today to have the jury sequestered during 
deliberations because of the upcoming anniversary of the tankers 
oil spill 
this raises the fear of a mistrial if the jury is exposed to 
demonstrations outside the courthouse attorney dick madson told 
superior court judge karl johnstone 
he added that jurors might be unable to avoid reading stories 
and seeing television coverage next week marking one year since the 
nations largest oil spill 
johnstone said alaska law provides that attorneys must ask for 
sequestration before a jury is sworn in unless good cause is 
shown he said you have not shown good cause and i am going 
to deny your application 
in a discussion about legal instructions to be given to the 
jury the judge said he would tell the panel members they may not 
consider hazelwoods alleged efforts to move his ship off a reef as 
evidence of recklessness 
he said testimony has shown clearly that it was impossible for 
the ship to move and thus there was no risk under the law 
he said however he would allow the prosecution to argue that 
hazelwoods efforts in turning on the engines and moving the ships 
rudder could be interpreted as evidence of his impairment by 
alcohol closing arguments to the jury were scheduled for tuesday 
hazelwoods lawyers rested their case thursday without calling 
him to testify in his criminal trial prosecutors also wrapped up 
thursday setting the stage for final arguments next week after six 
weeks of testimony over the grounding of hazelwoods tanker on a 
charted reef in prince william sound 
with jurors out of the courtroom johnstone questioned hazelwood 
about whether he freely decided to give up his right to testify in 
his own behalf 
hazelwood responded yes several times but offered no 
explanation 
it had become apparent in recent days that hazelwoods lawyers 
confident of their case preferred not to expose him to possibly 
long and grueling crossexamination 
capt hazelwood you have a right to testify and if you were 
to testify you would be subject to crossexamination johnstone 
said do you understand that right 
hazelwood seated at the counsel table answered yes 
is it your desire at this time not to testify asked the 
judge 
yes hazelwood responded 
it was the most the pensive balding skipper has said in public 
since his trial began 
a defendant is never required to testify in his own behalf and 
jurors are instructed to infer nothing from a decision against 
taking the stand 
hazelwood 43 returned to alaska from his home in huntington 
ny to stand trial on charges stemming from the march 24 
grounding of the exxon valdez a 987foot tanker which spilled 
nearly 11 million gallons of north slope crude oil into waters rich 
with fish and other marine life 
hazelwood is the only member of the ships crew to face criminal 
charges he is accused of a felony criminal mischief and three 
misdemeanors reckless endangerment operating a vessel while 
intoxicated and negligent discharge of oil 
if convicted on all counts he could be sentenced to 7 years in 
prison and fined 61000 
key issues addressed by 46 prosecution and 15 defense witnesses 
centered on whether hazelwood was reckless before and after the 
grounding 
they were questioned about whether the captain seemed drunk 
whether he erred in leaving the ships bridge in control of a third 
mate and whether he tried a dangerous maneuver to drive the 
stranded tanker off the reef 
the latter claim appeared moot by the end of testimony through 
defense witnesses who testified the gigantic ship was immovable 
johnstone said he probably will instruct jurors they cannot 
consider as reckless an attempt to do something that was impossible 
move the ship 
the last defense witnesses a marine salvage master and a naval 
architect agreed the ship was stuck firmly on bligh reef 
the final prosecution witness was robert mackintire captain of 
texaco tanker the brooklyn which preceded the exxon valdez into 
prince william sound several hours before the grounding 
mackintire testified he always remained on the bridge while 
going through the sound but on crossexamination added he did not 
consider it a particularly difficult area to navigate 
hazelwood was in his cabin and a third mate was at the helm when 
the exxon valdez ran aground

african national congress 
leaders exiled for decades will return home for groundbreaking 
talks with the white minority government april 11 president fw 
de klerk announced friday 
nelson mandela scheduled to arrive in south africa on saturday 
after a fivenation tour is expected to head the anc delegation at 
the discussions they are designed to remove obstacles to formal 
blackwhite negotiations on a new constitution 
the meeting is structured to address those things which are 
perceived to be stumbling blocks toward negotiations de 
klerk told a cape town news conference after the announcement 
he said some leaders of the ancs military wing fear arrest upon 
return to south africa and that could be one of the obstacles 
discussed at the meeting 
but de klerk also said he hoped the anc would drop its reference 
to continued armed struggle so all leaders could commit 
themselves to peaceful solutions 
there was no immediate comment from the anc the main black 
group fighting the white government the zambiabased organization 
said last month it wanted to hold preliminary talks with de klerk 
as soon as possible 
at a rally in stockholm sweden mandela repeated anc conditions 
for formal negotiations with the south african government the 
conditions include lifting of the state of emergency freeing of 
all political prisoners and repeal of repressive legislation 
during mandelas past week in sweden he and other anc leaders 
held extensive strategy discussions with anc president oliver 
tambo who is recovering from a stroke in stockholm 
mandela 71 was elected deputy president of the anc earlier 
this month during a visit to zambia the position makes him the 
effective leader of the organization while tambo recuperates 
the government has made clear that the anc would be only one of 
several blackled organizations it would invite to formal talks on 
a new constitution 
among others are leaders of south africas 10 black homelands 
such as mangosuthu buthelezi political leader of the zulus 
de klerk has met with many black leaders in south africa and he 
told reporters it will not be my first meeting with the anc 
ive already met mr mandela twice 
the relatively conservative buthelezi a proponent of 
capitalism has long been at odds with the anc over its use of 
violence and support for economic sanctions against south africa 
de klerk has as state president burnt the ruling national 
partys bridges behind him said buthelezi who arrived for a 
state visit in lusaka zambia 
bold movements he has made into the new south africa are 
irretrievable commitments to abandon apartheid and to establish a 
new and just social economic and politcal order in south africa 
he said 
de klerk also said the government would spend 380 million more 
this year to eliminate backlogs in black housing and education and 
purchase more land for settlement of blacks near the cities 
an additional 760 million will form the basis of a trust fund 
to be administered by the private sector it will be used to 
encourage donation from inside and outside south africa to improve 
blacks living conditions and their opportunities for advancement 
the anc was banned in 1960 and many anc leaders will make their 
first trip to south africa since going into exile three decades ago 
the president legalized the anc and more than 60 other 
organizations feb 2 nine days later he freed mandela who had 
been imprisoned 27 years for helping launch the anc sabotage 
campaign 
de klerk says he wants to negotiate a new constitution that will 
bring blacks into the national government but allow whites to 
maintain veto power over major policy decisions de klerk opposes a 
oneperson onevote system that the anc and other leading 
antiapartheid groups demand 
the anc announced last month it would not open formal talks on a 
new constitution until de klerk lifts the state of emergency 
de klerk said friday i would hope the governments actions 
and the influence of the total leadership in south africa 
including the anc will bring about a situation which will enable 
us to lift the state of emergency as soon as possible 
de klerk and other cabinet ministers said recently that some 
black leaders were not ready to negotiate and were instigating a 
wave of violence that has killed 300 blacks in the past six weeks 
the violence is considered the worst since the mid1980s which 
led the government to declare the state of emergency in june 1986

the supreme court on friday raised the 
possibility it will decide by early summer the constitutionality of 
a new law making it a crime to burn the american flag 
the court partially granted a bush administration request for 
speedy consideration of the law ordering challengers of the law to 
file legal briefs by march 26 
the justices will wait until they receive those briefs before 
taking any further action in a pair of administration appeals to 
overturn lower court rulings that the law unconstitutionally 
stifles free speech 
the justice department on tuesday asked the high court to 
expedite consideration of the politically charged issue and 
schedule oral arguments as early as april 25 
while the department and president bush have expressed doubts 
about the laws constitutionality the administration filed legal 
papers urging the court to uphold the statute 
the department urged the high court to overturn rulings by two 
judges here and in seattle who declared the law unconstitutional 
the judges overvalued the narrow category of expressive 
conduct at stake and undervalued the compelling governmental 
interest that lies at the core of the statute the preservation of 
the flag as the unique symbol of our nation the department said 
conviction under the law carries a maximum oneyear jail 
sentence 
the justice department acknowledged that bush allowed the law to 
be enacted oct 28 without his signature because he questions its 
constitutionality and prefers a constitutional amendment to assure 
the same protection for the flag 
bush said he has serious doubts the law can withstand 
supreme court review and said a constitutional amendment is the 
only way to ensure that our flag is protected from desecration 
david cole a lawyer representing the defendants in both flag 
cases accused the administration of seeking expedited high court 
review so that flag burning will be an issue in this years 
campaign for house senate and state legislative seats 
he urged the court to schedule arguments in the case when it 
returns in october from its summer recess 
this is a very important constitutional question it shouldnt 
be subject to political considerations cole said 
the supreme court voting 54 in june struck down a texas law 
barring desecration or destruction of the flag the court said 
burning the american flag as a form of political protest is 
protected by the constitutions free speech guarantees 
the high courts june ruling touched off a political firestorm 
and led to enactment of the new flagprotection law 
democratic leaders in congress supported the law as an 
alternative to a constitutional amendment 
the cases are us vs eichman 891433 and us vs haggerty 
891434

when the white government and 
the african national congress meet they face three issues that 
could block the start of formal negotiations on a new constitution 
they are 
the state of emergency the anc wants it lifted president 
fw de klerk does too but says he will not do so until violence 
in black areas subsides more than 300 blacks have been killed in 
the past six weeks most in factional fighting 
political prisoners the anc says several hundred members 
convicted of politically motivated violence must be freed the 
government has refused but has been speaking to the lawyers of the 
prisoners also the government has been vague on status of anc 
exiles suspected of violence the exiles want guarantees they wont 
be prosecuted if they return 
violence the anc still endorses its guerrilla campaign 
though it poses no threat to the government the government says 
theres no justification for armed resistance now that the anc is a 
legal organization 
if agreement is reached on these obstacles the government the 
anc and several other black and white groups would likely begin 
formal talks on a constitution that would grant political rights to 
the 28million black majority 
other major issues include 
apartheid laws all black groups insist legislation 
segregating schools neighborhoods hospitals and other facilities 
be abolished the government has said there will be changes but so 
far opposes a full repeal 
voting rights black groups want oneperson onevote the 
government has said that would replace white domination with black 
domination many whites want guarantees the rights of minority 
groups will be protected de klerk envisions a system that gives 
blacks voting rights but allows whites to have veto power on major 
policy decisions 
land blacks account for more than 75 percent of south 
africas population but are restricted to 13 percent of the land 
black groups demand land redistribution

republicans will likely hold onto the 14th district seat which 
covers staten island and a sliver of brooklyn and democrats are 
predicted to keep the seat in the 18th district covering the 
impoverished south bronx 
gary koops spokesman for the national republican congressional 
committee admitted it would be tough to win the bronx seat a 
longtime democratic stronghold democratic assemblyman jose serrano 
is the favorite 
it also doesnt help that the republican candidate a former 
democrat is considered an outsider literally 
simeon golar lives in queens and though candidates are not 
required to live in the districts they seek to represent that 
can be a factor for many voters koops said 
also on the ballot is ismael betancourt running on the 
independent fusion and righttolife party lines the seat became 
vacant when rep robert garcia was sentenced to three years in 
prison for extorting payoffs in the wedtech scandal 
in the staten island race democrats are not racing to stencil 
the name of their candidate robert gigante on the door of an 
office in the capitol 
im optimistic we have a good chance to make this a very close 
race says howard schloss of the democratic congressional 
campaign committee in washington but he quickly added thats 
not to say were going to win 
gigante 41 is an attorney and virtual unknown facing city 
council member susan molinari whose father resigned from congress 
in the middle of his fifth term to become staten island borough 
president many say guy v molinari quit congress to open the way 
for his only child 
his 31yearold daughter got a boost both media and moneywise 
when president bush visited staten island for a fundraising 
luncheon that put an extra 223000 into her campaign coffer her 
father ran bushs 1988 campaign in new york 
gigante who is running a distant second despite a 2to1 
democratic registration edge has trashed his opponent for 
looking like a little girl at the podium 
if thats the best issue gigantes got then i hope he has a 
strong law practice koops said 
others running in the 14th district include carl grillo on the 
liberal line and righttolife candidate barbara bollaert 
analyst charles cook whose cook political report handicaps 
congressional races for corporations trade and union groups 
snored loudly when asked to give his opinion of the two races 
he says he hasnt even looked at the bronx race because i just 
assume serrano is going to catch it 
serrano spokesman carol pasco said the bronx republican 
committee chose golar a former family court judge and excity 
commissioner of housing and human rights because he is black 
i think the strategy is fairly obvious he said the 18th 
district population is evenly split between blacks and hispanics 
in staten island cook says gigante is every bit as effective 
a candidate as molinari but he doesnt have the necessary 
resources ie money and support to pull it off 
molinari is expected to raise about 400000 for the special 
election gigante is likely to bring in about 225000 gov mario 
cuomo and new york mayor david dinkins have endorsed gigante but 
neither has actively campaigned with him 
if elected molinari would be the youngest sitting member of 
congress she has been the only republican on the 35member city 
council the legislative body that governs new york since her 
election in 1985

housing starts fell 7 percent in february but 
remained well above the level of the last 11 months of 1989 the 
government reported friday analysts said the building pace cannot 
be sustained 
new homes and apartments were built at a seasonally adjusted 
annual rate of 148 million units in february the commerce 
department said 
that followed a 247 percent jump in the warmest january on 
record the biggest increase since a 293 percent gain in july 1982 
despite being revised down from a 296 percent advance first 
reported last month 
temperatures remained above normal in february and although 
housing starts fell from januarys 159 millionunit level they 
remained higher than those of any month last year except for the 
166 million units started in january 1989 
the pace of activity in january and february is higher than we 
can expect over the course of the year said thomas holloway 
senior economist with the mortgage bankers association were 
probably borrowing a few starts from later in the year because of 
the warmer weather 
the increase in new construction was based entirely in the 
singlefamily sector which rose 51 percent to an annual rate of 
117 million units it was the highest level since a 119 
millionunit rate in january 1989 
the fact that singlefamily starts were up in february bodes 
well for activity in the coming months as mortgage interest rates 
head downward said john a tuccillo chief economist at the 
national association of realtors 
multifamily starts plummeted 35 percent to an annual rate of 
266000 after rising 40 percent the previous month 
analysts said the january pace resulted both from the weather 
and from builders desire to get construction underway in advance 
of new regulations designed to make apartments more accessible to 
the handicapped 
the new fair housing rules could add 3000 to the cost of 
multifamily units said david seiders chief economist for the 
national association of home builders 
david berson chief economist with the federal national mortgage 
association said a high vacancy rate also contributed to the 
multifamily weakness 
its almost certain to remain weak until vacancy rates come 
down berson said 
the northeast posted the biggest gain in overall starts up 244 
percent to an annual rate of 219000 units it was followed by a 
148 percent jump in the south to 604000 units 
starts in the midwest declined 29 percent to an annual rate of 
271000 units and in the west fell 24 percent to 383000 units 
applications for building permits a barometer of future housing 
activity fell 25 percent after a 268 percent gain in january the 
decline was the largest on record

largest commercial network reported the salary and price hikes 
would be 40 percent in april and 20 percent in may 
the violence of inflation and runaway prices has made 
indispensable directed parameters for prices and salaries said 
collor de mello 
collor de mello said the measures would result in the 
weakening of speculation and the strengthening of investment 
the new conservative president also announced a new currency 
the cruzeiro which replaces the 14monthold new cruzado the 
cruzeiro is brazils fourth currency in as many years 
private economists said it would be created by lopping two zeros 
off the new cruzado which is now worth about 25 cents 
collor de mello declared a new law against economic abuses 
such as withholding goods from the market financial speculation 
and illegal price hikes 
who tries to cheat and fool the people will be jailed he 
said adding that store owners and managers found guilty of 
economic crimes will face fiveyear jail terms 
the most contoversial part of collor de mellos annoucement 
centered around his promise to balance the budget deficit this 
year promised new measures included 
major new taxes on the wealthy and on financial gains from 
trading in stocks and gold 
the suspension of 22 billion in annual federal subsidies to 
private enterprise that go to everyone from exporters to the 
computer industry

companies brazil has 188 publicly owned firms many operate at a 
loss and they have total debts of about 62 billion 
stiff increases in public utility rates such as electricity 
and telephone 
firings of large numbers of brazils 700000 federal employees 
this years federal deficit will be zero theres no way to 
knock down inflation if the government spends more than it takes 
in collor de mello said

economy into the world market eliminate import restrictions and 
bring foreign capital to the country 
we will modernize our economy and stimulate competition

growth he said 
collor de mello signed laws thursday that reduced the number of 
government ministries from 25 to 12 and ordered the sale of 
governmentowned mansions and cars 
also decreed was the extinction of 24 federal agencies and 
companies including the brazilian institute of coffee which 
controls all coffee trade and the governments port authority 
portobras 
initial reactions to collor de mellos package were mixed 
weve worked all our lives for reforms like a balanced budget 
halelujah said rightwing senator jarbas passarinho of the 
social democracy party 
union leaders were mostly negative 
im still analyzing the package but my sensation is that 
workers have lost if he wants to take on the banks fine but 
weve got nothing else to give said luis antonio medeiros 
president of the powerful sao paulobased metalworkers union 
medeiros supported collor de mello in last years presidential 
campaign 
collor de mello was inaugurated for a fiveyear term thursday 
he replaced jose sarney who took office in an electoral college 
vote set up by the rightwing military regime that ruled brazil 
between 1964 and 1985

cubas first communist party congress in four 
years will allow some debate but will not challenge the partys 
31year monopoly on power the state news agency said 
prensa latina said the announcement of the congress to be held 
next year was made by defense minister raul castro the brother of 
cuban president fidel castro 
the report came thursday the same day vice president dan quayle 
appealed to other countries to urge the havana government to hold 
free elections 
castro repeatedly has rejected westernstyle balloting and said 
his country has no need for sovietstyle reform despite pressure 
from soviet president mikhail s gorbachev and a drop in soviet aid 
the party congress will be held in the first half of next year 
the dispatch said without giving the exact date the report was 
monitored in mexico city 
the party said the meeting would not exhibit unreal eagerness 
of unanimity false mechanical and formal 
however the party which seized power in a 1959 revolution 
made clear its intention to retain full control of the caribbean 
island 
our communist party the base of political organization in our 
society is perfecting itself to better complete its work of 
historical transcendence that we are setting up today it said 
when the government announced in february that a party congress 
would be called there was speculation that the move might signal a 
change in course for the hardline marxist government 
since then however castro has said he intends to remain 
staunchly loyal to marxist principles 
quayle and castro both in brazil on thursday for the 
inauguration of president fernando collor de mello stayed clear of 
each other but debated through the media 
we have encouraged all people who have any contact with fidel 
castro to urge him to stop the war in el salvador to stop 
funding the wellorganized guerilla movement quayle told a 
news conference thursday 
we also urge anyone who is in contact with castro to ask him 
when hes going to have elections said quayle 
castro said wednesday he saw no need for westernstyle elections 
in cuba congresses of the ruling communist party choose cubas 
leadership 
we have our own type of election he said in an interview 
with tv globo brazils largest network it would take long to 
explain our political process 
castro has faced growing international criticism of his human 
rights policies and increasing pressure to reform in three months 
he lost his two closest caribbean allies panamas manuel antonio 
noriega who was toppled in a us invasion in december and 
nicaraguas leftist sandinistas who were defeated by a usbacked 
opposition coalition in elections feb 25 
as criticisms of cuba have appeared in official soviet media 
castro has called on cubans to brace for possible cuts in the 
soviets 5 billion in yearly aid 
us sources said last year said there had been substantial 
reductions already as evidenced in the marked decline in the 
purchase of sugar which the soviet union buys from cuba at prices 
substantially higher than world market levels as a form of subsidy

inflation and a revision in the pentagons 
costestimating system have pushed the price of the next generation 
of airtoair missiles to more than 14 billion air force 
officials told congress on friday 
the new estimate is 21 percent higher than the previous 
calculation 
lt gen ronald w yates also told the house armed services 
procurement subcommittee that the air force has suspended delivery 
of the amraam missile because of problems with some of the 140 
missiles it has accepted for testing 
most of the discrepancies fall into the category of quality 
workmanshiptype issues or process changes at the contractors 
yates said 
raytheon and hughes manufacture the missile 
the amraam which has been in development since 1981 is 
considered a smart missile 
the pentagon envisions that a fighter pilot would use radar to 
detect enemy aircraft at long distances and fire the 12foot 
missile the amraam would then use its own radar to hit the enemy 
missile 
the program however has had problems with cost overruns 
yates said the original cap imposed by congress on the program 
in 1984 was 7 billion but that limit was later revised to 75 
billion and then 77 billion 
adjusted for 1984 prices the new estimate of 1437 billion for 
the 24335 missiles the pentagon has planned to purchase would be 
93 billion 21 percent more than the last estimate 
the assistant air force secretary for acquisition john j 
welch said a fourth of the increased cost is due to higher prices 
for components and the rest stems from the defense departments 
change in its estimating methods 
yates also said that the air force is reexamining the total 
number of missiles it plans to buy in light of the diminshing 
soviet threat 
the air force is responsible for development and overseeing 
production of the amraam but the navy plans to purchase it as well

secretary of state james a baker iii 
venturing into his first round of onsite african diplomacy will 
urge south african president fw de klerk next week to end a 
3year state of emergency and to release all remaining political 
prisoners 
as bakers trip was announced friday by the state department 
the de klerk government said it would begin negotiations with 
nelson mandela and exiled leaders of the african national congress 
on april 11 
a senior us official said baker hopes to accelerate the 
negotiations but ruled out demands by mandela for stiffer us 
sanctions against south africa as a pressure tactic it is time 
for us to encourage them not punish them the official said 
referring to de klerks release of mandela from prison last month 
and the presidents willingness to negotiate with the black 
opposition 
but the official who spoke on the condition of anonymity said 
baker would urge de klerk to end the state of emergency in south 
africa and free political prisoners estimated by his critics to 
number nearly 300 
baker will leave sunday for namibia the newly independent 
former south african colony where the secretary and other world 
figures will attend ceremonies for the new nation 
the united states during the reagan administration played a 
leading role in the establishment of namibia and is prepared to 
provide 78 million in aid next year 
while at the celebration baker will meet with mandela whose 
demand for stiffer sanctions and a suspension of us diplomatic 
relations with south africa is being rejected as counterproductive 
the bush administration prefers dealing with pretoria as a way to 
try to shape events in the racially segregated country arguing 
that a cutoff and a tougher stance would limit us leverage 
in namibia baker also will meet with soviet foreign minister 
eduard a shevardnadze west german foreign minister hansdietrich 
genscher and egyptian president hosni mubarak 
before leaving for capetown to see de klerk anglican bishop 
desmond tutu and black opposition leaders baker will open talks 
with angolan president jose eduardo dos santos in an effort to end 
his governments 14year war with usarmed guerrillas 
the secretary will then see jonas savimbi leader of the unita 
rebels who receive an estimated 45 million to 50 million in 
covert us aid 
the united states has no diplomatic relations with angola but a 
virtual stalemate in the war since december may improve prospects 
for a negotiated settlement and us recognition 
the united states is alone among major western countries in not 
recognizing the angolan government

an argentine navy officer was convicted in absentia 
friday for the abduction and murder of two french nuns killed in 
argentina 12 years ago 
french legal experts said it was the first time someone had been 
convicted of a crime outside of his own country after having been 
granted amnesty in his homeland 
on trial was capt alfredo astiz 40 commander of a warship in 
argentina and scheduled for promotion known to human rights 
groups as the angel of death he was sentenced to life in 
prison after a hearing in a paris criminal court that lasted less 
than four hours 
the court in a symbolic gesture also ordered the sequestration 
of all of astizs property 
astiz in the past has denied any connection with the crime 
along with all other junior officers in argentina he was 
exempted in 1987 from prosecution for any human rights violations 
committed during the dirty war waged against leftists by a 
military junta president raul alfonsin seeking to consolidate 
civilian rule with conciliatory gestures said only senior military 
commanders should be held accountable 
the nuns relatives and their lawyers do not expect argentina to 
extradite astiz but they said a conviction might prompt other 
countries to recognize an international arrest warrant on astiz 
that could in effect make astiz a prisoner of his own country 
the bodies of the two roman catholic nuns alice domon and 
leonie duquet were found on a beach near buenos aires two months 
after they were abducted in december 1977 
astiz who had been captain of a navy frigate was assigned at 
the time to infiltrate organizations that had taken up the cause of 
victims of the juntas repression 
according to papers filed in the french court astiz ordered the 
abduction of the nuns who had befriended antigovernment 
activists he later was implicated by an activist who escaped 
custody 
lawyers representing the nuns families say they hold astiz 
responsible for torture the two women allegedly underwent shortly 
after abduction 
in the courtroom friday were two women who said they had 
belonged to an organization of mothers of the disappeared in 
argentina they wore the groups traditional white scarves 
in 1978 astiz served briefly with the argentine embassy in paris 
under an assumed name 
the nuns families filed charges against astiz in 1982 and an 
arrest warrant was issued france unsuccessfully sought his 
extradition from britain where he was taken as a prisoner after 
his capture during the falkland islands war 
he was indicted in argentina for the january 1977 arrest and 
disappearance of swedish teenager dagmar hagelin but freed from 
prosecution in december 1986 by a federal court that invoked the 
statute of limitations 
alice doman 40 at the time of her death was sent to argentina 
in 1967 she worked for a time in a buenos aires shantytown and 
later in an impoverished northern village before returning to the 
capital in 1976 she was abducted while leaving a church following 
a meeting with parents of missing activists 
leonie duquet 61 at the time of her death had worked in 
argentina since shortly after world war ii her brother eribert 
is a roman catholic priest who was posted in san francisco at the 
time of her abduction 
astiz is stationed at the puerto belgrano navy base about 460 
miles south of buenos aires on the south atlantic the base is 
argentinas largest

a plan to balance the budget by raising taxes 
and freezing social security benefits was attacked friday by a 
laborfinanced group as unfair to low and middleincome americans 
the plan by rep dan rostenkowski dill chairman of the house 
ways and means committee looks a lot like what president bush 
campaigned on said robert mcintyre director of citizens for tax 
justice 
mcintyre whose organization has produced some widely read 
analyses of the tax system outlined what he said would be fairer 
way to reduce the deficit the central element in mcintyres plan 
would raise the top individual and corporate tax rates to 38 
percent up from 33 percent and 34 percent respectively 
sen daniel patrick moynihan dny also criticized 
rostenkowskis plan friday because it would continue to the use of 
surplus social security taxes to hide the real size of the overall 
federal deficit 
this is not government money moynihan said this money 
belongs to the contributors meaning the workers whose payroll 
taxes finance social security 
moynihan has proposed eliminating the surplus by cutting social 
security taxes 
moynihan also faulted rostenkowski for calling on retirees to 
give up their scheduled social security costofliving increase in 
1991 this is the first time i have heard such a proposal made 
from our democratic side on a unilateral basis moynihan said 
he said that although the freeze would be for only one year the 
failure to pay the increase would permanently reduce retirees 
benefits 
moynihans staff calculated that in 1991 the freeze would cost 
a typical couple retiring this year at age 65 about 588 over five 
years the loss would total 3192 
citizens for tax justice says rostenkowskis plan is flawed 
because its asking the wrong people to pay for the deficit 
the organizations substitute proposal would raise individual 
taxes by 139 billion over the next five years and corporate income 
taxes by 178 billion another 195 billion for deficit reduction 
would come from reducing the defense budget and 62 billion would 
be derived from cutting government interest payments 
all but the richest 5 percent of american families would 
fare better compared with rostenkowskis plan mcintyre said 
rostenkowski would eliminate the lingering deficit by 
eliminating costofliving raises for social security beneficiaries 
and recipients of many other government programs it would also 
raise income taxes on everybody who files a return with an 
especially big boost on the richest 600000 people and raise taxes 
on gasoline cigarettes wine and beer 
bush has said there is room for discussion in rostenkowskis 
plan but repeated his opposition to any tax increase

king birendra said friday he would 
consider political reforms in this himalayan kingdom but he ruled 
out the multiparty system that protesters have demanded 
police arrested about 150 people including prominent writers 
and entertainers in one of the largest mass arrests of 
demonstrators since the movement for a return to democracy was 
launched feb 18 witnesses said 
nepals twoyear experiment with westernstyle democracy ended 
in 1961 when king mahendra birendras father dismissed the 
government headed by the nepali congress party the king accused 
the party of corruption and banned all political parties 
the national assembly now shares power with the monarch 
birendra a 44yearold harvard graduate spoke at a rally in 
the resort city of pokhara 85 miles northwest of katmandu his 
speech marked his first public comments on the monthlong campaign 
of protests and strikes in nepal at least 12 people have died in 
the unrest 
we have instituted reforms as called for by the changing needs 
of time the king said in an address broadcast by stateowned 
radio taking into account the nepalese aspirations this process 
will continue 
but he said there would be no change in the decree banning 
political parties 
the king said the ban was upheld in a 1980 national referendum 
and our political tradition relies on the popular will 
he lashed out at the protest movement and said there could be no 
solutions when there is irresponsible behavior and undignified 
acts disregarding the interest of the country and people 
the nepali congress said birendras speech was politically 
most disappointing 
indications of reform in the royal address cannot solve 
the real problems of the nation the party said in a statement 
under the current system the king nominates onefifth of the 
national assemblys 140 members and wields considerable influence 
in the selection of top officials and the formulation and 
implementation of government policy 
the rest of the assemblys members are elected on a nonparty 
basis 
riot police broke up a silent protest friday at patan college on 
the outskirts of katmandu 
the protesters wore black cloth over their mouths to demonstrate 
their resentment of the governments efforts to silence their 
demands they distributed statements accusing the government of 
arresting more than 50 writers and artists in addition to other 
protesters during the recent crackdown on innocent and unarmed 
people

soviet president mikhail s gorbachev on friday 
gave the breakaway lithuanian republic three days to start 
returning to the soviet fold but he did not say what the kremlin 
would do if lithuania refused 
the republics leader declared moscows views irrelevant 
lithuania announced plans to start setting up check points on its 
borders 
the official tass news agency distributed the text of a terse 
telegram from gorbachev to lithuania president vytautas 
landsbergis it accompanied a copy of the soviet parliaments 
proclamation thursday that lithuanias declaration of independence 
was invalid 
in a threeday period inform about measures toward realizing 
this directive said the telegram signed president ussr m 
gorbachev 
parliament elected gorbachev to the presidency this week and 
gave him expanded powers 
the prospect of gorbachev assuming new authority allowing him to 
thwart moves toward independence drove the baltic republic on 
sunday to reclaim the sovereignty that existed between 1918 and 
1940 when stalins army moved in 
gorbachev on tuesday called the move illegal and invalid 
but said premier nikolai i ryzhkov and a commission would conduct 
talks with lithuania but he said they would not amount to 
negotiations 
we cannot talk about negotiations you carry out negotiations 
with foreign countries gorbachev said 
at a news conference thursday night gorbachev said he expected 
to carry out a respectful dialogue with lithuania 
the soviet leader and his advisers have ruled out the use of 
force to bring lithuania back into the union but gorbachev has 
demanded 34 billion in reparations for soviet investment in 
factories and infrastructure and wants to discuss territorial 
questions 
many lithuanians expect an economic boycott by moscow 
gorbachev was told by parliament on thursday the day he 
formally was given his new powers to work out the dispute with the 
republic 
however tass quoted landsbergis as telling the republic of 37 
million people that moscow had no right to tell it what to do 
it is not a problem that they do not recognize us now tass 
quoted landsbergis as saying on television the time will come 
and they will recognize us 
he said talks with moscow undoubtedly would take place tass 
reported 
the lithuanian communist party leader algirdas brazauskas who 
started the drive toward independence but lost the presidency to 
landsbergis also appeared on tv and joined in appealing for unity 
and calm tass said 
the lithuanian government renamed the government newspaper 
soviet lithuania to echo of lithuania and approved plans to set up 
37 border checkpoints in the near future as part of an effort to 
prevent uncontrolled export of commodities the soviet news agency 
said 
lithuania borders the russian byelorussian and latvian 
republics of the soviet union it faces the baltic sea but has no 
other land borders 
when they declared independence sunday lithuanian legislators 
also changed their homelands name to the republic of lithuania and 
dropped the soviet republics emblem 
lithuanias decision was bitterly criticized by deputies from 
other republics they approved the directive urging gorbachev to 
ensure the defense of the legal rights of every person living on 
lithuanian territory as well as defending soviet interests there 
admiral vitaly ivanov commander of the soviet baltic fleet 
accused lithuania leaders of betrayal of their own people and the 
people of the soviet union and called the declaration of 
independence a stab in the back

the national centers for disease control is 
considering banning most us primate importations after a rare 
deadly virus turned up in monkeys in at least two laboratories 
officials said 
in a letter to about 200 primate importers in the united states 
cdc director william l roper warned the health of your workers 
may be at risk 
ebola virus the deadliest virus known to man before the 
discovery of aids was spotted in this country in november in 
three monkeys at a virginia products testing center in january an 
ebolarelated virus turned up in a monkey at a pennsylvania lab 
now in the wake of the initial reports further active 
transmission in monkeys in quarantine has been demonstrated 
roper said in his letter the warning was sent thursday to primate 
importers health officials and others 
the additional transmission has occurred at the virginia 
laboratory hazleton research of reston officials said 
at least 173 people in the united states have been in contact 
with monkeys blood or tissue from infected lots with one person 
showing ebola antibodies roper said 
about 10 percent of monkeys studied from different countries 
show signs of infection with filoviruses the family including 
ebola virus 
the primates involved are cynomolgus monkeys which account for 
about 75 percent of all primates brought to the united states 
according to officials of the atlantabased cdc about 16000 
cynomolgus monkeys were imported last year 
these data indicate a definite risk probably at a fairly low 
level of human infection in the course of ordinary handling and 
management of monkeys roper said 
cdc is considering imposing a temporary ban on the importation 
into the united states of cynomolgus monkeys he said 
atlantas yerkes regional primate center one of the nations 
leading primate research centers has 38 cynomolgus monkeys 
longtailed macaques but a ban would not affect the center too 
much said spokeswoman cathy yarbrough 
large primate research centers such as yerkes breed many of 
their own animals 
the cdc last month issued new guidelines for workers involved in 
the handling of such primates calling for 31day quarantines 
restricted access to animal holding areas in primate importation 
areas and protective clothing for all workers in direct animal 
contact 
those guidelines are now mandatory effective immediately roper 
said

dr jonathan mann the american expert who has led 
the world health organizations battle against aids announced 
friday that he is resigning because of major differences with whos 
directorgeneral 
the announcement surprised manns coworkers in whos aids 
program one british aids specialist called the resignation a 
major disaster 
the organizations directorgeneral dr hiroshi nakajima of 
japan issued a statement saying he regretted the announcement 
which happened without previous consultation at a time when the 
organization is confronted with new challenges concerning the fight 
against aids he declined further comment 
manns letter of resignation indicated there had been 
disagreements between the two men ever since nakajima took office 
in 1988 nakajima succeeded dr halfdan mahler of denmark 
on the basis of my experiences during the last two years i 
have now come to the conclusion that there is a great variance 
between our positions on a series of issues which i consider 
critical for the global aids strategy and the who global program on 
aids he said 
the program seeks to control an epidemic that has spread to more 
than 150 countries since it was first identified in 1981 more than 
220000 cases were registered worldwide by the who last month mann 
estimates there will be 6 million cases by the year 2000 
his letter of resignation and a memorandum he sent to his staff 
both released to the media did not explain the differences he had 
with nakajima 
however the departure follows persistent rumors of low morale 
among the 4500staff of who many blamed the directorgenerals 
management style for the problem critics reportedly complained of 
autocratic methods and of sudden transfers without prior notice 
the netherlands mission to the united nations in a 
confidential letter quoted by dutch newspapers this year said work 
at the agency was deteriorating 
mann said his resignation was effective at the end of his term 
in june 
nakajima 61 took office in 1988 before that he was in charge 
of whos manilabased regional office for the western pacific he 
held that job nine years 
when his candidacy for the top executive post became known 
there were reports critically assessing his work on his previous 
assignments 
mann a public health official who grew up in boston and 
attended harvard joined who in june 1986 the aids program then 
consisted of mann and a secretary with funds coming from the 
regular who budget 
the program now has a staff of close to 200 and a special budget 
that has tripled in the past three years to 109 million 
mann 42 has been traveling throughout the world to push a 
worldwide campaign to inform people of the dangers of aids and the 
methods of protection 
who spokeswoman therese gastaut said that following the 
announcement of manns resignation he and nakajima had a 
cordial meeting and agreed there are no differences on the 
fundamental problems of the global aids strategy 
it was not immediately possible to reconcile that statement with 
manns letter and memorandum gastaut said nakajima could not be 
interviewed because he was leaving for afghanistan on friday night 
mann left word with his office that he was not prepared to talk to 
the media 
in london dr tony pinching who works at one of britains 
leading aids treatment centers said the loss of dr mann is a 
major disaster but it goes beyond that and i view this with very 
grave concern indeed 
there are few people of his caliber around he has directed 
the program with great vision and ability and will be very 
difficult to replace 
the resignation symbolized a very serious breakdown within the 
who which must be resolved for the sake of the program he said 
the british governments chief medical officer sir donald 
acheson said i have a very high personal regard for dr mann 
who has worked tirelessly with all countries to develop a global 
strategy to reduce the spread of hiv the aids virus to provide 
appropriate care and protect the rights and dignity of those 
affected

moslem fundamentalists who hold the largest 
bloc in parliament on friday urged arab neighbors to drop peaceful 
efforts to end the arabisraeli dispute and instead take up 
military action against israel 
in a statement sent to the associated press the moslem 
brotherhood organization also urged arabs to destroy us interests 
in the middle east and it threatened the soviet union 
we call on all arabs to drop the option of a peaceful 
settlement with israel and seriously return to the military 
option which was dropped by arabs in 1974 the statement said 
we should prepare all the arab nation males and females to 
become an armed popular army that will convert every inch of the 
palestinian land to become a bursting volcano where jews will be 
buried 
the brotherhood movement made similar demands during novembers 
election campaign its members captured almost two dozen of the 80 
seats in parliament far ahead of any rival faction but not enough 
to dominate legislation 
the brotherhood electoral strength has had no effect on king 
husseins moderate policy of arabisraeli peace which is based on 
israeli withdrawal from the territories it captured from jordan 
egypt and syria in the 1967 war 
roughly half of jordans 31 million residents come from 
palestinian families driven out of their homeland by the wars that 
created israel and expanded its control over the west bank and gaza 
strip 
the brotherhood statement responded to reports that hundreds of 
thousands of soviet jews plan to immigrate to israel this year

the car wash that illegally hired matthew 
garvey at age 13 was fined 400 after he lost a leg at the weekend 
job the boy told congress friday as child labor victims called for 
stiffer penalties 
garvey using a cane to help him walk with an artificial leg 
told the house government operations subcommittee on employment and 
housing that he had landed the job easily and had not been asked 
for a work permit 
now 16 the laurel md boy said the accident occurred in 1987 
when he was sitting on a dryer that pulled his leg into the machine 
and severed it 
at the hearing rep charles schumer dny called for 
mandatory sixmonth jail terms and fines of up to 100000 for 
employers that repeatedly violate child labor laws he also called 
for increasing the civil penalties for child labor violations from 
1000 to 10000 
schumer said that from 1987 to 1989 there were 128000 minors 
who were injured and an estimated 59 killed in the workplace the 
37 employers who were cited for violations relating to those cases 
were fined a total of 27000 he said 
the average penalty was a paltry 740 740 for a childs 
life in the united states schumer said 
suzanne boutros of plainfield ind said she was unaware until 
after her 17yearolds death delivering a pizza that it was 
illegal for youngsters to drive cars on their jobs the 1000 fine 
that the pizza shop was assessed was not enough she said 
the quickest way to get sombeodys attention is through their 
pocketbook ms boutros said 
on thursday labor secretary elizabeth dole announced that a 
threeday sting operation had uncovered 7000 minors employed in 
dangerous jobs or working long hours in violation of child labor 
laws the companies are expected to face civil fines totaling 18 
million she said 
the committee chairman rep tom lantos dcalif called the 
operation a spectacular public relations extravaganza but said 
it had probably heightened the publics awareness about child labor 
violations 
lantos noted that the general accounting office congress 
investigative arm has reported that the 1000 federal labor law 
inspectors spend about 4 percent of their efforts on child labor 
investigations 
he called that percentage ludicrously and pathetically 
inadequate 
mrs dole has said she is not yet convinced additional resources 
are needed but said she will consider legislative changes such as 
stiffer penalties 
schumer and pease are drafting a bill that would increase the 
penalties and make other changes in the law such as expanding the 
definition of child labor violations to include doortodoor sales 
they expect to introduce the measure next month 
lantos said the panel will try to find out whether child labor 
violations have increased because of labor shortages or increased 
economic pressures on families

the central bank interrupted foreign exchange operations 
thursday a few minutes after a police patrol sent by interior 
minister elias khazen arrived at the bank with a warrant to arrest 
bank director edmond naim 
sources at the bank said the conflict began when naim refused to

began shooting in the air 
banks said they intend to strike until the instigators are 
brought to trial 
a government spokesman quoted hoss as saying that this 
aggression should not go unpunished the person basically 
responsible for the attack should bare the responsibility 
the natural way to achieve this is for the interior minister 
to resign hoss was quoted as telling president elias hrawi by 
telephone 
khazen and naim are both maronites the catholic community that 
has dominated lebanon since independence from france in 1943 the 
bank is in syriancontrolled moslem west beirut naim is one of the 
only maronite officials to have an office on the moslem side of the 
city 
khazen had negotiated a contract with a british company to print 
the lebanese passports but naim had already received an offer from 
a swedish firm to print the passports at half that cost 
khazen visited naim late thursday to apologize for the incident 
and said that the incident is over its consequences have been 
solved 
but the independent annahar newspaper said naim has decided to 
sue the interior minister on charges of attempted murder and 
kidnapping 
justice minister nabih berri said friday the government will 
hold an extraordinary session to discuss the attemped arrest 
the lebanese pound once the most solid currency in the middle 
east has been hit hard by the 15year civil war dropping in the 
past five years from five pounds per dollar to around 550 
until now the bank has been the only government institution to

nicholas brathwaite who led a 
13month interim government after the usled invasion of grenada 
in 1983 was sworn in as prime minister on friday following an 
indecisive national election 
british governor general sir paul scoon administered the oath of 
office to brathwaite although his national democratic congress 
party wound up one seat short of a parliamentary majority in 
tuesdays election 
a party normally must have a parliamentary majority to form a 
government but the governorgeneral has constitutional discretion 
to waive the requirement if he thinks enough legislative support 
exists to govern 
the national democratic congress won seven of the 15 seats in 
the house of representatives grenadas parliament the grenada 
united labor party of former prime minister sir eric gairy came in 
second with four seats 
two seats each went to the national party led by ben jones and 
the new national party led by former cabinet minister keith 
mitchell 
the deadlock was broken after brathwaite reached a tentative 
deal with jones friday jones resigned earlier in the day as acting 
prime minister a post he held since the death of prime minister 
herbert blaize in december 
brathwaite and jones both said they held talks thursday about a 
new government but they gave conflicting versions of what emerged 
brathwaite said jones agreed to become deputy prime minister in 
the new government jones colleague legislator alleyne walker 
would become public works minister and both would support 
brathwaite in moving legislation through parliament 
jones said the deal offered by brathwaite was not good enough 
and he was waiting to hear further from him he denied assuring 
brathwaite of support saying i told him clearly that i was not 
making any commitment on that 
the mixup could mean this tiny caribbean island nation of 
94000 people may have to hold another election 
brathwaite 64 headed an interim government after us troops 
joined by a small regional force invaded gerenada on oct 25 
1983 and toppled a ruling marxist junta he was president until

erich honecker admits he made 
mistakes during his 18 years of ironfisted rule but feels he 
should not become a scapegoat for everything that went wrong a 
pastors wife who gave him refuge said friday 
he told me that some mistakes were made but that not 
everything done by his government was a complete failure said 
sigrid holmer who with her husband thomas a lutheran pastor has 
taken in the ailing 77yearold honecker and his wife 
two days before the east german elections mrs holmer spoke in 
the living room of the twostory parish house where the disgraced 
communist and his wife margot have lived since jan 30 
the holmers provided a safe haven after no one else would take 
in the honeckers who only five months ago were cheered by millions 
of east germans lutheran church documents show that among others 
the army refused to let the honeckers live at a military base 
saying it could not guarantee their safety 
honecker toppled by a popular revolution in october faces 
trial on high treason charges but was released after a twoday 
detention in prison in january because he suffers from kidney 
cancer 
the honeckers live in seclusion in the house with graying 
stucco walls and a forest nearby 
when mrs holmers 18yearold son traugott asked honecker on 
friday at the request of an associated press reporter whether he 
had a message for east germans before the elections honecker 
responded that his lawyers had asked him to remain silent 
when the lines of curiosityseekers drive by every weekend 
honecker sometimes stands at the secondfloor window and looks 
outside the son said 
mrs holmer said the honeckers closely follow east german 
political developments reading several east and west german 
newspapers and watching television 
they live in two rooms on the second floor and mrs honecker 
62 cooks their meals on a small stove said mrs holmer she said 
the couple brought a couch and table from their former home in 
wandlitz a secluded luxury enclave near berlin but that the rest 
of the furniture was provided by the holmers 
honecker remains indoors nearly all the time only taking an 
occasional evening walk with the pastor my husband looks around 
first if the coast is clear to make sure honecker will not be 
accosted outdoors she said 
mrs holmer said the family also received bomb threats after 
taking in the honeckers on friday a coal truck driver passing by 
the house shouted kill the guy and then drove off 
honeckers former political cronies have abandoned him only his 
daughter sonja and infant granddaughter viviane visit 
occasionally bringing food and other supplies from nearby berlin 
mrs holmer described honecker as a very considerate guest 
at first the honeckers ate with the holmer family downstairs 
the first day my husband told him that we usually say grace 
before dinner mrs holmer said mr honecker said of course 
go right ahead 
under the honecker regime christians could practice their 
religion but were hindered when they wanted to study at a 
university or advance in their jobs 
mrs holmer said nine of her 10 children were unable to go to 
college because they refused to join the communist partys youth 
movement the youngest kornelius is 14 and will have a free 
choice 
but traugott who gave his room to the honeckers had to become 
an apprentice carpenter because the road to higher education was 
blocked 
he said he felt no bitterness toward mrs honecker who was 
education minister during his school years she is a pretty nice 
lady and we talk sometimes said traugott a lanky teenager 
with unruly blond hair 
then he excused himself and sped off on his motorbike to put up 
campaign posters for the conservative alliance for germany in 
lobetal a village of 700 people about six miles northeast of 
berlin 
the lutheran church presence is particularly strong in lobetal 
which also contains homes for the retarded elderly and 
handicapped drab weathered homes line cobblestone streets a 
pleasant woods surrounds most of the town 
mrs holmer 58 said she took the hard times under the 
communists in stride christians were never promised a painfree 
life she said 
asked why she took in the honeckers she said we have a 
statue of christ here and underneath is the biblical inscription 
come to me all those who are tired and downtrodden

defense secretary dick cheney said friday the 
longdelayed talks on the future of the six us military bases in 
the philippines will begin next month 
cheney stressed however that well depart the philippines 
if the talks do not result in an agreement acceptable to the united 
states 
antiamerican sentiment has been running high in the philippines 
on the base issue 
during a twoweek trip last month to asia that included a stop 
in manila protestors burned figures of cheney in effigy and he was 
snubbed by philippine president corazon aquino 
mrs aquino expressed unhappiness over a 96 million cut 
congress made in the bush administrations request of 360 million 
to compensate the philippines for the use of sites that include the 
two largest us bases overseas clark air base and subic naval 
base 
the leases for the six sites expire next year 
preliminary talks on the bases had been scheduled to start in 
last december but were put off following the most recent coup 
attempt against the aquino government 
cheney noted the divisiveness of the issue within the 
philippines in discussing the bases friday at the national 
newspaper association the situation in the philippines is a 
difficult one he said 
but despite the public tiff with mrs aquino cheney praised her 
as a symbol of democracy because she helped topple the regime 
of ferdinand marcos and helped restore democracy 
our presence in the philippines has been important to the us 
we have an interest in continuing at subic and clark air force 
base if we can cheney said 
the secretary said he learned what a very sensitive issue 
the bases are for filipinos during his philippine visit but he 
stressed there is a limit to what we can afford to pay in order 
to continue to use those facilities 
and we will begin the negotiations next month hopefully 
well be able to reach an agreement that will allow us to continue 
to use those facilities but obviously if the filipinos do not 
want us there or if were unable to conclude an acceptable 
agreement from our standpoint well depart cheney said 
a pentagon official who spoke on condition of anonymity said a 
specific date for the talks has not been set but that they were 
expected to begin in midapril 
the preliminary talks are expected to lay the groundwork for 
fullscale negotiations between representatives that will be 
appointed to handle the talks another official said 
we have to agree to negotiate the filipinos could decide not 
to negotiate thats a possibility the second official said 
cheneys visit to the philippines came during a trip designed to 
reassess the us military posture in the pacific and to prepare a 
plan to reduce troops in the region by 10 percent in light of tight 
budgets and reduced international tensions 
in his speech cheney said america would fall from superpower 
status if military spending were cut in half over the next decade 
as proposed by some defense experts 
when serious people propose cutting the defense budget by half 
over the next 10 years they are not talking just about simple 
budget shifts cheney said they would give us the defense 
budget for a secondclass power 
among the most prominent advocates of halving the defense budget 
over the coming decade is william kaufmann a former pentagon 
official who recently said such large reductions could be achieved 
without harming the nations security 
the bush administration is proposing to cut next years defense 
budget by about 2 percent after inflation to 292 billion many 
in congress are pressing for a bigger cut 
i think the notion of americas inevitable decline is both 
wrong and dangerous cheney said my sincere belief is that far 
from becoming less of a force in the world america is going to be 
taking on greater global responsibilities in years ahead

a portuguese journalist working for 
lusa news agency and the voice of america was ordered to leave 
mozambique on friday because of a story he wrote and the voa said 
he departed for france 
the government had ordered antonoio mateus out of this southeast 
african country a former portuguese possession within 24 hours 
for writing a story it said damaged mozambiques image and 
constituted active disinformation 
information minister teodato hunguana also said the story filed 
to lusa the portuguese news agency and the usbased radio 
network has no basis in fact but other government departments 
acknowledged that elements of the story were true 
according to hunguana mateus filed a story monday saying 
military helicopters flew over the capital the previous saturday 
and that on monday special police units patrolled the city 
following rumors about the launching of a wave of protest against 
the cost of living hunguana said the story also mentioned the 
detention of 12 unemployed people monday 
the mozambican national news agency aim quoted an official 
source as saying it is routine for air force helicopters to fly 
over the capital and that the flights saturday had nothing to do 
with the rumors referred to by lusa 
aim said the detentions mentioned by mateus did occur but had 
nothing to do with the kind of operation he described it said 
police made arrests after a gang of petty criminals stole goods 
from stallholders in an open market 
deputy voa director bob coonrod told the associated press in 
washington that mozambican authorities were offended because mateus 
refused to divulge the name of a senior police officer he quoted 
anonymously in his account 
coonrod said mateus had been a parttime reporter for voa for 
three years

white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said 
friday a suspected chemical weapons plant in libya was most likely 
out of business as a result of this weeks blaze 
i dont think we can say for certain but we do think some 
very extensive and serious damage has been done fitzwater said 
he said he would not speculate on whether sabotage caused the 
explosion and fire at the rabta plant we still do not have a 
conclusion of how it occured 
asked if the united states had been assured by israel and west 
germany that they were not responsible for the fire fitzwater 
would only say i dont know who weve talked to about this 
libyan leader col moammar gadhafi had said his government is 
investigating to determine whether west german intelligence agents 
had anything to do with wednesdays fire 
both israel and west germany have denied any responsiblity as 
has the united states 
defense secretary dick cheney asked during an appearance friday 
at a national newspaper association conference about the fire 
said im inclined to attribute it more to libyan incompetence 
than anything else 
the bush administration has said all along that the plant was 
producing poison gas although libya insists the factory was making 
pharmaceuticals 
it seems likely that its out of business common sense would 
suggest that but i dont think we can reach an absolute conclusion 
at this point fitzwater said

designers of the governments giant 
atomsmasher are finally preparing to buy land for the project but 
the battle for funding has just begun key backers told a 
scientists meeting friday 
the struggle to wring the first of a projected 75 billion from 
the federal budget for the superconducting super collider will move 
to the house science space and technology committee in two weeks 
committee chairman robert a roe dnj urged scientists 
educators and industry figures at the meeting here to lobby for the 
project in texas designed to study the particles that make up 
atoms 
we cant build it alone roe said in a speech at the 
international industrial symposium on the super collider we 
cant get the votes on the floor of the house alone 
the collider awarded to texas after an intense struggle among 
several states will consist of an underground loop 54 miles in 
diameter to be built south of dallas the precise location of the 
loop was revealed thursday at the symposium 
the collider would use powerful electromagnets to send streams 
of protons traveling at nearly the speed of light smashing into 
each other the collisions would produce even smaller particles 
leading to a better understanding of the nature of matter 
four other members of congress at the conference joined roe in 
urging a campaign of support 
make no mistake this is not a done deal said us rep jim 
chapman dtexas 
of the 75 billion the committee is expected to recommend 
spending on the project over approximately 10 years no more than 
5 billion should come from the federal government roe said most 
estimates put the final price tag of the super collider at 8 
billion 
the remainder would come from texas foreign contributors who 
could serve as contractors or research partners and from 
innovative financing one possibility roe said would be to lease 
some of the buildings on the campus planned to house the colliders 
staff of 3000 scientists and support workers 
critics say money spent on the super collider could be better 
used to meet concrete needs such as housing and improved education 
but supporters point to benefits of the competing cern particle 
physics project outside geneva switzerland fourteen nations 
cooperate in that project which is said to have brought better 
housing improved the job market in the area and led to inventions 
for every dollar we spend on the collider well at least 
bring back five dollars that wasnt there before roe said 
cern is a model but could become a threat if the collider isnt 
built some scientists say 
its important that you have good research opportunities for 
faculty so that we dont undergo a brain drain of us 
scientists said marvin gettner particle physics professor at 
northeastern university in boston who has worked at the swiss 
facility

northwest airlines on friday fired three 
pilots accused of flying while legally intoxicated saying the 
cockpit crew violated company rules by operating the jetliner 
within 12 hours of drinking 
each of the pilots on the 625 am flight from fargo nd to 
the twin cities on march 8 had bloodalcohol levels exceeding 04 
percent a violation of federal regulations the company said 
northwest pilots have established a reputation for airmanship 
and safety company spokesman alan muncaster said all of us at 
northwest are now challenged to win back our reputation for flight 
excellence 
the federal aviation administration had already revoked the 
pilots licenses after its own investigation showed that the 
cockpit crew boarded the flight within eight hours of drinking the 
federal limit northwest imposes a stricter span of 12 hours 
northwest flight 650 carrying 91 passengers landed safely at 
the minneapolisst paul international airport where the cockpit 
crew was arrested by the faa and airport police 
dismissed were capt norman prouse 51 conyers ga 1st 
officer robert kirchner 35 highland ranch colo and 2nd officer 
joseph balzer 34 antioch tenn none of the three has any 
previous alcohol or drugrelated incidents on their flying records 
the company said 
balzers attorney bruce hanley of minneapolis said he hasnt 
taken a formal position on the firing calls to kirchner could 
not get through because the phone was busy and prouse has an 
unlisted telephone number 
the air line pilots association the union representing 
northwests 5400 pilots and about 36600 other pilots issued a 
statement out of washington on friday saying it has no tolerance 
whatsoever toward drugs or alcohol in the cockpit 
any airline pilot would be outraged and would take it as an 
affront to his profession if it were proven that a cockpit crew 
flew impaired as alleged in this incident the union statement 
said 
but the statement emphasized that the three northwest pilots are 
entitled to a fair hearing on the accusations 
the national transportation safety board has scheduled an 
appeals hearing before an administrative law judge april 36 in 
minneapolis for the three crew members all three were expected to 
appeal the license revocation although kirchner was the only pilot 
to file an appeal by friday said drucilla andersen an ntsb 
spokeswoman 
the pilots also face possible criminal prosecution by the city 
of minneapolis and by the chief prosecutor in cass county north 
dakota 
the pilots were drinking at the speak easy a moorhead minn 
restaurant and lounge late the night before they flew the boeing 
727 and a tipster informed the faa officials said 
the plane took off while an inexperienced federal inspector in 
fargo was telephoning his superiors to ask what to do associate 
faa administrator anthony broderick told a congressional committee 
wednesday 
northwest said friday that the inspector spoke to each of the 
pilots at the fargo airport but did not stop the flight 
balzer issued a statement thursday saying he offered to take a 
breath test urine test or blood test for the faa investigator 
before boarding the plane in fargo he said he was not required to 
do so 
i offered to cooperate fully balzer said it is absurd to 
suggest that the plane could take off from the fargo airport 
without proper authorization from the control tower which is 
operated by the faa and manned by faa controllers 
fred farrar an faa spokesman in washington said friday that 
the inspector instructed the cockpit crew that they could be in 
violation of faa regulations by flying the plane the crew decided 
to fly the plane despite the warning farrar said 
the faa inspector in fargo telephoned minneapolis after the 
flight departed from fargo setting up the arrest

lebanon during the israeli siege of beirut in an unsuccessful 
attempt to gain freedom for a captured israeli soldier 
nathan 63 was sentenced to six months in prison after pleading 
guilty to meeting arafat and other plo officials in tunis in 1988 
he entered an israeli prison near tel aviv on oct 10 1989 and 
his penalty was reduced by two months for good behavior 
 
when he was freed feb 9 he passed through the prison gates and

engineers managed to shift a wayward private 
communications satellite out of harms way friday at least 
temporarily and an aerospace company offered equipment for a 
possible salvage mission by a space shuttle 
engineers were able to send the intelsat vi satellite to a new 
higher orbit where it wont be drawn back to earth by the 
thickening atmosphere 
the satellite failed to separate from its launch vehicle a 
commercial titan 3 rocket after liftoff from cape canaveral on 
wednesday and was trapped in a useless orbit that swung within 103 
miles of earth 
on friday rocket builder martin marietta attributed the failure 
to a wiring problem in its titan 3 launch vehicle that was 
undetected by the processes and test procedures used in 
prelaunch checkout 
kerry masson a martin marietta spokeswoman in denver said the 
signal failed to make it from an onboard computer to the mechanism 
that was to separate the rocket and the satellite 
without that separation a motor attached to the satellite was 
unable to propel the spacecraft to its duty station 22300 miles 
above earth when engineers finally separated the sent rockets the 
booster rocket remained with the launch vehicle and both were 
expected to fall back to earth soon 
intelsat the international communications consortium which owns 
the 150 million uninsured satellite fired small onboard thrusters 
and raised the satellites orbit by nearly 60 miles that put the 
5ton satellite out of immediate reach of the atmosphere 
this is very good news said tony trujillo spokesman for 
the 118nation consortium we feel much better about the mission 
right now 
right now we are concentrating discussing with nasa on the 
possibility of assistance trujillo said such assistance would 
have to come from the space shuttle 
orbital sciences corp a small virginia aerospace company sent 
a letter to various parties including intelsat and nasa offering 
a newly developed rocket assembly that can be attached to a 
stranded satellite in orbit 
specifically the osc plan is to carry a replacement perigee 
motor to orbit on the shuttle mate the motor to the satellite and 
complete the mission from orbit rather than returning the satellite 
to earth for refurbishment and relaunch said the letter to nasa 
administrator richard truly and others 
the device called a transfer orbit stage or tos is designed to 
boost spacecraft from low earth orbit to the 22300 milehigh 
altitude at which communications satellites operate the device was 
qualified for space flight only in january 
we havent proposed anything said robert lovell a vice 
president of orbital sciences but he said the company has talked 
with colleagues about using the transfer stage if the shuttle were 
made available 
the tos could be sent up in the shuttle astronauts would 
attach it to the spacecraft and send it on its way lovell said 
only one transfer orbit stage has been built the engineering 
model used in qualification tests lovell said thats the one that 
would be offered for the rescue 
while the satellite was in a 103 mile by 218 mile orbit nasa 
said it would not consider a rescue the low point of that orbit 
brushes the upper edge of the atmosphere and the satellite was 
given only a nineday life 
nasa has performed five spectacular space rescues the latest

useless orbit because their attached rockets didnt ignite johnson 
space center spokesman kyle herring said that mission which 
involved spacewalks required nine months of planning

in its new orbit 161 miles at the low point the intelsat 
satellite can stay in space for months moreover because the 
satellite had enough steering fuel to last for 13 years there is 
plenty left to keep it out of the grip of the atmosphere 
the satellite was propelled into space at a cost of about 270

bassil who wait in cyprus for andersons release 
the world without god is not the world its hell a home

and difficult life is without you ms bassil wrote 
we are in as much captivity terry only our living space is

associated press he has been held longer than any of the 18 
western hostages in lebanon most of the others who include eight 
americans have been held at least three years and the prayers

allahu akbar

keep open lines of communications with all parties including iran 
who have influence over hostage takers he said in a letter to 
peggy say andersons sister 
but thursday the president said there were no immediate 
prospects for the hostages freedom and said he was perplexed by 
the recent wave of speculation about a possible hostage 
release this included reports in iranian newspapers recently 
saying the hostage issue should be resolved 
however on thursday a group holding three american educators 
threatened to kill them unless their demands were met it did not 
specify its demands 
earlier in the month another faction denounced media reports of 
possible hostage releases and said it had no intention of freeing 
its captives 
anderson is held by islamic jihad it has demanded the release 
of comrades jailed in kuwait for bombing the us and french 
embassies in december 1983 
mrs say met privately with bush and his wife at the white 
house then spoke at a ceremony across the street at lafayette 
park directing her remarks to her brothers captors she said 
you complain that your story has not been told and yet the man 
who would tell it has been chained to a basement wall for five 
years 
i dont want to punish them i dont want to hunt them down i 
just want my brother back but im not going to pay them for doing 
so she said 
louis d boccardi president and general manager of the 
associated press said at the ceremony at this point the 
greatest gift we can give him is to press on to not falter to 
find an honorable way to get the job done if you know terry 
thats what hes thinking too 
those attending included the rev lawrence martin jenco a 
former hostage who spent time locked up with anderson before his 
release in 1986

a former ally of president kenneth kaunda 
denounced the prominent african leader friday as a dictator and 
called for democracy during a ruling party convention 
the convention had been called to decide whether to keep 
oneparty rule or allow multiparty democracy but kaunda announced 
wednesday that the current system in place since 1973 would 
remain 
the attack on kaunda came from sikota wina who was once a 
cabinet minister and belonged to the central committee of the 
ruling united national independence party 
wina made his criticisms in an open letter circulated friday 
among 1000 delegates to the fifth national convention of the 
party the only lawful political movement in zambia a landlocked 
nation in southern africa 
kaunda led the british colony of northern rhodesia to 
independence as zambia in 1964 
wina drummed out of the party over 10 years ago for criticizing 
authoritarian rule slammed kaundas homegrown philosophy of 
humanism 
in his letter wina said the country at present is run as a 
dictatorship masked behind the cloak of a meaningless slogan called 
humanism 
he also said the top leadership and their offspring had 
committed economic sabotage he said they feel they are above 
the law 
wina said the convention should restore the multiparty system 
inherited from zambias colonial ruler he also called for a limit 
in the terms a president can serve 
wina has made few public statements since 1986 when he was 
detained first in india and then at home on accusations of drug 
trafficking he was later freed because of lack of evidence and he 
has generally concentrated on private business since then

the government friday released a proposed bill 
of rights to reassure hong kong residents that china will respect 
their political and economic system for 50 years after the 
territory reverts to chinese rule 
however lawmaker martin lee called the document 
unacceptable because he said it could be changed by future 
legislatures 
beijing has pledged to guard human rights in hong kong and 
retain this british colonys legal and capitalistic systems for a 
halfcentury after it assumes control of hong kong in 1997 
the proposed bill of rights hong kongs first amends the 
colonial constitution to incorporate the provisions of the 
international covenant on civil and political rights 
the bill of rights as the embodiment of the covenant will be 
the benchmark by which all laws enacted in hong kong will be 
tested said secretary for constitutional affairs michael suen 
suen said it would be almost impossible and very complicated 
to repeal the bill 
however the bill was criticized by some members of the hong 
kong lawmaking legislative council 
legislator jimmy mcgregor told the governmentfunded radio hong 
kong that the draft was not in the best interest of the people he 
said it could be easily repealed by the government after 1997 
the bill allows for anyone who feels his rights have been 
violated to seek redress in any court or tribunal in the territory 
in an emergency the bill gives the government the right to take 
actions that would infringe on the civil rights convenant but 
these measures could not restrict certain basic rights such as the 
right of life or freedom of conscience and religion 
the government hopes to enact the bill in july 
it decided to consolidate all the human rights provisions from 
various ordinances into a bill of rights because of mounting 
concern in hong kong that china would renege its pledges after 1997 
confidence in those pledges has evaporated since beijings june 
34 military crackdown on the studentled chinese movement for 
democratic reforms

two men arrested in a nineton cocaine 
bust described as the nations secondlargest pleaded guilty 
friday to a reduced charge of possessing less than one ounce of 
cocaine 
prosecutor ed cyganiewicz said he agreed to the plea bargain 
because he feared the state court jury might give a lenient 
sentence or even probation jurors might have been sympathetic 
because the defendants worked only as mules or laborers for 
drug kingpins who arent in custody he said 
defense attorneys welcomed the plea bargain entered in the 
middle of a trial after the prosecution rested its case based on 
the seizure of 18360 pounds of cocaine at a farm house last year 
youve got to admit theres a big difference between 18360 
pounds and one ounce said defense attorney hector villarreal 
said 
defendants hermenegildo sosa rivas 51 and guadencio garcia 
garcia 39 both mexican citizens face two to 20 years in prison 
and fined 10000 on the seconddegree felony charge 
the original firstdegree felony charge of possessing more than 
400 grams could have brought them life in prison and a 100000 
fine 
under texas law possession of less than 28 grams one ounce 
of cocaine is a seconddegree felony carrying a two to 20year 
sentence possession of more than an ounce is a firstdegree 
felony with harsher penalties that increase further if the amount 
exceeds 400 grams or about ninetenths of a pound 
texas department of public safety narcotics agents arrested sosa 
and garcia on oct 4 1989 during the siezure in harlingen in 
southern texas 
the only larger us cocaine seizure the department said was a 
20ton cache found in a los angelesarea warehouse the week before 
the prosecutor said he would ask judge darrell hester to impose 
the maximum penalty of 20 years at the sentencing scheduled for 
may 4 
defense attorney villarreal maintained that sosa and garcia took 
a job as day laborers oct 4 unaware the job was packing cocaine 
for shipment he said drug smugglers locked them in the house after 
they arrived 
the prosecutor countered that the house was unlocked and the 
men could have escaped any time or telephoned for help during the 
four hours they worked at the house

usbacked opposition 
in el salvador leftist rebels said tuesday theyve called off 
assassination attempts on civilian officials and attacks on public

down their arms before talks get under way

contact with the rebels if they showed willingness to negotiate

the lone codefendant of manuel noriega in a 
tampa drug and moneylaundering case once accompanied the ousted 
panamanian strongman to washington to meet with oliver north and 
william casey an attorney said 
but enrique kiki pretelt a panamanian jeweler went along 
on the 1983 trip purely to socialize according to defense attorney 
george tragos 
pretelt also went with noriega to havana in 1984 for talks with 
cuban president fidel castro again pretelt claims it was merely 
in a social capacity 
tragos filed a motion thursday in federal court in tampa seeking 
access to classified government documents he says will show his 
clients frequent contacts with noriega didnt involve drug 
smuggling or money laundering 
pretelt and noriega were indicted in 1988 on charges of taking 
bribes from tampabased drug smugglers to help ferry 300 million 
worth of colombian marijuana safely through panama 
the governments case involves guilt by association but only 
the government has information which can disprove these 
allegations tragos said 
pretelt went underground soon after the us invasion of panama 
on dec 20 noriega also fled taking refuge for 10 days at a 
vatican diplomatic building before surrendering to us agents on 
jan 3 
pretelt 47 surrendered to fbi agents in panama on jan 17 and 
was brought to tampa he pleaded innocent in january and is being 
held at an undisclosed site 
federal investigators are thought to be trying to strike a deal 
but tragos says hes preparing for trial 
noriega is in prison near miami awaiting trial there next 
january on drugsmuggling charges a federal indictment in miami 
says noriega was paid off by the medillin cartel of colombian drug 
smugglers to allow use of panama for shipping drugs and drug money 
that indictment says noriega went to cuba for a meeting that 
castro mediated with cocaine traffickers who were upset with the 
panama military after a cocaine laboratory was raided 
according to tragos motions here noriega went to washington in 
november 1983 to seek us approval for the election of nicolas 
ardito barletta as panamas president 
noriega met separately with former marine lt col oliver north 
and other members of the national security council with casey 
late head of the cia and other agency officials and with langhorn 
e motley then assistant secretary of state for interamerican 
affairs the motions state 
pretelt was not present at any of the official discussions and 
was again only present for social gatherings with general 
noriega tragos wrote 
he wants records from the bank of credit and commerce 
international that he claims will prove pretelt wasnt involved in 
any illegal activity the bank pleaded guilty to moneylaundering 
charges in january and agreed to forfeit a record 14 million plus 
interest

hundreds of thousands of college 
financial aid applications nationwide are being delayed because of 
processing problems at the firm that analyzes them for schools a 
company official said friday 
what would take two to three weeks to process at this time of 
the year is now running four to five weeks said kathleen 
brouder director of information services at the college 
scholarship service part of the educational testing service 
the data processing center is the financial aid division of the 
college board and is the starting point for financial aid 
applications for about 3 million students every year 
the service analyzes financial aid applications which detail 
family assets and income to make sure they comply with federal 
financial aid rules and determine how much aid students should 
receive then sends the analysis to the colleges chosen by the 
students 
ms brouder said the delays were partly caused by new federal 
procedures and partly by an engineering problem several weeks ago 
in a scanner used to review applications automatically the firm 
had to switch to a slower manual process for several days while 
the scanner was repaired 
she said this is the peak time of year for financial aid 
applications when students must meet college deadlines to apply 
for aid for the coming school year 
colleges are being notified of the delays ms brouder said 
so far this year the center has received 11 million 
applications she said

chuck martin a spokesman for martin feed mills ltd said high 
levels of the poultry medication monensin were found in 90kilogram 
198pound bags of its technical growth puppy food

were far higher than allowable for poultry feeds and the substance 
is not allowed in pet foods martin was quoted as telling the 
canadian press from company operations at elmira ontario 
the company also makes poultry feed but in a separate building 
martin feed ordered a recall of 1263 bags of the puppy food 
distributed in canada east of thunder bay ontario an additional

lactating mothers often used by breeders and trainers it is 
available only from pet food suppliers and veterinarians 
martin feed mills notified canadian dealers breeders and 
veterinarians bags sold in the united states were being traced 
about 40 percent of the contaminated lot has been returned so

the 253yearold charitable irish 
society is marking st patricks day by taking a bold step 
inaugurating its first woman president 
theyre quite pleased i think they feel its about time 
said william connaughton a former president of the bostonbased 
society which calls itself the oldest irish immigrant organization 
in the united states 
catherine b shannon a westfield state college professor was 
scheduled to be installed saturday as president it was a major 
development for a society that didnt admit women to its ranks 
until the early 1980s 
i think that what happened was there were a lot of men who 
were coming onto the board who were in their 40s and 50s who said 
this is ridiculous stag dinners are not that much fun 
shannon said 
shannon said irish history is her field of study and she also 
has researched the role of women in modern ireland giving her a 
unique perspective in her new job 
what i think is most important is to have us focus on what our 
tradition has been to be of service to those who are in distress 
or need she said this week i think women are perhaps uniquely 
prepared to recognize that very quickly and early on 
the society dates back to 1737 when it was founded by mainly 
protestant businessmen in boston to help immigrant irish of both 
faiths 
shannon who joined the society in 1985 said she hoped to lead 
the organization in recruiting more young members and reaching out 
to recent immigrants

a federal judge struck down most of the 
navys program of random drug tests for 80000 civilian employees 
saying the pentagon failed to limit the practice to jobs affecting 
safety or military secrets 
us district judge d lowell jensen in a ruling made public 
friday also overturned the navys plan for drug testing any of its 
325000 civilian employees who cause an accident involving injury 
or property damage 
he said the navy failed to limit postaccident testing to 
serious accidents and gave local commanders too much authority to 
decide who would be tested 
the ruling is one of a series of decisions from lower federal 
courts on drug testing programs ordered for all federal agencies 
under president reagan in 1986 the supreme court upheld testing of 
some railway workers and customs service job applicants last year 
but didnt rule on random drug testing 
this decision proves that theyll not allow the government to 
subject federal workers to agency drug testing programs without 
adequate justifications said diane witiak of the american 
federation of government employees which represents 74000 
civilian navy workers the court is looking at individual job 
duties 
assistant us attorney george stoll said the government 
wouldnt comment friday 
jensen had blocked the entire navy civilian drug testing program 
just before it was to take effect in january his new ruling 
appeared to allow just a small fraction of the random testing 
program to go into effect though neither side in the case could 
provide any figures friday 
jensen described as overly broad the navys stated 
justifications for random tests for 80000 workers in 45 job 
categories those criteria include the workers relation to the 
operation or maintenance of equipment national security public 
health and safety protection of life and property or drug and 
alcohol rehabilitation 
the judge however upheld random testing of some of the 80000 
in certain job classes including law enforcement officers 
firefighters drivers and staff with access to topsecret 
information he also allowed testing of any navy employee based on 
reasonable suspicion of current drug use 
for example he said national security covers not only 
employees with access to topsecret information but also those 
involved in a broad range of policy and planningrelated work 
public health and safety includes lab technicians and dental 
hygienists and protection of life and property includes 
recordkeepers for rail lines 
the navy interests are so broadly defined as to describe 
virtually any duties of civilian navy employees jensen said 
only 80000 employees considered to have the most sensitive jobs 
out of the navys total of 325000 employees were targeted by the 
proposed random testing program 
in a separate ruling jensen prohibited postaccident drug 
testing of the 5800 civil service employees of the federal office 
of personnel management he said opm failed to limit the program to 
employees who actually cause accidents

a 19yearold record store employee was 
arrested on a felony charge thursday for selling a copy of the 
controversial rap album as nasty as they wanna be to an 
11yearold girl 
chauncey reese an employee at sarasotas tracks record 
store may be one of the first people arrested in florida for 
selling the recording by the miami group 2 live crew said sarasota 
police spokesman russ nugent 
im just glad that someone has decided to do something 
whatever it takes to keep this trash out of the hands of minors 
im just elated said the girls mother ann skolnick 
reese who is accused of selling the miami rap groups tape to 
the girl in january was taken into custody at 3 pm thursday 
after police investigated a complaint by the girls mother he was 
later released on his own recognizance 
she felt that the lyrics were obscene and had no business 
being listened to by her 11yearold daughter said nugent he 
did not know of any other such arrest in the state involving the 
rap groups recordings 
the state attorneys office decided to charge reese with one 
felony count of selling harmful materials to minors rather than a 
misdemeanor obscenity charge which would call for less jail time 
and a smaller fine nugent said 
the doublealbum was pulled from store shelves across the state 
after gov bob martinez asked a state prosecutor to consider 
branding the record obscene the prosecutor later said that ruling 
would have to come from local officials 
a judge in broward county said there was probable cause to rule 
the record obscene and deputies there told store owners they would 
be prosecuted if they didnt pull it off their shelves 
a sanitized version of the record titled as clean as they 
wanna be is still carried by many stores but sales have lagged 
behind the nasty version 
telephone messages left late thursday at reeses home were not 
immediately returned

geoff hoyle is a scholar but more important for 
audiences hes exceedingly funny 
the english performers feast of fools which he also wrote 
opened offbroadway thursday night at the westside arts theater 
it keeps an audience laughing all evening 
one example two tuxedoed waiters one haughty and the other a 
clumsy slob take turns appearing from behind a center screen they 
finally fight behind the screen of course the audience sees 
hoyles head sticking out from behind the screen on the floor with 
a foot bearing down on his neck 
rather than verbal jokes most of the evening consists of such 
visual humor some of it would look familiar to those who recall 
the clowns of vaudeville and burlesque but hoyle is fresh with old 
material as well as new and makes it all funny 
hoyle who has studied mime and theater and whose childhood 
heros were variety show comics divides his work into eight parts 
relating fools through the ages one of the fools functions he 
writes in program notes was to mock the establishment as the 
court jester who sometimes was the only person able to tell the 
king some basic truths 
the feast of fools sketch includes some audience 
participation hoyle designated part of the audience as bishops 
himself as bishop of fools in the annual festival and the rest of 
the audience as 12thcentury french peasants who hurl imaginary 
dung balls at the bishops 
next came two characters from 16thcentury italian commedia 
dellarte one equated wealth and virility which hoyle said in his 
opening remarks was a silly renaissance conceit with no relevance 
to the man of today 
the performer often used masks over the top half of his face 
some sketches contained broad vulgarity such as pratfalls caused 
by slipping on his own spit 
act 2 entered present times a tedious old gent on a stage 
making a meandering plea for funds telling a long joke without a 
punchline hed drive you crazy in life but hoyles audience was 
weak with laughter he was followed by balloonnosed mr sniff who 
found bad smells from one side of the audience and good from the 
other and by spare in which hoyle donned a coat over three 
pants legs and three feet and danced 
feast of fools has been performed in la jolla and san

the chairman of greyhound lines inc on thursday 
accused his companys union of terrorism and said he had little 
hope that renewed negotiations would lead to a new contract for 
striking bus drivers 
i believe these union leaders think they can win this 
strike through violence terrorism and intimidation and if they 
think that then i have very low expectations for the talks 
which resume saturday in arizona said fred g currey 
since the walkout began march 2 there have been 14 shooting 
attacks on buses 46 bomb threats recorded but no bombs found and 
numerous other incidents of vandalism or threats including vacant 
buses set on fire company officials said 
union leaders say they have disavowed the violence though 
jeffrey nelson spokesman for the amalgamated council of greyhound 
local unions conceded that union members may be responsible for 
some of the incidents 
we have repeatedly gone to union officials at the local level 
imploring them to let their own members know that this is not a way 
to solve a strike he said 
in the latest violence a bullet shattered a drivers windshield 
thursday shortly after the bus left the chattanooga tenn 
terminal en route to detroit greyhound spokeswoman dana neal said 
thursday night 
none of the approximately 43 passengers was injured ms neal 
said 
the evening before at least two shots struck a window on a bus 
traveling in the same area outside chattanooga police said no one 
was injured although the two passengers nearest the window got 
off police said 
authorities were investigating both incidents but had no 
evidence to link striking drivers to the shootings police said 
earlier this week eight passengers were injured when a sniper 
fired on a bus traveling to jacksonville fla 
also in florida st petersburg police said a striking bus 
driver is being investigated in connection with an apparent attempt 
to set an unoccupied bus on fire that was interrupted by a security 
guard 
nelson declined to say if the union was planning a revised 
proposal when talks resume 
currey said the company was returning to the bargaining table 
only because federal mediators indicated it might help end the 
strike he would not say if the company has a new offer but 
repeated past statements that greyhound can afford no more than the 
63 million threeyear contract it first suggested 
nelson said the unions concerns center on job security 
especially in the grievance procedures 
we are close on pay we are close on subcontracting of 
routes nelson said we are concerned about deletion of 
provisions that allow thirdparty independent mediation of 
employeemanagement disputes he said 
greyhound the nations only national intercity bus company has 
been operating at reduced levels since the strike began using 
permanent replacements and union members willing to cross the 
picket line 
spokesman george gravley said the company had carried more than 
600000 passengers since the strike began including 44364 
wednesday 417 percent of the load carried on the same day last 
year 
gravley said 37 percent of unionrepresented employees have 
crossed the picket lines most of them mechanics and office workers 
the company says 394 union drivers are at work joining 1002 
permanent replacements the union says only 94 of its drivers have 
crossed the line

logging of virgin forests in the pacific 
northwest will probably have to be reduced further to protect the 
northern spotted owl federal officials said thursday 
the conclusion was based a on preliminary version of a report 
from scientists that was made public in an unusual meeting of the 
federal governments top four land management officials 
the chiefs of the forest service bureau of land management 
fish and wildlife service and national park service traveled to 
portland to address the issue which pits environmentalists against 
the regions vital logging industry 
lawsuits filed by environmental groups to protect spotted owl 
habitat tied up logging of vast tracts of forest land until last 
year when congress approved a compromise freeing timber sales on 
much of the land that agreement expires sept 30 
the prime habitat for the spotted owl is the regions old growth 
forests tracts of mature timber that never have been logged the 
old growth forests also account for most of the timber sold from 
federal land 
the fish and wildlife service staff has recommended the owl be 
listed as a threatened species and final decision on the listing 
is due by june 23 
f dale robertson chief of the forest service summarized some 
of the implications of the draft report produced by a committee 
assigned to plan management of federal forest land to protect the 
owls habitat 
i would say that based on what i heard this morning the 
forest service is going to have to provide some additional 
protection over and above our existing spotted owl plan 
robertson said at a news conference but how much thats still 
to be worked out 
he said that would mean a further reduction in national forest 
timber sales the mechanism by which the government allows private 
companies to log government land 
of the 1500 pairs of owls known to exist in the forests of 
oregon washington and northern california more than 90 percent 
are on land managed by one of the four interior department agencies 
represented at thursdays meeting 
there are about 7 million acres of suitable habitat for the owl 
and that would be reduced to 27 million acres by the year 2050 if 
current timbersales practices continue according to a fish and 
wildlife service report 
in addition to robertson officials at the meeting were cy 
jamison director of the bureau of land management john turner 
director of the us fish and wildlife service and jim ridenour 
head of the national park service 
the four officials declined to discuss the specifics of the 
scientists report which was being circulated for review by 
officials throughout the affected agencies it is to be made public 
april 4 at a congressional hearing in washington 
if the owl were listed as a threatened species the forest 
service and bureau of land management would be required to meet 
specific requirements for protecting its habitat before approving 
any timber sale that could hamper efforts by the two agencies to 
reach the target set in last years compromise that 77 billion 
board feet of timber be sold by sept 30 
jamison of the bureau of land management said he agreed with 
robertsons conclusions about the need for further protection for 
the owl 
robertson said the meeting was believed to be the first outside 
washington dc to include the heads of all four agencies he 
said a series of such meetings was planned and it was decided to 
make the first one in portland because the spotted owl is such a 
pressing issue 
about 150 people from a prologging organization outside the 
hotel where the federal officials met to press their case for 
increased logging 
were all very concerned about the impacts our decisions are 
going to have in the pacific northwest and in the communities 
here robertson said

deputies stated clearly the soviet intention of ignoring any 
attempts by lithuania to back its defiance with actions until the 
conflict has been resolved it said the soviet constitution and 
laws remain in effect in the baltic republic

confrontational rhetoric and simply direct him to protect the 
rights of soviet citizens and the soviet union in the baltic

removing the tropical rain forest from the 
amazon river basin of south america would change forever the 
climate of that region and could affect the global weather a new 
study says 
once the trees are felled said jagadish shukla a professor of 
meteorology at the university of maryland the famed dense jungle 
forest along the amazon river will be gone forever 
you will never be able to regenerate the forests once you have 
cut them said shukla the coauthor of a study appearing today 
in the journal science 
shukla said wiping out the amazon river forest probably also 
would affect the worldwide climate because it would change the 
temperature of waters near the mouth of the river and perhaps 
disrupt weather patterns affected by those waters

masada rather than fall slaves to rome the memory of york jewrys 
fate has survived through the ages still strong enough eight 
centuries later to draw several hundred jews and a handful of 
christians to a memorial service thursday at the place where it 
happened 
the service opened a fourday program of lectures concerts and 
exhibitions organized by jewish and christian groups and the city 
of york to commemorate the slaughter of march 16 1190

of a londonbased journalist was not diminished by news of his 
robbery conviction but some lawmakers said it raises questions 
about his background and whether he was a spy

our dismay at the execution has been made quite clear by the

twenty years have changed the eden hotel 
which called itself the oldest and favorite shop in town serving 
the best nepalese hash now it caters to cleanshaven trekkers 
the ready availablility of hashish at the eden and nearby 
establishments and the bearded longhaired westerners who bought 
it earned jhochhen road the nickname freak street 
although the hashish and flower children are gone a generation 
later along with the eden posters saying let us take you 
higher jhochhen road is still known as freak street 
nepal has outlawed the sale of drugs and the eden now serves a 
credible approximation of european cuisine to western tourists who 
happen by about 150000 visit nepal each year 
hippies have given way to trippies says the insight guide to 
nepal and there is rarely a whiff of illicit smoke and not a 
bare breast to be seen in public 
many trekkers prefer thamel a district for budget travelers 
about a mile to the north where such amenities as private baths 
and hot water are easier to find than on freak street 
times have changed but the old ones linger in many minds 
chaitanya lal srestha a doctor who uses the initials wf for 
world famous before his name remembers the visitors of the late 
1960s and early 1970s 
so many of them came to me for cures he said in an 
interview at his clinic a tiny illventilated alcove lined with 
herbs in glass bottles i was famous on freak street because i 
used the ayurvedic system of medicine which does not have any side 
effects unlike the western allopathic system 
the tourists had many problems he said they werent very 
clean and their lives were odd they often fell sick 
few tourists visit srestha now he spends much of his time 
visiting friends on freak street a stooping man in his 50s who 
shambles from restaurants to shops reflecting with their owners on 
more affluent days 
nhuchhe narayan manandhar who owns a freak street hotel called 
the sayami lodge said i remember the groups of tourists who 
used to gather on the street and smoke chillums 
chillums are clay pipes usually filled with hashish or 
marijuana 
manandhar a dourfaced man of middle years said he still was 
wary of western tourists 
i dont give out my rooms to a single person he said 
stay with someone and its ok less chances of trouble 
some years ago a german checked in alone and died because of 
too many drugs he said in a mixture of nepali and english we 
didnt know until the next morning i still think if there was 
someone with him in the room he could have been saved 
rooms at the sayami lodge cost about 2 a night making it among 
the cheapest in the city a few minutes from manandhars are sights 
that include the old palace with its wooden lattice windows and 
ornate carvings and durbar square in an area of at least 50 hindu 
temples 
you cant see many freaks now manandhar said waving toward 
the narrow cobbled street crowded with lowbudget travel agencies 
restaurants secondhand bookshops and stores selling 
mountaineering equipment 
dipendra purush dhakal nepals director of tourism said 
todays tourist spends more money and stays in katmandu three days 
during a trip to nepal that averages 12 days 
that means most visitors go to other places he said the 
hippies didnt go anywhere outside katmandu and didnt spend much 
money 
two reasons the hippies have disappeared are the 1972 ban on the 
sale of narcotics and the requirement that a western visitor who 
stays in nepal more than 30 days buy 10 worth of the local 
currency for each of those days 
only two shops still have address boards proclaiming freak 
street the scores of others have reverted to the original 
jhochhen which means a line of houses

the countrys leaders have admonished 
rich indonesians for years not to flaunt their wealth with luxury 
homes or other conspicuous consumption 
now president suharto wants businessmen to help redistribute 
wealth by selling shares in their companies to cooperatives 
home minister rudini declared in 1988 it is an insane idea 
for people to compete to build mansions similar to the white house 
they are asocial 
retired adm sudomo coordinating minister for general policy 
and security said last year the slow spread of wealth was a 
greater danger to stability than any political or military threat 
sudomo said the side effects of economic development were 
not moving rapidly enough to cope with all the social problems so 
we can narrow the gap between the rich and the poor 
last month suharto said of course we cannot avoid 
differences in levels of income and abilities but these 
differences should not be allowed to grow into a social gap that is 
contrary to the spirit of togetherness 
we must recognize these differences and take steps to minimize 
them before it is too late 
per capita annual income is less than 500 in this nation of 178 
million people the gap between rich and poor is great and a middle 
class began to emerge only in the last generation 
in his annual budget speech in january suharto urged companies 
to sell 25 percent of their shares to cooperatives so the coops 
could become a national economic force he suggested making 
loans to poorer cooperatives to help them buy the shares 
businessmen were surprised by the proposal and many dismissed it 
as a populist response to criticism of powerful conglomerates 
indonesia has 34000 cooperatives with about 26 million members 
they were established to give small farmers the advantages of mass 
buying and marketing and to help introduce modern methods in 
handicraft and cottage industries 
cooperatives enshrined in the constitution were intended as an 
economic complement to stateowned enterprises and private 
companies 
suharto has promoted cooperatives as the ideal way to help the 
poor in a land where 70 percent of the people make their livings in 
the countryside 
unfortunately most cooperatives are perceived as poorly 
managed undercapitalized and burdened with bad debts of 6000 
rural credit coops a 1988 world bank report said 1272 are 
insolvent but not entirely hopeless while 1658 are candidates for 
dissolution or liquidation 
some businessmen startled by the idea of selling shares to 
cooperatives hope suhartos suggestion was a pep talk rather than 
a new government policy of divestiture 
as explained by radius prawiro coordinating minister for 
economy finance and industry this is an appeal and not an 
entirely new policy helping one another must not be spelled out by 
legislation this is an appeal to the private sector to give 
cooperatives a chance to own part of the equity 
prawiro and other senior officials said private companies would 
not be compelled to sell stock to cooperatives but it was not made 
clear how such transfers might occur without compulsion 
business analysts said few privately held companies would 
voluntarily sell shares to cooperatives or lend money to finance 
the purchases 
suhartos proposal followed months of statements by economists 
politicians and educators that efforts to deregulate the economy in 
recent years benefited big enterprises at the expense of small 
ones especially of cooperatives 
there were complaints that many of indonesias largest companies 
are controlled by ethnic chinese who make up less than 5 percent 
of the population but have great influence 
any belief that the suharto proposal would fade away ended with 
a major presidential gesture march 4 on that sunday he was host 
on his farm at tapos 45 miles south of jakarta to 31 of 
indonesias business leaders most of them ethnic chinese 
a more equitable distribution of incomes should be developed 
together with growth and stability otherwise social jealousy and 
upheaval may break out to annihilate all our achievements the 
jakarta post quoted him as saying 
he said conglomerates were useful in fighting tough 
international competition but should not become domestic 
monopolies because they can also manipulate prices causing the 
people to suffer the paper reported 
antara the national news agency quoted suharto as saying that 
the government hopes the selling of shares to cooperatives will 
proceed smoothly if the transactions do not run smoothly the 
government will take measures to see to it that they do 
if this fails to proceed the existing gap will only give rise 
to social envy and social upheavals antara quoted him as saying 
there will thus be no winners 
suharto told the businessmen the government would prepare a list 
of worthy cooperatives deemed to have the necessary financial 
resources 
that way he said you would not have to look for such 
cooperatives

michele scarabelli says her role on foxs 
alien nation as a melonheaded immigrant from the planet 
tencton is one of the most normal shes played on television 
she stars as susan francisco the mother of three and the first 
newcomer as the aliens are called to become pregnant she had the 
baby in february or rather her husband george did 
the way she became pregnant and the baby was born are among the 
intriguing traits devised for the newcomers in this series adapted 
from the 1988 motion picture of the same name 
ive never played a more normal role said scarabelli who 
was a homicidal psychopath on cbss dallas two years ago 
susan is very grounded very real she said i think 
thats because george is so quirky and compulsive susan is a 
counterpart to that oh george calm down susan was initially 
created to be very much a woman of the 90s the only outward 
difference is the head 
the franciscos like all the newcomers look like a less pointy 
version of the coneheads on saturday night live they have no 
hair or visible ears and their heads are covered with spots 
last november scarabellis character became pregnant with the 
help of two men one of them her husband in a ceremony both sexual 
and religious 
in february she ejected a pod that george played by eric 
pierpoint put into his marsupial pouch in the second of a 
twopart episode he went into labor prematurely and his police 
detective partner played by gary graham had to deliver the baby 
a daughter named vessna 
its amazing that these normal newcomer events happen during 
television ratings sweeps months 
i had a prosthetic belly button and this tentacle came out of 
it scarabelli said kids thought it was so gross but they 
loved it people were taken aback by it and enthralled at the same 
time 
scarabelli was born in canada and lived in venezuela during part 
of her childhood at 12 she was taken to france to stay with 
relatives she began working as a model but then studied at the 
montreal actors studio and moved to the second city workshop in 
toronto 
i played an acadian woman in the first film i did she said 
we shot it in a small town in new brunswick for canadian 
television i loved it it was called labour of love it was my 
first meaty part 
she starred in two feature films hotel new hampshire and 
cover girl and an nbc movie the ruling passion she also 
had guest roles in hbos philip marlowe and cbss night 
heat and was a regular on usa networks airwolf ii 
scarabelli said the viewer reaction to alien nation has been 
extraordinary its basically a detective show yet it has an 
underlying theme of tolerance for people who are different such as 
the newcomers 
weve gotten a lot of letters from teachers who say they use 
it as a teaching tool she said the jewish board of education 
which has jurisdiction over 400 schools in new york uses it 
because it addresses the issues of bigotry and prejudice weve 
also dealt with sexism 
in the movie a spaceship carrying 270000 slaves from tencton 
landed on earth integrating them into society takes some doing 
they turn out to have all the moral values of human beings as well 
as the vices and failings they also have some odd physiological 
characteristics and strange cultural customs these all figure 
heavily in the stories 
when we started we were like a bunch of kids with a new 
toy scarabelli said we were fascinated with all the 
possibilities i brought a lot of things with me i was raised in 
montreal but i wasnt french canadian or catholic so i could make 
an identification with being different 
after filming the pilot last year she flew to anchorage 
alaska to help in the cleanup of the exxon valdez tanker spill 
i was tired of watching the horror story on television she 
said we drove from anchorage to seward and spent several weeks 
there cleaning sea otters they look like cartoon characters we 
werent supposed to have eye contact so they wouldnt bond it was 
almost impossible not to look at them we saved about 150 but i 
dont know where they released them

if youre interested in buying a fish 
processing plant sugar refinery telephone company or even a 
former convent mexico is interested in you 
president carlos salinas de gortaris government is trying to 
sell hundreds of inefficient businesses and industries many 
nationalized more than 40 years ago that have beome a crippling 
drain on the budget 
motivations for taking over the companies were many to free the 
country from foreign exploitation improve the lot of workers save 
jobs avoid social unrest and bail out owners who had labor or 
profit problems 
after nationalization the companies became sinkholes of 
corruption and havens for political hacks from the ruling 
institutional revolutionary party 
two generations later privatization has become part of a 
strategy to reduce government subsidies improve efficiency and 
obtain new foreign investment and credit as mexico tries to emerge 
from seven years of economic crisis 
what we have to do and what we are doing in mexico is to 
create attractive conditions for doing business in mexico said 
angel gurria assistant treasury secretary in charge of foreign 
debt negotiations he mentioned the sale of stateowned companies 
as one of those conditions 
a disadvantage is the loss of thousands of jobs through layoffs 
either by the government before the sale or the new owners 
afterward 
heberto castillo a leader of the leftist opposition democratic 
revolutionary party estimated 200000 jobs were lost to 
privatization and modernization in the past year 
mexico under salinas has become in the eyes of its creditors a 
model for debtor nations it has opened the economy to foreign 
investment and imports brought down inflation and trimmed the 
bureaucracy and budget 
a state that is too busy administering its enterprises is 
neither just nor revolutionary salinas said nov 1 in his first 
state of the nation address 
in january he told residents of a poor suburb that some of the 
money from sales of state companies would be used to bring them 
services and that new owners of the companies would have to invest 
in creating jobs 
not everything is being sold 
under the constitution the government must own and control the 
oil monopoly petroleos mexicanos which includes the oil 
operations expropriated from foreign companies in 1938 basic 
petrochemical production electric power nuclear energy and 
radioactive minerals satellite communications railroads and mail 
service 
it has skirted the law by shifting many petrochemicals from 
basic to secondary categories thus permitting private and foreign 
investment 
even historic mines and steel companies some started by the 
government are included on the forsale list the real del monte y 
pachuca silver and gold mines which the aztecs worked before the 
spanish conquest have been sold 
of the 1155 companies the government owned seven years ago 194 
have been sold 322 closed and 75 merged with others according to 
the treasury department 
among items awaiting buyers are 11 fish processing plants seven 
sugar refineries two gas distributorships the national telephone 
company a coconut plant and the former convent 
the 1990 federal budget includes 14 billion in payments to 
stateowned enterprises that is up from 117 billion in 1989 but 
it includes social security payments and airport funds 
luis pazos an economist who runs a private research center on 
free enterprise said figures on how many companies and government 
operations have been sold or closed are unrealistic because many 
only existed on paper 
he also questioned the governments commitment if it really 
wants to divest itself the commercial banks nationalized in 1982 
should be returned to private hands and peasants who work 
stateowned farms should be given title to the land pazos said 
its going very slowly probably for political reasons he 
said there is still fear of the left 
some operations including steel plants are being held back 
while generous union contracts are renegotiated and the facilities 
are modernized 
we have found that without making certain changes there 
isnt anyone to buy them said alfredo genel director of 
industries at the commerce and industrial development department 
over the years not only union contracts but relations with 
suppliers then with clients became distorted he said they 
arent as rigorous in demanding the lowest price from suppliers 
they gave low prices or special terms to the clients they dont 
have a group of stockholders to answer to 
european countries found the steel industry could not be sold 
unless it was modernized he said 
a privatization success story is the airline aeromexico which 
was famous for delays and cancellations until it was sold late in 
1988 to a private consortium and the pilots union 
now it is known for ontime performance and better service 
financial figures were not available 
the government no longer is in the soft drink textile cement 
and dish manufacturing businesses among others 
as for the convent of santa catarina in oaxaca southern mexico 
it later was a jail and now is the hotel presidente 
several hotels are on the list of government offerings but only 
the operation of the hotel presidente will be sold because the 
building is a national monument

atampt has presented one of its main unions 
with a plan to sweeten pensions to encourage early retirements the 
companys latest move in a continuing effort to trim its workforce 
the communications workers of america had a mixed reaction to 
the proposal and offered a counter plan said spokesman steve 
rosenthal but no details available talks were to resume monday 
atampt said it held talks thursday with the cwa and its other main 
union the international brotherhood of electrical workers on 
plans that for the first time would offer early retirement for 
nonmanagement employees 
last year a special retirement plan for managers prompted 
12500 to depart out of 35000 who were eligible the company said 
the arrangement added five years to each managers age and 
tenure and boosted pension payments by 15 percent for five years 
or until a retired worker reached 65 
the company had few details about the plan because talks were in 
an early stage said company spokesman burke stinson at atampts 
basking ridge office though atampt is headquartered in new york the 
bulk of its operations are in new jersey 
the efforts are another step in a continuing goal to reduce 
overhead costs and consolidate operations stinson said 
though ibew spokesman tom hickman said he could not comment on 
the talks he said the idea of offering enhanced pensions to induce 
retirements is obviously something that were not opposed to 
probably less than 10000 people would be affected said stuart 
crane an analyst for gruntal amp co though he noted it is 
impossible to predict how many will accept the deal 
i just think theyre continuously putting the bait in front of 
the donkey to get him to drive away crane said 
crane said it is likely atampt will continue to try to pare down 
its workforce through the 1990s 
according to atampts stinson the company has steadily reduced 
its workforce since 1984 when bell telephone broke up into 
regional baby bell phone companies 
as atampt computerizes its operations with new digital and solid 
state technology it has increasing numbers of workers with less to 
do stinson said more switching and operator services are done by 
computer and digital equipment has made equipment installation 
easier 
also competition has forced atampt to pare away extra layers of 
employees that it could afford when it was a monopoly 
at the time of the breakup the company had 373000 employees 
they now employ 281400 173500 of whom are nonmanagement 
last year a total of 25000 jobs were cut some through 
attrition stinson said

if a slew of incentives wasnt enough to fog a 
carbuyers mind nissan motor corp is offering 100 to those who 
test its stanza sedan before buying a honda accord or toyota camry 
chrysler corp recently ended a similar program urging potential 
carbuyers to drive a chrysler product and stack it up against the 
competition that program which ran only last month applied to 
more cars than nissans does but carried a reward of just 50 
ever since the mid1970s when the federal trade commission 
relaxed a ban on using a competitors name in advertising 
companies have shown their products in action against the 
competition 
its becoming more and more popular because of credibility 
consumers see it and say well if their saying it it must be 
true melvin helitzer a former advertising executive who is a 
journalism professor at ohio university in athens said thursday 
the nissan and chrysler promotions designed to boost sales and 
get people into showrooms are the latest attempts by automakers to 
persuade consumers to compare products something smart shoppers do 
naturally 
those really are showroom traffic builders said jim 
wangers president of automotive marketing consultants inc of 
vista calif they say ive got enough confidence in my car and 
i will put it on the line with anybodys 
but what it really says is bring me more bodies 
chrysler and nissan dealers could use more bodies in their 
showrooms 
during the first two months of the year chryslers total 
vehicle sales of 305985 were down 14 percent compared with the 
yearago period and nissans total vehicle sales were 89974 off 
163 percent 
nissan spokesman ec mueller said the focus of the 100 
testdrive offer is to get people into the stanza a newly 
redesigned car 
the offer works like this a potential buyer test drives a 
stanza between feb 12 and april 30 and fills out an evaluation 
form the dealer reviews it keeps one copy sends another to 
nissan headquarters and gives one to the consumer 
if the consumer takes delivery of an accord or camry within 
seven days of the stanza test drive and attaches the purchase order 
to the copy of the nissan evaluation the consumer gets the 100 by 
mail from nissan in four to six weeks 
if the consumer buys the stanza mueller said theres no reward 
the results of chryslers 50 testdrive program are private 
information chrysler spokesman tom jakobowski said

a government dispute erupted friday over 
washingtons demand that japan open its markets and prompted prime 
minister toshiki kaifu to quickly intervene officials said 
the dispute at a regular cabinet meeting was between the 
ministers of trade and home affairs over how to handle us 
demands to abolish a law restricting the opening of large retail 
stores 
meanwhile us secretary of commerce robert mosbacher was 
ending trade talks in tokyo after meeting with five major users of 
semiconductors to encourage them to buy more from us producers 
mosbacher came to tokyo to follow up on the summit two weeks ago 
between president george bush and kaifu in palm springs calif 
and address ways to reduce japans 49 billion dollar trade surplus 
with the united states 
one move requested by us negotiators is to abolish japans law 
protecting small businesses from being overwhelmed by supermarkets 
or department stores moving into their neighborhoods 
during fridays cabinet meeting home affairs minister kaiwa 
okuda said japan should eliminate the law entirely said a home 
affairs ministry official 
okuda criticized the minister of trade and industry kabun muto 
because the trade ministry wants only to modify the law and make it 
quicker for large retailers to get permits to open stores said the 
official who spoke on condition of anonymity 
the home affairs minister said the trade ministers measure 
would be insufficient to solve the dispute with washington and 
urged the trade ministry to come up with stronger measures that 
would improve japanese standards of living the official said 
kaifu intervened before muto was able to respond the official 
said and the three met afterward it was not immediately clear 
whether the matter was resolved 
the dispute at the usually mundane meeting was the top item on 
noontime television news 
increasing the spread of largescale retailers is thought to 
raise the sales of imported goods as small neighborhood stores are 
less likely to stock foreignmade products 
mosbacher was to return to washington later friday during his 
four days in tokyo the commerce secretary met with kaifu foreign 
minister taro nakayama trade minister muto and officials of the 
countrys top business group the federation of economic 
organizations keidanren 
on thursday mosbacher urged japan to move into a close 
partnership with the united states to eliminate trade barriers 
if we do not act soon we may throw away our last chance to 
save the world trading system from serious damage mosbacher told 
reporters at the japan national press club

raise its discount rate today by as much as 1 percentage point from 
the current 425 percent in effect since last december to stem

a recent harvard university graduate who has 
traded securities since the seventh grade was accused by federal 
officials of misleading brokers so he would not lose money on deals 
andrew worden whose age was listed as 23 or 24 was described 
thursday as a selfemployed investor in a securities and exchange 
commission civil lawsuit filed in us district court in manhattan 
that charges him with securities law violations 
court papers said that despite his young age worden was an 
experienced securities trader having traded securities for his own 
account as well as making investments for family members 
lawrence iason the secs regional administrator in new york 
said in court papers that the alleged scheme was abhorrent 
because it tends to facilitate manipulation and excessive 
speculation 
according to the lawsuit worden most recently worked out of his 
manhattan apartment ordering securities for 41 different brokerage 
accounts by creating corporatesounding names to make his purchases 
if the stocks went up in value he would sell and make partial 
or delayed payments on the order the sec charged if the value 
dropped he would not pay at all and force the brokerage house to 
take the loss 
worden allegedly misled brokers by creating names for his 
accounts like convergence corp and worden management and 
giving false information about his finances 
the lawsuit said the alleged scheme took place between august 
1987 before his graduation from harvard in 1988 to the present 
it said worden avoided losses of 131353 and profited by at least 
2330 
wordens lawyer marc powers said thursday evening he had just 
received the lawsuit and would not comment

federated department stores inc and allied 
stores corp are giving a us bankruptcy court details of their 
twoyear 25 million retention program designed to keep top 
managers from joining competitors 
david g heiman a lawyer for the two cincinnatibased 
retailers told us bankruptcy judge j vincent aug jr at a 
hearing thursday that the plan would be filed today with augs 
court where federated and allied filed chapter 11 bankruptcy 
reorganization petitions two months ago 
the companies which have 260 stores and 100000 employees in 28 
states listed a total of 77 billion in debts accumulated when 
torontobased campeau corp bought allied in 1986 and federated in 
1988 
in the chapter 11 proceedings federated and allied must get the 
bankruptcy courts approval for spending proposals 
heiman also said he hopes the companies can file their 
reorganization plans sometime this year but said he could not be 
more specific 
lewis rosenbloom a lawyer representing thousands of federateds 
unsecured creditors said they have not been told when to expect 
the reorganization plans but would like to see them as soon as 
possible to more effectively review proposed spending by federated 
and allied 
youre dealing with some of these things in a vacuum and out 
of context rosenbloom said 
heiman said the manager retention plan will affect about 2300 
federated and allied employees nationwide including senior 
executives down through divisional merchandise managers focusing 
on a core of about 400 key executives the plan will cost between 
10 million and 11 million each of its two years with an 
additional 5 million discretionary pool that management can 
use to reward performance heiman said 
he described the plan as a basic program to provide job security 
assurances and performance bonuses aug will be asked to approve 
the program at a hearing april 12 heiman said 
rosenbloom said creditors support the retention program and 
realize the need for it but are concerned that it grants federated 
and allied substantial discretion in operating the plan 
heiman also told the judge that preliminary indications show 
federated and allied are enjoying better than expected sales this 
month after sustaining a poor fourth quarter heiman declined to 
give details of march sales 
aug on thursday also gave federated and allied permission to pay 
lawyers accountants and investment bankers on the basis of 
statements to be submitted monthly that will be shared with 
creditors 
the payments will be subject to stringent quarterly reviews 
heiman said he declined to say how much federated and allied have 
budgeted for those expenses 
aug told lawyers in the courtroom i am going to be reviewing 
these fees in minute detail im looking for evidence of abuse 
federated and allied will ask aug march 27 to approve spending 
to continue five store remodeling or construction projects valued 
at about 91 million these involve projects at bon marche stores 
in seattle and tukwila wash and eugene ore a goldsmiths 
store in memphis tenn and a bloomingdales store in palm beach

the chicago mercantile exchange says it will seek 
membership approval for dualtrading restrictions that would ban 
the controversial practice in most of the mercs financial futures 
markets 
the merc said thursday it had scheduled an april 17 referendum 
in which owners of the exchanges approximately 2700 seats will 
vote on whether to ban dual trading in any contract month with 
average daily volume of 10000 contracts with certain exceptions 
if adopted the proposal would require approval of the commodity 
futures trading commission the federal regulator of the futures 
markets which is considering a complete ban on dual trading 
congress also is considering dualtrading restrictions that 
would be potentially more severe than those proposed by the merc 
although the congressional plans would allow dual trading in 
markets with a proven ability to detect fraud 
dual trading is the widespread legitimate practice among floor 
brokers at futures exchanges of trading both for their own accounts 
and their customers 
critics of the practice contend it allows brokers to defraud 
their customers by positioning themselves to profit from large 
customer orders they know will move a market an illegal activity 
known as frontrunning that prevents customers from getting the 
best possible deal 
brokers are supposed to execute any customer orders before 
trading for their own accounts 
frontrunning is one of many fraud schemes alleged by the 
government in indictments against 48 people from the merc and the 
chicago board of trade 
the exchanges have generally defended dual trading claiming it 
improves the efficiency of their markets by effectively increasing 
the pool of buyers and sellers the more players in the market 
they say the faster a customer order can be executed 
the merc proposal addresses this liquidity issue by restricting 
dual trading on a contractmonth basis instead of banning the 
practice in an entire market 
for example in the mercs standard amp poors 500 stockindex 
futures pit contracts are currently traded for delivery in march 
june september and december each contract represents the basket 
of stocks tracked by the sampp 500 index 
of the four contract months listed only two march and june 
have average daily trading volume in excess of 10000 dual trading 
would be banned in those markets but not in the september and 
december contracts 
the merc proposal would label the highvolume contract months as 
mature liquid contracts most of the mercs stockindex and 
currency futures contracts would fall into that category but its 
agricultural futures would not said spokesman andrew yemma 
in contrast a bill passed last year by the house of 
representatives would ban dual trading in any futures market with 
an annual daily volume of at least 7000 trades for all contract 
months combined that restriction would apply to nearly all of the 
markets at the merc and the board of trade

the united food and commercial workers union has 
filed another unfair labor practice complaint against nordstrom 
inc this one contending the company is withholding documents 
essential to the bargaining process 
joe peterson ufcw local 1001 president said thursday that the 
company has refused to produce a number of important documents 
dealing with employee schedules 
the union contends the company recently allowed employees to 
change their schedules so they on company time could organize and 
attend an antiunion rally in seattle 
the company also is refusing to provide paperwork on backpay 
issues for which the union has already filed complaints peterson 
said 
company spokeswoman kellie tormey told kirotv thursday that the 
latest allegations are ludicrous and wishful thinking on the 
part of the union 
the first contract talks since january between the union and the 
company began thursday afternoon and ended after three hours 
peterson said thursday night 
we made no progress nordstrom seemed even more intransigent 
than ever he said adding nordstroms main goal is to 
eliminate the union 
nordstrom spokesmen could not be reached for further comment 
thursday evening 
the union has filed six complaints against nordstrom with the 
national labor relations board peterson said 
the board two weeks ago issued a complaint to the company for 
allegedly bargaining directly with employees on the issue of back 
wages a process peterson said is supposed to go through the union 
and the state department of labor and industries said in 
midfebruary that nordstrom had violated state law by failing to 
pay some employees for putting in time without compensation while 
attending company meetings writing customer thankyou notes and 
making deliveries 
the back pay could cost nordstrom many millions of dollars 
especially if its extended to include the companys 50000 current 
and former employees in washington oregon california virginia 
utah and alaska 
the 2000 sales office and display workers in king and pierce 
counties who are members of the union have been working without a 
contract since july 31 peterson said 
at issue are wages benefits grievance procedures job security 
and scheduling 
we are as far apart today as we were the first day we started 
talking last may peterson said

a glut of grain in india and pakistan 
credit problems in egypt and higher shipping costs are being blamed 
for a suddenlyweak market for soft white wheat grown in the 
northwest 
theres just not much grain moving here tom winn oregon 
wheat commission administrator said of the port of portland 
bids for soft white wheat have fallen more than 1 during the 
past year to 376 a bushel thursday in portland winn said

wes grilley of pendleton executive vice president of the 
9000member oregon wheat growers league 
oregons soft white wheat is used in asia for noodles cookies

is used in unleavened bread and pita bread 
grilley said india and pakistan had a bumper crop last year and 
another is predicted this year 
egypt is desperate to get more wheat but they need credit 
he said 
grilley also blamed the cargo preference provisions of the food 
for peace program which require the bulk of federal aid exports to 
be shipped on usflag vessels 
recently on a sale to egypt the us vessels were charging 
27 more per ton from the west coast than from the east coast and 
the foreign flag vessels were charging 1 a ton more grilley

the northwest he said was hit harder than other regions of the 
country prices for midwest dark northern spring wheat and hard red

washington public power supply system bondholders 
could receive as much as 32 cents on the dollar under an agreement 
between two groups sharing a 753 million settlement fund 
for some bondholders the payoff could be as little as 10 cents 
for each of the 1 bonds 
the payment agreement announced thursday requires federal 
court approval said new yorkbased chemical bank trustee of the 
wppss bond fund payments would be made june 1 1991 
sharing in the settlement would be holders of the defaulted 
wppss bonds which were sold to finance two sinceabandoned nuclear 
power plants and members of a classaction lawsuit that alleged 
fraud against the supply system northwest utilities and other 
parties 
original investors who have held the bonds through most of this 
decade will be able to collect as both bondholders and members of 
the classaction suit 
the 753 million fund was collected from settlements made 
before during and after the giant fraud case went to court before 
us district judge william browning in september 1988 defendants 
in the case included 88 northwest utilities the supply system 
bond underwriters engineering firms and wppss advisers 
the case was settled out of court after three months of trial 
the case consolidated dozens of lawsuits filed after wppss 
defaulted on 225 billion in bonds sold to finance construction of 
unfinished nuclear plants wppss nos 4 and 5 the default was the 
biggest in the history of the municipal bond market 
jeffrey klafter attorney for the classaction plaintiffs said 
the recommended settlement would pay about 22 cents on the dollar 
to those with a claim who had retained their bonds the award would 
be less for those who sold their bonds at reduced prices he said 
the bond fund managed by chemical bank will receive some of 
the 753 million and also has received money from the sale of scrap 
parts from the abandoned plants the fund will total 210 million 
said chemical bank vice president william berls enough to pay 
bondholders only about 10 cents on the dollar thus some plaintiffs 
would receive the 22 cents plus 10 cents per dollar invested 
those who purchased bonds after wppss missed its payments in 
june 1983 leading to default the next month would apparently 
receive the least from the settlement fund those bonds have been 
considered speculative and many of the buyers paid original 
purchasers as little as eight or nine cents on the dollar 
berls said all parties should be pleased with the agreement 
given the litigation risks given the time we have saved everyone 
and the uncertainties of appeals 
the two sides also agreed to repay the bond fund 52 million for 
previous litigation expenses in addition 50 million and 435 
million in interest will be transferred from the settlement fund to 
the bond fund on june 1 1991 
also expected to come out of the settlement fund is nearly 100 
million that has been requested by lawyers for the classaction 
plaintiffs browning has yet to decide on the eventual payoff for 
lawyers 
another lawsuit still before browning could result in 400 
million in payoffs for bondholders that suit against wppss and 
the bonneville power administration alleges expenses for two other 
supply system plants were unfairly billed to plants nos 4 and 5

suddenly it seems that proxy battles are in 
with corporate predators making them the latest trend in takeovers 
but while directors of several big companies have become 
targeted for removal by dissident investors it remains to be seen 
how successful these ploys are 
the boards of lockheed corp and avon products inc face proxy 
fights by corporate suitors at their upcoming annual meetings 
meanwhile usx corp has averted a threatened proxy battle with 
carl icahn by agreeing to put his proposal for selling the 
companys steel business to a shareholder vote 
proxy fights essentially a contested shareholder election for 
control of management have regained some of their luster as other 
takeover methods such as junk bondfinanced hostile buyouts have 
lost theirs 
highrisk junk bonds were raiders tool of choice during the 
hostile takeover binge of the 1980s but with the collapse of 
several junkfinanced companies and the bonds main purveyor 
drexel burnham lambert inc some wouldbe acquirers think its 
easier to seize control through proxy battles 
investor harold simmons plans a proxy fight at lockheeds march 
29 annual meeting because hes unhappy with the current boards 
management of the defense and aerospace company he thinks he can 
do a better job of deploying its assets and cutting costs thereby 
increasing the value of his lockheed stock 
simmons who is lockheeds biggest shareholder with 19 percent 
of its stock has nominated a slate of directors that includes such 
highpowered names as former texas sen john tower and retired 
admiral elmo zumwalt jr a former member of the joint chiefs of 
staff 
at a news conference this week simmons was undaunted when a 
reporter noted that proxy fights notably icahns unsuccessful 
1988 attack on the board of texaco inc generally have had little 
success 
simmons said of icahn who is chairman of trans world airlines 
hes not basically a manager simmons and icahn both are viewed 
as corporate raiders but simmons believes he has a better track 
record after running companies like nl industries inc amalgamated 
sugar co and keystone steel and wire co 
simmons thinks that should carry some weight with lockheed 
shareholders he also believes his chances for success are better 
than icahns were at texaco because lockheed is in worse financial 
shape than the oil giant was two years ago and probably has more 
unhappy shareholders 
icahn then texacos biggest shareholder tried to unseat the 
texaco board because he thought the company wasnt doing enough to 
increase its stock price if he had won control he planned to sell 
some of its assets and distribute the proceeds to texaco 
shareholders 
texaco won the proxy battle when shareholders voted against 
icahns slate of nominees but it also undertook a restructuring 
that included billions of dollars in asset sales and a special 
dividend to shareholders 
icahn was considering a proxy fight at usx where he also is the 
largest stockholder however he sidestepped that tactic in 
exchange for a shareholder vote may 7 on splitting up the oil 
steel and gas company which he says would increase shareholder 
value 
other companies have thwarted proxy fights long before their 
annual meetings are held 
a year ago polaroid corp stopped a proxy attack by shamrock 
holdings inc by putting enough of its shares in friendly hands to 
defeat a shamrock slate of nominees shamrock gave up after the 
courts in delaware where polaroid is incorporated upheld the 
defensive move 
some other companies have averted proxy fights only by 
capitulating to dissidents demands 
allegis corp abandoned plans to become a travel empire after

two house members called today for mandatory 
jail terms and fines of up to 100000 for employers who repeatedly 
violate child labor laws 
rep charles schumer dny said child labor laws need to be 
overhauled to make effective the labor departments efforts to 
crack down on businesses that violate them 
schumer speaking before a house government operations 
subcommittee on employment and housikng called for increasing the 
civil penalties for child labor violations from 1000 to 10000 
schumer said that between 1987 and 1989 there were 128000 
minors who were injured and an estimated 59 killed in the 
workplace yet 37 employers who were cited for violations relating 
to those cases were fined a total of only 27000 he said 
the average penalty was a paltry 740 740 for a childs 
life in the united states schumer said 
the hearing came a day after labor secretary elizabeth dole 
announced that a threeday sting operation had uncovered 7000 
minors employed in dangerous jobs or working long hours in 
violation of child labor laws the companies are expected to face 
civil fines totaling 18 million she said 
rep don pease dohio said a threeday undercover sting 
followed by a highly publicized media blitz is no substitute for 
practical laws and sustained enforcement over time pease said 
schumer and pease plan to introduce legislation next month to 
expand the definition of child labor violations 
rep tom lantos dcalif the committee chairman said the 
panel would explore why child labor violations have increased and 
whether it is due to labor shortages or increased economic 
pressures on families 
the sad fact is that it may continue to make economic sense to 
employers to violate the law if penalties remain at present 
levels schumer said 
lantos said more enforcement personnel are needed not for 
three days but every single day of the year so the most valuable 
resource of this nation children will not be frittered away in 
terms of their time energy and physical wellbeing 
at a news conference thursday mrs dole said proposed revisions 
to the nations child labor laws were under review 
she said the government should first make the most of current 
resources then if additional funds are needed you can bet ill 
ask for those funds she said 
most of the violations uncovered this week involved firms in 
which 14 and 15yearolds worked more hours or later at night 
during the school week than allowed under federal law said william 
brooks an assistant labor secretary 
but there also were more than 900 youngsters mostly 16 and 
17yearolds who were performing dangerous tasks or using 
hazardous equipment such as powerdriven meatslicing machinery 
dough mixers and paperbalers 
federal law forbids 14 and 15yearolds from working more than 
three hours on a school day or 18 hours during a week when school 
is in session eight hours is permitted on weekend days and 40hour 
weeks are permitted in summer and during vacations 
those youngsters may not work outside the hours of 7 am to 7 
pm or to 9 pm from june 1 to labor day 
brooks also said nearly 200 youngsters under 14 barred from 
most jobs with a few exceptions such as certain farm work and 
newspaper delivery were found illegally employed 
mrs dole declined to name businesses involved saying 
investigations are continuing 
officials said however that most of the alleged violations 
occurred at service businesses such as restaurants grocery stores 
pizza and doughnut shops and drycleaning establishments

nbc inc has filed a 250 million lawsuit 
against sony corp and columbia pictures entertainment inc 
alleging they secretly diverted home video distribution business to 
sony 
the lawsuit filed thursday in superior court concerns 
rcacolumbia home video jointly owned by nbc and sonycolumbia it 
is among the nations leading home video distributors 
the suit charges sony columbia and various subsidiaries 
practiced selfdealing designed to appropriate the assets 
business opportunities and profits of rcacolumbia home video for 
their own companies 
a sony spokesman declined to comment saying the company had not 
received a copy of the lawsuit but the company issued a statement 
saying the lawsuit is surprising because columbia and nbc have 
enjoyed a good relationship 
in a recent deal sonycolumbia acquired theatrical distribution 
and home video distribution rights for a major package of future 
films by orion pictures 
nbcs complaint alleges that orion first offered distribution 
rights to rcacolumbia but that sonycolumbia refused to let the 
joint venture proceed it also says sonycolumbia never told 
rcacolumbia it was secretly negotiating its own deal 
harry rubin nbc vice president for home video said sony and 
columbia have intentionally diverted business to themselves that 
should have should have gone to the joint venture 
this goes beyond a normal business dispute and is not the type 
of behavior we are accustomed to from business partners he said 
in a statement 
the complaint also alleges sony and columbia have used 
confidential information on the joint ventures distribution goals 
to sonys benefit 
it is our contention that sonys executive in charge of 
strategic planning in japan directly contacted the various 
sonycolumbia representatives and required that type of information 
be shared with them nbc spokesman joe rutledge said in a 
telephone interview from new york 
rutledge said rcacolumbia in which nbc has a halfinterest 
had been averaging annual profits of more than 70 million and was 
itself valued at more than 1 billion before sony acquired columbia 
in october 1989

grain and soybean futures opened mixed then 
turned mostly lower today on the chicago board of trade amid 
disappointment over the lack of anticipated sales of corn and 
soybean meal to the soviet union 
wheat futures showed some strength though after the 
agriculture department announced it had accepted bids from 
exporters to sell 300000 metric tons of us wheat to china at 
subsidized prices 
many analysts had expected a higher opening in the soybean 
market following thursdays gains of as much as 13 cents a bushel 
on rumors that the soviets were in the market for corn and by 
logical extension soybean meal as livestock feed 
but there was no evidence this morning that the russians 
bought more corn said walter spilka a grain market analyst with 
smith barney harris upham amp co 
the soybean market showed little reaction to news that brazilian 
president fernando collor de mello had ordered a halt to 
agricultural subsidies brazil is the worlds secondlargest 
soybean producer 
in early trading wheat futures were unchanged to 1 cents lower 
with the contract for delivery in march at 385 a bushel corn 
was cent to cent lower with march at 246 a bushel oats were 
cent to 1 cents higher with march at 145 a bushel soybeans 
were cent to 3 cents lower with march at 582 a bushel 
livestock and meat futures were mostly higher in early trading 
on the chicago mercantile exchange 
live cattle futures were 08 cent to 22 cent higher with april 
at 7752 cents a pound feeder cattle were 20 cent lower to 28 
cent higher with march at 8277 cents a pound live hogs were 02 
cent lower to 50 cent higher with april at 5320 cents a pound 
frozen pork bellies were 12 cent lower to 45 cent higher with 
march at 50 cents a pound 
cattle futures retreated on thursday while pork futures were

the effect of milderthanusual weather on 
energy supplies held wholesale prices steady in february the 
government said today 
the labor departments producer price index showed no change 
following a huge 18 percent jump in january 
a holiday cold snap had caused record increases in energy prices 
and large food price rises propelling the overall index in january 
to the largest increase in 15 years the february report despite 
another substantial rise in food costs was the best in six months 
figures for the two months taken together represent an 
annualized wholesale inflation rate of 114 percent however 
economists do not expect anything approaching that for the entire 
year 
most anticipate prices will rise between 4 percent and 45 
percent in 1990 slightly lower than the 1989 rate of 48 percent 
the february price report was in line with economists 
predictions and traders said it had little effect on stock and bond 
prices however a federal reserve report showing 
lessthanexpected strength in manufacturing helped send financial 
markets higher in early trading 
economic weakness is seen as giving the fed room to lower 
interest rates a boon to stock and bond prices 
industrial production rose 06 percent in february after falling 
1 percent in january the central bank said the bounceback was 
weaker than anticipated 
meanwhile the commerce department said the seasonally adjusted 
rate of new construction of homes and apartments fell 7 percent 
last month after a huge 247 percent rise in january 
stock markets were also heavily influenced by computerized 
trading driven by the triple witching hour expiration of a set 
of options and futures contracts on stock indexes 
in the first half hour of trading the dow jones average of 30 
industrial stocks rose 1261 to 270833 
energy prices in february plunged 5 percent after soaring 136 
percent in january 
the effect of the weather showed up most strongly in fuel oil 
prices which rocketed 253 percent in january and plummeted 302 
percent in february they were the biggest increase and decrease 
since the department began tracking that price in 1973 
gasoline prices fell 23 percent last month after rising 167 
percent in january natural gas prices edged up 01 percent after 
jumping 32 percent in the previous month 
food prices in february rose 09 percent compared with january 
when they rose 21 percent the biggest jump in six years 
vegetable prices last month shot up 233 percent on top of the 
58 percent rise in january the holiday freeze killed vegetable 
crops from texas to florida however analysts expect vegetable 
costs to subside this spring as new crops are harvested 
in other good news for grocery buyers the wholesale price of 
eggs plunged 24 percent while dairy costs fell 27 percent both of 
those categories had been increasing for most of the previous year 
however chicken prices shot up 85 percent and fruit rose 8 
percent 
prices excluding the volatile food and energy sectors rose a 
moderate 04 percent in february after a slight 01 percent rise in 
january economists often use this socalled core rate as a better 
indication of underlying inflationary pressures in the economy 
inflation has been capped but it hasnt been broken said 
economist robert g dederick of northern trust co 
weakness in manufacturing is preventing inflation from 
accelerating he said but the sluggishness hasnt spread to other 
sectors enough to substantially reduce inflation 
in other categories prices rose 11 percent for childrens 
clothing held steady for passenger cars jumped 29 percent for 
tobacco products and plunged 5 percent for home electronic 
equipment 
the various changes put the index for finished goods at 1174 in 
february this meant that a hypothetical selection of goods which 
cost 100 in 1982 cost 11740 last month up from 11170 a year 
earlier 
price pressures in earlier stages of the production process also 
eased in february intermediate goods fell 07 percent following a 
12 percent rise in january while crude goods increased a moderate 
04 percent following a 24 percent jump a month earlier 
an example of the three stages would be bread for finished 
goods flour for intermediate and wheat for crude

general development corp has agreed to plead 
guilty to federal charges in connection with an alleged scheme to 
inflate the cost of homes at the firms nine florida developments 
federal officials said today 
the plea was announced along with the unsealing of a 16count 
indictment against general development and two former executives 
the indictment was issued tuesday but not made public while 
officials discussed possible plea agreements with the defendants 
the miamibased real estate development firm agreed to plead 
guilty to one count of conspiring through certain of its officers 
to violate the federal mail fraud statute 
general development agreed to pay a fine of not more than 
500000 and agreed in principle to enter into a civil consent 
decree establishing a restitution fund for eligible homebuyers who 
purchased homes between jan 1 1982 and dec 31 1989 
charles j simons chairman president and chief executive 
officer said he was gratified that general development has been 
able to put this episode in its history behind it 
this company will be run in full compliance with all laws and 
regulations and with the highest standards of business ethics 
said simons it is clear that our house prices had gotten out of 
line with our competition and that some of our customers were 
disadvantaged 
the indictment alleged that general development sold more than 
10000 homes between 1983 and 1989 at prices exceeding fair market 
value in at least one case the home was valued at less than half 
its sale price 
also named in the indictment was gdv financial corp a general 
development subsidiary that provided mortgages and other financial 
assistance to home buyers 
former general development chairman david brown and former 
president robert ehrling were accused of fraud in the indicatment 
and were also considering plea agreements us attorney dexter 
lehtinen said 
there was no immediate comment from either man and general 
development said it did not have telephone numbers where they could 
be reached brown and ehrling were ousted from general development 
a week ago 
lehtinen said a plea agreement for the two executives could 
include jail time 
lehtinen said details of the planned restitution by general 
development were still under discussion and would not be official 
until he files a civil consent order 
under the agreement which still must be approved by financial 
institutions holding mortgages on general development homes up to 
100 million could be set aside for reimbursement 
lehtinen said federal officials hoped general development would 
remain in business but the plea agreement could require dismissal 
of other top executives 
general development is fighting to survive a cash shortage that 
the company says results from its legal problems lenders and 
investors have deserted general development since it disclosed that 
it might be indicted by a federal grand jury investigating how 
general development markets its homes

eddie antar the eccentric founder of the 
crazy eddie inc stereo chain once suddenly changed his mind about 
going to dinner with a group of associates and jumped into a long 
black limousine in front of the restaurant 
after dinner the associates saw the limo still there and asked 
the driver what had happened to mr antar as the story is told by 
a businessman who had dealings with antar 
the driver was confused and then understood 
he said that crazy guy he walked in one door and out the 
other said the businessman who spoke on condition of anonymity 
antar has become even more elusive in fact he is a fugitive 
from a federal judges contempt citation in a securities and 
exchange commission insider trading case against him 
antar failed to appear today to give sworn testimony in the 
case paving the way for him to be found in default and have a 
judgment entered against him 
and in court papers filed late thursday his attorneys said they 
wanted to withdraw from the case based on antars 
unavailability 
the brooklyn nyborn high school dropout built an empire of 
43 stores in four states from a lone outlet much of his success 
was to two decades of tvrattling commercials advertising 
insannnnne prices 
his commercials used to annoy me and now hes annoying me 
said us marshal arthur borinsky the man in charge of tracking 
antar down 
i have no expectations at all about seeing him said a 
source close to antar 
antar disappeared after us district judge nicholas h politan 
found him in contempt for failing to appear in court to feb 28 
earlier politan required antar to repatriate 52 million in 
allegedly illegal profits believed to be in israeli banks from 
selling crazy eddie stock 
politan has also frozen antars assets and appointed a trustee 
to trace them 
the fugitive entrepreneur was last seen by authorities at a feb 
13 appearance 
in addition to a criminal contempt finding by politan the us 
attorney has also filed criminal contempt charges against him 
the sec charges antar and other former crazy eddie officials 
reaped millions of dollars in illegal trading profits after 
inflating the companys income they allegedly exaggerated 
inventory and falsely reduced bills to suppliers 
there have been numerous sightings of antar but none panned 
out said ray mack a us postal inspector investigating the case 
antars wife former wife inlaws and friends all say they have 
no idea where he is the sec even asked actor jerry carroll the 
companys manic broadcast pitchman from 1972 to 1989 no luck 
eddie was always a reclusive guy carroll said in an 
interview if eddie didnt want to talk to you he didnt talk to 
you 
carroll said he was paid handsomely for making more than 6000 
commercials and was given options for 81000 shares of stock in 
unsolicited bonuses the options are now worthless new management 
failed to turn around the teetering chain and went to bankruptcy 
court crazy eddie was liquidated last year 
its stock had traded as high as 21 and the company had 
revenues in 1987 of more than 350 million stores were in new 
jersey new york connecticut and pennsylvania 
antars name was rarely mentioned in print without the word 
reclusive attached to it 
the 42yearold onetime wall street darling infrequently 
appeared in public pictures are few though the latest shows him 
hair slicked back and beard closely trimmed holding a us 
marshals processing number it came after his feb 13 court 
appearance 
known by the nickname kelso after the famous racehorse the 
eccentric antar often wore jogging suits even when surrounded by 
people in black tie and gowns at formal company parties he kept a 
large german shepherd with him had exercise equipment in his 
office and reportedly wore a lucky black sweater for two years 
antar grew up in a compact community of syrian jews in 
brooklyns flatbush section most of whom trace roots to the 
ancient trading city of aleppo many in the remarkably successful 
community spend their summers in the jersey shore town of deal 
antar is very bright very private and right now very put 
upon said his new jersey lawyer jack arseneault who denied the 
sec charges and blamed them on the bitter statements of three 
disaffected company officials 
disgruntled shareholders sued him in 1987 and the us attorney 
is seeking a criminal indictment he also has been embroiled in a 
reopened divorce case with his previous wife

with commands from the ground 
engineers have succeeded in raising the orbit of an errant 150 
million communications satellite so that it wont crash through the 
atmosphere in the next nine days 
the higher orbit buys time for the owner intelsat to explore 
rescue options tony trujillo spokesman for the washingtonbased 
company said today that a letter was going to the national 
aeronautics and space administration discussing its help possibly 
a rescue by a space shuttle 
the satellite was left in an orbit that went within 1035 miles 
of earth after it failed to separate properly from its titan 3 
rocket after launch on wednesday if the satellite had remained at 
that altitude atmospheric drag would pull the spacecraft into the 
atmosphere where it would burn up 
using small steering thrusters and hydrazine fuel stored aboard 
for small course corrections engineers boosted the satellite to an 
eggshaped orbit of 161 miles by 276 miles a satisfactory position 
for parking 
this is very good news trujillo said of the successful 
effort to boost the 5ton satellite the maneuver does nothing 
however to restore the satellite to usefulness it must be in a 
geosynchronous orbit 22300 miles high to carry out its functions 
nasa said once it is asked by intelsat for help questions of 
planning for such a complex mission crew training and 
modifications to the shuttle would have to be evaluated in the 
light of the orbit achieved by the intelsat spacecraft 
there were reports too that intelsat was asking the soviets 
for help but trujillo said only that right now we are 
concentrating discussing with nasa the possibility of assistance 
the satellite was propelled into space at a cost of about 270 
million in the fourth commercial launch of a payload by a us 
company 
it wound up in the wrong orbit after failing to separate 
properly from the second stage of its booster rocket the satellite 
was separated about seven hours later by computer commands sent 
from intelsats headquarters in washington 
but the rocket motor that was to have boosted the satellite into 
higher orbit remained attached to the second stage booster 
the titans second stage traveling at about the same speed as 
the satellite in the same elliptical orbit 90 to 190 miles above 
earth has until about wednesday before falling back to earth said 
maj thomas niemann of the us space command the rocket has more 
mass than the satellite and more surface area causing greater 
atmospheric drag 
the us space command probably will not know where the 
spacecraft will come down until about 12 hours beforehand niemann 
said 
john pike associate director for space policy for the 
federation of american scientists said the satellite is 
worthless no matter where it is unless nasa agrees to help 
the best they can do is to hope they get it in some orbit that 
would enable a shuttle probably the american shuttle to bring it 
back down pike said 
before the 1986 challenger disaster shuttles brought back two 
satellites for refurbishing and crew members repaired two others in 
space following the explosion president reagan and congress 
directed nasa to move away from launching commercial satellites and 
devote its efforts to research and development 
there are so many unknowns in this thing nasa spokesman 
karl kristofferson said first whether its doable second 
whether it would fit 
martin marietta corp which launched the rocket and satellite 
has not yet determined what went wrong company spokesman art koski 
said of 142 titan 3 launches 136 have been successful 
the intelsat vi spacecraft was intended to transmit three tv 
channels and up to 120000 telephone calls simultaneously 22300 
miles above earth for more than 13 years it was to have eventually 
replaced two older satellites over the atlantic 
intelsat a notforprofit international consortium that 
operates a global communications satellite system had not acquired 
insurance for wednesdays launch instead it selfinsured the 
satellite and launch vehicle through a reserve fund established to 
cover failures 
martin mariettas stock dropped 1375 a share wednesday as 
investors became nervous about the companys possible financial 
liability for the 150 million satellite and 115 million rocket 
the stock rebounded thursday closing at 41375 up 12 cents 
the company said its financial responsibility ended when the 
titan 3 rocket ignited 
under its contract with the international telecommunications 
satellite organization or intelsat martin mariettas financial 
responsibility ended before the rocket cleared the launch tower a 
company spokesman said 
but intelsat officials declined to comment on martins 
assessment of its liability for the satellite 
it would be dangerous for us to talk about when their 
liability ended and ours began at this time said intelsat 
spokesman tony trujillo it could come up in litigation 
wednesdays launch was intelsats 44th 35 were successful

british industrial giant btr plc announced today 
an unsolicited 164 billion tender offer for norton co a us 
abrasives manufacturer 
btr said it was offering 75 a share for norton through a us 
subsidiary er holdings inc 
norton responded that its board of directors was reviewing the 
offer and would tell shareholders by march 29 of its position on 
the bid 
btrs finance director chris bull said the company would 
finance the bid with corporate reserves and bank borrowing he said 
he did not know how much debt would be incurred but added that btr 
could cope with any repayments despite britains 15 percent 
interest rates 
norton had earnings of 858 million on sales of 153 billion 
in 1989 
btr formerly known as british tire and rubber has diverse 
activities including electronics sports products and 
transportation it had aftertax profit 783 million pounds or 13 
billion on sales of 703 billion pounds or 113 billion last 
year 
norton stock soared on the news of the bid rising 1562 to 
7387 by midday on the new york stock exchange 
londons stock market also reacted enthusiastically to the move 
btrs shares jumped 20 pence or 32 cents to close at 437 pence 
or 704 on londons stock exchange 
analysts generally said btr would benefit from owning norton 
despite recent problems at the us company 
i think its a very good deal said analyst jack jones of 
the london investment firm ubsphillips and drew 
david ireland an analyst with hoare govett ltd said norton has 
excellent products and good market position 
but scott fulton an analyst with charterhouse tilney took a 
negative view everybodys been waiting for btr to make an 
acquisition and i dont think people should get excited about this 
acquisition he said 
nortons main lines of business are in decline globally and the 
company suffers from high manufacturing costs fulton said 
btr chairman john cahill said the company would continue its 
acquisitive trend in 1990 
we have a number of companies were looking at cahill said 
adding that he was targeting the united states as a prime buying 
market the united states is in vogue he said

neither side in the 15day greyhound bus strike is 
confident that renewed talks will produce a settlement as gunshots 
again were fired at a bus today and a striking driver was arrested 
in an earlier shooting 
federal mediators scheduled separate meetings today in tucson 
ariz with company officials and union negotiators the two sides 
were to meet facetoface saturday for the first time since 6300 
drivers and an estimated 3000 other greyhound workers walked out 
greyhound lines inc chairman fred g currey on thursday accused 
the amalgamated council of greyhound local unions of terrorism in 
connection with shooting attacks on buses and other violence 
a striking driver was charged today in the shooting monday of a 
greyhound bus in farmington conn roger d cawtra 44 of 
stratford was arrested at his home by state police and charged with 
reckless endangerment and weapons offenses police said a judge 
ordered him held on 100000 bond 
a shot fired from a passing car hit the windshield of a bus in 
phoenix early today police said greyhound spokeswoman ann wheat 
said the glass was not penetrated and no one was injured she said 
the 43 passengers on the bus bound from new york to los angeles 
were put on another bus 
currey said the violence has undermined his optimism at reaching 
a settlement 
i guess the best way to characterize my feeling is that i have 
high hopes but very low expectations currey said 
i believe these union leaders think they can win this 
strike through violence terrorism and intimidation and if they 
think that then i have very low expectations he said 
union spokesman jeffrey nelson defended union leaders though he 
acknowledged union members may be responsible for some of the 
violence 
union leaders do not believe violence will solve this 
problem he said we have repeatedly gone to union officials at 
the local level imploring them to let their own members know that 
this is not a way to solve a strike 
nelon suggested the company is positioning itself to walk out of 
the negotiations 
it takes two parties to negotiate nelson said if one 
party is not prepared to negotiate then there cant be 
negotiations 
currey said the company was returning to the bargaining table 
only because federal mediators indicated it might help end the 
strike 
he would not say if the company has a new offer repeating past 
statements that greyhound can afford no more than the 63 million 
threeyear contract it first offered 
the strike began march 2 after talks broke down over wages and 
job security nelson said the two sides are not that far apart 
on financial aspects but differ on grievance procedures 
since the walkout began there have been at least 14 shooting 
attacks on greyhound buses 46 bomb threats and numerous other 
incidents of vandalism or threats currey said thursday 
in chattanooga tenn police escorted buses out of town late 
thursday after a second sniper attack in as many days a bullet 
shattered a bus windshield thursday afternoon shortly after it left 
the chattanooga terminal en route to detroit and two shots struck 
a bus wednesday night on interstate 24 no one was injured in 
either incident 
also thursday strikers and employees were forced to evacuate a 
greyhound maintenance yard in los angeles after a caller phoned in 
the threat bomb squad members found a ticking suitcase in the 
cargo area of a bus in the yard but later discovered an alarm clock 
and clothing inside said police sgt tom jones 
greyhound has won court orders barring violence in more than a 
dozen cities and reached agreement with the union thursday to ban 
picketing and demonstrations at three greyhound operations in 
jacksonville fla 
greyhound the nations only intercity bus company has been 
operating at reduced levels since the strike began using permanent 
replacements and union members willing to cross the picket line 
the company says 394 union drivers are at work joining 1002 
permanent replacements the union says only 94 of its drivers have 
crossed the line

sea containers ltd announced friday its 
stockholders approved the companys proposed recapitalization 
which involves selling certain container and ferry assets to

president james b sherwood said final sale agreements have been 
executed with stena and tiphook the transactions should be 
completed by the end of march and the share program would be 
carried out by early april 
swedens stena and britains tiphook had jointly pursued sea 
containers through a ferry consortium they own together called 
temple holdings ltd sea containers rejected three temple takeover

temple in midjanuary offered to drop its bid if sea containers 
agreed to sell portions of its ferry and container businesses to

sea containers main areas of operation would be specialized marine 
container leasing and related activities especially refrigerated

the national broadcasting co said friday it had 
agreed to sell a majority interest in its cleveland television 
station wkyctv to multimedia inc which would be making its first 
major purchase since undertaking a 11 billion recapitalization in 
1985 
terms of the sale and the size of the stake being sold were not 
disclosed 
multimedia which owns four television stations and has 
interests in newspapers radio television programming and cable 
tv would assume complete responsibility for managing and operating 
the station 
wkyctv serves the nations 11th largest tv market and would be 
multimedias biggest tv property 
the deal could free nbc to buy another tv station in a larger 
market trimming its holdings to six stations reaching 20 percent 
to 21 percent of the country its seven stations including 
cleveland reached about 22 percent of the country federal 
regulations prohibit a company from owning stations with a combined 
reach of more than 25 percent of the country 
nbc would retain a minority interest in the cleveland station 
but would have no daytoday role the station went on the air in 
1948 
the deal is subject to completion of a definitive agreement and 
approval by the federal communications commission and the boards of 
multimedia and nbcs parent general electric co 
nbc said multimedia approached it with the proposal several 
months ago 
robert c wright president and chief executive at nbc said the 
proposal offered a terrific opportunity to expand our 
relationship with an accomplished group of broadcasters 
three of the four multimedia stations are nbc affiliates wlwt 
in cincinnati wbir in knoxville and ksdk in st louis the fourth 
wmaz in macon ga is affiliated with cbs 
this was the smallest owned and operated station that nbc 
has walter bartlett chairman and chief executive of the 
greenville scbased company said in a telephone interview we 
knew they were in pursuing a larger market station 
joe rutledge an nbc spokesman said nbc has no immediate plans 
to buy another station but he said the network always has been 
interested in attractive stations at reasonable prices 
he said the cleveland station has been profitable but he 
declined to reveal its cash flow industry analysts said a wellrun 
station can command a sale price of 12 times its cash flow 
multimedia borrowed 113 billion in 1985 as part of a 
recapitalization but has since reduced its debt to about 700 
million bartlett said 
he said the company is about 100 million ahead of where it 
expected to be in repaying the 650 million bank debt incurred in 
the recapitalization 
in addition bartlett said the company has raised about 30 
million to 40 million after taxes from sales of a small newspaper 
several radio stations and an independent television station in 
nashville tenn over the past few years 
as a result he said the company was able to jump at the 
opportunity to buy a majority interest in what would be its biggest 
tv market to date 
bartlett declined to comment on the companys future plans for 
expansion 
in addition to its tv stations multimedia publishes 14 daily 
newspapers and 50 nondaily newspapers owns seven radio statuons 
operates 100 cable tv franchises in four states and produces and 
syndicates tv shows including the phil donahue show and sally 
jessy raphael 
nbc owns tv stations in new york los angeles chicago 
washington dc miami and denver it also operates the nbc

topsyturvy weather is sending wholesale 
inflation on a rollercoaster ride so far this year with prices 
unchanged in february after a steep increase a month earlier 
a sharp drop in energy prices offset increases for other items 
and held the labor departments producer price index steady overall 
last month the government said friday 
it was the best report in six months and welcome relief after 
the huge 18 percent rise in january that increase the largest in 
15 years was driven by a record gain in energy costs and a large 
jump in food prices 
food costs rose substantially again in february particularly 
vegetables 
taken together the two months represent an annual wholesale 
inflation rate of 114 percent but many analysts believe prices 
are falling this month and predict the manufacturing slowdown will 
keep the rate for all of 1990 below the 48 percent price gain last 
year 
inflation has been capped but it hasnt been broken said 
economist robert g dederick of northern trust co in chicago 
unusual weather a deep freeze around christmas followed by 
unseasonal warmth also contributed to sharp swings in other 
economic indicators 
the federal reserve board said industrial production after 
slumping 1 percent in january bounced back 06 percent in 
february output at utilities fell and rose with the temperature a 
cutback at auto plants followed by a production rebound also 
contributed to the overall swing 
the operating rate at factories mines and utilities increased 
03 percentage point to 823 percent of capacity in february 
housing starts fell 7 percent in february returning to a more 
normal seasonally adjusted annual rate of 148 million units after 
a record leap of 247 percent a month earlier the commerce 
department said both months were warmer than usual but rain held 
back builders in february 
analysts trying to sort through the figures found little to help 
them divine the direction of the federal reserves monetary policy 
the central bank sought to avoid a recession by cutting interest 
rates over the last half of 1989 it has left shortterm rates 
unchanged since late december and now appears more interested in 
keeping rates high enough to dampen growth and consequently 
inflationary pressures 
federal reserve policy will be on hold until the direction of 
the economy becomes clearer said economist samuel d kahan of 
fuji securities inc 
kahan said prices excluding the volatile food and energy 
sectors the socalled core rate of inflation advanced at about 
the same rate as previous months they rose a moderate 04 percent 
in february after a slight 01 percent rise in january 
energy prices plunged 5 percent in february after soaring 136 
percent 
fuel oil plummeted 302 percent after shooting up 253 percent 
the biggest increase and decrease since the department began 
tracking that price in 1973 
gasoline prices fell 23 percent recovering only partly from a 
167 percent rise in january natural gas edged up 01 percent 
after jumping 32 percent 
the fuel oil people are cutting prices like crazy to get rid 
of what theyve got but the gasoline people are anticipating the 
driving season and arent unhappy to see inventories rising said 
economist donald ratajczak of georgia state university 
food prices rose 09 percent compared with a 21 percent jump 
in january the biggest in six years vegetable prices last month 
shot up 233 percent on top of the 58 percent rise in january 
the wholesale price of eggs plunged 24 percent and dairy costs 
fell 27 percent both items had been increasing for most of the 
previous year however chicken prices shot up 85 percent and 
fruit rose 8 percent 
the revitalized florida crops are coming back in and we should 
see those vegetable prices tumbling in march and april ratajczak 
said 
clothing prices rose 11 percent for children 07 percent for 
women and 06 percent for men the strong dollar which reduced the 
price of imports should keep clothing prices for continuing higher 
in other categories prices held steady for passenger cars 
jumped 29 percent for tobacco products and plunged 5 percent for 
home electronic equipment 
the various changes put the index for finished goods at 1174 in 
february this meant that a hypothetical selection of goods sold 
for 100 in 1982 cost 11740 last month up from 11170 a year 
earlier 
price pressures in earlier stages of the production process also 
eased in february intermediate goods fell 07 percent following a 
12 percent rise in january while crude goods increased a moderate 
04 percent after a 24 percent jump a month earlier 
an example of the three stages would be bread for finished 
goods flour for intermediate and wheat for crude

anheuserbusch inc spends millions of dollars 
trying to convince people not to drink the brewers bestselling 
beers and says it doesnt mind getting only goodwill in return 
we are a big part of societys desire to reduce abuse said 
steve burrows vice president for consumer awareness and education 
at the worlds largest brewery which commands 42 percent of the 
domestic beer market its an area we feel we have a 
responsibility to be in 
the brewer is introducing another national advertising campaign 
about responsible drinking tuesday this ones called family talk 
about drinking and it joins 11 other campaigns the company is 
running 
busch has pioneered an industry effort to promote sobriety and 
distance itself from the beerguzzling image moreover its just 
good business to remind consumers not to overindulge said 
burrows who has worked solely on alcohol awareness programs for 
nearly a year 
he has a staff of seven and estimates anheuserbusch already has 
spent 1 million on the new family talk program 
last year anheuserbusch spent as much on the know when to say 
when program which encompasses all its alcoholawareness 
endeavors as it did on the michelob dry rollout burrows said 
although antidrinking activists have accused some brewers of 
using the sobriety message as a public relations ploy industry 
analysts see no ulterior motives in the push by busch and other 
brewers to combat alcohol abuse 
george thompson an analyst for prudentialbache securities inc 
in new york said its a logical path to travel for busch which 
has introduced lowalcohol beer la and noalcohol brew 
odouls in the last few years 
thompson said busch will never make money on those brands and 
likely wont profit from its alcohol awareness programs either 
but its not something theyll let up on thompson said 
theyre not trying to impress people theyre trying to solve the 
problem 
bob weinberg head of of rs weinberg amp associates st louis 
research firm that tracks the brewery business said a good test 
was whether people recalled the brand name sponsoring responsible 
drinking ads he passed 
im not sure i can distinguish between the brewers said 
weinberg who is also a professor at washington university the 
message i remember 
the company doesnt expect to strengthen its already dominant 
position in the beer industry with family talk it may even 
lose sales 
thats business that we will gladly lose burrows said 
busch is targeting its family talk campaign at a specific 
audience going for the fathers in sports illustrated the mothers 
in good housekeeping and both in newsweek and parent 
its message is mostly common sense the ads invite readers to 
telephone a tollfree number to obtain guidelines that tell parents 
how to be a role model provide the facts about drinking and 
driving enforce rules and encourage positive friendships 
a sixperson staff of expert advisers which helped develop the 
guides also advises starting discussions on the subject early at 
about age 9 the guides include sample dialogue to encourage 
bringing up the subject informally 
it may sound simple but roger vogler a clinical psychologist 
from pomona collge in claremont calif and a member of the 
advisory board says its not 
my experience is that people are surprisingly uninformed about 
things that may seem pretty obvious vogler said a lot of 
parents in my experience believe that they are there to enforce the 
rules rather than facilitate their kids meeting their own needs 
we dont have a good format for teaching people how to parent 
in our society and i think parents need some help 
even before the ad campaigns debut burrows spread the 
tollfree number by word of mouth through the brewerys 
wholesalers he said there already have been hundreds of calls on 
the number 1800359talk set up for people to order free copies 
of the guide packet 
response has been so brisk burrows said that anheuserbusch 
also is planning to translate the package into spanish 
unlike its other programs which feature celebrities and sports 
figures warning of the evils of alcohol abuse family talk is 
more subtle the first ad features a small photo of an 
oldfashioned bicycle below the message talk to your kid about 
drinking before he gets his first set of wheels 
its a different more lowkey approach by a company that spends 
most of its advertising dollar on network sports programming 
as for the everburgeoning responsible drinking division at 
busch burrows says its not time to say when yet 
as we finetune this effort if we see an opportunity well 
certainly seize it burrows said well continue to address the 
issue and were always looking for new ideas

soybean futures prices closed moderately lower 
friday on the chicago board of trade in reaction to a brazilian 
economic reform plan while grain futures finished mostly higher 
newly inaugurated brazilian president fernando collor de mello 
on friday announced a broad package of economic measures designed 
to halt brazils runaway inflation rate including the introduction 
of a new currency with freefloating exchange rates 
traders speculated that a freefloating currency would encourage 
export sales of soybeans from brazil the worlds secondlargest 
producer after the united states but analysts said it was 
impossible to predict the ultimate effect of the broad economic 
reforms on the soybean market 
the world wants and needs the brazilian crop but the question 
is given all the economic reforms how is that crop going to move 
to the world said mickey luth oilseeds analyst with shearson 
lehman hutton inc no one knows 
grain futures were led higher by the march wheat contract which 
rose sharply on indications of tight availability of nearterm 
supplies 
at the close wheat was 1 cents lower to 5 cents higher with 
the contract for delivery in march at 390 a bushel corn futures

a new magazine american style is making an 
appointment for september at 140000 beauty salons across the 
country in the latest media venture aimed at giving advertisers 
access to a large audience of women 
american style will be an oversized bimonthly magazine from 
whittle communications a knoxville tennbased media concern that 
had conducted a twoyear test of a similar magazine southern 
style in southern beauty parlors 
peter finn the whittle division president reponsible for 
american style said the magazine will be in beauty parlors which 
handle 90 percent of the nations beauty salon customers 
he said the magazine which will feature affordable fashions 
beauty tips and profiles of women who other women admire should 
reach an unduplicated audience of 29 million adult women readers 
every quarter 
the location enables us to reach women when they can really 
focus on the magazine and obviously on the advertising finn 
said 
the announcement of the new magazine comes as another media 
company communications venture group of rye ny begins to 
distribute confetti a series of six separate bimonthly magazines 
designed for women in beauty shops 
each confetti magazine will focus on a different topic people 
writing style home connections and leisure and will be 
distributed in about 4000 salons in department stores and malls 
about 8 million women are expected to read the magazines at least 
once every two months 
unlike american style the publishers of confetti require that 
they be allowed to handle all of the magazines that will be 
available in a given beauty salon and to limit that to no more than 
four other magazine titles 
controlledcirculation magazines such as american style will be 
prohibited from beauty salons signing up to receive confetti 
according to dave smith a managing director at communications 
venture group 
there is a lot of magazine clutter out there he said 
smith said his company is focusing on beauty shops located in 
stores or near stores because it puts the magazine in the hands of 
women who would be in position to act immediately on any 
advertisinggenerated impulses to shop 
a women in a beauty shop on the fifth floor of a department 
store will be bumping into the counters of our advertisers as she 
leaves he said 
murdoch magazines a unit of news corp ltd headed by rupert 
murdoch announced last month that it planned to create 
commerciallysponsored video programs designed for beauty shop 
clients 
murdochs salon network would consist of tapes of 30 minute to 
40 minute programs including 10 minutes of ads that would be 
delivered for replay in at least 3000 beauty parlors starting june 
or july the creators say 2 million to 25 million women are 
expected to see the programs while at the beauty shop 
the shows would contain video versions of stories that have 
appeared in murdoch magazines such as mirabella new woman new 
york and premiere 
advertising rates are just under 1 million for a page in each 
of six bimonthly issues of american style 300000 for one page in 
each of six bimonthly issues of confetti and 20000 for a 
30second commercial on a salon network program 
joseph ostrow worldwide media director at the advertising firm 
foote cone belding communications in new york said the new 
magazine and video vehicles have potential because they address a 
very specific target audience in a setting where the right message 
could motivate people to buy a product 
the question is whether the women will indeed read them or 
view them it is one thing to get them into distribution and quite 
another to get them read he said

bidermann industries corp said friday it has 
agreed to buy three divisions of cluett peabody and co at a price 
an analyst said was well below what cashstrapped industrialist 
william farley had hoped to get 
the purchase price was about 350 million in cash and a 60 
million note due march 2000 according to a joint statement by 
farleys west pointpepperell inc and bidermann 
the note provides for no principal payments until maturity 
interest will accrue and be added to principal until january 1998 
after which interest will be payable in cash the statement said 
farley started to sell those at 600 million analyst edward 
f johnson of johnson redbook service in new york said of the sale 
the price is down and not all of it is in cash 
they are still in a tight position financially johnson said 
the sale follows renegotiation with bankers wells fargo amp co 
and bankers trust co of a 12 billion loan which buys farley 
more time to complete his takeover of georgiabased pepperell 
cluett peabody is a leading manufacturer of menswear the 
transaction involves divisions that make and sell arrow shirts 
schoeneman suits and gold toe socks 
farley the chicagobased industrialist who acquired pepperell 
in a hostile takeover last year for 156 billion is selling the 
cluett peabody divisions to get through a cash squeeze 
the agreement with bankers trust and wells fargo announced 
earlier this week extends through 1994 a loan that was set to 
mature on march 31 the loan package consists of a term loan of 
550 million and a revolving credit line of up to 650 million 
lenders previously had agreed to extend the loan only if farley 
could sell some of pepperells assets 
there was concern that farley would default on the 104 billion 
bridge loan he got to buy west point 
the sale completes negotiations that were begun last fall when 
bidermann and west point announced that an agreement had been 
reached to acquire cluett peabody 
bidermann industries is the principal american subsidiary of

us and european scientists will be able to 
compare notes across the atlantic with a new highspeed data link 
unveiled thursday by the national science foundation 
the foundation said it was extending the nations largest 
computer network used in science and education nsfnet to europe 
thanks to support from international business machines corp and 
mci communications corp 
stephen s wolff a division director of the foundation said 
the new transatlantic link will speed the exchange of information 
in areas such as global weather changes mapping the human gene 
analyzing reactions in particle physics and predicting weather 
european and us researchers will be able to exchange 
information at the network speed of 15 million bits per second or 
almost 200000 characters per second that is the equivalent of 
about 50 single spaced pages of text a second 
but even that blinding speed news agencies tranbsmit text at 
150 characters per second and facsimile machines can reach 1200 
characters per second is not enough for todays computer networks 
to handle sophisticated graphics from several locations at once 
later this year nsfnet should go to 45 million bits per second 
about 56 million characters per second in the united states 
according to the announcement of the new network at the national 
net 90 networking conference 
the transatlantic fiber optic cable will remain limited to 15 
million bits per second 
network officials demonstrated prototype equipment that 
transmitted information between washington and ann arbor mich at 
45 million bits per second 
it is clear that this kind of collaboration has the potential 
to speed up the research process and lead us to new scientific 
breakthroughs that today we cannot even imagine said wolff 
the connection between nsfnet and the european academic 
supercomputer initiative network will be made at the cornell 
national supercomputer facility at ithaca ny and at cern the 
european laboratory for particle physics near geneva switzerland 
nsfnet is a partnership of the foundation ibm mci the state 
of michigan and the merit computer network a consortium of eight 
michigan universities 
nsfnet links more than 1000 us universities business and 
government research networks and provides access to supercomputers

when generes 
and large food price rises which had propelled the overall index 
to the largest increase in 15 years 
figures for the two months taken together represent an 
annualized wholesale inflation rate of 114 percent however 
economists do not expect anything approaching that for the entire 
year 
most anticipate prices will rise between 4 percent and 45 
percent in 1990 slightly lower than the 1989 rate of 48 percent 
in two other economic reports released today the government 
said housing starts returned to a more normal slower pace in 
february and industrial production bounced back from a january 
decline 
the commerce department said new homes and apartments were built 
at a seasonably adjusted annual rate of 148 million units in 
february down 7 percent after leaping a revised 247 percent in 
january 
the federal reserve said industrial production rose 06 percent 
in february following a 10 percent drop in januarys output in a 
separate report the fed said the operating rate of the nations 
factories mines and utilities rose 03 percentage point to 823 
percent in february 
energy prices in february plunged 5 percent after soaring 136 
percent in january 
the effect of the weather showed up most strongly in fuel oil 
prices which rocketed 253 percent in january and plummeted 302 
percent in february they were the biggest increase and decrease 
since the department began tracking that price in 1973 
gasoline prices fell 23 percent last month after rising 167 
percent in january natural gas prices edged up 01 percent after 
jumping 32 percent in the previous month 
food prices in february rose 09 percent compared with january 
when they rose 21 percent the biggest jump in six years 
vegetable prices last month shot up 233 percent on top of the 
58 percent rise in january the holiday freeze killed vegetable 
crops from texas to florida however analysts expect vegetable 
costs to subside this spring as new crops are harvested 
in other good news for grocery buyers the wholesale price of 
eggs plunged 24 percent while dairy costs fell 27 percent both of 
those categories had been increasing for most of the previous year 
however chicken prices shot up 85 percent and fruit rose 8 
percent 
prices excluding the volatile food and energy sectors rose a 
moderate 04 percent in february after a slight 01 percent rise in 
january economists often use this socalled core rate as a better 
indication of underlying inflationary pressures in the economy 
in other categories prices rose 11 percent for mens and boys 
clothing held steady for passenger cars jumped 29 percent for 
tobacco products and plunged 5 percent for home electronic 
equipment 
the various changes put the index for finished goods at 1174 in 
february this meant that a hypothetical selection of goods which 
cost 100 in 1982 cost 11740 last month up from 11170 a year 
earlier 
price pressures in earlier stages of the production process also 
eased in february intermediate goods fell 07 percent following a 
12 percent rise in january while crude goods increased a moderate 
04 percent following a 24 percent jump a month earlier 
an example of the three stages would be bread for finished 
goods flour for intermediate and wheat for crude

the dollar declined friday against most major 
foreign currencies with buyers focusing on the swiss franc and west 
german mark 
gold prices gained in domestic and overseas dealings 
republic national bank of new york quoted a bid for a troy ounce 
of gold at 400 as of 4 pm est up 180 from thursdays late 
bid on new yorks commodity exchange gold for march delivery 
settled at 39960 a troy ounce 150 higher than thursday 
currency dealers said a bearish attitude toward the dollar 
prevailed in foreign exchange markets interest in trading dollars 
slackened in the new york afternoon which is typical before a 
weekend 
traders usually are reluctant to establish significant new 
positions on fridays for fear developments over the weekend could 
have an impact on currency values this was especially true this 
friday because of sundays parliamentary elections in east germany 
there has been speculation that the west german mark will 
strengthen next week if the east german elections signal a 
quickening of german unity 
as trading ended in new york the dollar was quoted at 16980 
west german marks down from 16990 marks late thursday 
meanwhile a batch of statistics about the economys performance 
in february furnished fresh evidence of weakness judging by the 
reports analysts said they dont foresee any imminent change in 
federal reserve credit policy which could influence the dollars 
value against its foreign counterparts 
marc chandler a currency market analyst at mms international in 
chicago said stronger demand for swiss francs also caused dollar 
selling 
chandler said the japanese yen remained the weakest of the major 
currencies because interest rates in that country have stayed put 
rather than gone up as many currency traders expected 
one dollar bought 15265 japanese yen late in new york compared 
to 152285 yen on thursday earlier in tokyo the dollar closed at 
15250 japanese yen up from 15247 in london late friday the 
dollar closed higher at 15230 yen 
also in london one british pound cost 16235 late friday more 
expensive for buyers than thursdays late 16177 later in new 
york a pound fetched 16190 down from 16215 on thursday 
other late dollar rates in new york compared with late quotes 
thursday included 15095 swiss francs down from 15180 5736 
french francs down from 57415 125300 italian lire down from 
125500 and 118285 canadian dollars up from 118085 
selected late rates for the dollar in europe compared with 
thursdays late levels were 16945 west german marks down from 
17025 15080 swiss francs down from 15222 57245 french

british industrial conglomerate btr plc offered 
164 billion friday to acquire norton co the worchesterbased 
abrasives manufacturer in an unsolicited tender offer that sent 
norton shares skyrocketing 
londonbased btr which has international operations ranging 
from building materials to sporting goods offered 75 a share for 
norton through a us subsidiary er holdings inc 
btr also threatened a proxy fight to win control of nortons 
board if the company tried to block its tender offer 
norton stock soared on news of the bid rising 1662 to 
7487 a share on the new york stock exchange 
norton spokesman francis j doherty jr said nortons board of 
directors was reviewing the offer and would inform shareholders of 
its position on the bid by march 29 
norton the worlds largest manufacturer of abrasives also 
produces ceramics plastics and chemical process products 
the company earned 858 million on sales of 153 billion in 
1989 it employs 16600 people and operates 120 plants in the 
united states and 27 in other countries 
operations of btr formerly known as british tire and rubber 
include electronics sports products and transportation under such 
companies as stewart warner in the united states borg warner in 
australia dunlop slazenger and rockwell valve 
the company had an aftertax profit of 13 billion on sales of 
113 billion last year 
btrs finance director chris bull said the company would 
finance the bid with corporate reserves and bank borrowing he said 
he did not know how much debt would be incurred but added that btr 
could cope with any repayments 
btr chairman john c cahill wrote in a letter to norton chief 
executive john h nelson that he hoped the transaction would be 
enthusiastically supported by nortons nearly 6000 
stockholders 
but he said btr would consider proposing an alternative slate of 
nominees for directors at nortons annual meeting april 26 to 
ensure that nortons board does not either through action or 
inaction deny norton stockholders the opportunity to accept our 
allcash offer 
cahills letter also included a pledge not to close any of 
nortons manufacturing facilities and to keep nortons corporate 
headquarters in worcester 
british analysts generally said btr would benefit from owning 
norton despite recent problems at the us company 
i think its a very good deal said analyst jack jones of 
the london investment firm ubsphillips and drew 
david ireland an analyst with hoare govett ltd in london said 
norton has excellent products and good market position 
but scott fulton an analyst with charterhouse tilney in london 
took a negative view everybodys been waiting for btr to make an 
acquisition and i dont think people should get excited about this 
acquisition he said 
nortons main lines of business are in decline globally and the 
company suffers from high manufacturing costs fulton said 
cahill said btr would continue its acquisitive trend in 1990 
we have a number of companies were looking at cahill said 
adding that he was targeting the united states as a prime buying 
market the united states is in vogue he said 
a number of btrs businesses were acquired including 
chicagobased stewart warner a maker of electronic and fabricated 
metal products and hardware that btr bought acquired in late 1987 
btr mounted a 18 billion hostile takeover attempt for 
britains pilkington brothers plc the giant glassmaker in late 
1986 but later dropped the bid amid a domestic political uproar 
over the move

a year after the alaska oil spill some 
experts still point to exxon corps reaction as a virtual primer 
on how not to handle a disaster 
to be nice id say they did not distinguish themselves 
said gerald meyers former chairman and chief executive officer of 
american motors and author of a book on corporate crisis control 
when it hits the fan 
to be more blunt they screwed up he said for whatever 
reason the company appeared to be indifferent or uncaring or 
unconcerned while hundreds of sea otters and all kinds of wildlife 
were washing up on shore 
marilou hedlund managing director of the hill amp knowlton public 
relations firm in chicago said several new clients came to her 
saying in essence we dont want to have what happened to exxon 
happen to us 
reporters had trouble getting comment from exxon about the march 
24 spill and company chairman lawrence g rawls stayed away from 
the area and didnt appear before reporters until april 18 
within hours of the spill a local group volunteered to mobilize 
fishing boats to help move in equipment to keep the oil from 
spreading but in another example of what critics label exxons 
clumsiness the company never returned their call the groups 
members said by the time exxon responded with its own equipment a 
storm had moved through the area and spread the oil over a wider 
region 
the associated press called exxon asking to discuss its handling 
of spills but officials at the corporations new york 
headquarters its subsidiarys headquarters in houston and its 
bayway refinery in linden nj all declined comment 
ms hedlund and other crisis managers a burgeoning subfield of 
public relations live by a simple maxim theres no substitute for 
practice 
we do crisis training with our clients actually create an 
incredible crisis and simulated news and radio reports and see how 
they handle them she said 
ms hedlund said she also refers clients to several textbook 
examples of good crisis management including united airlines 
handling of the crash of flight 232 in iowa last summer and johnson 
amp johnsons of the nightmarish tylenol poisonings of the early 
1980s 
the key to the success of both cases was the companys 
immediate release of everything they knew and their handling of 
victims families she said 
meyers said british petroleums recent oil spill off huntington 
beach calif provides another good example 
they learned from exxon no doubt he said bps chairman 
jim ross flew there almost immediately and showed a takecharge 
attitude that was a very bad scene an oil spill right in the 
cradle of the environmental movement but they weathered the 
storm 
exxon recently halted oil loading and unloading operations at 
its only east coast refinery after three spills in two months in 
new york cityarea waters even though only one of the spills was 
directly tied to exxon property 
the shutdown illustrates exxons tension over its public image 
in the year since its tanker split open in alaskas prince william 
sound said simon trimble international oils analyst for the 
investment firm shearson lehman hutton in new york 
these days trimble said it doesnt take 10 million barrels 
of oil spilled into american waters for there to be a negative 
impact on exxon

from a helicopter the wavewashed 
beach looks as if the worst oil spill in us history had never 
touched it 
silvery sticks of driftwood poke through a deep blanket of snow 
and smooth gray pebbles roll in the surf under the gaze of a bald 
eagle perched in a shoreside spruce 
but the view doesnt impress joe bridgman of the alaska 
department of environmental conservation dashing out as the 
chopper lands he digs into the cobble beach and quickly finds what 
he knew he would 
oil he says smell it 
the pungent odor of petroleum wafts through the air as the hole 
turns black with crude oil an oozing remnant of the 108 million 
gallons spilled into prince william sound last march 24 by the 
tanker exxon valdez 
bridgman scoops up a shovelful of gravel lugs it to the waters 
edge and dumps it in a rainbow sheen of oil spreads across the 
water 
hundreds of gallons of oil are locked up under this beach 
he says and this isnt isolated there are hundreds of beaches 
all over the sound that are still oiled and the oil is slowly 
bleeding out 
the beaches can look beautiful at the surface but you can dig 
down in this case just a few inches below the surface and find 
lots of oil now is that a threat or isnt it 
a year after the wreck of the exxon valdez the question clings 
like the oil under this perry island beach certainly the worst is 
over thousands of dead birds no longer wash up on shorelines as 
they did last summer 
but assessing the continuing damage wrought by the nations most 
extensive and expensive oil spill has just begun as a growing 
slick of lawyers haggles over who is to blame exxon corp and 
government agencies debate how to clean up whats left and 
scientists track wildlife populations first steps on the long road 
to recovery 
any hope of a quick solution faded last summer as oil from the 
exxon valdez spread across 1100 miles of alaskas wild southern 
coast 
a cleanup army of 12000 workers polished rocks by hand blasted 
beaches with hot water and sprayed fertilizer to promote the growth 
of oileating microbes 
but when exxon suspended its 2 billion cleanup in 
midseptember it had recovered only 5 percent to 9 percent of the 
oil spilled state officials estimate about 20 percent to 40 
percent is believed to have evaporated that leaves 50 percent to 
75 percent of the oil in the water on the ocean bottom or on 
beaches 
some was soaked up by unwilling sponges the seabirds eagles 
and sea otters whose carcasses now lie frozen in five vans in an 
anchorage storage yard awaiting their day as physical evidence in 
court 
workers found more than 1000 dead otters a sizable chunk of 
the spill areas total population of 15000 to 22000 
many of prince william sounds 3000 bald eagles also suffered 
at least 151 died most poisoned by scavenging the oily remains of 
some of the 34400 dead seabirds recovered 
those numbers alone make the valdez spill the most lethal ever 
but scientists say the actual death count is much higher 
estimating that up to 90 percent of the seabirds caught in oil sank 
from sight or drifted out to sea 
exxon notes the spill did not wipe out any species and says 
surviving animals and birds will rebuild populations but that may 
take up to 70 years for some hardhit seabird colonies us fish 
and wildlife service researchers say 
we never claimed that the spill put any animal on the 
endangered species list but thats missing the point said fish 
and wildlife spokesman bruce batten its still the greatest 
humancaused wildlife disaster that this agency knows about 
oily carcasses were an obvious measure of the spills impact 
but victims also included less visible members of the ecosystem 
such as young salmon and tiny intertidal creatures 
assessment studies for these populations are not finished and 
even preliminary findings are hard to come by researchers have 
been told by lawyers to save their findings for court where it 
seems nearly everyone involved in the spill is headed 
capt joseph hazelwood skipper of the exxon valdez is on trial 
this month in anchorage on charges including criminal mischief and 
drunken driving of his vessel and a federal grand jury recently 
issued criminal indictments against exxon starting a case that 
could take years to finish 
exxon already faces more than 150 civil lawsuits 
fishermen sued because of lost seasons tourboat operators sued 
because fewer people wanted to cruise an oiled sound the state 
sued claiming the company was negligent in responding to the 
spill only to be countersued by exxon which claimed state 
officials hindered the use of chemical dispersants that could have 
broken up large quantities of oil early on 
information about the spill is filtered through this litigious 
atmosphere making much of it suspect exxon distributes 
beforeandafter pictures of cleaned beaches bridgman and other 
state officials accusing exxon of mythmaking eagerly make 
room for journalists on flights to oiled beaches 
state officials cite an october survey that showed 117 miles of 
shoreline remained moderately or heavily oiled with oil more than 
two feet deep in some spots they say observers flying over the 
sound still report 15 to 20 oil sheens bleeding off beaches daily 
exxon officials meanwhile say their winter monitoring of 64 
sites shows wind and waves have scoured away on average more than 
half the surface oil left in september and up to 80 percent of the 
buried oil 
from a laymans point of view whats left out there is really 
insignificant said exxon scientist andy teal

both the state and exxon figures may be accurate but even the 
best studies of the spills effects are mere snapshots of a rugged 
sparsely populated region the size of new jersey maryland and 
delaware combined 
the coast guard has declared some sort of cleanup must resume 
may 1 but nobody has committed to how much or what kind decisions 
will be made after another survey of beach conditions next month 
in general exposed beaches eroded by winter storms appear to 
have fared the best but surface oil remains thick in many 
sheltered coves and estuaries 
areas with oil hidden beneath the surface such as the perry 
island beach bridgman visited may prove the most troublesome 
state officials believe many of those beaches would benefit from 
intensive work such as digging up gravel tumbling it in 
rockwashing machines and replacing it 
while that would kill nearly all living organisms it would 
provide a clean slate for populations to rebuild said steve 
provant the department of environmental conservations spill 
coordinator 
but exxon officials say such intrusive techniques could do more 
harm than good 
some federal authorities are inclined to agree recalling last 
summers heavyhanded invasion of the alaska wilderness 
frightened animals had to flee repeatedly from buzzing 
helicopters and cleanup crews left behind tons of plastic boom 
material absorbent pompons and other litter on previously pristine 
beaches even scientists made their mark painting rocks with 
flourescent paint and tying orange plastic flagging to trees 
you can see these things a mile away and theyre in areas 
where people otherwise would be having a quality wilderness 
experience said nancy lethcoe a sailboattour operator in 
valdez 
lethcoe remembers a prince william sound where you could stand 
on a lonely beach and feel you were the first human ever there it 
was a place where the world still felt big now the world seems 
suddenly smaller civilizations reach extended by the greasy 
fingers of an oil spill 
lethcoe said shell leave the blaming to the lawyers when she 
goes out on the sound these days she focuses on natures 
recuperative powers it works until she discovers that oil has 
found another of her favorite hideaways 
when i know an area is oiled i can brace myself she said 
but when i find an area that wasnt supposed to be oiled it 
brings back the whole trauma of the spill it brings back the 
pain

citicorp said friday it was reorganizing its 
commercial real estate division a move analysts linked to a rise 
in bad loans because of a downturn in the market nationwide 
under the shift citicorp is expected to deemphasize lending to 
large building projects and concentrate on real estate activities 
that generate fees for the bank such as finding investors for 
projects 
citicorp the nations largest lender among commercial banks in 
the field had 126 billion in domestic real estate loans at the 
end of 1989 nonperforming loans totaled 116 billion up from 
548 million a year earlier 
weve seen deterioration in real estate portfolios across the 
board for most large banks said richard mueller a banking 
analyst with duff amp phelps inc in chicago 
citi may be looking at not building up the loans 
outstanding he said it doesnt make sense to expand a real 
estate loan portfolio if its going to continue to demand capital 
and the returns may not be sufficient 
the real estate industry in several regions of the country has 
weakened recently because of excess capacity following expansion in 
the early and mid1980s 
overbuilding was fueled by easy credit from banks and savings 
and loans and an assumption that the market would continue 
expanding analysts said that has led to a reduction of new 
construction to allow demand to catch up with expansion 
among the hardest hit banks has been the bank of new england an 
aggressive lender during the mid1980s construction boom which 
lost 11 billion in 1989 largely due to bad loans 
along with continuing problems in the southwest tied to a 
recession there the northeast has the weakest commercial real 
estate market now analysts said florida arizona and the 
midatlantic region also have been softening 
citicorp said it remains committed to this business and we 
intend to grow and expand our franchise to deliver financial 
solutions to our clients 
the bank suggested that increasing competition from abroad also 
played a role in the reorganization foreign banks involved in a 
rising level of crossborder real estate investments have pushed 
down profit margins on international and highgrade projects 
citicorp suffered a sharp rise in nonperforming loans which are 
loans on which borrowers are not paying interest but have not yet 
defaulted in the first six months of 1989 the bank has said it 
expects an increase in the nonperforming loans in 1990 
according to published reports the restructuring will create 
two new divisions traditional real estate lending and 
feegenerating activities such as arranging sales debt and equity 
for projects

when exxon corp returns to the oiled 
beaches of prince william sound this summer its cleanup will be 
smaller than last years and use mostly lowimpact techniques 
company officials said thursday 
lee raymond exxon corp president said at a news conference 
that winter storms had cleaned some of the gummy residue of the 
nations worst oil spill caused when the exxon valdez ran aground 
march 24 on a charted reef 
but he said a tour of the beaches a week and a half ago showed 
him that much work remains to be done beyond the 2 billion the 
company reports it has already spent on the effort 
raymond declined to say how many people would join the cleanup 
effort 
significantly less than were involved last year he said 
we would hope we could get the job done this year but thats 
based on information that wont be available until the end of 
april 
david kennedy oil spill coordinator for the national oceanic 
and atmospheric administration said earlier this week that he 
expected the exxon workforce to number in the hundreds rather than 
approach the 10000 hired last year 
noaa has suggested exxon crews pick up tarballs and oiled debris 
by hand break up asphalt and tar mats with shovels and spray 
fertilizer over the contaminated sand and gravel to promote natural 
bacteria which eat oil 
only in extreme cases should heavy machinery be brought in 
kennedy said heavy machinery such as plows can be used to turn 
over gravel to expose it to oxygen and sunlight helping the 
natural breakdown of oil 
noaa and the state have recommended the extreme measure of 
digging up the sand washing it and putting it back on beaches 
where people gather shellfish for food the agencies say that the 
shortterm damage would be overshadowed by the longterm gains 
otto harrison exxon alaska operations manager said the company 
will use cleanup techniques this summer generally less intrusive 
on the environment than the hot water and steamhose baths 
employed last year 
they range from bioremediation using the oileating 
bacteria to simply removing the oiled sediment 
to dig it up is the most intrusive thing you can do 
harrison said we dont know if the benefits are worth it 
a multiagency group is to conduct a shoreline survey in april 
and turn in a work plan by may 1 harrison said work will begin 
the first of may or as soon as weather permits harrison said 
exxons plan must be approved by coast guard adm david 
ciancaglini the federal onscene coordinator 
harrison said some sections of the shoreline most exposed to 
wind and wave action are 50 percent cleaner than they were when 
exxon cleanup workers left the coast in september 
the storms did a little better than wed hoped harrison 
said and were not through the winter yet 
the exxon valdez leaked nearly 11 million gallons of north slope 
crude oil into the clear waters of prince william sound staining 
beaches shutting down fishing seasons and killing countless birds 
and mammals 
exxon said more than 25 studies have been done over the winter 
most of which show significant shoreline improvement excellent 
water quality no missing species and no stressed animals 
fin fish are safe for consumption generally the same is true 
for shellfish except for those in the windy bay area harrison 
said 
responding to a reporters question the officials said they 
didnt plan to hire any rock polishers as the company did last 
year 
wiping rocks with rags was never a primary technique 
harrison said the material on the rocks this year is pretty 
heavy bioremediation and removal will be the primary tools

the government spent more than 1 million too 
much on nobid contracts to put the green and the black in the 
nations greenbacks according to a congressional report released 
thursday 
the general accounting office also said the head of the company 
that got a contract to supply ink for the nations currency was a 
friend of the thendirector of the head the bureau of engraving and 
printing the governments moneyprinter 
sen john glenn dohio described the contract as a highly 
questionable procurement 
he said the government was offered a price for ink in 1988 when 
contracts became competitive that was 13 million cheaper than 
the same supplier sold to the government on a noncompetitive bases 
in 1986 the savings would have been higher still if the government 
had let potential ink suppliers compete for the contract from the 
start he added 
beginning in 1982 the bureau of engraving and printing stopped 
making its own black and green dollarprinting ink and began buying 
it from the us subsidiary of a swiss company sicpa sa 
in 1986 the contract was opened to competition and sicpa offered 
the highest of four bids the report said complaints about ink 
fumes led the government to cancel two tests of the offered inks 
and throw out all the bids sicpa continued as the governments 
single supplier and the contract process dragged on for another two 
years 
bids were solicited again in 1988 and sicpa reduced its price by 
10 percent to submit the lowest bid other bidders increased their 
prices over the 1986 proposals the report said 
but even before the 1986 proposals said the gao the 
investigative arm of congress sicpa president maurice amon and 
thenbureau of engraving and printing director robert leuver were 
apparently becoming friends they took a 1985 trip to brazil and 
traveled in 1986 to the far east with us treasurer katherine 
ortega 
the brazil trip was billed as an inspection of an underground 
inkmoving system at a sicpa plant but the plant had no underground 
inkmoving system the report said 
in 1987 according to the gao leuver suggested another 
solesource contract for sicpa and triggering an internal 
confrontation with ortega ortegas deputy and peter daly then 
leuvers deputy and now the bureaus director 
leuver was not involved in ink procurement matters after 
that and retired a year later the report said 
although the government spends only about 112 million annually 
on ink for american money said glenn the report highlights the 
need to ensure there are no personal relationships between agency 
chiefs and contractors 
procurement integrity is not some theoretical abstract said 
glenn who heads the senate governmental affairs committee which 
is looking into government contracting 
daly did not immediately return a call seeking comment

president bush said thursday he would appoint 
a michigan real estate executive to the board overseeing his 
savings and loan bailout 
robert c larson chief executive officer of the taubman company 
in bloomfield hills mich was named to one of two vacant seats on 
the fivemember resolution trust corp oversight board 
treasury secretary nicholas f brady who heads the board said 
he expects the white house to announce the fifth member next week 
federal reserve chairman alan greenspan and housing secretary jack 
kemp are also members 
the board sets policy and controls the purse strings of the 
bailout agency created last august 
congressional democrats have complained that bush waited until 
after most of the bailout policies were in place before naming the 
public members of the board who were supposed to balance the 
influence of the government officials 
brady said the appointments were slow because the administration 
sought people experienced in real estate disposal that complicated 
clearance checks for possible conflicts of interest he said 
weve done the right thing and gotten people who really know 
what theyre doing instead of just a name he said 
on another matter the oversight board voted unanimously to 
clear the way for state housing agencies to provide lowcost 
mortgages to lowincome and moderateincome people who purchase 
homes from the corporation 
the agency plans to offer about 10000 properties to lowincome 
people of which 5174 are in texas 968 in oklahoma and 881 in 
louisiana the texas housing agency has offered to reserve up to 
140 million in lowcost mortgages to speed the purchase of homes 
there

coffee futures prices fell sharply friday on new yorks coffee 
sugar amp cocoa exchange after brazils new president announced 
sweeping economic reforms that were seen as likely to spur sales of 
brazilian coffee 
the brazilian economic package also was linked to a decline in 
soybean futures prices and to a sharp rise in sugar futures 
although analysts conceded the measures were difficult to interpret 
on other commodity markets grain futures rose oil futures were 
mostly lower precious metals advanced and livestock and meat 
futures were mostly higher 
coffee futures settled 5 cents to 6 cents lower with the 
contract for delivery in march at 8950 cents a pound 
the economic reforms outlined friday by president fernando 
collor de mello included abolishment of the brazilian coffee 
institute introduction of a new currency with freefloating 
foreign exchange rates and limits on bank withdrawals all of which 
were seen as encouraging brazilian producers and exporters to pour 
more coffee onto the world market 
brazil the largest coffee producer has been withholding coffee 
from the market which recently helped to boost coffee futures 
prices to their highest levels in eight months 
analysts said the brazilian coffee institute which administers 
the governments export and internal marketing policies is known 
to be holding a large quantity of lowquality coffee possibly as 
many as 17 million 132pound bags 
by dissolving the institute as a costcutting measure the 
government could force the agency to sell that coffee sooner that 
it would have otherwise although the beans would probably go for 
internal consumption rather than export said analyst celeste 
georkakis of cargill investor services inc 
a freefloating brazilian currency could encourage brazilian 
exporters to offer more coffee on the world market analysts said 
they said limits on bank withdrawals might prompt producers and 
exporters to sell coffee at lower prices as a way of raising cash 
analyst arthur stevenson of prudentialbache securities inc 
said that increased coffee sales was only one possible 
interpretation of the brazilian reform package 
he said the selloff in coffee futures also reflected 
disappointment about what collor de mello did not say 
the market was perhaps looking for a very constructive 
statement from the new brazilian government and that statement was 
not forthcoming stevenson said 
concerns about the new brazilian currency also prompted selling 
of soybean futures on the chicago board of trade brazil is the 
secondlargest producer of soybeans after the united states

cents a gallon may lost 054 cent to 5289 cents and june dropped 
to 5232 cents down 063 cent 
analysts said demand for crude oil has weakened in recent weeks 
due mainly to seasonal factors including warmer weather nationwide 
and spring maintenance when refineries use less crude oil to make 
gasoline and other products 
as of last week the 13week average demand was down 1 percent 
from the same period last year said peter beutel energy analyst 
with elders futures inc 
slower demand has resulted in a sharp buildup in crude oil 
inventories in the nations storage tanks supplies are running 
approximately 56 percent higher than last year according to 
statistics released this week 
we will see demand pick up later this year but for now theres 
plenty of oil out there beutel said

bond prices shot up friday as traders detected 
weakness in the nations manufacturing sector and signs that the 
economy remains sluggish and inflation in check 
the treasurys benchmark 30year bond climbed 1316 point or 
813 per 1000 face amount its yield which rises when prices 
fall fell to about 854 percent from 861 percent late thursday 
the government released three reports on february economic 
statistics but analysts said figures showing of no change in 
wholesale prices and a 7 percent decline in housing starts during 
the month had little effect because of the influence of 
unseasonable weather 
instead bond prices climbed after the federal reserve said 
industrial production rose 06 percent less than economists had 
anticipated and largely due to a return of automobile workers after 
january slowdowns 
the factory sector of the economy remains weak said steven 
a wood economist with bankamerica capital markets in san 
francisco 
analysts had expected an increase in industrial production of 
08 percent to 09 percent wood said so the lower figure was 
interpreted as a further sign of weakness factoring in resurgent 
auto production the signs were even weaker he said 
what you had in the markets was expectations for worse news on 
the price front and the economic front which strengthened the 
credit market said maria fiorini ramirez president of ramirez 
capital consultants inc 
the industrial production report was good for the bond market 
because a slowdown in such economic indicators dampens the 
likelihood the fed will think it necessary to raise interest rates 
in order to curb inflation higher interest rates lower the value 
of existing bonds 
the labor departments producer price index showed no change 
following a huge 18 percent jump in january attributed to a 
holiday cold snap mild weather in february kept energy prices down 
economists said inflation which erodes the value of bonds 
still was on a 4 percent to 45 percent annual course 
also housing starts returned to a more normal pace in february 
declining 70 percent following a steep jump during januarys 
record warm weather 
analysts said both reports virtually were ignored by bond 
traders as they were in line with expectations 
in the secondary market for treasury bonds prices of shortterm 
governments gained lsqb point to point intermediate maturities were 
up 1132 point to point and longterm issues shot up 2332 point 
to 1316 point according to telerate inc the financial 
information service 
the movement of a point is equivalent to a change of 10 in the 
price of a bond with a 1000 face value 
the shearson lehman hutton daily treasury bond index which 
measures price movements on all outstanding treasury issues with 
maturities of a year or longer climbed 425 to 115181 
yields on threemonth treasury bills fell to 815 percent as the 
discount was down 2 basis points to 790 percent yields on 
sixmonth bills dropped to 826 percent as the discount was 2 basis 
points lower at 785 percent yields on oneyear bills were off 
sharply at 834 percent as the discount lost 5 basis points to 775 
percent 
a basis point is onehundredth of a percentage point the yield 
is the annualized return on an investment in a treasury bill the 
discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face 
value which is paid at maturity 
the federal funds rate the interest rate banks charge each 
other on overnight loans was quoted at 8 316 percent down from 
8 percent late thursday 
in the taxexempt market the bond buyer index of 40 actively 
traded municipal bonds closed at 91 1532 up 332 point the 
average yield to maturity was 749 percent compared with 748 
percent late thursday the bond buyer changed the mix of bonds in

opec oil ministers met friday evening to 
review the groups pricing and production strategy and decide 
whether to change it in the coming months 
the meeting of the organization of petroleum exporting 
countries special monitoring panel got under way amid widespread 
speculation that the cartel was unlikely to rein in current 
production anytime soon despite slackening demand and softer world 
oil prices 
opec secretarygeneral subroto said demand for the groups oil 
is expected to fall to 208 million barrels a day in coming months 
far below the 237 million barrels the cartel is estimated to be 
pumping 
the ministers met for about 90 minutes in formal session then 
adjourned the committee was expected to hold informal discussions 
in their hotel rooms on saturday 
no date was set for a final session but many doubt the 
discussions will continue beyond the weekend 
in advance of the session some ministers expressed concern that 
quotacheating by various opec members which has swelled the 
cartels production well above its target could dampen prices 
further 
prices have been slipping since early january and are expected 
to weaken further in the traditionally weak second quarter when 
seasonal factors and annual refinery maintenance reduces demand for 
crude oil 
those countries that overproduce i think they have some 
explanations surely they have some reasons behind it said 
ginandjar kartasasmita oil minister of indonesia 
we would like to hear it he said 
kuwaiti oil minister ali khalifa alsabah reflecting the unease 
about the upcoming quarter said it has three months april 
may and june i wish it had two 
the opening of the committee meeting was delayed several hours 
to give the ministers time to huddle privately in their suites at a 
luxury hotel not far from opec headquarters 
several ministers said no changes would be made in the cartels 
production and pricing guidelines for the first half of the year 
we are not suppose to take any decisions said ginandjar 
nigerian oil minister jibril aminu said the purpose of the 
meeting is to monitor production and quotas 
what decision is taken depends on the data available to us 
he said 
some were clearly worried by the cheating of such countries as 
kuwait and the united arab emirates 
mana saeed otaiba the emirates oil minister told reporters he 
would like to see both higher production and higher prices but 
acknowledged that is impossible 
when pressed to make a choice he said wed rather increase 
production until everybody is satisfied 
industry analysts put opecs output at well over 23 million 
barrels a day its supply ceiling for the januaryjune period is a 
bit more than 22 million barrels a day compared with 205 million 
barrels in the last quarter of 1989 
until recently demand in the united states and other consuming 
nations has dried up the excess supply keeping prices above the 
cartels benchmark of 18 a barrel 
but some worry that continued high production will lead to 
weaker prices in the apriljune quarter when demand tends to shrink 
with warming weather 
overproduction is a concern to us said ginandjar 
algerian oil minister sadek boussena upon arrival late 
thursday said we knew from the beginning the second quarter 
will be difficult 
iraqs minister issam abdul raheem alchalabi said demand 
will go down in the apriljune quarter thats for sure 
he predicted it would run between 21 million to 22 million barrels 
a day 
in order to keep prices up he said we will ask everybody to 
adhere to the quota and i think this will be met 
prices are not as firm as they used to be a few weeks ago 
so maybe they the overproducers will think twice about 
raising output he said 
the average price of a basket of seven crudes monitored by opec 
was 1836 a barrel in the first week of march it hit 2056 a 
barrel in the first week of january 
west texas intermediate the benchmark american crude has been 
trading in the range of 20 to 21 a barrel 
in advance of the committee meeting chalabi reportedly pressed 
although unsuccessfully for a 10 percent increase in the 18 
reference price 
his suggestion like that of kuwaits ali khalifa alsabah to 
scrap the quota system will likely get an airing at the committee 
meeting the talks are designed to lay the groundwork for a 
decisionmaking conference in may 
sabah has said the quota system should be shelved because it is 
unrealistic and often ignored 
the cartel sets an overall output ceiling and then gives each 
country a quota for its production without a quota each member 
could produce freely but some of the countries now are producing 
at their limits and could not go any higher 
opec members are algeria ecuador gabon indonesia iran 
iraq kuwait libya nigeria qatar saudi arabia the united arab 
emirates and venezuela

general development corp has agreed to plead 
guilty to a felony charge and pay up to 500000 in fines to settle 
charges it schemed to inflate home prices at its nine florida 
developments prosecutors said friday 
a 16count indictment said thousands of home buyers lured by 
slick sales pitches and florida sunshine fell prey to an elaborate 
scheme in which general development allegedly made 850 million on 
more than 11000 overpriced homes 
the indictment said the homes were sold mostly to midwest and 
northeast residents many of them recent emigrants brought to 
florida on sales junkets and blocked from learning the facts about 
the state housing market 
many of the homes sold by general development in nine 
communities between 1982 and 1989 were at least 20 percent 
overvalued compared to similar florida homes and at least one was 
listed for more than twice its estimated worth officials said 
peoples lives were devastated they were stuck with 
mortgage payments and homes valued far under what they paid said 
assistant us attorney norman moscowitz who led the twoyear 
investigation 
federal prosecutors said general development agreed to plead 
guilty to one count of mail fraud and pay the fine as part of a 
consent decree that must receive court approval 
also the homebuilder agreed to reorganize top management and 
set up a courtmonitored restitution fund that could exceed 100 
million during the next 25 years 
two former general development executives named in the fraud 
indictment are considering a plea agreement that would call for 
some jail time but the details have not been finalized us 
attorney dexter lehtinen said 
former chairman david brown and former president robert ehrling 
were making 600000 a year each before being forced out by general 
development directors march 9 they could not be reached for 
comment friday 
meanwhile the new york investment firm united capital corp 
which owns 127 percent of general development announced it plans 
to nominate six candidates to the companys board at elections in 
may 
general development which also faces several classaction 
suits has restructured its homesale policies and plans to remain 
in business said charles simons president and chief executive 
officer 
it is clear that our house prices had gotten out of line with 
our competition and that some customers were disadvantaged he 
said 
general development whose nationwide real estate holdings equal 
nearly half the size of rhode island this month has laid off about 
5500 workers about 10 percent of its work force and shut down 
sales offices in hollywood fla and boston 
in addition to 350000 lots in the nine florida developments 
general development operates a timeshare resort near disney world 
a recreational community in tennessee and 10 timeshare resorts in 
the west 
through dozens of northern sales offices and seminars general 
development pitched vacant lots or built homes only other general 
development homes were used in appraisals to back up company 
statements on the value of the properties the indictment alleged 
many customers took advantage of threeday southward ho 
subsidized trips to florida 
but general development kept potential buyers from learning 
about prices in other developments by assigning a sales 
representative to track customers constantly and screen telephone 
calls their hotel rooms the indictment alleged 
those agreeing to buy a house were told to seek a mortgage at 
gdv financial corp a general development subsidiary also named in 
the indictment general development sales officials told buyers 
that only cash and gdv mortgages were accepted as part of the 
companys onestop shopping 
chase federal savings and loan and california federal savings 
and loan two major purchasers of gdv mortgages stopped investing 
after learning of the overvalued homes since 1988 gdv sold 70 
million in mortgages to the public through drexel burnham lambert 
inc and painewebber inc 
the federal national mortgage association and the federal home 
loan mortgage corp also stopped buying gdv mortgages in 1985 
because of the companys appraisal policies

a federal judge on friday ordered drexel burnham 
lambert group inc to give creditors more information about 260 
million in bonuses paid before the firm filed for bankruptcy 
protection 
lawyers for drexel agreed to provide detailed information about 
the firms 1989 compensation and bonus payments over the weekend to 
attorneys and accountants for the official committee of unsecured 
creditors 
drexel also said it would turn over transcripts of depositions 
of drexel executives taken by the securities and exchange 
commission which is investigating the bonus payments 
creditors have questioned the timing of the bonus payments of 
196 million in cash and 64 million in securities to drexel 
exceutives in the months prior to the firms chapter 11 bankruptcy 
filing on feb 13 
sec chairman richard breeden told congress on march 2 the 
commission was investigating whether there was any was wrongdoing 
in the bonus payments which drexel said were made in december and 
january 
under federal law creditors can seek to recover payments made 
to company insiders up to one year before a bankruptcy filing 
creditors routinely seek a wide range of information about a 
companys financial condition leading up to a filing 
after drexel creditors attorney marc kirscher said the company 
was trying to impede a study of the firms financial condition 
before the chapter 11 filing drexel agreed to turn over copies of 
financial statements and auditors reports for 1988 a drexel 
spokesman said 1989 reports were not yet completed 
us bankruptcy judge howard c buschman iii said if the 
creditors committee was not satisfied with information provided by 
drexel it could raise complaints at a hearing monday 
drexel had asked that the information about the payments remain 
confidential but buschman said it would become public in court or 
through the sec 
the bonus payments were made by drexels securities subsidiary 
drexel burnham lambert inc which is not part of the bankruptcy 
case but creditors can seek information about the payments because 
they relate to the financial status of the parent firm 
also friday drexel also disclosed in court that it hoped to 
sell its 65 million investment in paramount petroleum corp for 
95 million drexel owns 53 percent of the company which is in 
bankruptcy proceedings 
buschman also resolved the first challenge by creditors to a 
planned asset sale when he allowed drexel to accept an offer for 
nearly 10 million for 141 million in highyield notes issued by 
petco a california pet supply company 
drexel underwrote the 155 percent notes due in march 1991 in a 
private placement creditors had wanted to drexel to consider other 
bids to try to get a higher price 
drexel once one of the most powerful firms on wall street 
filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection after defaulting on 
shortterm debt and failing to raise new bank credit 
under an agreement between the company and creditors three 
drexel board members are supervising the firms liquidation with 
input from creditors
