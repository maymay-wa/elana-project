welcome to paradise for as long as it 
stays above water the people of this chain of palmstudded islands 
fear global warming could condemn their nation to geological 
history 
if the earth gets hotter as some scientists predict the 
maldives could be swamped by rising seas and violent storms the 
indian ocean archipelago almost certainly would be among the first 
casualties of the greenhouse effect 
we may have some islands just disappear that is according to 
the businessasusual scenario i would hope that the international 
community would take note and do something before that happens 
said hussain shihab the maldives director of environment affairs 
according to some estimates unchecked emissions of carbon 
dioxide and other heattrapping greenhouse gases will raise the sea 
level by a foot in the next 40 years submerging much of the 
maldives 175 square miles of land 
the maldives about 400 miles south of india and the same 
distance west of sri lanka are little more than clumps of coconut 
palms fringed by white sand in a nest of coral reefs 
the 1190 islands are clustered in atolls in an archipelago 510 
miles long just 200 islands are inhabited and a quarter of the 
nations 200000 people live on male island which covers barely 
one square mile 
few of the islands are more than 6 feet above sea level so a 
big splash can be devastating as demonstrated in april 1987 when a 
tidal wave rolled over the island nation 
we had a storm that was more severe than anyone could ever 
remember shihab said this really woke us up 
twothirds of male the maldivian capital was flooded by sea 
water the international airport on neighboring hulule was closed 
for two days and entire fishing villages were under water 
shihab said damage totaled 40 million half this nations 
annual gross domestic product 
some experts said the freak storm originated 4000 miles away in 
the south indian ocean underlining the maldives vulnerability to 
faraway calamities 
the disaster forced maldivians to take a more appreciative look 
at their coral reefs the feeding grounds for a stunning array of 
tropical fish the reefs provide a natural barrier from an often 
hostile sea 
the mining of coral the basic building material for most houses 
here was forbidden on reefs connected to islands the ban 
eventually will be extended to unattached atolls although 
importing cement will be costly shihab said 
traditionally dependent on fishing and tuna exports the 
islands energy needs are small there is no heavy industry and 
male has only a few dozen cars experiments with solar power 
promise to further decrease dependency on polluting fossile fuels 
as a result the maldivians have felt few constraints about 
pressing for worldwide controls on emissions of carbon dioxide and 
other greenhouse gases that threaten the islands 
these gases build a shield in the atmosphere which traps heat 
and many experts predict higher temperatures will change weather 
patterns and raise sea levels endangering coastal areas and 
lowlying countries some experts disagree arguing that such 
longterm effects are unclear 
it is the small island states who contribute the least in 
heattrapping pollutants which will suffer the most shihab 
said 
the tropical beauty of the islands is the maldives only natural 
asset and major source of income other than the sea when the first 
tourist resort opened in 1972 the maldives were virtually unknown 
except as a staging post for the british air force dating from 
world war ii the british left in 1976 
this year the number of tourists is expected to equal the 
resident population resorts have gone up on 59 previously 
uninhabited islands catering to scuba divers and sun worshipers 
the influx of tourists has aroused fears of cultural pollution 
in this strict sunni moslem society which has its own unique 
language and script travelers are discouraged from visiting all 
but a few fishing villages outside the resort islands 
passengers arriving on international flights are cautioned not 
to bring alcohol pigs dogs statues for worship pornography 
explosives guns or drugs in that order 
shihab said the loss of cultural identity would be the real 
tragedy if the maldives were overwhelmed by the environment we 
dont want to be refugees of the greenhouse effect he said

young ablebodied men seem in short supply 
in the teeming markets and streets of baghdad the threat of war 
has stripped iraq of its youth and sent many of them to the front 
the government announced this week it would call up an 
additional 150000 men for duty in kuwait 
but some western diplomats question the numbers and expressed 
doubts about iraqs ability to wage a war claiming troop morale is 
low strategic fuel supplies inadequate and vital spare parts are 
in dwindling supply 
highways in kuwait are littered with brokendown tanks and 
disabled military vehicles western diplomats claimed 
the country has 18 million people a regular army of 550000 and 
480000 reservists as well as a popular army militia of about 
850000 according to diplomats in baghdad who spoke on condition 
of anonymity iraq claims more than 8 million volunteers in the 
popular army 
its air force with more than 500 combat jets is fairly 
sophisticated and its army wellequipped 
a weakness the diplomats say is the soldiers whose morale is 
eroding because of months maintaining the alert in the desert and 
food shortages brought about by distribution problems 
men going absent while on leave is another big problem one 
european diplomat said speaking on condition of anonymity 
one estimate is 40 percent of those who go on leave dont go 
back to kuwait the president had to decree that its the same as 
desertion the diplomat said 
also the diplomats noted that small numbers of iraqi soldiers 
have deserted along the turkish border 
besides the expected reinforcements iraq has an estimated 
430000 troops in southern iraq and kuwait which iraq invaded aug 
2 
there are about 330000 soldiers in persian gulf from the 
multinational force including about 230000 us troops the 
united states plans to increase its troop strength to about 430000 
by january 
about 1 million iraqis and iranian troops died during their 
eightyear war according to un estimates 
iraq expelled all western military attaches last month making 
it more difficult to accurately assess iraqs readiness for war 
were getting a lot of technical intelligence but we can no 
longer get the assessments of individual units commanders and 
their fighting ability said one western diplomat with long 
military experience 
others say many of the troops in kuwait belong to the popular 
army a ragtag outfit of illtrained irregulars 
iraqi troops in the south also include the crack 
battlehardened republican guards whose ability and willingness to 
fight remains unchallenged to western observers 
but iraq is also a victim of its military system said the 
diplomat with military experience 
he said the army is dug in along a maginottype line on the 
border which is vulnerable to massive air strikes from 
multinational forces the maginot line was a french fortification 
that failed to repel germanys invasion in world war ii 
they dont realize what theyre facing the diplomat said 
this time the americans have the proper weapon for the proper 
target 
western diplomats increasingly feel that a limited war coupled 
with economic sanctions might be enough to force iraq to withdraw 
from kuwait 
iraq meanwhile is hoping it can endure the economic embargo 
and break the international coalition against it the diplomats 
said 
the iraqi leadership believes that unless they give him a 
reason to go to war president bush like all presidents will look 
for a way to avoid doing it the european diplomat said 
iraqi officials say they want peace but insist theyre prepared 
for war 
we expect war at any moment this is a fact not just 
propaganda said information minister latif nassayif jassim 
one hopes a war will never erupt 
diplomats contend the timing of iraqs planned dec 25 to march 
25 release of western hostages reflects baghdads fear of fighting 
the united states 
the winter is considered the best time for military operations 
in the gulf because of lower temperatures and frequent spells of 
good weather 
also diplomats say the west may face political pressure to 
avoid war during the moslem fasting month of ramadan beginning in 
march

life was good for johnny spell 
until saddam hussein absorbed kuwait 
spell was busy running an appliance store founded by his late 
father in rural north carolina and he was settling down with his 
bride of three months 
then he was called to active duty with his national guard unit 
now his original 90day tour has been extended for another 90 
days so he wont be home for the holidays 
when this is over i hope ive got a business to go back to i 
hope my business dont go bankrupt because im gone said spell 
46 of autryville nc and a staff sergeant with the 382nd public 
affairs unit 
ive got that to worry about plus breaking away from a new 
family we were just getting started and all of a sudden this 
thing comes along that has been the hardest thing for me to cope 
with spell said in an interview 
more than 51000 citizen soldiers have been called to active 
duty under operation desert shield with an extension they can 
serve for 180 days or even longer if congress authorizes it 
by law employers must keep a job open for reservists doing 
their duty but small businessmen such as spell can only hope their 
trade will survive in their absence 
its harder on the citizen soldier we had to leave a job and 
we had to leave our families spell said being selfemployed 
its just a tough situation to deal with in my absence i feel 
like i am going to lose some business 
spell an 18year veteran of the national guard says not to 
misinterpret the strain of being away as an unwillingness to serve 
he wont shirk his duty no matter how much it hurts financially 
and personally 
when you sign the dotted line you know if a time comes like 
this you have to go and do your duty im not bitter about being 
here i just miss home and i miss my business like every person 
does and i need to be back spell said 
this may sound corny but i wanted to do my patriotic american 
duty i wanted to serve weve got a job to do he said but 
everyone over here regrets theyre not at home i dont guess that 
can be helped 
his father founded spells furniture and appliance store in 
1949 selling and repairing household furnishings tvs and other 
electronic products in a town of 500 people spells has eight 
fulltime employees at two locations 
spell will be away for the christmas rush his busiest time of 
the year and thats worrisome 
i do the buying the selling the service even some of the 
delivery someone else has to do it now spell said the only 
way weve existed through the years is through repeat business 
spells wife and cousin are filling in as managers for the 
business while hes in saudi arabia attached to the armys 18th 
airborne corps it would be impossible for him to try to run the 
shop from 7000 miles away while hes wearing his desert camouflage 
fatigues and doing uncle sams work 
i need to give the army 100 percent he said 
spell was activated aug 31 and has been in saudi arabia since 
sept 13 he had barely enough time to straighten out some business 
details change some things in his will and give his wife power of 
attorney 
hell miss thanksgiving and christmas with his family and his 
75yearold mother and hell be away for his wifes dec 7 
birthday 
and there just wasnt enough time to take care of some personal 
business like selling his wifes former home while the couple 
settled in 
some things will just have to be put on hold spell said 
theres only so much one person can do

the lower house of congress has 
temporarily suspended eight of twelve supreme court justices in a 
dispute over a beer tax aggravating political divisions in the 
country 
in response the justices threatened to annul the 1989 elections 
that put the current government in power they asked the armed 
forces to intervene 
the armed forces which have staged more than 100 coups in 
bolivias 165year history declined a statement said the conflict 
must be resolved according to the constitution 
the government had said two weeks ago that it would try eight 
out of the twelve justices for incompetence after they ruled that a 
beer tax authorized by congress was illegal 
charging the justices were influenced by beer companies the 
government said the repeal of the tax threatened an economic 
stabilization plan by depriving the treasury of 50 million 
the lower house temporarily suspended the justices on tuesday 
and the senate was to consider a measure permanently removing them 
the court responded by saying it would consider a petition 
presented in august 1989 by the revolutionary nationalist movement 
calling for the annulment of the elections the court is controlled 
by justices appointed under the previous revolutionary nationalist 
movement government 
congressmen tito hoz de vila head of the congressional economic 
committee said the conflict threatens the countrys political 
and economic stability 
it is necessary for bolivians to act with serenity said 
gen hugo banzer suarez a member of the governing coalition we 
must strengthen democracy which is in danger 
the revolutionary nationalist movement placed first in the 1989 
popular vote but lacked the required absolute majority as a 
result the president was elected by congress 
president jaime paz zamora of the revolutionary leftist 
movement finished third in the elections but was elected by 
congress through an alliance with the conservative nationalist 
democratic action party headed by former dictator banzer suarez 
whose party had finished second 
the opposition accused the governing coalition of attempting 
to destroy the judicial power by subjugating it to act as a legal 
office and not as a separate branch of government

here are excerpts from tuesdays testimony 
before the senate ethics committee on the dealings five senators 
had with charles h keating jr owner of the failed lincoln 
savings and loan 
gwendolyn van paasschen economics assistant to sen john 
mccain rariz continued her testimony from monday she was 
questioned at one point by james hamilton the lawyer representing 
sen dennis deconcini dariz 
 
hamilton i would like to go back to the question i asked you 
before about whether sen mccain was coaxed into the meeting with 
four senators and edwin gray then chairman of the federal home 
loan bank board now who was coaxing sen mccain into this 
meeting 
van paasschen it was my view that what sen deconcini had 
suggested was inappropriate and i further went on to say that i 
believed that the reason that sen mccain was being involved in 
this was because sen mccain was a republican and that would 
ensure that it was a bipartisan effort and that keating had raised 
more for sen mccain than he had for sen deconcini at that time 
so if the press were to ever get a hold of it it would be more 
embarrassing for sen mccain than for sen deconcini 
hamilton what fact led you to believe that sen deconcini was 
coaxing sen mccain to this meeting because he was a republican 
 
van paasschen his demeanor was very persuasive he was coming 
to sen mccain instead of mr keating himself he was a democrat 
we were republican and as i said before keating had raised more 
for sen mccain than he had for sen deconcini at that time

in the afternoon session any sabrin special assistant to 
special counsel robert bennett questioned sen mccains 
administrative aide christopher koch 
 
sabrin did you attend the meeting between mr keating and sen 
mccain on the 24th march 24 1987 
koch i did 
sabrin can you tell us with as much detail as you can recall 
what happened 
koch it would be a very difficult meeting to forget i 
remember vividly him mccain telling mr keating that he hadnt 
spent 5 years of his life in a prisoner of war camp to have his 
courage or his integrity questioned and he gave mr keating a 
dressing down the likes of which i in my experience on the hill 
had never experienced a senator giving a major employer of his 
state it was startling to me i mean it was a very vivid 
impression 
sabrin can you recall with any detail what the substance was of 
what mr keating was asking sen mccain to do and what his response 
was 
koch yes john said that theres certain things he can do and 
theres certain things he couldnt do he said he could find out if 
mr keatings allegations had merit he could look in and ask 
questions about if this investigation was taking so long why it 
was taking so long 
but he said i cant go in and do your bidding for you i 
cant go in and break arms and legs for you i can find out if 
youre being treated fairly 
mr keating thought he was being treated very very 
unfairly it was almost as if he hadnt been listening to john 
because he again got into requests for him to get involved and 
again the meeting got a little bit hot and john came back at him 
again and said he couldnt do that 
sabrin what was your understanding after mr keating walked 
out of sen mccains office of how the whole matter was left 
koch i thought that the relationship had clearly in my opinion 
come to a screeching halt i had never heard two people have 
that kind of conversation and ever want to talk to each other 
again

when michelle and rodney lawrence 
got married they really didnt anticipate spending their first 
anniversary on thanksgiving day driving trucks in different parts 
of saudi arabia thousands of miles from their 3monthold son 
for pvt 1 michelle lawrence the best thanksgiving present 
would be to see her 25yearold husband a 3hour drive away in 
the northern desert and to get home as quickly as possible to her 
infant son and two older children 
though some military couples have thrived here others like the 
lawrences have been torn between military duty and family 
commitments back home 
the huge us deployment in the persian gulf shattered mrs 
lawrences family heightened her anxiety and turned her against 
the army which ordered her to leave rodney jr when he was only 
five weeks old 
they said you signed a contract you have to go she said 
i dont think its fair that they split families up like this 
because not everybody needs to be here its extremely 
heartless 
if she had the opportunity the 21yearold from battle creek 
mich said she would choose a peaceful stateside job and quit the 
army 
when i joined the army i never believed id be in a place 
like this back home is such a beautiful place when things come up 
like this it brings reality to the job that youre actually 
doing she said 
mrs lawrence candidly admits she joined the army so she could 
go to college become a lawyer and get comprehensive health 
coverage for her children 
she signed up for 6 years and has been in for 2 years driving 
trucks 
on nov 22 1989 she married fellow truck driver spec rodney 
lawrence and started a new life excited at the prospect of 
completing more prelaw courses 
we used to be in the same unit she said when we got 
married according to military laws they split us up 
their first child was born just after iraq invaded kuwait on 
aug 2 
shortly afterward lawrences 96th transportation company was 
ordered to saudi arabia then 2 weeks later her 180th 
transportation battalion from ft hood tex was deployed here 
i knew i had to go so i volunteered to come with our advance 
party so i could hurry up get over here get it over with and get 
back home she said 
but with no rotations because of the additional us troops 
being deployed here she said those who arrived first will end up 
staying longer 
before lawrence left he adopted her two oldest children tony 
3 and brandon 2 his mother is now looking after them and the 
baby rodney jr 
ive talked to them one time on the phone since ive been 
here the oldest one isnt doing too bad the middle one is really 
taking it hard hes always talking about momma i want you to 
come home momma i miss you momma come get me 
its hard to talk to him i try and talk to tony as long as i 
can to make up for the tears that i shed with brandon 
since her arrival about seven weeks ago mrs lawrence has been 
driving fiveton trucks some of her female colleagues have been 
run off the road or stoned by saudi men unaccustomed to seeing 
women drivers but she said so far shes been lucky 
her husband has been driving tank carriers 
ive seen him three or four times and i get a letter about 
every two or three days she said weve tried to spend as much 
time alone as we possibly could just talking and crying and 
talking about our three children we have back home

in a major step to reform colombias 
battered judicial system the government has created a special 
corps of invisible judges to hear drug and terrorismrelated 
cases 
up to 500 judges will try cases without having their identities 
revealed justice minister jaime giraldo told a news conference 
tuesday they will live in heavily protected fortresses in 
colombias four biggest cities 
the reform measures giraldo announced also provide anonymity for 
witnesses and have police rather than judges collect evidence in 
sensitive cases 
they are part of president cesar gavirias program to protect 
judges from intimidation by drug traffickers 
seventyseven judges have been murdered by the cocaine bosses in 
the past 12 years the magistrates often are given a choice between 
plata o plomo a bribe or a bullet 
so far the country has been unable to keep any major drug 
trafficker in jail most of the top traffickers brought to justice 
were first taken to the united states and tried and jailed there 
under a special extradition treaty 
but the extraditions have created political problems because 
many consider them insults to national pride gaviria has said that 
fortifying the judicial system will allow the government to 
prosecute drug criminals in colombia 
in the present system judges must act as investigators and 
prosecutors in addition to deciding guilt or innocence they visit 
crime sites and collect witness testimony thus becoming even 
bigger targets of the drug mafia 
under the new plan such evidence will be collected by police 
the medellin cocaine cartel has been blamed by authorities for 
killing 550 colombians since the government and the traffickers 
declared war on each other after a political assassination in 
august 1989 
among the dead were three presidential candidates 
most of the crimes have gone unpunished 
judicial reform will be among the topics discussed at an 
upcoming national assembly to reform colombias 104yearold 
constitution

reacting to a statewide vote against a 
holiday honoring the rev martin luther king jr one arizona 
county decided tuesday to give its workers a paid holiday 
commemorating the slain civil rights leader 
pima county employees will be given time off on either of two 
days but the countys offices will remain open on both days with 
at least skeleton crews the board of supervisors decided by a 
unanimous vote 
the county includes the city of tucson and its environs 
voters in the states general election on nov 6 rejected two 
propositions that would have created a paid holiday to honor king 
one proposition called for creating a king day while retaining 
columbus day and the other would have created a king day while 
eliminating columbus day 
the rejection led to a backlash of national criticism with many 
organizers of conventions and sporting events threatening to 
boycott the state 
a majority of the voters in pima county supported creating an 
11th state holiday in honor of king 
the board had been advised by its lawyer that it could not 
simply declare a holiday because the county must abide by state 
status on when offices must be open however the boards action 
changes the countys personnel policy and does not conflict with 
state law said supervisor raul grijalva 
the resolution the board passed calls for giving county 
employees eight hours paid administrative leave to be taken on 
either the third monday of january or on the friday preceding that 
monday grijalva said 
the national holiday honoring king falls on the third monday of 
january 
grijalva also said he will send the boards resolution to the 
maricopa county board of supervisors in phoenix in the hope that 
they will follow pima countys example 
i think that if the two largest counties in the state set the 
tone that will push the legislature to either do something 
themselves or put it back on the ballot for voters to decide he 
said

president bush counseled just be patient when 
pressed on why the soviet union hadnt joined his call for a 
resolution authorizing military force against kuwait but in the 
end bush may have been the impatient one 
by seeking support for a resolution dealing with war at a 
conference dedicated to peace bush may have given the impression 
of pushing too hard that threatened to alienate some of those who 
stood with the united states in earlier united nations actions 
against international outlaw iraq 
the presidents hand on the persian gulf also may have been 
weakened by the political defeat delivered to british prime 
minister margaret thatcher on tuesday by her own conservative 
party mrs thatcher who was forced into a second party leadership 
vote next week has been bushs staunchest ally in insisting that 
the military option be left open in the gulf 
bush was heading to the middle east where he will meet with 
saudi and exiled kuwaiti officials today us forces on 
thanksgiving and egyptian officials on friday without the 
consensus he had hoped to forge in paris 
but not for lack of trying 
like lobbyists on capitol hill in search of votes bush and 
secretary of state james a baker iii worked the halls and the 
elegant salons in which the 34nation conference on cooperation and 
security in europe had gathered to celebrate the end of eastwest 
hostilities 
but the us efforts failed to wring agreement from summit 
leaders on what to do next to dislodge iraqs saddam hussein from 
kuwait 
when the summit leaders went into a closeddoor session tuesday 
for concluding discussions the crisis in the persian gulf didnt 
even come up participants said 
after bushs private dinner with soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachev on monday night failed to produce a breakthrough baker 
continued to press the presidents case during two meetings tuesday 
with soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze 
speaking with reporters after the second meeting shevardnadze 
stressed past ussoviet cooperation on the gulf he noted it was 
remarkable considering the long history of rivalries 
that unity and high level of solidarity that has been 
accomplished in the course of preparation and adoption of past 
security council resolutions is something that we cherish very 
much he said 
so please dont make me get ahead of time he added 
the soviets did agree that the united nations should take 
another look at the effectiveness of the sanctions it imposed on 
iraq with an eye to new resolutions if necessary to enforce 
the old ones 
that narrowed the gap a little bit but administration officials 
said many differences remain 
one soviet official speaking on the condition of anonymity 
suggested that bush and baker did not come here with a need to 
decide anything urgently and might be getting a bum rap it 
seemed that they were interested in longerrange talks in taking 
the longer view the official said 
even so it was clear that administration officials had expected 
more to happen 
the two lecterns set up by the white house in the us 
ambassadors residence for a news conference that never happened 
one set high for the tall bush the other set lower for the more 
stocky gorbachev were graphic testimony to that 
did bush send out the wrong signals in trying to win support for 
a more militant stance toward iraq at a peace conference i can 
see the wisdom of that line of thought said white house 
spokesman marlin fitzwater 
but he suggested the need to build a consensus and having 
everybody on board was more important than a question of location 
and timing

summit delegates offered their concern but little 
concrete help to cope with the seething nationalism and economic 
troubles that threaten eastern europes young democracies and the 
crumbling soviet empire 
speaker after speaker mentioned the dangers to peace and 
democracy as the leaders of 34 nations met at the conference on 
security and cooperation in europe one year after eastern europes 
breathtaking revolutions 
a new welfare war may rise in place of the iron curtain 
warned hungarian prime minister joszef antall polands tadeusz 
mazowiecki raised the specter of an aclass europe and a bclass 
europe 
german chancellor helmut kohl who is preparing to ship food to 
help the soviet union through its harsh winter used his first 
summit speech as head of his reunified country to urge the wealthy 
west to bail out the poorer east 
discussion of one grave danger the migration of millions from 
the poor east to the rich west dominated a closeddoor session 
tuesday according to german spokesman hans klein 
up to 5 million soviet citizens are believed ready to emigrate 
once a new passport law is passed as many as 25 million people 
want to leave the former east bloc united nations officials 
estimate 
soviet neighbors czechoslovakia poland and hungary are 
particularly worried that the flood of migrants passing through 
would tax their already stretched economies beyond the breaking 
point thousands of talented young people already have fled the 
poor balkan nations of romania and bulgaria 
yet while everyone agrees the west must act to shore up 
democracy in eastern europe the most delegates accomplished on the 
migration question was to consider establishing a paneuropean 
group to monitor it 
european leaders floated various proposals to help eastern 
europe combat collapsing economies high oil prices and dwindling 
soviet supplies the threat of mass unemployment and the renewed 
vigor of populist nationalism 
the netherlands for instance seeks a european energy charter 
to help east europe deal with reduced supplies of oil coal used 
for heating and a major shortfall in electricity predicted by 2000 
norway pledged to establish a new fund to help reduce harmful 
emissions that cause global warming and delivered a reminder that 
capitalism cannot cure all the easts ills 
market forces alone cannot protect our health or achieve 
social justice said prime minister gro harlem brundtland 
economic growth cannot be bought at the expense of social 
justice 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev whose giant country is 
threatened with multiple ethnic and social conflicts delivered the 
strongest warning on nationalist tension warning of a 
destructive snowball effect if demands to revise borders and 
remake nations are elevated to state policy 
bulgarias zhelyu zhelev warning against the exaltation of 
national sentiment urged creation of a new section in the 
helsinki process now divided into security economic cooperation 
and human rights to deal with ethnic and minority issues 
some of these proposals would cost little others would cost 
billions but no one mentioned providing money 
this is at least partly because the easts needs arise as the 
west also is becoming strapped for cash the united states must 
bear the costs of involvement in the persian gulf escalating oil 
prices a coming economic recession and a vast stubborn budget 
deficit 
even wealthy germany the worlds largest exporter is expected 
to become a heavy net borrower on international markets to help the 
former east germany achieve something approaching western living 
standards 
when president bush visited prague last weekend all he could 
offer in new aid was a 60 million development fund he said he 
would request from congress one prague resident said that was less 
than the value of air force one 
but east european officials seemed appreciative that the 
regions plight is at least high on the wests agenda 
the problem is there for all to see said czechoslovak 
president vaclav havels spokesman michael zantovsky we feel 
supported by the speeches and we think that more concrete steps 
will follow

the value of us agricultural exports rose to 
a nineyear high in the fiscal year that ended sept 30 but 
agriculture department analysts say itll be tougher sledding in 
1991 
in fiscal 1990 the departments economic research service said 
tuesday export values rose to 402 billion from 397 billion in 
1989 that was the most since the record of 438 billion in 1981 
official forecasts of 1991 exports farm income and other 
indicators will be issued next week at the departments annual 
outlook conference 
but bumper crops in some other countries have already lowered 
prospects for us grain exports in the coming year the report 
said 
for example the export volume of corn in september the final 
month of the 1990 fiscal year plunged to 27 million metric tons 
the lowest monthly volume since february 1987 
although analysts were not specific on the effects of an export 
slowdown the report noted other factors that will have a bearing 
on farm income in 1991 and beyond 
the us economy continues to grow very slowly and the 
outlook is for more slow growth or even a brief contraction the 
report said given an orderly unwinding of current problems 
though growth should pick up in 1992 
over the longer haul it said forecasts suggest that inflation 
interest rates and the value of the dollar will drift down 
lower interest rates would put downward pressure on farmers 
production costs and a lower exchange rate would aid farm 
exports the report said 
but good crops in much of the world have lowered prospects for 
us exports of wheat coarse grains and rice it added 
global wheat output is expected to rise 11 percent in 199091 
setting a record the report said a smaller gain in coarse 
grain production is likely and world trade will slip a record 
world rice crop is expected and trade will increase only 
slightly 
the monthly report by the departments economic research service 
also said the net cash income of farmers this year is still 
expected to be at a record level probably in the range of 59 
billion to 63 billion 
that is unchanged from previous forecasts by the agency net 
cash income is the difference between gross cash income and cash 
expenses 
another report tuesday said the cereal grain needs for 55 
lowincome countries in 199091 are substantial despite the 
favorable outlook for supplies globally 
east africa and the relatively populous region of south asia 
will require the most assistance followed by latin america and 
southern africa the report said 
the analysis added that the situation reflects poor harvests 
in ethiopia and sudan good crops in most of asia and declining 
commercial cereal imports in most regions due to foreign exchange 
shortages 
 
washington ap agriculture secretary clayton yeutter has no 
plan to leave his job despite speculation that he would soon step 
down says his chief spokeswoman 
talk has circulated on capitol hill and elsewhere that yeutter 
was headed for greener pastures following completion of the 1990 
farm bill and the conclusion next month of international trade 
talks 
one of the latest to surface is that yeutter might be in line 
for an ambassadorship perhaps to germany if that should become 
available 
kelly shipp who has been yeutters press secretary since 1987 
when he was president reagans us trade representative said 
reports of his leaving the cabinet soon perhaps within 90 days 
are not true 
specifically shipp said tuesday it is not true absolutely 
patently false that yeutter is seeking or being touted for an 
ambassadors job 
yeutter just returned from a week of meetings in europe where 
the uruguay round of talks under the general agreement on tariffs 
and trade is struggling with agricultural strategy 
the us view advocated vigorously by yeutter for years is 
that tradedistorting policies including export subsidies and some 
internal price supports are bad for everybody 
some countries share the us position but others notably the 
european community are balking as a result there is a 
possibility the trade talks could wind up at an impasse on some of 
the major agricultural issues 
people have always speculated that the secretary was going to 
leave after the uruguay round shipp said but he never said 
that he doesnt feel that way he hasnt even focused on life 
after usda whenever thats going to be 
when presidentelect bush chose him as agriculture secretary in 
december 1988 it was reported that yeutter had really wanted to 
get back into the private sector after 3 years as trade 
representative 
there was also talk at the time that yeutter and bush had agreed 
the usda commitment would last only through the formulation of the 
1990 farm bill which is awaiting bushs signature and the 
conclusion of the gatt negotiations 
but shipp said yeutter made no such deal with bush he and the 
president never talked about his departure she said 
yeutter who will be 60 on dec 10 has an interest in a 
2500acre family farming operation in nebraska he holds 
doctorates in law and economics and has held many public and 
private posts including agriculture department service in the 
early 1970s and the presidency of the chicago mercantile exchange 
from 1978 to 1985

black workers at the treasury department 
agency that produces dollars stamps and government securities will 
be given more opportunity for advancement under a court settlement 
that also provides for 14 million in back pay 
the settlement was announced tuesday by lawyers who brought the 
action and was confirmed by the bureau of engraving and printing 
the bureau said it initiated the settlement and was pleased with 
its terms 
the agreement in us district court covers 248 present and 
former employees of the bureau it ends an 8yearold lawsuit in 
which black workers contended they were denied access to 
higherpaying craft jobs such as bookbinders printers or 
pressmen 
the bureau employs 750 craft workers and 1750 noncraft 
workers said bureau spokesman ira polikoff 
the lawsuit said the bureau perpetuated an oldboy network under 
which white workers were brought in from private industry by 
friends and relatives and were given preferential treatment for 
craft jobs 
whites held 85 percent of the craft jobs while blacks held 
nearly 100 percent of the noncraft jobs the plaintiffs argued 
blacks were held back by an apprenticeship system and written 
tests that had nothing to do with the skills required for the 
better jobs the plaintiffs claimed they added that blacks often 
had to train the whites on equipment that was unique to the bureau 
the settlement suspends the writtentest requirement for 
selecting apprentices to the craft jobs and shortens the 
apprenticeship period the agreement also sets aside 72 bookbinder 
and pressman apprenticeships to be filled from within the bureau 
top officials of the bureau of engraving and printing just 
didnt seem to care about the discrimination built into the 
hiring and apprenticeship system said attorney david p donovan 
joseph m sellers of the washington lawyers committee for civil 
rights under law called the situation at the bureau one of the 
most egregious examples of discrimination in the federal 
government 
polikoff said the bureau initiated the settlement which 
includes reforms suggested by peter daly after he took over as 
bureau director in 1988 
he saw that the system was outdated and that it needed to be 
modernized polikoff said he disagreed with sellers 
characterization of the degree of discrimination and said that in 
1983 the bookbinders apprentices consisted of 17 blacks and one 
woman 
the settlement also provides for wage increases for 39 employees 
costing 300000 in the first year of the settlement and pension 
increases for 44 retired employees at a cost of more than 170000 
a year according to a statement from the washington law firm of 
wilmer cutler amp pickering whose attorneys brought the lawsuit

through the eye of the hubble telescope 
scientists have recorded a gigantic storm blowing across saturn at 
more than 1000 mph sending ammonia clouds billowing 150 miles 
into space 
pictures taken by the telescopes planetary camera show that the 
storm which began in september as an earthsized white spot now 
girdles the planet in a band 6000 miles across 
it might just be the largest atmospheric structure right now 
in the solar system outside of the sun andrew ingersoll a 
planetary scientist from the california institute of technology 
said tuesday the last time saturn did anything of this magnitude 
was in 1933 
after amateur astronomers discovered the white spot in 
september the hubble was trained on saturn the second largest 
planet in the solar system the flaw in the telescopes mirrors 
does not detract from the instruments ability to see such 
relatively close objects 
by nov 9 and 11 when the first pictures were taken the storm 
clouds ringed the planet with clearly visible swirls and loops the 
hubble photographed saturn again last weekend bringing the number 
of pictures to 400 
they will be made into a film said charles pellerin director 
of astrophysics at nasa headquarters and pretty soon well be 
able to watch what some people have called the storm of the century 
evolve in great detail 
astronomers dont know what is causing the great white belt of 
clouds and whether it is diffusing as it spreads or whether 
material from the planet is feeding it 
these planets like jupiter and saturn are fluid objects all 
the way to the center said ingersoll there are no volcanoes 
erupting because there are no volcanoes there is no solid crust 
these planets are sort of bubbling cauldrons of liquid and gas 
the atmosphere of saturn is composed of hydrogen and helium and 
the clouds contain ammonia ice crystals and possibly a mixture of 
sulfur and carbon compounds 
ingersoll discounted the possibility that a comet or other 
celestial object hit saturn or that the disturbance was formed by 
smaller storms joining 
it has to be some sort of internal intermittent thing on 
saturn like saturn burped ingersoll said why it should wait 
so long to burp i dont know 
saturn the second largest planet after jupiter is the windiest 
place in the solar system with the storm being whipped by a west 
wind of 1000 mph 
ingersoll said heat is coming out of the deep interior of saturn 
and presumably pressures can build up the planets weather is not 
driven just by sunlight as it is on earth 
i dont really understand it he said in some mysterious 
way which i dont have a clue about saturn burps in the 
summertime this changing season could be part of it

the decade of the 90s could confront america 
with a water shortage as serious as the current oilprice 
inflation a top government water expert warns 
as we move toward the 21st century short supplies of clean 
water could rival expensive oil as one of the nations most serious 
concerns unless we start now to implement strategies to better 
manage our water supplies dr michael d hudlow said tuesday 
i believe were headed into a water management crisis in the 
1990s said hudlow director of the national oceanic and 
atmospheric administrations office of hydrology 
the severe drought that struck much of the nation in 1988 was 
just the first round in what could become a continuing problem he 
explained california already faces a serious water shortage 
were going to have real extreme drought conditions going into 
next spring unless mother nature cooperates and gives us a 
bumper crop of snowfall in the mountains of the west hudlow 
said 
in general the water outlook in much of the west is precarious 
depending heavily on the winter snows he said at a news conference 
called to discuss water conditions and resources 
extreme drought still grips much of the west from california 
to montana and in parts of the southeast in midoctober drought 
conditions in much of georgia and the carolinas ended with a 
significant flooding episode hudlow reported 
water shortages are developing as part of the normal variability 
of climate he said with the relatively wet years of the 1970s and 
early 1980s giving way to a drier period 
and that does not include the threat of the socalled greenhouse 
effect which some scientists say could raise temperatures 
worldwide and change rainfall patterns if that does happen it 
could just make things worse said hudlow 
while forecasting floods and drought now depends on climate 
records and shortterm weather forecasts hudlow said a new water 
supply forecasting system is being developed by his agency 
termed warfs for water resources forecasting service the 
system is being tested at the colorado river basin forecast office 
in salt lake city 
using longrange climate and weather models the system can 
study the conditions in a local river basin and calculate 
probabilities of floods drought or a return to normal conditions 
seasonally and farther into the future 
if the testing goes well the system could be put into national 
service by 1992 assuming money is available hudlow said 
the new system could provide local water managers and civil 
defense officials the probabilities of danger or drought on which 
they could make decisions he explained 
for example reservoir managers might be reluctant to reduce 
water levels out of concern that they would later have too little 
water for generating power irrigating crops and other uses but if 
they had a reliable forecast that there was a good chance of severe 
flooding a decision could be made to lower reservoir levels so 
flood water could be trapped and damage prevented 
we didnt do it right in 88 weve got to get in a position 
to do it right now hudlow said referring to the lack of 
accurate forecasts of water conditions in that drought year

former president ford resigned as honorary 
chairman of a republican political action committee a week after 
democrats complained to him about a controversial word list the 
group developed for gop campaigning 
but penny circle a spokeswoman for the former president said 
tuesday that his oct 8 resignation as honorary chairman of gopac 
was not related to the complaint he received oct 1 from rep beryl 
anthony dark chairman of the democratic congressional campaign 
committee 
it was just coincidental she said 
anthonys complaint was based on a 131word list drafted by 
gopac that urged republican candidates to use words such as 
greed sick permissive and liberal when describing 
democratic opponents and words such as children common 
sense reform and family when referring to themselves 
the list also suggested that democrats should be described as 
traitors but gopac later removed that word from the training 
brochure it mailed to some 6000 republican candidates and 
officeholders nationwide 
anthony wrote ford in september asking him to demonstrate your 
support for decency in our nations political life by repudiating 
gopac whose general chairman is house republcan whip newt 
gingrich of georgia 
ford replied in a letter anthony released tuesday that he had 
resigned the post because of a desire to reduce significantly my 
political activity 
he did not mention the gopac word list but said he had delayed 
his response because he did not want it to become an issue in the 
1990 elections 
in view of this decision i do not feel i should comment 
further the former president wrote 
in his complaint to ford anthony characterized the list as 
demagoguery without limits without content and without 
honesty 
as an individual who has devoted his life to public service i 
am sure you will find these activities as disgusting as i do 
anthony wrote he sent ford a copy of the list in the event that 
you have not seen it 
howard bo callaway a former georgia congressman who is 
chairman of gopac said ford 77 stopped signing letters for the 
group about two years ago when he began cutting back his political 
activities 
hes clearly from everything i understand just getting out of 
all political things callaway said he has never expressed any 
dissatisfaction of any kind to me and i think were close enough he 
would have

milk producers and the food and drug 
administration say the nations milk supply is safe despite a 
congressional report that contends federal testing methods are 
inadequate 
milk is one of the most tested food americans consume said 
jim barr chief executive officer of the national milk producers 
federation the industry is constantly working with farmers milk 
processors and state and federal governments to refine the testing 
procedures that guarantee the purity of the milk supply from cow to 
consumer 
his comments came tuesday after rep ted weiss dny released 
a report from the general accounting office that criticized the fda 
for not being able to detect certain animal drug residues in milk 
gao found that we cannot rely on fdas assurances of safety 
because fda has absolutely no idea of the incidence of harmful drug 
residues in milk said weiss 
dr gerald guest director of the fdas center for veterinary 
medicine said the reports recommendations are things we will 
work on and need to work on 
he said the fda began improving its milktesting methods after 
weiss government operations subcommittee held hearings on the 
subject last february 
the milk is safe but there are areas we should work to make 
it safer said guest 
the gao the investigative arm of congress said its findings 
suggest a need for more thorough examination by fda to identify 
the types and amounts of animal drug residues that may be 
contaminating milk 
even if the fda had conducted a more thorough survey the 
results would still be of limited value because fda lacks test 
methods to detect and confirm most of the drugs believed to be used 
in dairy cows and some of fdas test methods cannot detect drug 
residues at the concern level set for human consumption the 
report said 
the gao recommended that the fda 
ask the states and the dairy industry to routinely provide them 
with the results of screening tests for drug residues and 
information about their testing methods 
help states evaluate commercially available screening tests and 
encourage that those found effective for sulfa tetracycline and 
other drugs be included in the surveys now primarily used just for 
penicillins 
speed up efforts to develop new testing methods 
work closely with the states to confirm on a random basis the 
types and amounts of drug residues found in state screening 
samples 
if widespread misuse of drugs is found the fda should reassess 
its policies on drugs it allows for dairy cows and take appropriate 
regulatory action

the daily news took a new tack in the nearly 
monthlong strike against the tabloid by suing 11 people for 
allegedly burning a delivery truck stealing bundled papers or 
attacking replacement drivers 
evidence in two of the three lawsuits filed in state court 
tuesday includes videotapes made by management newspaper spokesman 
john t sloan said 
each lawuit seeks 100000 in punitive damages and unspecified 
compensatory damages they claim defendants hurt the papers 
ability to do business 
one lawsuit claims that a member of the drivers union set fire 
to a truck outside the papers brooklyn printing plant on oct 25 
the night the strike began 
another claims two wall street journal drivers stole bundles of 
the news that had been left off at a dropoff point by nonunion 
drivers on oct 30 
the third lawsuit accuses eight people of attacking nonunion 
drivers and independent distributors on oct 31 at a paper dropoff 
point 
nine unions representing more than 2000 employees at the 
nations thirdlargest newspaper went on strike over what they said 
were unfair labor practices the walkout followed month of 
unsuccessful contract talks 
in a separate court action strikers won a victory when us 
district court judge jack b weinstein issued a temporary 
restraining order tuesday night permitting striking pressmen to 
expand pickets outside the brooklyn plant 
the pressmen complained management and police infringed on their 
rights by confining pickets to side streets on either end of the

general motors corp is the last of the big 
three us automakers to establish a program for helping workers 
ward off potentially crippling repetitive motion injuries 
one hundred thirtyeight plants and an estimated 302000 workers 
will take part in an effort similar to those being undertaken by 
chrysler corp and ford motor co last year and earlier this year 
labor secretary elizabeth dole said tuesday 
the gm pact is part of a settlement of government charges that 
the nations largest automaker violated safety and health rules at 
plants in trenton nj and oklahoma city okla gm will pay 
360000 in fines for the alleged violations 
the transformation of the workplace required by this agreement 
wont be possible overnight said stephen p yokich a uaw vice 
president but if we are to make progress there must be an 
immediate recognition by the management at each individual plant of 
the full extent of the problem 
a spokeswoman said gm would have no immediate comment 
repetitive motion traumas also referred to as cumulative trauma 
disorders are disorders of the musculoskeletal and nervous systems 
caused by repetitive motions or exertion over extended periods 
painful and sometimes crippling they range from back injuries 
to a nerve disorder of the hand and wrist to various tendon 
ailments they comprise about 48 percent of the workplace injuries 
for which the departments occupational safety and health 
administration keeps records 
preventive measures include redesigning work stations t better 
accommodate the body by for example adjusting workbench heights 
also devices can be used to prevent excessive lifting or similar 
exertions tools and training can be redesigned

a new aids vaccine candidate that has been 
shown to work in one chimpanzee has won approval for early human 
clinical tests 
the candidate vaccine approved for further testing by the food 
and drug administration was developed through the cooperation of 
the national institute for allergy and infectious diseases the 
national cancer institute and immunous inc a rochester mich 
branch of an austrian company 
at a news conference tuesday company officials said the 
clinical trials will test the safety of the vaccine and determine 
whether the 60 test subjects develop antibodies against human 
immunodeficiency virus hiv the virus that causes aids this 
first step of human testing called phase i trials will not use 
aids patients 
if the vaccine proves to be safe and shows promise then phase 
ii trials will more thoroughly test for protection against aids a 
final phase of testing would be required before the fda releases 
the vaccine for general use 
the candidate vaccine is a geneticallyengineered synthetic 
glycoprotein that was derived from the envelope or skin of the 
hiv1 virus this part of the virus envelope is called gp160 the 
theory is that the bodys immune system will react to gp160 and 
develop antibodies these antibodies then would trigger an immune 
response in the body should there be contact with the hiv virus 
dr martha eibl director of aids vaccine research at immuno ag 
the parent company of immunous said that two forms of the 
vaccine were tested on four chimpanzees 
the chimps were injected with the candidate vaccine and then 
injected with the aids virus using a dose that is 100 times the 
amount needed to cause an infection in the laboratory 
all four of the chimps developed some immune response and one 
of the animals remained free of aids 
it has protected a chimp from productive infection for nearly 
three years eibl said of the candidate vaccine that is the 
longest protection up to now

atlantis ended its secret mission 
where it began making the first shuttle landing in florida since 
1985 many nasa workers who launch the spaceships got their first 
chance to see one come back 
raindampened desert runways and high wind kept atlantis from 
landing in the california desert as planned nasa opted for clear 
skies calm winds and the concrete runway at kennedy space center 
for touchdown tuesday afternoon 
we didnt expect to be here when we left mission commander 
richard covey an air force colonel said after the spacecraft 
touched down 
during their secret pentagon mission atlantis five astronauts 
put in orbit a satellite to spy on iraq 
atlantis astronauts had planned to return on monday but high 
winds at edwards force base calif forced them to stay in space 
another day rain at the mojave desert base monday night left the 
natural surface runways too wet on tuesday and the wind was too 
high for a landing on edwards concrete runway 
so nasa decided to use kennedy where atlantis touched down on 
the 28mile paved runway its arrival heralded by its signature 
twin sonic booms 
kennedy workers given just a few hours notice scrambled to 
prepare for the landing about 250 people cheered the nearperfect 
touchdown they included two busloads of launch control center 
workers who had counted down to atlantis fiery liftoff in an 
unusual nighttime launch five days earlier 
you have to remember that half the workforce at kennedy has 
never seen a shuttle landing said launch director bob sieck 
its a real treat for them and of course were thankful for it 
it was the sixth shuttle landing at kennedy the last was in 
1985 when discovery blew a tire and sustained brake damage on 
touchdown 
atlantis appeared to be in good shape with only a few dings in 
the heatresistant tiles said william lenoir head of nasas 
spaceflight program 
the shuttle had enough supplies to stay in orbit until thursday 
if necessary 
the mission delayed since july by hydrogen leaks was the 
seventh and last secret shuttle flight for the pentagon which 
still plans to fly unclassified cargoes on two more shuttles but 
will use unmanned rockets for secret payloads 
the pentagon ordered a news blackout on the mission but sources 
said the crew deployed a satellite that will conduct photo surveys 
or eavesdrop on communications in the persian gulf 
one of these days well be able to tell you about dick and 
frank and carl and bob and sams excellent adventure covey told 
a crowd of about 150 people on the crews return to houston hours 
after the landing for now itll have to remain under ropes and 
under tight cover 
the other crew members were pilot frank culbertson jr a navy 
commander and army maj charles sam gemar air force lt col 
carl meade and marine col robert springer all mission 
specialists 
among those greeting the astronauts in houston were their wives 
who had been at edwards for landing 
nasa plans to use kennedy for more landings but prefers edwards 
because it has a variety of lakebed runways and a concrete strip to 
choose from weather more stable than floridas and wideopen 
spaces with more room for error 
the space agency saved 1 million and about a weeks time by 
using kennedy since atlantis doesnt have to be taken back to 
florida atop a jetliner 
columbia also grounded this summer by hydrogen leaks is 
scheduled to fly next in early december on an astronomy mission

a group of harvard law school students 
turned their legal training into a weapon against their own school 
with a lawsuit aimed at getting more minorities hired as 
professors 
today we use the only instrument of power harvard law school 
seems to understand said secondyear student john bonifaz 
today we take harvard to court 
the lawsuit filed tuesday and signed by 11 students accused the 
ivy league school of failing to hire any minority women american 
indians asianamericans disabled people openly homosexual men 
and women or hispanics to the permanent faculty 
it also claims harvard discriminates against white women and 
blacks in its faculty hiring 
the complaint does not have merit and in due course we will 
submit a formal response to the superior court law dean robert 
c clark said in a statement 
the student group that sued the harvard law coalition for civil 
rights said five of 66 tenured and tenuretrack faculty members at 
the law school are women or 758 percent nationwide at law 
schools approved by the american bar association 237 percent of 
faculty members are women 
of the schools four tenuretrack faculty members two are 
black the lawsuit said three of 62 tenured positions or 484 
percent are held by blacks 
clark did not challenge the students figures but countered that 
about onethird of the schools parttime lecturers are women or 
minorities 
the lawsuit seeks to force harvard to give weight to diversity 
in its hiring and establish an affirmative action plan and other 
corrective measures 
in 1971 derrick bell became the first black appointed to a 
fulltime faculty position at the law school founded in 1817 bell 
in april took an unpaid leave of absence to protest harvards 
hiring policies 
he joined the students at a sidewalk news conference after the 
lawsuit was filed

prime minister chandra shekhar today 
presented a 32member cabinet dominated by loyalists who helped 
propel him into office after political and religious turmoil sank 
the previous government 
the ministers who took their oaths of office include just two 
with a long history in the top ranks of national government 
seven others served as junior ministers during prime minister 
vp singhs government which lasted just 11 months but sided 
with chandra shekhar when he split singhs janata dal party two 
weeks ago 
singh lost a vote of confidence on nov 6 and chandra shekhar 
replaced him four days later 
no portfolios were announced during the swearingin ceremony 
but press trust of india said chandra shekhar retained the top 
ministerial posts in defense home affairs and information and 
broadcasting for himself 
press trust and another news agency united news of india later 
reported a breakdown for the other ministries 
deputy prime minister devi lal was given agriculture and 
tourism devi lal was minister of agriculture under the previous 
government until being forced out in a power struggle with singh 
vidyacharan shukla who held a halfdozen cabinet posts between 
1966 and 1980 is the new foreign minister 
the swearingin ceremony at the presidential palace was marred 
when police beat journalists snatched cameras and kicked them out 
of the palace 
police prevented about 100 journalists from entering the 
ceremonial hall claiming they had arrived too late at least two 
reporters arms were cut by glass when the window in a door was 
smashed 
police grabbed at least two cameras from photographers and beat 
several journalists with bamboo staves 
this is a brutal act by the police subodh kant sahay 
minister of state for home affairs in the new government said 
later sahay held the same post in the previous government 
sahay will also be minister of state for information and 
broadcasting minister of state is a junior rank below minister 
the indian press association issued a statement condemning the 
attack 
chandra shekhar whose splinter group the janata dal 
socialist party commands barely 10 percent of the seats in 
parliament became prime minister with the support of the 
opposition leader former prime minister rajiv gandhi 
gandhis congress party holds 195 seats in the 522member lower 
house of parliament giving him the power to bring down the new 
government at any time 
the singh government collapsed when a rightwing hindu party 
withdrew its support a month ago following the arrest of its 
leader lal krishnan advani head of the bharatiya janata party 
was detained while leading a crosscountry caravan to rally support 
for a campaign to build a hindu temple on a site already occupied 
by a moslem mosque

dozens of times he has broken a rib worn out equipment and coped 
with foul weather

starting out on springer mountain all alone in the middle of the 
worst flood in the history of georgia not even knowing how i 
was going to get down the trail 
though he couldnt see the magnificent vistas or trailside 
sunsets during his trek irwin said he found solace in the silence 
of the woods and beauty in the odors and other sensations of 
nature

margaret thatcher may lose her job 
next week but britains iron lady kept a stiff upper lip at a 
glittering feast for summit leaders 
the british prime minister chatted politely with her belgian 
counterpart wilfried martens just two hours after being pushed 
into a secondround vote for the leadership of her conservative 
party 
if she loses next week mrs thatcher will be out of a 15year 
job as party leader and will step down as prime minister 
but mrs thatcher put on a brave face and a blackandred 
brocade gown after hearing the news and attended a ballet and 
fivecourse dinner at versailles palace 
seated at a dinner table as long as a fashion runway in the 
shimmering hall of mirrors mrs thatcher smiled for photographers 
but refused to comment on her future 
seated directly across the table ironically was french premier 
michel rocard who survived a narrow noconfidence vote monday in 
the national assembly 
what was mrs thatchers mood she wasnt letting on a british 
diplomat who was asked the question simply threw back his head and 
roared in laughter 
 
ever the polite host french president francois mitterrand held 
up the ballet performance by star dancers of the paris opera while 
mrs thatcher made her entrance 25 minutes late 
the troupe performed a medley of pieces by tchaikovsky auguste 
de bournonville and marius pepita 
later between bites of a dinner roll president bush offered 
the simple critique that ballet was good 
 
mitterrand beamed from his seat at the center of the table next 
to first lady barbara bush few leaders can throw a party in a 
place like versailles 
built by king louis xiv during the 17th century the chateau and 
its manicured gardens and fountains define grandeur gallic style 
dining in the hall of mirrors aglow with chandeliers requires a 
menu equal to the venue 
the army of chefs feeding 120 heads of state or government and 
their spouses and ministers settled on the following 
shellfish soup lobster from brittany capon dressed with foie 
gras cheese and iced nougat sprinkled with grand marnier liqueur 
they washed it down with two vintage wines a 1978 chateaumargaux 
and 1985 pulignymontrachet 
coffee was in high demand among the summit leaders who heard 21 
speeches during daylong conferences tuesday 
 
marie antoinette supposedly mocked starving peasants with the 
line let them eat cake she lost her head todays french 
leaders have learned their lesson in a land where the stomach is 
the real king 
the thousands of police officers journalists paramedics and 
ordinary palace workers dined on bouillabaisse creamy veal stew 
and rich chocolate mousse in a palace wing converted into a 
100table dining room

exposed as lipsyncing frauds the milli 
vanilli duo say that rather than come clean about the sham they 
once took a dialect coach on tour with them to help them shed their 
foreign accents 
every time we gave an interview the reporters would hear my 
french accent or robs german accent and theyd say no way how 
could these guys have sung the songs fabrice morvan said in 
todays los angeles times 
we didnt want to do any more interviews said his partner 
rob pilatus the more we talked the worse things got 
dialect accent specialists in los angeles was hired in august 
1989 and paid by arista records to accompany pilatus and morvan and 
help them sound more like the singing voices they mouthed on their 
hotselling album they told the times 
on monday the national academy of recording arts amp sciences 
stripped milli vanilli of its grammy after its producer confirmed 
rumors that pilatus and morvan were just front men on the album 
that won them best new artist honors in february 
the pair met reporters tuesday and heaped blame on their german 
producer frank farian they claimed he took advantage of them when 
they were down and out in munich 
we were seduced we were abused and we felt very guilty 
pilatus said 
the deception began to unravel at a 1989 concert when their 
audio system playing the album girl you know its true started 
to skip like a broken record the times reported today the 
recording at the bristol conn show kept rerunning the lyrics 
girl you know its girl you know its 
i knew right then and there it was the beginning of the end 
for milli vanilli pilatus told the newspaper when my voice 
got stuck in the computer and it just kept repeating and repeating 
i panicked i just ran off the stage 
pilatus and morvan both 25 said at tuesdays news conference 
that they had been pressing farian to let them sing on the next 
album 
we said to frank farian you dont let us sing on the album 
dont do this anymore pilatus said we dont want to live like 
this 
we dont want to be embarrassed every night by arsenio hall 
we didnt want to go to clubs and have every girl say hey you 
dont sing on the records we wanted to stop 
their album sold 7 million copies and made the two unknowns 
international stars pilatus said it actually featured vocalists 
johnny davis brad howell and charles shaw 
pilatus said he and morvan were offered 4000 each to become 
milli vanilli when they were living in a munich housing project and 
were so poor they had to steal food 
you get something but for that you make a pact with the 
devil pilatus said 
we really love our fans we just hope that they understand 
that we were young that we just wanted to live the life the 
american way 
clive davis president of arista records knew they were faking 
the pair and manager carsten heyn claimed despite repeated arista 
denials 
pilatus born in new york and raised in germany and morvan a 
native of guadaloupe in the french west indies intend continue to 
their musical career minus the milli vanilli name 
the new monicker

president bush counseled just be patient when 
pressed on why the soviet union hadnt joined his call for a 
resolution authorizing military force against kuwait but in the 
end bush seemed to be the impatient one 
by seeking support for a resolution dealing with war at a 
conference dedicated to peace bush may have given the impression 
of pushing too hard that threatened to alienate some of those who 
stood with the united states in earlier united nations actions 
against international outlaw iraq 
even so the president declared today that were on the same 
wavelength as the soviet union on persian gulf policy despite 
departing paris without a new un resolution backed by the soviets 
in his pocket 
bush was heading to the middle east where he will meet with 
saudi and exiled kuwaiti officials today us forces on 
thanksgiving and egyptian officials on friday without the the 
clear consensus he had hoped to forge while here at a 34nation 
european summit 
the presidents hand on the persian gulf also may have been 
weakened by the political defeat delivered to british prime 
minister margaret thatcher on tuesday by her own conservative 
party mrs thatcher who was forced into a second party leadership 
vote next week has been bushs staunchest ally in insisting that 
the military option be left open in the gulf 
at a news conference today before leaving paris bush hinted 
that he and gorbachev had reached understandings on how to proceed 
against saddam hussein that he could not publicly divulge 
he suggested this unity also may have been obscured by the 
technicalities of diplomacy and that the coalition in the sands 
and on the seas of the gulf was holding together 
like lobbyists on capitol hill in search of votes bush and 
secretary of state james a baker iii worked the halls and the 
elegant salons in which the 34nation conference on cooperation and 
security in europe had gathered to celebrate the end of eastwest 
hostilities 
but the us efforts failed to wring clearcut agreement from 
summit leaders on what to do next to dislodge iraqs saddam hussein 
from kuwait 
when the summit leaders went into a closeddoor session tuesday 
for concluding discusions the crisis in the persian gulf didnt 
even come up participants said 
after bushs private dinner with soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachev on monday night failed to produce a breakthrough baker 
continued to press the presidents case during two meetings tuesday 
with soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze 
speaking with reporters after the second meeting shevardnadze 
stressed past ussoviet cooperation on the gulf he noted it was 
remarkable considering the long history of rivalries 
that unity and high level of solidarity that has been 
accomplished in the course of preparation and adoption of past 
security council resolutions is something that we cherish very 
much he said 
so please dont make me get ahead of time he added 
the soviets did agree that the united nations should take 
another look at the effectiveness of the sanctions it imposed on 
iraq with an eye to new resolutions if necessary to enforce 
the old ones 
that narrowed the gap a little bit but administration officials 
said many differences remain 
one soviet official speaking on the condition of anonymity 
suggested that bush and baker did not come here with a need to 
decide anything urgently and might be getting a bum rap it 
seemed that they were interested in longerrange talks in taking 
the longer view the official said 
even so it was clear that administration officials had expected 
more to happen 
the two lecterns set up by the white house in the us 
ambassadors residence for a news conference that never happened 
one set high for the tall bush the other set lower for the more 
stocky gorbachev were graphic testimony to that 
did bush send out the wrong signals in trying to win support for 
a more militant stance toward iraq at a peace conference i can 
see the wisdom of that line of thought said white house 
spokesman marlin fitzwater 
but he suggested the need to build a consensus and having 
everybody on board was more important than a question of location 
and timing

charles hazley and robert hernandez who would be barred from 
reelection under the new law claimed in the lawsuit tuesday that 
the limit violates the voting rights act of 1973 by restricting 
minorities choice of candidates 
term limits are fast becoming a trend among voters fed up with 
incumbents california colorado and oklahoma in recent months 
passed limits on how long politicians may serve and similar 
measures are being considered elsewhere 
hazley and hernandez argued that city voters the majority of 
whom are white restricted the choices of voters in predominantly 
minority districts when they passed the termlimit measure 
the measure would prevent nine of the 13 council members from 
seeking reelection all five minorities on the council are 
affected as are four whites the four other council members are 
white 
henry e lyons chairman of the committee to limit terms said 
minorities are not deprived of their voting rights under the term 
limit any more than whites 
the lawsuit seeks a court order allowing the councilmen to file 
for reelection the filing period opens tuesday for the 1991 
elections

the mysterious polish emigre who exploded out of 
nowhere to challenge for the presidency of his native land is 
described by a close associate as a leader a charmer and a 
modernday indiana jones 
stanislaw tyminski 42 has moved ahead of prime minister 
tadeusz mazowiecki in the most recent public opinion polls 
supported by 20 percent of respondents against 17 percent for 
mazowiecki as sundays election nears 
solidarity leader lech walesa leads with 27 percent in the 
survey conducted by polands government polling service over the 
weekend 
canadian colleagues of tyminski say it all began as something of 
a lark 
tyminski head of several companies in north and south america 
turned a routine business trip to warsaw in september into a run 
for the presidency according to business partner frank ollie 
look he is a very mysterious guy ollie said describing 
tyminskis route from poland to sweden to canada to peru to 
selfmade millionaire in the west to darkhorse candidate for the 
top job in warsaw 
tyminski traveled to poland in september to attend to the 
business of transtek a company he set up in his sisters name and 
to promote a book on his political and economic ideas written last 
summer entitled sacred dogs 
it was all fun in those days ollie said of tyminskis early 
presidential aspirations 
its not entirely fun now tyminski is being investigated for 
slander for some of his comments polish newspapers are attacking 
him and questions abound about the man who came home to run for 
president after making his fortune 
a liar or a fool the promazowiecki gazeta wyborcza 
newspaper said in a headline tuesday a week before the 
elections we know as much about tyminski as he has told about 
himself and from what he says and how he says it an image of an 
unbalanced individual emerges 
his colleagues across the atlantic paint a much different 
picture of the man who estimates his worth at 5 million 
he is very charismatic said ollie general manager of 
tyminskis canadianbased computer company transduction he 
loves to talk his stories are amazing he would be a great dinner 
guest he is an excellent leader obviously he has a way about 
him 
an adventurer 
he is i dont think there is any doubt about it hes a bit 
like a modern indiana jones he just does crazy things ollie 
said referring to the rugged charcter in the adventure movies 
according to bob spanski tyminskis north american campaign 
manager the candidate was born in a warsaw suburb in january 
1948 he left poland at the age of 21 first going to sweden then 
arriving pretty much penniless in canada in 1970 he became a 
canadian citizen in 1975 
tyminski who owns a 40acre strawberry farm outside toronto 
founded transduction in the nearby suburb of mississauga 15 years 
ago the private company produces industrial computers spanski 
says its annual sales exceed 10 million tyminski also heads or is 
associated with several other computerrelated companies 
he was in the right place at the right time but he also took 
some bold steps on the right products and made a lot of money out 
of it ollie said 
in the early 1980s tyminski went to peru ending up in iquitos 
on the upper amazon 
according to ollie tyminski first built a barge to distribute 
gasoline up and down the amazon but the army took a liking to it 
and grabbed it rumor has it he lost 800000 on it 
then tyminski decided the people of iquitos needed cable 
television 
now his main peruvian interests include tvs iquitos a 
radiotelephone business and a restaurant 
basically the effect he had there was probably the exact 
effect he had in poland ollie said he came in as a wealthy 
gringo he wanted to help the people 
he also married one tyminski and his peruvian wife grace have 
three children he also has a son by an earlier marriage

black leaders accused police of a racist double 
standard for their lowkey investigation of the gangrape and 
murder of a young black woman 
eight teenagers were arrested monday in the slaying of kimberly 
rae harbour 26 nearly three weeks after her mutilated body was 
found on a playing field near the housing project where she lived 
with her 7yearold daughter 
investigators said the woman was repeatedly raped beaten with a 
bottle and a tree limb and stabbed more than 100 times on oct 31 
the people of our community particularly the women were put 
at risk by the police when they failed to inform the community 
said louis elisa president of the boston chapter of the national 
association for the advancement of colored people 
police commissioner francis m roache said officers withheld 
details of the grisly slaying to avoid jeopardizing the 
investigation but comparisons were immediately drawn to the 
charles stuart case 
stuart a white man told police a black man had shot to death 
his pregnant wife police questioned blacksuntil evidence began to 
point to stuart who apparently jumped to his death in january when 
he learned he was a suspect 
in the stuart case mayor raymond flynn was at the hospital 
immediately making statements to the press and calling out every 
available detective because there was some great threat to public 
safety ellishagler said 
on this one we dont hear a whimper until weeks afterward 
he said 
no one saw harbours killing as any great threat to public 
safety said the rev graylan ellishagler pastor of the church 
of the united community i cant help but think the difference is 
that stuart was white and this victim was black 
david rodman spokesman for the district attorneys office said 
authorities were being placed in a nowin situation 
in the stuart case the community was upset with the police 
and the prosecution for publicizing the case rodman said now 
they are criticizing us youre really damned if you do and damned 
if you dont

cnns tapes of manuel noriegas jailhouse phone 
calls to his legal team are in the hands of a federal magistrate 
who will help determine whether the former dictators right to a 
fair trial has been jeopardized 
the network handed over a briefcase full of tapes on tuesday 
after the us supreme court refused over the weekend to lift us 
district judge william hoevelers temporary order barring cnn from 
airing the recordings 
us magistrate william turnoff will make and study transcripts 
and report to hoeveler who as the judge who will preside over 
noriegas trial on drug trafficking charges will weigh a defense 
request to dismiss the case 
hoeveler assigned turnoff to listen to the tapes to avoid being 
tainted by having learned details of noriegas defense 
strategy 
no time limit for reviewing the tapes was set but noriegas 
lead attorney frank rubino said the judge guaranteed it would 
done with dispatch 
rubino also asked hoeveler to set a contempt hearing against cnn 
for airing a conversation in alleged violation of the judges 
order the judge did not immediately set a hearing saying he must 
await a decision by the chief judge of his judicial district on a 
cnn request to remove him from the tapes case 
cnn attorney steven korn wouldnt say how many tapes were turned 
over he would not discuss their contents or origins but said he 
was confident that the judge will rescind his socalled prior 
restraint on broadcast of the tapes 
he said cnn believes it never violated the judges order because 
the telecast conversations did not deal with matters protected by 
attorneyclient confidentiality in part because rubino tacitly 
agreed to broadcasting them when he identified them on the air 
noriega has asked that the case against him be dismissed because 
of the taping the freezing of his assets and other alleged 
government misconduct 
the fallen dictator is jailed outside of miami on charges of 
taking bribes to protect the cocaine trade his trial isnt 
expected to begin before the spring

tubby kids stand a better chance of slimming down 
and keeping the weight off if their overweight parents try to 
reduce too stay away from junk food and praise the children along 
the way researchers said today 
if you have children who you dont want to eat potato chips 
you cant sit in front of them eating hohos said psychologist 
leonard h epstein head of the university of pittsburghs 
childhood obesity clinic and leader of the research team 
findings published in todays journal of the american medical 
association suggest child obesity need not persist into adulthood 
previous research concluded that fat children will become fat 
adults and that weight lost in dieting programs is typically 
regained quickly 
in the study children who participated in a weightloss program 
as 6 to 12yearolds and whose parents took part in similar 
programs were significantly less obese 10 years later than those 
whose parents received less training 
parental support conveyed through praise and by maintaining 
proper eating and exercise habits made the difference epstein 
said 
if you have a family where both parent and child share the 
problem you have to include both in the treatment in order to 
foster the best change in the children he said 
despite the childrens improvement all parents in the study 
were more obese after 10 years 
in the project 75 obese children and their parents were 
randomly assigned to three groups they were instructed to limit 
consumption to no more than 1500 calories a day and follow an 
aerobic exercise program 
all were asked to attend eight weekly treatment meetings 
followed by six monthly meetings then meetings at the 21month 
fiveyear and 10year marks 
in one group both parents and children received praise for 
losing weight and were trained to praise other family members for 
changing eating and exercise habits 
in the second group only the children received praise and were 
trained to praise family members for weightcontrol behavior 
parents and children in the third group received praise only for 
attending the meetings they received information about social 
reinforcement without specific training in how to use the method 
all subjects lost weight initially at the 10year mark the 
children in the first group were on average 75 percent less 
overweight than at the beginning of the study those in the second 
and third groups were 45 percent and 143 percent fatter 
respectively 
although encouraging the study needs to be repeated to confirm 
its findings drs albert j stunkard of the university of 
pennsylvania medical school and robert i berkowitz of the 
philadelphia child guidance clinic wrote in a journal editorial 
nevertheless they said the findings are the first evidence 
that treatment of obesity in childhood can produce effects that 
persist into young adulthood

president bush and soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachev led world leaders today in final rites for the cold war 
as a 34nation summit ended with a triumphant declaration that the 
era of confrontation and division in europe is over 
the celebration was tempered by concern over the persian gulf 
and the leaders departed paris still apparently groping for 
consensus on how to force iraqs withdrawal from kuwait 
the final act of the first postcold war european summit was 
marked by the signing of the charter of paris a written commitment 
to democracy human rights and economic freedom we are closing a 
chapter in history the cold war is over and we now move on toward 
working toward a peaceful and stable europe said bush 
it took only 15 minutes to sign the document bound in red 
leather which signaled an end to an era of tensions in the nuclear 
age 
french president francois mitterrand was the first to sign he 
was followed by helmut kohl chancellor of a newly unified germany 
and the leaders of poland hungary and other nations that until a 
few months ago were hardline communist followers of the soviet 
union 
the summit opened on monday with the formal signing of a 
landmark treaty that slashes nonnuclear forces in europe and a 
companion nonaggression pact 
but if the formal sessions were devoted to european security 
issues in the post cold war era president bush devoted much of his 
backstage diplomacy to the persian gulf where iraqs occupation of 
kuwait is more than three months old 
bush headed for the middle east and a thanksgiving day visit 
with us troops there departed without a public commitment from 
gorbachev to support a united nations resolution authorizing the 
use of force to dislodge iraqs army from kuwait 
even so he said ive said all along that we are on the 
same wave length as the soviet union he added he was very 
encouraged about this holding together of a coalition in the sands 
and on the seas of the gulf 
the soviets are calling for a meeting of the united nations 
security council a position gorbachev underscored after meeting 
with canadian prime minister brian mulroney 
there is a need for a meeting of the un security council 
without delay to discuss the situation and take a decision there 
gorbachev said describing the situaiton as very dangerous 
the summit document exulted in the end to cold war tensions that 
divided europe for 45 years every european nation but albania 
signed as did canada the united states and the soviet union 
europe is liberating itself from the legacy of the past the 
charter said ours is a time for fulfilling the hopes and 
expectations our peoples have cherished for decades steadfast 
commitment to democracy based on human rights and fundamental 
freedoms prosperity through economic liberty and social justice 
and equal security for all countries 
the charter sets up a small bureaucracy in prague for the 
34nation conference on security and cooperation in europe as well 
as a center for the prevention of conflict in vienna and an office 
in warsaw to help monitor elections 
democratic government is based on the will of the people 
expressed regularly through free and fair elections the charter 
said democracy is the best safeguard of freedom of expression 
tolerance of all groups of society and equality opportunity for 
each person 
the summit document also recommends that the heads of member 
states and governments meet at least once every two years their 
foreign ministers annually and senior officials even more often 
bush who met with gorbachev over dinner on monday night said 
he was leaving paris convinced that were in good 
synchronization with other nations on strategy for ending the 
gulf crisis 
nevetheless the persian gulf was not discussed at tuesdays 
afternoon closeddoor session said french spokesman hubert 
vedrine he said the subject did not come up adding there will 
be no common declaration by the 34 on the gulf 
there was not and the leaders departed without devoting a line 
of their summit charter to the issue 
asked by reporters if he had set a deadline for iraqi withdrawal 
from kuwait bush replied just watch the way all this develops 
everybody is convinced that they must get out of kuwait with no 
concessions and thats whats emerging here

the fruits of peace in europe were evident in the summit 
discussions 
several eastern european leaders suggested that the warsaw pact 
was headed for dissolution and appealed to the west for support to 
avoid an economic iron curtain separating europes haves and 
havenots 
czechoslovak president vaclav havel said he could imagine the 
warsaw pact remaining but only as a temporary consultative 
organization on disarmament issues 
still there was no shortage of problemsd to address 
kohl leading his nation to its first major international forum 
since unification endorsed the appeals of eastern european leaders 
for western financial support 
there must now be no borders which perpetuate the prosperity 
divide he said the ideological gulfs that have been overcome 
must not be torn open again 
the social highlight of the summit came tuesday night when the 
leaders gathered at the chateau of versailles outside paris for a 
ballet performance and a banquet featuring lobster and capons 
among those on hand was britains prime minister margaret 
thatcher who learned shortly before the dinner that she faced a 
second round of balloting in an unprecedented challenge to her 
11year reign as conservative party leader 
the summit opened monday after leaders of 16 north atlantic 
treaty organization members and the remaining six warsaw pact 
nations put their signatures on two treaties one making sweeping 
cuts in nonnuclear arms throughout europe and the other pledging 
nonaggression toward one another 
the socalled conventional forces in europe treaty reduces 
thousands of tanks armored vehicles and other nonnuclear weapons 
from the arsenals of the warsaw pact and nato across europe 
us and soviet officials said tuesday that bush and gorbachev 
tentatively plan to meet in moscow in january hoping that 
negotiators can first work out problems with a nuclear arms treaty 
havel was one of several leaders who in summit speeches 
expressed regret that the soviet unions breakaway baltic republics 
estonia latvia and lithuania had been excluded from the 
summit 
the three baltic foreign ministers protested tuesday at the 
soviet move and urged participants to help them gain a full and 
complete role in the conference 
also unhappy was the delegation from albania limited to 
observer status because of its isolationist policies and lack of 
political reform the delegation said in a statement that the 
reasons for its exclusion were incomprehensible

not one member of the legislature voted 
against an ethics measure than bars more than 32000 state and 
local officials from taking gifts over 100 from lobbyists 
i dont think theres another legislature in the nation thats 
gone as far as weve gone said house speaker tk wetherell a 
democrat 
the bill an effort to restore public confidence eroded by a 
criminal investigation into government ethics passed the house 
1190 and the senate 390 on tuesday gov bob martinez is expected 
to sign it into law 
the bill would prohibit gifts over 100 from lobbyists and 
political action committees to more than 32000 public officials 
including legislators 
among the exceptions lobbyists can pay for food and drink of 
any price if its consumed at a single sitting 
the measure would impose a fine of up to 5000 and a twoyear 
lobbying ban on lobbyists who violate it officials could be 
removed from office 
senate republicans had tried to amend the bill to prohibit gifts 
no matter the value 
under this bill a lobbyist couldnt give you a 400 set of 
golf clubs said sen richard langley but he could give it to 
you one club at a time 
but democrat tom brown the measures chief senate sponsor said 
100 was a reasonable amount that could be changed by the 
legislature in the future 
this is one we needed to get behind us brown said 
the bill was inspired by an investigation into legislators 
acceptance of trips to hunting lodges ski resorts and foreign 
countries from lobbyists and lawmakers failure to report the 
gifts as the law now requires 
a prosecutor has subpoenaed records from dozens of lobbyists as 
part of the probe 
government entities such as state commissions school boards 
and city councils could give officials gifts but universities 
and colleges could not that would end such perks as football 
weekends for legislators 
also out would be the annual legislative family day at disney 
world 
bill jones of the goodgovernment group common cause said the 
bill is a good first step but that the need for campaign finance 
reform is much greater

a previously unknown millionaire emigre 
who has suddenly become a contender in polands presidential race 
jumped ahead of prime minister tadeusz mazowiecki in the polls 
today trailing only lech walesa 
the latest survey by the government polling service showed 
42yearold businessman sanislaw tyminski was backed by 20 percent 
of respondents 
walesa the solidarity chairman was favored by 27 percent 
mazowiecki 17 percent and the remaining three candidates shared a 
total of 12 percent twentyfour percent were undecided or did not 
plan to vote 
if no candidate wins more than 50 percent in sundays election 
the top two votegetters will compete in a dec 9 runoff 
however the poll was conducted over the weekend before 
tyminski charged that mazowiecki had betrayed the nation by 
creating economic chaos and found himself the subject of a 
government slander investigation 
tyminskis allegation was based in part on figures he 
misinterpreted and prompted journalists to take the first hard look 
at his international business dealings his canadian and peruvian 
nationality and his absence from poland for the last 21 years 
the promazowiecki newspaper lamented tyminskis meteoric rise 
in a frontpage commentary today poland used to be the 
conscience of europe and now we have a chance to become the 
laughing stock of the world 
under the headline a liar or a fool the newspaper on 
tuesday said tyminski appeared unbalanced 
tyminski describes himself as a selfmade millionaire who left 
poland penniless at age 21 and made fortunes in canada and the 
amazon port of iquitos peru according to his campaign he runs 
transduction ltd a toronto computer automation company and leads 
canadas tiny conservative libertarian party 
although unknown in poland or in emigre circles tyminski was 
given free television and radio time by newly democratic polands 
evenhanded election law and a press making every effort to be fair 
covered him just as it treated walesa mazowiecki or the other 
three candidates 
however because he initially was given no chance of winning he 
was generally treated as a curiosity and not subjected to hard 
criticism until his surge in the polls 
he appealed to poles disenchanted by the painful marketoriented 
reform promulgated by mazowiecki and endorsed by walesa who saw 
his support drop from 35 percent in a poll released friday 
the antiinflationary plan threatens to bring civil war 
tyminski told audiences struggling with high prices unemployment 
and uncertainty the country has been engulfed by recession we 
have neither a government nor a parliament 
a columnist in the zycie warszawy newspaper said one sociologist 
described tyminskis appeal as an easy way for poles to resolve 
their problem of choosing between walesa and mazowiecki 
if i have a conflict hanging over me i will gladly go out for 
a vodka the commentator said it is this vodka that tyminski 
the only independent candidate represents 
however he wrote when tyminski made charges amounting to 
treason against mazowiecki a veteran solidarity activist and the 
first noncommunist prime minister in the east bloc the vodka 
got spilled 
gazeta wyborcza referring to the investigation of tyminski for 
slander said that a person can be imprisoned for from six months 
to eight years if convicted of publicly offending and humiliating 
the polish nation 
the poll released today was conducted saturday and sunday and 
surveyed 1490 people in person the government polling service 
said the margin of error was 2 percent

a dispute over how to grill a hot dog has a 
palestinian food retailer pitted against a rabbi who is baltimores 
lone inspector of kosher meats 
the merchant george barghout still was touting his dogs as 
kosher on tuesday despite a conviction last week for violating a 
city ordinance that bars merchants from claiming their products are 
kosher when theyre not 
rabbi mayer kurcfeld has spent 15 months dogging barghout 
insisting that the kosher wieners he sells at his yogurt plus 
eatery are rendered nonkosher because he grills them next to 
nonkosher dogs 
if the consumer believes he is getting kosher food that is 
what he should get the rabbi said 
jewish dietary laws forbid the commingling of kosher and 
nonkosher foods barghout says the cooking does not deprive the 
hot dogs of their kosher qualities the flame doesnt contaminate 
the meat it purifies it he said 
it doesnt make any difference what he thinks kurcfeld 
replied 
barghout came to the united states 31 years ago and says he is 
devoted to the cause of a palestinian homeland he owns five 
baltimore food stores 
kurcfeld is an orthodox jew born in israel 
he takes his job with baltimores bureau of kosher meat and food 
control so seriously that he refuses to reveal the days he travels 
to philadelphia for a second job as a kosher slaughterer 
if people knew when i was out of town who knows what they 
might do he asks 
am i in a zionist state or am i in america said barghout 
this is a zionist place i tell you a goddamn zionist place 
the conviction cst barghout 500 in fines plus court costs

a manuscript of mozarts fantasia and sonata in 
c minor sold today at auction for 157 million tying a record 
for a music manuscript sothebys said 
the manuscript which contained previously unknown 
embellishments by the composer was part of a group of manuscripts 
offered by the eastern baptist theological seminary of 
philadelphia 
the bid by otto haas a london dealership tied the record for 
such a manuscript set a year ago when sothebys got the same price 
for a piano concerto by robert schumann 
haas paid an additional buyers premium of 10 percent 
the manuscripts were discovered in a safe at the school in july 
they had been donated in 1950 by marguerite treat doane whose 
father had been a prominent collector 
sothebys said the manuscript apparently had been among a 
collection sold by mozarts wife constanze in 1799 eight years 
after the composers death 
william howard doane of cincinnati ohio an industrialist and 
hymn writer acquired the manuscript in 1889 
the fantasia and sonata are customarily played together

time hasnt faded 77yearold harold williams 
memory of leaving new york city along with other orphans on a train 
taking them to new homes in the midwest 
i remember standing on the platform and then going into the 
train and sitting down with my teddy bear in my lap he said 
tuesday i recall looking out the window and seeing all the 
people and the buildings 
many orphaned or abandoned children benefited from the orphan 
train movement which lasted from 1854 to 1929 others merely had 
their suffering relocated 
their tales good and bad were told at an orphan train reunion 
attended by about two dozen people who took part in the unusual 
social experiment that sent more than 100000 children to foster 
homes far from the big city 
in 1929 me and my twin brother were put on the last orphan 
train out to kansas said alan bankston 64 of dayton ohio 
we wound up with adoptive parents he said they gave us 
everything we needed except love and love is what we needed the 
most 
bankston wept during part of his talk he said although he and 
his wife had six children they took in two foster children 
because i knew how important it was to have someone love you 
the orphan train came at a time when new york city was inundated 
by european immigrants who crowded tenements on the lower east 
side poverty and disease were rampant many children were orphaned 
or left to fend for themselves on the streets 
arthur smith 72 of trenton nj was only 49 days old when a 
welldressed woman left him in a wicker basket in gimbels 
department store when he was 4 he boarded a train for a new life 
on an iowa farm 
smith said he was lucky to be taken in by a loving family but 
he admitted the mystery of the woman who left him behind haunted 
him 
then i sort of put it aside he said i decided it was a 
door i wasnt meant to open i dont feel bad about my mother i 
assume she was in circumstances beyond her control 
williams of magalia calif said he is still angry at his 
mother i was a cute little baby only 16 days old he said 
how could she dump me 
he said he spent most of his childhood with an old lady who 
was a tyrant and her five daughters 
i was scared to death of her williams said if i became 
sick i got beaten she had this theory that if you got sick youd 
done something bad 
williams left that home at 17 after years of being abused 
mentally physically and sexually 
he became a homeless alcoholic but pulled his life together with 
the help of a job at a dairy plant he later became plant manager 
and got married 
seventyoneyearold winifred williams no relation of temple 
hills md looked at her husband lawrence while she spoke to the 
group 
to be an orphan means to survive she said you dont have 
a parent or a mother to love you you tell yourself you will 
survive until you find someone who will love you i felt that way 
when i met my husband he made up for all the love i didnt have as 
a child 
alice ayler 71 of oklahoma city survived a nightmarish 
childhood in a series of foster homes where she was abused she 
became a psychologist and has been married for 51 years 
the reunion she said completed the journey begun so many years 
ago 
were all a big old family she said looking around the 
crowd not by blood by something bigger

the national government berated the russian and 
kazakhstan republics today for refusing to obey a decree to lift 
price controls on jewelry american cigarettes and other luxury 
goods 
the state prices committee said the move to free market prices 
for nonessential luxury items was inevitable and that their 
prices should rise the communist party newspaper pravda quoted the 
committee as saying the defiant republics refusal to obey the 
order was illegal 
prices of many luxury items have been fixed by the state but 
many are regularly sold for much more than the official price by 
corrupt salesclerks and even the factory workers who produce the 
goods and the truck drivers who deliver them 
womens shoes now cost 439 on average on the black market a 
pack of 20 cigarettes costs 9 and a color television set 3638 
all three to six times higher than state prices a newspaper report 
said today 
the council of ministers or soviet cabinet announced last week 
it was lifting price controls on select items to encourage 
production of consumer goods 
the order affected sales of furs carpets hightech 
electronics cut glassware china car parts caviar and imported 
whiskey and gin 
within hours of the surprise announcement the russian republic 
refused to enact it and temporarily forbade the sale of the 
affected goods on russian territory the central asian republic of 
kazakhstan also nullified the decree within its borders and 
azerbaijan said today it would temporarily ignore it while studying 
its impact 
floating prices are an important element of the governments 
plan to move to a market economy from central planning in which 
the government sets all prices regardless of the cost of 
production 
the supreme soviet or national parliament adopted a plan for 
gradually freeing prices last month but has run into resistance 
from some republics notably russia which has adopted its own 
plan 
the rabochaya tribuna workers tribune newspaper today quoted 
the russian federation statistics committee as saying the black 
market prices of some consumer goods in the republic exceeded state 
prices by 100 to 200 percent or more 
it said the average black market price for beef or pork was 
1620 and for a small jar of caviar 3780 both four times the 
state prce 
in moscow a can of caviar fetches 63 dollars on the black 
market or seven times the state price the newspaper said 
the price of 45 dollars for a kilogram 22 pounds of 
chocolate candies exceeds the state price seven times over it 
said a bottle of wine is sold for 18 while the average 
official price is 630 
the state prices committee rejected criticism that the freeing 
of prices would play into the hands of black marketeers 
pravda said as long as prices remain artificially low 
jewelry caviar and other goods in short supply are being bought 
up on a large scale for personal gain not only by soviet citizens 
but also and this is particularly alarming by foreigners

a liberal lawmaker challenging a proposal to 
regulate suggestive advertising evoked a provocative biblical 
passage while ultraorthodox parliament members shouted and covered 
their ears in protest 
arieh eliyav of the leftleaning labor party said he read the 
passionate sections from the songs of songs in the old testament to 
show that indecency is not easily defined 
but after seven hours of debate tuesday legislators voted 4238 
to give the first of three approvals needed to adopt a law banning 
use of nude or scantily clad women in advertising 
the law is among religious legislation the ultraorthodox agudat 
israel party demanded last week when it joined prime minister 
yitzhak shamirs ruling coalition 
the proposed laws have incensed many secular israelis who accuse 
the ultraorthodox minority of religious coercion about 70 percent 
of israeli jews do not observe strict religious practices 
at the beginning of the session the debate was more academic 
than erotic with lawmakers discussing whether clothed or nake 
women were more arousing 
then came eliyav quoting from the song of songs also known as 
the song of solomon 
your two breasts are like two fawns twins of a gazelle that 
feeds among the lilies how delightful is your love my sister 
my bride how much more pleasing is your love than wine and the 
fragrance of your perfume than any spice he quoted 
rabbi avraham ravitz of the ultraorthodox torah flag party 
leaped to his feet 
he eliyav is bringing damnation upon the people of israel 
he shouted this could only happen in the israeli parliament 
using the bible for political purposes its a shame 
agudat israel legislator rabbi moshe feldman covered his ears 
eliyav continued unperturbed your belly is a heap of wheat 
encircled with lilies 
after eliyav stopped reading three legislators urged him to 
leave 
i wont let the rabbi ravitz teach me about loving the bible 
throughout the years hundreds of millions of people throughout 
the world loved these words word for word and we gave them to 
the world he told the daily yediot ahronot newspaper

diplomats under siege at the us embassy in kuwait 
have found a new source of water and may be able to hold out until 
some time in december president bush said today 
bush said the water source was being purified for drinking but 
he did not elaborate until now the diplomats drank purified 
swimming pool water and bottled liquids 
iraq cut off water and electricity to all embassies in kuwait in 
late august ordering them to shut down all diplomats have left 
except for eight americans two britons and some arab 
representatives 
the diplomats have been living off canned food supplies and 
fresh dates and were not expected to hold out beyond november 
in terms of how long the people can last i dont know the 
answer to that bush told reporters at the us ambassadors 
residence following an international summit it has been pushed 
back to something in december he added before departing for a 
visit to saudi arabia and egypt 
the 10th antiiraq resolution adopted earlier this month by the 
un security council calls for the secretary general to find ways 
to resupply the beleaguered embassies but he has yet to announce 
how he plans to do so 
in late october secretary of state james baker announced the 
diplomats had dug a shallow well in the compound he said they were 
using the water to tend a vegetable garden and to thumb their nose 
at the iraqi troops ringing the compound by washing the embassy 
cars 
the us compound shelters ambassador w nathaniel howe a staff 
of seven and 19 american citizens who have taken refuge there 
there is an attempt by saddam hussein to starve them out

a construction site cavein four blocks from 
the white house was stabilized early today as utility crews worked 
to restore telephone and electrical services 
a 100footlong section of sidewalk and part of a downtown 
street slid into the 4storydeep hole tuesday as workers tried to 
shore up the construction site from the initial collapse monday 
night no injuries were reported 
workers at united press international were allowed back in their 
headquarters today but telephone company spokesman michel daley 
said full service would not be restored until later in the day the 
news agency abandoned its headquarters adjacent to the scene of the 
collapse monday night but the news service continued to operate 
with help from a rival agency reuters and from national public 
radio 
even though the site was stabilized more dirt will be dumped 
according to vincent ford district of columbia chief building 
inspector ford said he did not expect any further ground movement 
daley said chesapeake and potomac telephone co crews were 
working to repair a cable that was severed in the collapse about 
70 percent of the circuits were expected to be restored by early 
afternoon daley said 
were literally running cables through windows to get services 
restored on a temporary basis daley said 
if the cavein spreads any further it could cut electric lines 
supplying power to surrounding office buildings said bill gausman 
construction manager for the potomac electric power co the utility 
urged customers to curtail power usage 
the area around the halfblocksquare construction project is 
being blocked off to traffic while crews dump dirt into the site 
workers are going to be at it for days said charles culver 
director of construction and engineering for the occupational 
safety and health administration which is investigating the 
accident schal midatlantic inc had planned an office building at 
the location 
upi will operate from temporary quarters until at least 
thanksgiving according to spokesman milt capps 
we urgently need our telephone service restored if we are 
going to deliver quality service over the holiday period capps 
said he described morale as grim but added there was also a 
foxhole camaraderie among employees 
upi staff members who are members of the wire service guild 
voted last friday to accept a 90day 35 percent pay cut the 
company said was needed to stave off financial insolvency and make 
it mre attractive to potential buyers management employees took 
the same cut earlier

clients and that national public radio was helping maintain its 
broadcast and audio network services upi was operating out of 
several locations including the senate press gallery at the 
capitol 
were prepared to continue operations over here 
indefinitely upis executive editor al rossiter jr said from 
a company facility in a virginia suburb

ground on arrival crying for joy and chanting allahu akbar or 
god is great 
tehran radio said the 238 former pows arrived at the capitals 
mehrabad airport and were warmly greeted by military and political

the agency said the iraqis had been convicted of crimes but were 
later pardoned by iran it did not specify the nature of the

he was apparently seeking peace on his eastern border while 
trying to consolidate his hold over kuwait iran has strongly 
condemned the aug 2 invasion of the emirate 
iraq suspended the prisoner exchanges without explanation on 
sept 20 after 37000 men had been exchanged the international

baghdad last week the highest official from iran to visit iraq 
since the 1979 islamic revolution got the exchanges going again

were convicted of crimes such as murder and assault after they were 
interned in camps during the 19801988 war 
irna in its report said a freed pow while weeping 
bitterly said a great grief breaking their hearts was the passing

federal drug agents lured reputed lebanese 
heroin producers and traffickers to the united states with the 
promise of payment for previous drug shipments in order to arrest 
the rings leaders a prosecutor says 
we were able to arrange for all of the key players to be 
present in the united states during a twoweek period said henry 
e hudson us attorney for the eastern district of virginia 
they came here to collect money for previous transactions 
he said tuesday adding were talking several hundred thousand 
dollars 
the results were the arrests of 22 people in five states and the 
district of columbia including nine people who normally reside in 
lebanon but were enticed to the washington area officials said 
among the lebanese residents arrested were kamal charif 
identified by officials as a former employee of the lebanese 
parliament and his son wadgy charif 
wadgy charif told undercover drug enforcement administration 
agent hollis williams and a dea informant on aug 2 1989 that his 
father owned and operated one of the largest heroin processing 
facilities in the bekaa valley and could supply williams with 
large quantities of heroin williams said in an affidavit 
kamal charif came to the united states not only to pick up money 
but also to negotiate with our agents to supply 50 kilograms 110 
pounds a month to supply what he thought was a heroin network 
hudson said in an interview 
the 16month undercover case dubbed operation helix began 
with the august 1989 meeting at the four seasons restaurant in 
alexandria va and involved purchases or arrangements to purchase 
numerous multikilogram quantities of heroin at about 40000 
apiece williams affidavit said 
it also led to the seizure of 25 kilograms of extremely pure 
heroin hudson said 
its possible that the arrests could have been delayed so we 
could have seized more heroin but we might have lost a couple of 
the key players the prosecutor said 
this organization is probably one of the largest importers of 
heroin on the east coast of the united states responsible for 
supplying significant quantities into the washington metropolitan 
area as well as into new york and detroit hudson said 
the organization was responsible for the importation of 
hundreds of kilograms of relatively pure southwest asian heroin 
into the united states europe and canada a justice department 
statement said 
of the 22 people arrested 18 were charged with conspiracy to 
distribute heroin a charge that carries a possible sentence of 
life without parole as well as immigration violations the other 
four are charged only with immigration violations 
fifteen of the 22 were seized in washington dc or northern 
virginia three in detroit two in new jersey and one each in 
toledo ohio and miami 
the investigation is expected to lead to nine more arrests 
including one in germany said an official familiar with the case 
the heroin came from the syriancontrolled bekaa valley the 
newfound cooperation between the united states and syria due to 
their alliance against iraq has not extended to drug control 
efforts according to the official who spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
the syrians arent helping us the official said if 
anything they are hindering us 
the state departments international narcotics control strategy 
report issued last march said we believe that syria tolerates 
and profits from the drug production and trafficking in the areas 
over which it exercises control 
this view was supported by one of the people arrested michel 
rebeiz who told dea agent williams that the syrian police were 
now running the airport and asking 10000 per kilogram to allow 
heroin through the checkpoints according to williams affidavit 
the state department report said lebanese production of opium 
the raw ingredient for heroin increased significantly last year 
to as much as 45 metric tons during that year the us officials 
believe lebanon produced as much as 65 metric tons of heroin with 
45 metric tons coming from locally grown opium and the rest from 
opiates imported from afghanistan iran and pakistan 
the heroin involved in operation helix was shipped through 
cyprus western europe and then to the united states said dea 
spokesman cornelius dougherty

here is a brief look at the latest developments in the persian 
gulf 
 
mikhail s gorbachev says the un security council should meet 
to address a very dangerous situation in the persian gulf and 
take a decision there speaking after a meeting with canadian 
prime minister brian mulroney gorbachev said we cant just 
leave things this way without giving them closer analysis the 
soviet leader did not elaborate on what any un security council 
meeting might discuss or what any solution might involve 
 
iraq meanwhile promised to free 157 more europeans it is 
holding western officials said hostages to be released over the 
next days included britons italians germans irish dutch danes 
belgians portuguese and greeks many western officials have said 
saddam husseins policy of releasing hostages gradually is designed 
to break the world alliance against iraq 
 
speaking in paris where he attended a european security summit 
president bush said he and gorbachev see eye to eye on the gulf 
crisis and any differences between them were very minor bush 
left paris for the middle east where he was to meet with arab 
officials and spend thanksgiving with us troops in dhahran saudi 
arabia 
 
it looks like virtually all 230000 americans deployed in the 
gulf will be eating fresh turkey with all the trimmings on 
thanksgiving day but just in case the us military says it has 
600000 prepackaged turkey dinners stashed in a warehouse

shogun the musical certainly has the 
spectacle what it needs is a coherent story a few good songs and 
a couple of characters you could care about 
all are missing from this big beached whale of a show that 
floated belly up into broadways marquis theater on tuesday night 
the premiere was postponed several days after the leading man 
philip casnoff was bonked by a piece of falling scenery during a 
preview performance nov 13 
its amazing casnoff wasnt hurt before the show opens with a 
shipwreck a rather nifty maritime catastrophe done with an 
honesttogoodness ship laser beams and some blackclad sea 
sprites pulling billowing sheets of cloth the musical also has an 
earthquake and several big battle scenes including one striking 
chorus line of warriors on horseback they are not enough 
although shogun has the technical expertise of recent big 
british musical blockbusters it doesnt have the emotional sweep 
of les miserables or the sense of romance and fun found in 
the phantom of the opera director michael smuin has mastered 
the wizardry of modern stage technology but he cant do much with a 
baffling narrative and pedestrian music and lyrics 
the musical is based on james clavells mammoth novel of 
17thcentury japan the book is so detailed and complicated the 
paperback version runs more than 1200 pages that any adaptation 
is bound to be more outline than story even so the producers have 
included a twopage plot synopsis and a glossary of japanese 
phrases that still dont make the tale completely accessible 
shogun concerns an englishman john blackthorne shipwrecked 
on the japanese coast he gets involved with several warlords a 
conniving portuguese jesuit and most significantly the lovely 
lady mariko who happens to be married to a nobleman you know 
there will be trouble 
shogun takes itself very seriously the characters dont 
talk they proclaim when they are not proclaiming they are 
explaining the plot adapter john driver uses several of the main 
characters to summarize what is going on its like listening to 
cliffs notes read out loud 
when they are not explaining the performers are singing 
composer paul chiharas wallpaperthin music melodies that linger 
no longer than the time it takes to sing them the music and 
lyrics which are by driver often seem unnecessary stopping the 
plot rather than advancing it and more important in the love 
songs failing to forge the bond between blackthorne and mariko 
instead these love songs are so generic particularly an often 
repeated number called born to be together that they probably 
could be dropped into any musical and work ok 
the cast doesnt let the weak material stop them casnoff is 
personable a handsome leading man who sings with authority and 
even seems to have a sense of humor june angela as the doomed 
mariko is striking a lovely singer who throws herself into the 
show with even more conviction 
the rotund francis ruivivar as the good warlord is stuck with 
a character who alternates between buffoon and nobleman he also 
has one of the shows more pointless songs rum below in which 
blackthorne teaches the wouldbe shogun to dance a jig but the 
shows campiest moment occurs early in the second act when the 
geishas sing about oriental sexual toys truly embarrassing 
the costumes by patricia zipprodt are extraordinary an endless 
display of patterned silks and brocades as well as a parade of 
armor for scores of warriors no one seems to wear the same outfit 
twice loren shermans settings are equally lavish particularly 
the richly decorated darkhued osaka castle lair of the evil lord 
ishido the lighting by natasha katz beautifully shows off the 
settings and the costumes 
but these design achievements cant really mask the thinness of 
what were seeing and hearing on stage shogun the musical can 
occasionally dazzle the eye but it never touches the heart and 
mind 
what other critics said 
frank rich in the new york times said casnoffs accident with 
the scenery may have been the biggest break of his career 
because his performance after his recovery had the swaggering 
selfassurance of a star in complete command of a vast 
production 
clive barnes in the new york post said the show is as 
unremittingly serious as triviality can ever hope to be the 
book is unwieldy and the lyrics banal he said 
linda winer in newsday said shogun is drivel but its not 
inept drivel without cameron mackintosh and his presold 
international marketing machine behind it however the show will 
need all the karma it can get

the government has agreed to free at least 
157 more europeans stranded in iraq and occupied kuwait western 
officials said today the announcement came a day after iraqs 
parliament voted to free all germans 
the bush administration seeking global support for a un 
resolution to wage war on iraq has called the baghdad governments 
piecemeal releases of hostages an attempt to divide the coalition 
arrayed against saddam hussein 
there is general agreement among coalition members that the 
unordered embargo on trade with iraq is far from achieving its 
desired goal of forcing saddam out of kuwait which his forces 
seized on aug 2 
heavyweight boxing great muhammad ali left amman for baghdad 
today for talks with saddam on the gulf crisis ali was accompanied 
by two associates and two members of the coalition to stop us 
intervention in the middle east 
french rightwing politician jean marie le pen in baghdad since 
sunday will take 83 european hostages to strasbourg seat of the 
european parliament a member of his delegation said le pen is a 
member of the european parliament which is scheduled to discuss 
the gulf crisis on thursday 
the delegation member speaking on condition of anonymity said 
those leaving thursday would be 35 britons 15 italians 15 
germans six irish five dutch three danes 2 belgians a 
portuguese and a greek 
he said two others who held french passports but were not full 
french citizens would fly out he would not elaborate 
the head of a swiss parliamentary delegation said today that 36 
hostages would leave thursday afternoon on a swissair charter 
flight to zurich 
edgar oehler a christian democrat member of parliament told a 
news conference that those allowed to leave include 16 swiss four 
irish and two britons 
also today the head of personnel for foreign workers at ibn 
albitar hospital said 38 mostly irish staff members would be 
allowed to leave the group includes 2 britons and a dane said 
gerry fitzgerald 
it was unclear when the workers contracts had already expired 
the iraqi government has previously blocked some workers from 
leaving even if their contracts were fulfilled 
it was not immediately known when that group would be allowed to 
leave 
iraqs parliament voted tuesday night to release all the german 
hostages in response to recent statements by german chancellor 
helmut kohl stressing the need for a peaceful solution to the 
persian gulf crisis 
iraqs parliament speaker saadi mahdi saleh said there were 
124 germans still in iraq and kuwait no specific arrangements were 
made for their departure germany says there are about 180 of its 
citizens still in iraq 
the germans were among the 600 people including americans 
britons and japanese held at strategic sites to deter an attack by 
the multinational forces gathered in the gulf to try to force iraq 
out of kuwait 
about 2000 westerners are believed hiding in kuwait 
earlier this week iraq said all foreigners would be set free 
between dec 25 and march 25 but information minister latif 
nassiyif jassim indicated monday that some might be allowed to 
leave earlier 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater in paris with president 
bush for a european security cummit said baghdads moves to free 
hostages gradually was another effort to chisel away international 
solidarity against iraq 
our answer is simply sorry it wont work said fitzwater 
on tuesday 
the iraqi promise to free all foreigners came after the bush 
administration announced last week that 200000 more us troops 
would be sent to the region to place the 350000strong 
multinational force on an offensive footing

boris n yeltsin today criticized soviet president 
mikhail s gorbachevs plans to strengthen the executive branch of 
government as illogical and hastily prepared 
yeltsin president of largest soviet republic said russia could 
not be forced into signing gorbachevs proposed union treaty which 
would redefine the relationship between the 15 republics and the 
national government 
the treaty would be signed only if russias real sovereignty 
would be assured and if issues are resolved over the ownership of 
the vast republics bounty of gold diamonds oil gas and other 
natural resources said yeltsin gorbachevs frequent critic and 
main political rival 
gorbachev on saturday proposed dumping his embattled prime 
minister nikolai i ryzhkov and revamping the executive branch to 
put it entirely under presidential control the supreme soviet 
legislature gave the proposals initial approval but is expected to 
consider them further friday 
the soviet leader made the proposals after the supreme soviet 
urged him to resolve a building political crisis that was 
paralyzing efforts at reforming the nations economy 
most of the 15 soviet republics including russia have declared 
some form of sovereignty pushing for local control over their own 
economies political structures and culture this has resulted in 
political confrontations with the central government over which 
directives should be carried out or ignored 
yeltsin speaking to reporters at the opening of a historical 
exhibition at the russian republics headquarters said gorbachevs 
proposed strengthening of the national presidency seemed to be 
prepared in a hurry probably as a result of the debates in the 
supreme soviet or prompted by the staff of the supreme soviet or 
presidential aides 
but they are not exactly logical not quite consistent for 
one thing and for another such things should be discussed and 
adopted taking into account the will of the republics he said 
without elaboration 
yeltsin who on monday urged a referendum on the entire 
presidential system and the governments performance said today 
that a decision on such a vote hasnt been made and he would not 
predict one 
asked if gorbachevs reputation or credibility are helped by the 
proposal to strengthen his presidential powers yeltsin replied 
it was my impression from the stormy meetings in the ukraine 
where i spent only one day that no it doesnt 
yeltsin was in the ukraine earlier this week to sign a treaty on 
relations between that republic and the russian republic

profits for major oil companies increased by 
less than 2 percent in the months immediately after the persian 
gulf crisis and most benefits from higher prices went to 
oilproducing countries the energy department reported today 
a report by the energy information administration said higher 
crude oil prices led to substantial increases in income from oil 
and gas production but the beneficiaries often were foreign 
governments 
income for oilproducing countries as well as for domestic 
producers soared in the third quarter by 684 percent compared to 
the same threemonth period in 1989 the report said but for the 
most part the benefit did not pass on to many of the oil 
companies the study reported 
for the major petroleum companies increased profits from oil 
and gas production were nearly offset by reduced earnings from 
refining marketing and chemical businesses said the report 
the net income for major us oil companies was l7 percent 
overall the report said companies that had to buy crude oil and 
petroleum products at the higher prices reported profit declines 
the report said 
some refineries reported sharp increases in profits however 
the report said that the net income for independent refiners 
increased 130 percent in the 3rd quarter compared to the same 
period a year earlier profits from integrated refinery operations 
at the major oil companies were mixed five companies reported 
profit increases up to 46 percent while six reported decreases of 
up to 83 percent the report said 
due to retail price restraint us companies who had to 
purchase oil to process at higher prices saw their income 
decline said the report 
the report provided no information on specific companies 
its analysis covered the month of july through september iraq 
invaded kuwait on aug 2 leading to an embargo of iraqi and 
kuwaiti oil and a shortfall of world oil supplies by 43 million 
barrels prompting prices to soar 
spot crude oil prices which were about 21 a barrel before the 
invasion peaked at 41 a barrel in october before declining to 
about 34 a barrel in early november

here are excerpts from recent editorials in newspapers in the 
united states and abroad 
 
nov 16 
roswell nm daily record on the presidents need to build 
support before taking offensive action in the persian gulf 
president bushs decision to significantly expand american force 
levels in the persian gulf and cancel troop rotation orders sends a 
resolute signal he is ready to go to war to liberate kuwait 
yet it is far from certain that in the event of bloodshed on a 
massive scale mr bush would be able to count on the sustained 
backing of the american people and the rest of the world 
mr bush must clearly spell out americas aims and articulate 
why the defeat of saddam hussein on the battlefield is vital to 
us interests otherwise americans may not be willing to make the 
heavy sacrifices that a war almost certainly would impose 
much more is at stake in the persian gulf than low cost 
gasoline the strategic reality is that unless saddams aggression 
is checked once and for all the economic security of the entire 
industrialized world will be in jeopardy 
 
nov 16 
the ledger lakeland fla on the congressional role in the 
gulf crisis 
president bush as commander in chief of the military has every 
right and obligation to prepare the troops for war he acted wisely 
by rapidly deploying us troops to saudi arabia and the persian 
gulf to contain iraqi aggression containment of saddam hussein is 
certainly in the best interest of the united states 
the president should not however slowly draw the united states 
into war with iraq without first building a consensus among the 
american people 
congress in fact should no let bush do it 
congress has neglected its duties by putting off hearings on the 
military buildup in the middle east the economic and human costs 
of war the strategic benefits and risks and whether or not war is 
necessary 
 
nov 19 
los angeles times on hostage family visits to iraq 
the somewhat ghoulish invitation of president saddam hussein to 
come visit iraq as it were presents the loved ones of 
hostages being held there with a difficult dilemma its not 
surprising that some of them are reacting emotionally its also 
not surprising that some plan to go 
clearly the iraqis hope to milk these visits for all the 
propaganda value they are worth hussein seems to think the world 
will see iraq as a kinder gentler place and as a country with 
which it is possible to do business it probably doesnt occur to 
hussein that these visits as well as his latest offer to free all 
guests by march only remind everyone of iraqs cruel 
hostagetaking policy 
it could be that the sight of loved ones in baghdad for the 
holidays will actually aid us policy by starching up the 
antihussein coalition and reminding people of the grisly nature of 
his dictatorship but even if the visits have an effect close 
to what saddam hussein probably wants it is still right that they 
be permitted to occur in western political philosophy individuals 
do count the role and desires of just one person have importance

the columbus ohio dispatch on election results 
committed political junkies those who like to pick over the 
bones of an election until they are absolutely clean must have 
noticed by now that the voting last week propelled a bumper crop of 
women into office 
and political strategists said the stage has been set for a 
greater share of female victories in 1992 
in the coming years there will be an increasingly large number 
of women working as lawyers doctors engineers and in other 
professional capacities 
no reason then that there shouldnt be more women politicians 
too 
this year the center for the american woman and politics 
reported 2063 female candidates in the field these candidates are 
expected to increase the share of state legislative offices held by 
women to about 18 percent 
ask the average person what kind of job he or she thinks 
politicians are doing and the answer might well be unprintable 
with more women in the field maybe that will change

the flint mich journal on homelessness 
soon the last vestiges of indian summer will vanish 
and thus inside our homes shut off from the snow and cold we 
will breathe in the fine aroma of wellcooked meals 
theres nothing quite like home sweet home but sadly for a 
growing number of americans young and old no such place exists 
they have no home no fireplace no closet no oven not even a 
bed to call their own for them home is a box or a tent or a car 
or an abandoned home or for short periods shelters 
with the us economy sliding ever deeper in recession millions 
more are teetering on the edge of homelessness 
some of these people are as ordinary as our friends or 
neighbors all they need is a good paying job and a couple of 
breaks to return them to their feet others are people whose lives 
have been torn for any of a wide variety of reasons including 
problems they inflicted upon themselves 
still they are people brothers and sisters in this special 
relationship we call humanity 
as a society we must do a much better job of creating public 
private and charitable strategies to address this complicated 
problem 
but as a civilized people as a caring people we cannot wait 
for these strategies to be implemented and succeed we must do what 
we can now as individuals to help those in need all around us 
and so we urge you to help area shelters and food banks donate 
what you can and volunteer your time

the kenosha wis news on the airline industrys woes 
one of the first economic sectors to suffer the effects of the 
dawning recession is the airline industry thanks to saddam 
hussein the price of jet fuel has risen 70 percent since early 
august more than 10000 airline employees have been laid off 
ridership is down and likely to fall further yearly losses are 
estimated at a record 1 billion some wellknown carriers teeter 
on the brink of bankruptcy 
so in its new budget congress did to this essential industry 
what congress does best it raised the industrys taxes and user 
fees almost 14 billion congress blithely assumed that these costs 
could be passed on to consumers but the industry says competitive 
pressures combined with the general weakness of airtravel 
business make this impossible 
industry leaders have gone to transportation secretary sam 
skinner seeking relief perhaps by relaxing rules on foreign 
investment or delaying ticket taxes theyre entitled to it and 
not in the name of some industrial policy in which the 
government manipulates the market to help favored industries at 
this critical moment the airline industry and the millions of 
consumers who depend on it dont need government protection they 
need protection from government

willie nelson is broke the revenooers from washington have 
swooped down on willie to the tune of 167 million they say he 
owes uncle sam in back taxes 
now willie is really a nice guy he was the country music star 
who back awhile staged those concerts that raised funds to help 
struggling farmers stave off foreclosure and bankruptcies 
but fortunately he has friends and one of them annetta white 
has a solution to willies problem we should all send a dollar 
to willie aid and with those dollars willie she says could 
pay off those troublesome tax men 
now if we all do as annetta suggests its a safe bet willie 
would find his present stay in hawaii a bit more relaxing 
and when you millions of americans send those dollar bills 
dont forget jimmy swaggart and jim bakker

the times of india on japan 
important winds of change are blowing over japan today with the 
accession to the throne of the new emperor akihito the resurgence 
of japanese militarism which historically has been associated with 
royalist rule has again become an issue 
mr kaifu favours the participation of a japanese military 
contingent in the gulf alongside western partners he has been 
pressured to adopt this view by the us but it is clear that tokyo 
itself has fewer reservations than ever before about flexing its 
longdormant military muscle just as emperor akihitos 
accession to what is seen as divine status is a generational change 
at the apex it may be only a short while before a new japanese 
generation with only faint memories of world war ii or the earlier 
interwar period feels that the resurgence of japanese militarism 
is but the natural complement of its exceptional economic 
might

the herald of harare zimbabwe on the gulf crisis 
war is now inevitable in the persian gulf if only because the 
foreign forces have to seek justification for having been deployed 
there in the first place 
president george bush whose country already has the largest 
single foreign force in the gulf has just ordered a further 
buildup 
two weeks ago the americans and the saudis streamlined the chain 
of command of their forces should war break out with iraq many saw 
this as one more step in the direction of armed confrontation 
the american administration is under severe pressure at home to 
do something now before the all too familiar campaign to bring 
our boys back home gains momentum 
mr bush smarting from a midterm election disaster now has the 
time to devote his energy to the gulf crisis but he and president 
saddam hussein more than anybody else have burned their bridges 
in a diplomatic game whose end result has all the potential for a 
devastating conflict

el pais of madrid on the first anniversary of the murder of 
jesuit priests in el salvador 
the military chiefs who planned and ordered the action dont 
even appear as suspects the judge handling the case has been and 
remains incapable of sitting all those responsible in the dock 
the blame lies with among others the government of the extreme 
rightist president alfredo cristiani which far from fulfilling its 
promise to solve the crime has dragged its feet and even put 
stumbling blocks in the way of the judicial investigation 
the scandal is of such magnitude that the government of the 
united states has reduced its military aid to el salvador by 50 
percent other governments like the government of spain less 
able to impose material sanctions have put considerable moral 
pressure on the central american nation without much success 
either 
in the end it is not so much a question of finding and 
punishing those guilty of a repulsive crime as it is of a country 
demonstrating that it is capable of functioning like a civilized 
society that follows the rule of law

financial times of london on the soviet union 
the soviet crisis deepens by the day hunger possibly 
famine is facing the soviet union as the snows of winter cover 
fields of rotting crops oil production is falling sharply and 
the problem of delivering oil and gas is compounded by 
disintegrating pipelines and a chaotic transport system what 
we are witnessing is the accelerating collapse of political and 
economic structures this is happening in a country where the 
destruction of civil society over 70 years has fatally weakened the 
countrys capacity to react creatively to the new freedoms suddenly 
granted it all that is clear at this stage is that the 
transition from communism is going to be much longer much harder 
and much more expensive than imagined over a year ago to achieve 
it peacefully could cost the west as much effort and treasure as 
the cold war whose demise we celebrate in paris this week this is 
the probable scale of the challenge ahead

president bush headed to the persian gulf today 
saying he will tell us troops they are not there on a mission 
impossible and declaring the soviets support his tough stand 
against iraqs saddam hussein 
departing a european security summit for a thanksgiving day 
visit with us forces in the middle east bush said any 
differences with the soviet union on the persian gulf are 
extraordinarily minor 
he said he and gorbachev see eye to eye on the subject 
despite the soviet leaders reluctance to issue a public 
declaration of support for a united nations resolution authorizing 
the use of force to evict iraqs occupying forces 
bush was en route to saudi arabia when the white house announced 
he would return to europe on friday to meet with syrian president 
hafez assad the meeting in geneva will center on the persian gulf 
relations with syria a hardline arab state considered by the 
state department to be a sponsor of international terrorism have 
warmed since it joined the usled coalition against iraq last 
august 
bush spoke in paris just before the soviet leader issued a call 
for an immediate meeting of the united nations security council to 
address a very dangerous situation in the persian gulf and 
take a decision there 
we cant just leave things this way without giving them closer 
analysis the soviet leader added 
asked if the un might act this month bush said stay tuned 
theres certainly a chance 
bushs first stop in the middle east was in jiddah for a meeting 
with the exiled emir of kuwait next was a nearmidnight dinner

800 trash collectors fearing for their safety were on strike for a 
fourth straight day to demand protection from authorities 
in other violence around cape town a black man was found dead 
near railway tracks late tuesday apparently after jumping from a

a spate of guerrilla attacks 
against the army abruptly halted today but president alfredo 
cristiani said the fighting could derail peace talks 
fighting broke out in half of el salvadors 14 provinces on 
tuesday beginning early in the day and leaving at least 27 people 
dead and 141 wounded officials said 
but the country appeared to be returning to normal this morning 
despite sporadic exchanges of gunfire on the outskirts of the 
northern provincial capital of chalatenango 30 miles north of the 
capital 
in the eastern provincial capital of usulutan where some of 
tuesdays heaviest fighting took place buses were returning to the 
streets and women were setting up market stalls today with no 
gunfire in earshot 
electricity still had not returned to usulutan 60 miles east of 
san salvador nor to most of eastern el salvador 
the farabundo marti national liberation front the rebel 
organization also known as fmln denied it had launched an 
offensive it said the attacks aimed to prod cristianis government 
back to the negotiating table 
government and rebel representatives have held five rounds of 
talks since may negotiations were to resume nov 4 in mexico but 
bogged down over bitterly differing positions on the future role of 
the armed forces it is time to say enough to the fmln this 
cannot be called military action since most of those affected are 
civilians cristiani said in a radiotv speech late tuesday 
its a new terrorist offensive 
the only thing these actions do is endanger the negotiating 
process since violence engenders violence and will not provide the 
flexible and rational conditions needed to end the bloodshed he 
added 
more than 73000 people have been killed nearly half of them 
civilians since the civil war began in october 1979 many have 
been slain by death squads linked to the military who suspected 
them of leftist sympathies 
the rebels say they are willing to demobilize and join the 
political process only if the current armed forces are disbanded a 
demand the government refuses to entertain 
congress has slashed el salvadors 85 million annual military 
aid in half for 1991 to prod the negotiations along it stipulated 
that aid would be restored if the rebels launched an offensive and 
cut off altogether if the cristiani government balked at further 
talks 
a rebel communique shortly after the attacks were launched said 
the fmln could launch an allout offensive if the government does 
not return to the negotiating table soon 
fmlns action followed the first anniversary of the armys 
massacre of six jesuit priests their housekeeper and her teenage 
daughter on nov 16 1989 during a rebel offensive in the capital 
the guerrillas international human rights groups and us 
congressional investigators say the armed forces murder and torture 
political opponents and are corrupt 
defense minister col rene emilio ponce warned in a radiotv 
message tuesday night the rebels were likely to intensify their 
attacks he said a total of 25 people were killed and 126 wounded 
in the fighting 
ponce said 12 government soldiers were killed and 76 wounded 
and 10 guerrillas were killed and an undetermined number injured 
he said civilian casualties amounted to three dead and 50 wounded 
a telephone survey of hospitals first aid centers military 
officers in the field and town officials provided the casualty 
figures earlier tuesday showing that at least 27 were killed and 
141 wounded 
one military airplane and three small civilian planes were 
destroyed by rebel gunfire at the main air base on the outskirts of 
the capital ponce said 
guerrilla sabotage damaged electrical installations and power 
lines affecting about twothirds of this central american nation of 
more than 55 million people the government electrical company 
said

a former cia official says the united states 
is very close to getting indictments against the terrorists who 
bombed pan am flight 103 and it also has evidence that iran was 
responsible for the disaster 
us officials investigating the december 1988 bombing over 
scotland had initially suspected that members of the syrianbased 
palestine front for the liberation of palestinegeneral command 
were responsible 
but vincent m cannistraro who retired two months ago as chief 
of operations and analysis at the cias counter terrorism center 
said the pflpgc guerrillas abandoned the project at the last 
minute after a police raid on their safehouses near frankfurt 
cannistraro said the job was taken over by libyan agents who 
planted the highly sophisticated semtex explosives in the forward 
hold of the plane and timed them to go off soon after takeoff from 
frankfurt 
cannistraro said the pan am bombing was ordered by the 
government of iran in retaliation for the accidental downing of an 
iranian passenger jet over the persian gulf in july 1988 by the uss 
vincennes 
the scheme was known by irans top leadership including the 
countrys current president hashemi rafsanjani 
most of the 270 people killed by the blast were americans and 
the united states has been seeking sufficient evidence for 
indictments that would stand up in a court of law 
cannistraro taking the unusual step of speaking to reporters 
soon after leaving the agency said investigators had made great 
progress in determining how the bomb was placed on board and by 
whom he did not elaborate 
but he added the indictments wont make much difference 
because the perpetrators probably are beyond the reach of us 
law 
cia spokesman mark mansfield declined to address the substance 
of cannistraros remarks hes a retired agency officer who is 
entitled to express his own opinion mansfield said 
cannistraro has been sharply critical of the administration as 
being too timid in its handling of international terrorism he 
spoke at a luncheon sponsored by the national strategy information 
center inc a private group concerned primarily with soviet 
intelligence activities 
cannistraro also said there is some evidence that iraq was 
involved in the assassination last month of egypts parliamentary 
speaker though the attack probably was carried out by the small 
islamic jihad movement in the country 
he said iraq is casing american military installations in 
the middle east as possible terrorist targets if war breaks out in 
the persian gulf 
i dont believe the iraqis are going to unleash that 
capability against the americans at this time he said but 
they are certainly preparing themselves positioning themselves to 
do so once the situation changes 
a specialist on the middle east cannistraro also served as a 
special assistant for intelligence at the defense department and as 
director of intelligence programs at the national security council 
he said iraq is providing weapons money and information to 
various groups including one headed by palestinian radical abul 
abbas as well as the iraqibacked arab liberation front 
cannistraro said most terrorist incidents are sponsored by four 
countries iran iraq libya and syria in trying to avert 
bloodshed he said we are unsuccessful more than we are 
successful

fear takes a seat at the nations thanksgiving tables on 
thursday ushered in by rumblings of imminent war in a distant 
desert 
the fragile veneer of hope for a peaceful settlement in the 
persian gulf has all but shattered as the conflict drags into the 
holiday season with 230000 us servicemen and women in the 
region and hundreds of americans held hostage in iraq and occupied 
kuwait 
at home americans cope with frayed nerves growing uncertainty 
and the pain of separation through protest prayer and patriotism 
but patience is wearing thin 
if saddam hussein will move back out of there like everybodys 
been telling him to we can maybe get back to a normal life weve 
said a prayer for that to happen said frank atchison a missouri 
national guard mess sergeant whose poplar bluff detachment has yet 
to be activated his son 1st lt frank darrell atchison leads the 
1221st transportation company which was called up this week along 
with 15091 other reservists from 35 states 
i dont want any fathers sons to be in war the elder 
atchison said keeping a firm grip on the infant car seat holding 
his granddaughter morgan 1 monthold on thanksgiving ill give 
thanks if we dont have a war 
fear that the united states is moving too quickly toward war has 
chipped away at support for president bushs policy only half of 
americans surveyed recently approved of the deployment of troops to 
the middle east down from 75 percent shortly after saddams aug 2 
invasion of kuwait 
the cbs newsnew york times poll found half of americans expect 
the united states to fight iraq and they are not happy about the 
prospect 
protesters have marched in places like fargo nd held peace 
vigils in new haven conn and richmond ind and poured oil and 
simulated blood over a mound of sand in front of san franciscos 
presidio 
i think as long as the president is beating the war drums and 
not wanting to have a full discussion of this in congress people 
are getting angrier and angrier said frances crow a 71yearold 
quaker among those gathered at the gates of westover air force base 
in massachusetts 
anger mingled with sadness and a feeling of helplessness have 
overshadowed the usual joy of the season for some hostage families 
i havent even thought about thanksgiving said kim edwards 
of carson city nev whose husband tony is trapped in baghdad 
i should be out shopping and doing stuff but what can you do i 
just dont have any enthusiasm for celebrating 
sally martindales older brother thomas gordon had been 
planning to stay in kuwait during this years holidays teaching 
english to members of that countrys air force in august he 
became a hostage 
all along ive been thinking hed be home for halloween now 
its thanksgiving and a week from now ill probably be thinking 
christmas said martindale of curtis mich it will definitely 
put a damper on our holidays but we always have that hope 
some families and friends of desert shield soldiers are keeping 
the blues at bay by honoring absent loved ones in small ways like 
the place setting at the empty seat at darla dicks thanksgiving 
table in camden nj 
my husband told me to make sure they set a plate for him and 
to eat both plates said mrs dick whose husband gregory left 
for the gulf two weeks ago with a reserve unit of course were 
all going to miss him but we know his heart and soul are with us 
and that helps a lot 
mothers like marge panny of green creek nj chase away fear 
with routine keeping life as normal as possible for her sons 
eric 8 and michael 5 while their father sgt 1st class edward 
panny is away 
i dont think the reality of it has set in yet for the older 
one mrs panny said weve been telling him for so long that 
daddys going to be away but i dont think its going to hit him 
until thursday 
for michael a telephone call from saudi arabia on tuesday was 
an early present tuesday was the first day of a week of free calls 
home from us troops at atampts expense 
michael is deaf but he knew his father was on the other end of 
the line as his mother signed i love you 
his face lit up like a christmas tree mrs panny said he 
was signing away saying its daddy its daddy

prime minister margaret thatcher said today she 
will battle to retain her leadership against her most serious 
political challenge since taking office in 1979 
i fight on i fight to win mrs thatcher said as she left 
her office at 10 downing st for the house of commons where a 
second vote on the leadership of the ruling conservative party is 
scheduled for next week 
mrs thatcher suffered a resounding defeat tuesday when she 
failed to stop a party leadership challenge by former defense 
minister michael heseltine in the first round of voting among 
conservative lawmakers 
the prime minister spent nearly 75 minutes in the house of 
commons fielding questions after her brief report on the 34nation 
summit on european security which she attended monday and tuesday 
when paddy ashdown leader of the small liberal democratic 
party suggested mrs thatcher was in the twilight days of her 
premiership mrs thatcher responded 
the first 11 years havent been so bad with regard to 
twilight please remember there are 24 hours in a day 
mrs thatcher also met today with conservative leaders to assess 
her chances 
with mrs thatcher weakened politically and her longgoverning 
party severely split the opposition labor party leading in 
opinion polls is scenting victory 
i think people are far more likely to switch from her to 
michael heseltine than the other way around said conservative 
lawmaker timothy raison who abstained on the first round 
party leaders including chairman kenneth baker and chief whip 
timothy renton met with mrs thatcher this afternoon renton the 
partys chief vote counter in parliament presumably gave mrs 
thatcher his view on her support 
lord whitelaw a former deputy prime minister and a senior 
figure in the party also visited 10 downing st it was not 
immediately known what they told her 
mrs thatcher europes longestserving prime minister fell 
just short of the 15 percent margin she needed to avoid a second 
round of voting 
she received receiving 204 votes to 152 for heseltine in the 
secret ballot with 16 lawmakers abstaining 
conservative party legislators who hold 372 seats in the 
650seat house of commons will vote for a second time next 
tuesday and mrs thatcher would be expected to step down as prime 
minister if she does does not emerge victorious 
rumors that mrs thatcher would resign pushed up the british 
pound on currency exchanges late today dealers said 
the times of london today reported strong speculation among 
legislators that senior tories would try to persuade the 
strongwilled mrs thatcher to reverse her decision to fight a 
second round 
mrs thatcher who was in paris for the 34nation summit on 
european security is expected on thursday to lead the debate on 
the motion of no confidence proposed by opposition labor party 
leader neil kinnock 
heseltine could win the leadership by picking up the 16 votes 
that abstained on tuesday and persuading 19 of mrs thatchers 
supporters to change sides 
other candidates have until noon thursday to join the race 
in the second round a simple majority can win but other 
candidates now are free to join the race if necessary a third and 
final ballot would be held nov 29 
mrs thatcher 65 has recently suffered a great loss in 
popularity in part because of a new per capita local services tax 
that demands the same fee of prince and pauper alike 
her government also has been blamed for high inflation and high 
interest rates the conservatives have trailed labor in opinion 
polls for 16 months 
heseltine 57 also has criticized mrs thatchers reluctance to 
fully integrate britain into the european community 
she became prime minister when the conservatives won the 1979 
general election and is now in her third term 
the next general election must be held by mid1992 at the latest 
but the prime minister of the day can call one any time before 
then 
if he becomes prime minister heseltine has pledged to 
substitute what he calls caring capitalism for mrs thatchers 
austere free market policies 
in addition he has focused on her lone opposition among 
european common market leaders to closer political and financial 
unity in the community 
heseltine has also promised to review the new per capita tax 
which sparked antitory riots in london and elsewhere this year 
heseltine resigned as defense secretary in 1986 in a fight over 
rival merits of european and us rescue packages for the westland 
helicopter company

rhetorical excess is no stranger in the us 
senate but it still seemed a little out of place to find mother 
teresas name coming up this week in defense of the keating five 
dennis deconcini one of the five senators invoked her name as 
he held nothing back in an impassioned defense against allegations 
of misconduct in behalf of savingsandloan owner charles h 
keating jr 
mother teresa the nobel peace prize winner for her selfless 
work on behalf of the worlds poor might seem a far cry from 
keating who has become a symbol for some of the sampl scandals 
but the two are linked the arizona democrat told the senate 
ethics committee keating who gave substantial political 
contributions to each of the five senators also contributed to 
mother teresas cause he said 
so much so deconcini said that when he had occasion to meet 
her once in 1986 and told her he was from arizona also keatings 
home state the first thing she said how is my friend charlie 
keating 
deconcini was trying to make the point that keating was well 
thought of just a short time ago at the time the senators 
intervened with federal banking regulators on his behalf 
robert s bennett the ethics panels special counsel couldnt 
resist the opening left to him 
when deconcini and a roomful of lawyers had finally finished 
bennett rose to discuss with the committee the order of witnesses 
he intended to call first would come an aide to one of the 
senators 
and then he began mother teresa 
he slapped his hand on the table top no just kidding he 
wouldnt call mother teresa to verify the story

its often said that the ethics panels hearings amount to a 
public trial for the five senators 
it would be more accurate to say there are two trials for each 
of the senators one before their peers and two the trial before 
a public audience 
the hearings which have recessed until monday are being 
carried live on the cspan cable television network 
everyone in the large senate hearing room is mindful of the

some 20000 children live in orphanages in the 
russian republic and most suffer from neurological disabilities 
caused by pollution alcoholism malnutrition and poverty a 
newspaper reported wednesday 
trud the trade union newspaper said many of the children 
living in 274 orphanages in russia were abandoned by their parents 
russia is the largest of the 15 soviet republics 
the newspaper said almost threequarters of the children had 
problems with their central nervous systems but it did not specify 
what the disabilities were or elaborate 
trud said 65 percent of the children at one unidentified moscow 
orphanage had parents who lived elsewhere but abandoned them after 
deciding its going to be better this way 
one woman ran away from the maternity home right after her 
child was born when the police found her she explained that this 
was her sixth child that her husband is held in custody and that 
she has no money to pay the rent the newspaper said 
so she wrote an application asking the orphanage to accept her 
child for at least three years 
trud said it costs the government about 18 a day to keep a 
child in an orphanage it said that when a woman who placed her 
child in an orphanage learned of the cost she exclaimed if the 
state could give us this money wed never have parted with our 
son

president bush will meet friday in 
switzerland with syrian president hafez assad to discuss the 
persian gulf crisis the white house announced today 
bush will fly to geneva for the twohour meeting following a 
thanksgiving day visit with us troops and a stop in cairo for 
talks with egyptian president hosni mubarak said presidential 
spokesman marlin fitzwater 
fitzwater said the iraqi occupation of kuwait was the focus of 
the meeting but that the plight of us hostages in captivity in 
lebanon also would be discussed 
it will be the first meeting between a us and syrian president 
since jimmy carter met assad in geneva in 1977 
syria is a hardline arab state accused by the state department 
of sponsoring international terrorism and suppressing human rights 
but relations have warmed since syria joined the usled 
coalition against iraq last august 
the syrians have promised to send 15000 troops to join the 
international force deployed in saudi arabia and secretary of 
state james baker visited syria last month to discuss its role in 
the coalition 
as a result of contacts between the governments of the united 
states and syria it has been agreed that president george bush and 
president hafez assad will hold a meeting in geneva on nov 23 
1990 said a statement issued aboard air force one as it took 
bush to saudi arabia bush spent three days in paris at a 34nation 
summit on european security 
a similar statement was issued by the syrian government in 
damascus 
diplomatic sources in damascus noted that the summit which they 
said was requested by the white house revives hope that the ordeal 
of the western hostages who include six americans might be 
heading toward an end 
an editorial in the syrian government newspaper tishrin earlier 
this month linked the release of hostages held by proiranian 
extremists in lebanon to britain and the united states improving 
ties with syria 
the hostages in addition to the americans are four britons 
two germans and an italian 
the longestheld of these captives is american journalist terry 
anderson 43 who was kidnapped march 16 1985 
the two presidents will discuss a number of international and 
regional issues the joint syrianus statement said 
speaking to reporters aboard the plane fitzwater said the 
main purpose of the meeting is to discuss the situation in the 
gulf 
he said the meeting was arranged by a number of us allies 
specifically egypt and turkey they thought it should happen 
he said 
bush was originally scheduled to return to washington directly 
from cairo friday evening he will now be returning in the early 
hours of saturday fitzwater said 
fitzwater also said efforts were made for bush to meet with 
jordans king hussein in paris but that the monarch said he 
couldnt come 
but jordan which shown sympathy for iraq in the gulf crisis 
blamed bush 
the royal palace in amman announced monday that bush had 
indefinitely postponed a meeting with hussein which was scheduled 
to be held in paris on tuesday 
government sources said bush postponed the meeting after hussein 
accused the united states last saturday of a double standard in its 
relationship with iraq 
the king said that by condemning iraq for invading kuwait but 
supporting israel which occupied other arab lands the united 
states was guilty of blatant and shameless conduct 
ties between washington and damascus have steadily improved 
since assads government joined the usled international alliance 
against iraqs saddam hussein after his invasion of kuwait on 
aug2 
it was the first time in almost two decades that washington and 
damascus have agreed on a conflict in the middle east until then 
syria had been a staunch critic of us middle east policy mainly 
because of washingtons support of israel 
british prime minister margaret thatchers government however 
has refused to reward damascus for its stance on the gulf crisis 
anglosyrian ties were severed four years ago after britain 
announced that it had conclusive evidence that syria was behind an 
attempt to blow up an israeli jetliner at heathrow airport in april 
1986 
relations further deteriorated after a syrianbased radical 
group the popular front for the liberation of palestinegeneral 
command was implicated in the pan am explosion over lockerbie 
scotland on dec 21 1988 in which 270 people were killed

stemmed from a disagreement with gang members 
the youth died tuesday at a hospital where gang members took him 
monday night police said 
authorities said ruedas is the third person involved with the 
same gang to die this year 
the boys mother frances ruedas said the only way her son

death she said

area where police said the initiation ceremony occurred he was 
being held in lieu of 40000 bail on a charge of aggravated 
assault filed before ruedas died police were discussing upgrading

golfing gangsters have become the bane of japans 
genteel country clubs and one association of course owners has 
decided to do something about the flowers of evil that spoil our 
greens 
theyve promised to bar japans tattooed men a euphemism 
for gangsters who have been increasingly drawn to the expensive 
and highstatus world of japanese golf 
we will not allow gangsters to join our clubs not allow them 
on our courses and we will not allow people with tattoos in our 
showers says a pamphlet by the council to rid chiba golf courses 
of gangsters 
the council claims as members all 108 country clubs in chiba 
prefecture a state on tokyos eastern border 
i believe it has been an effective part of our anticrime 
efforts said council executive mikiji komatsu 
he said a new edition of the 20page pamphlet was published last 
month after an enthusiastic response to the original printing two 
years ago about 30000 copies have been printed 
so how do you spot a gangster with his shirt on 
most of them drive expensive foreign cars and are surrounded 
by bodyguards or underlings the pamphlet says they wear their 
hair in tight short curls or have shaved heads and wear 
sunglasses 
part of the little finger on their left hand is missing if 
they are missing any other fingers you can assume that is because 
of an accident and does not indicate they are gangsters to hide 
their tatoos they wear longsleeved shirts even in the summer 
the brightly colored tattoos often covering most of their 
torsos are a trademark of japanese gangsters who often cut off 
sections of their fingers to show devotion to their boss 
besides golfing for relaxation and amusement the gangsters have 
used the courses as a setting for highstakes illegal gambling 
police say at least one gangrelated murder has been reported on a 
golf course 
course operators fear mobsters can lead to a bad reputation for 
the course and lower the value of memberships which can approach 
1 million at the most prestigious tokyo clubs 
nonmembers can pay up to 250 for 18 holes at some courses 
the pamphlet also explains what kind of tricks gangsters use to 
make golf reservations without divulging their backgrounds 
its cartoonstyle illustrations show scarfaced thugs 
flowers of evil that spoil our greens clubbing innocent 
golfers while course workers telephone the police 
manners are important in the sport of golf it says 
please help us create a bright environment on the courses free 
of violence 
police estimate that japan has about 90000 gangsters which are 
known as yakuza meaning good for nothing they often keep a 
high profile operate out of wellmarked offices and wear lapel 
pins to denote their gang membership 
for decades their appearance on golf courses was looked upon as 
an unavoidable evil 
but while golf courses take action against the gangs police 
have made little progress in uprooting the underworld 
authorities believe the gangs have reacted to increased outside 
pressure by consolidating their forces creating huge syndicates 
that rake in an estimated 9 billion each year on gambling 
extortion drugs and other illegal activities 
yoshinori watanabe head of the nearly 30000member 
yamaguchigumi japans largest gang was convicted of assault last 
year for a fight on a golf course in 1984 he was given a suspended 
sentence and continues to be a devoted duffer 
other gangland golfers boast they regularly travel to hawaii or 
guam to pursue their sport 
the chiba golf course owners council formed in 1986 is one of 
a growing number of grassroots organizations that have teamed up 
with police to rid gangsters from their neighborhoods or 
businesses 
the movement began after problems with gambling of hundreds of 
millions of yen and even a murder 1985 in the southern japanese 
city of fukuoka on golf courses in other prefectures were 
reported said a chiba police official our efforts are 
preventative and we think they have worked 
while there has not been a great increase in arrests fewer 
gangsters are being allowed onto courses resulting in less 
disturbances for regular golfers according to the official who 
spoke on condition of anonymity 
weve been telling our younger members not to take showers at 
the clubs said the boss of one tokyobased gang in a recent 
interview we dont want to frighten the regular members

leaders from east and west on wednesday buried the 
cold war uniting for the first time in solemn commitment to 
democracy and vowing to combat the economic hardships that threaten 
to divide europe anew 
the signing of the paris charter by the united states canada 
and all european nations except albani was a victory for the 
unheralded millions who fought tyranny and violence in europes 
troubled past 
but it posed new challenges for the newly united northern 
hemisphere whose leaders left paris without consensus on action in 
the persian gulf crisis 
president bush flew to saudi arabia without soviet president 
mikhail s gorbachevs backing for a united nations resolution 
sanctioning the use of force to get iraq out of kuwait 
gorbachev meanwhile won pledges of food and other aid to help 
his reforms survive the rigors of winter but neither he nor east 
european leaders came away with any guarantees that the west will 
help ease mounting ethnic and social strife 
seated around a threedimensional map of europe and north 
america the 34 leaders took 15 minutes to sign into history their 
commitment to free elections the rule of law and a market economy 
french president francois mitterrand host of the threeday 
summit was the first to sign the red leatherbound document 
helmut kohl attending his first summit as leader of a united 
germany was second followed by bush 
the era of confrontation and division in europe has ended 
the charter declared europe whole and free is calling for a new 
beginning 
bush said we are closing a chapter in history the cold war 
is over 
to cement their new unity the leaders agreed to meet again in 
helsinki in 1992 their foreign ministers will gather in berlin 
next year meeting annually after that senior officials will meet 
even more often 
the charter established a small office in prague to run the 
process known as the conference on security and cooperation in 
europe csce it also set up a vienna center for the prevention of 
conflict and an office in warsaw to monitor free elections 
the only european states that have not yet held free balloting 
are the yugoslav republics of serbia and montenegro which vote 
dec 9 and albania where elections still dominated by the ruling 
communists are due in february 
albania was limited to observer status at the summit because of 
its isolationist policies and lack of political reform 
the conference charter exulted in the end of cold war tensions 
ours is a time for fulfilling the hopes and expectations our 
peoples cherished for decades steadfast commitment to democracy 
based on human rights and fundamental freedoms prosperity through 
economic liberty and social justice and equal security for all our 
countries it declared 
concluding the summit mitterrand spoke about the global bonds 
forged by the charter and the challenges confronting the nations 
if it is true that a shot fired on the soil of europe echoes 
in a canadian forest then it is also true that any wave born in 
the pacific breaks on our continents shores he said 
everything has to be rethought mitterrand said no 
institution will escape this critical reexamination the european 
community nato the council of europe 
at the summit opening monday leaders from the north atlantic 
treaty organization and the crumbling warsaw pact signed an accord 
scrapping vast arsenals of tanks guns and other weapons 
the two military alliances also signed a nonaggression pact and 
measures allowing europes armies to know more about each than ever 
before 
east european leaders suggested in paris that it is only a 
matter of time before the warsaw pact disbands hungarian premier 
joszef antall host of a warsaw pact next month said he wants the 
alliance dissolved by 1992 
nato leaders have clung firm to their alliance without saying 
how it might accommodate the security needs of newly democratic 
eastern europe or save the tax dollars of western citizens 
europe faces long soulsearching on economic unity both on the 
continent and across the atlantic the united states and canada are 
currently at loggerheads with the ec over its massive subsidies to 
farmers 
the yawning gap in living standards between the rich west and 
poor east also threatens stability united nations officials 
estimate as many as 25 million citizens of the former east bloc 
want to emigrate in search of wealth and stability 
there must now be no borders which perpetuate the prosperity 
divide said kohl germany is expected to be a key source of 
western economic largesse to the east 
another potential peril are ethnic tensions breeding fierce 
nationalism and threatening the postworld war ii borders sealed in 
the 1975 helsinki final act which launched the csce process 
czechoslovakia yugoslavia and especially the soviet union face 
ethnic disputes 
political frictions also impinged on the summit french premier 
michel rocard survived a confidence vote monday night but 
britains margaret thatcher was forced tuesday into a second round 
in a damaging contest for leadership of her conservative party 
there was a general feeling of sadness for her and good wishes 
from everyone there said canadas brian mulroney

junk bond financier michael milken was sentenced 
today to 10 years in prison for breaking federal securities and tax 
laws in the most celebrated case of financial corruption in wall 
street history 
milken who sobbed at points during the sentencing stood with 
his head down as us district judge kimba wood pronounced the 
stiffest punishment yet in the fraud scandals that have gripped 
wall street since the mid1980s 
in addition she sentenced him to three years probation during 
which he must work 1800 hours a year in community service 
milken 44 faced a maximum of 28 years but woods sentence is 
far stiffer than many had predicted he must serve at least 
onethird of his prison term before he can be considered for 
release 
i believe that a prison term is required for the purposes of 
general deterrence wood told a court crammed with 200 
spectators including many of milkens friends and supporters 
wood said milkens misuse of his leadership position constituted 
serious crimes warranting serious punishment and the discomfort 
of being removed from society 
she said milken was a man of talent and industry but that a 
long prison term was required to send a message to other possible 
securitieslaw violators 
the judge said she considered evidence of additional crimes 
including obstruction of justice by milken in handing down the 
sentence 
he was ordered to begin his sentence march 4 1991 no federal 
prison was designated 
the sentence capped the long tumultuous saga of the former 
drexel burnham lambert inc executive who was first implicated in 
an aggressive government insider trading investigation by 
speculator ivan boesky in 1986 
milken of encino calif personally made more than 1 billion 
through a junk bond empire that altered american corporate finance 
in the 1980s 
sobbing at times during the 90minute hearing he told the 
judge what i did violated not just the law but all of my 
principles and values and i will regret it for the rest of my life 
i am truly sorry 
before wood issued the sentence milkens attorney arthur liman 
asked her to consider the financiers more than 360 million in 
charitable contributions and other acts of generosity 
he will never repeat his mistakes he is a changed person 
liman said 
assistant us attorney jess fardella countered that despite 
his talents and opportunities mr milken sought to multiply his 
success through the vehicle of fraud 
milken pleaded guilty in april to six counts of conspiracy and 
fraud related to illegal securities trading after denying a much 
broader array of accusations 
none of the charges involved insider trading or junk bonds the 
risky debt securities milken turned into a tool for capital raising 
and corporate takeovers 
as part of his plea bargain milken also agreed to pay 600 
million in fines and restitution to defrauded investors the 
largest penalty against an individual in us history 
the wall street fraud probe revealed seamy pockets of corruption 
at top firms during major investment deals and resulted in about 50 
indictments 
boesky by comparison was sentenced to three years in prison 
and penalized 100 million after pleading guilty to one criminal 
count of lying to federal regulators he served 18 months in 
prison 
before he was sentenced milken wrote an 11page letter to wood 
apologizing for his crimes and asking for a chance to rebuild his 
life by performing community service 
i never dreamed i could do anything that would result in being 
a felon milken wrote but i did break the law i was wrong 
and no matter how sorry i am i have to accept that fact 
wood delayed sentencing originally scheduled for oct 1 for a 
hearing into government charges of additional crimes beyond 
milkens guilty plea 
prosecutors revealed that drexel paid milken a total of 11 
billion from 1984 to 1987 including 550 million the final year 
that 550 million paycheck put him in the guinness book of world 
records 
drexel in february filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection 
the firm was hurt by its 1989 guilty plea to six felonies its 
agreement to pay 650 million in penalties and the collapse of the 
junk bond market 
regulators have pinned much of the blame for the savings and 
loan crisis on drexel accusing it of plundering sampls through its 
junk bond practices

on the eve of a thanksgivingday 
trip to the front lines president bush conferred with arab leaders 
on the threemonth standoff against iraq he said the 230000 
american troops on saudi soil were not on a mission impossible 
after a fiveandahalf hour flight from paris bush stepped 
from air force one into the warm humid saudi evening at this red 
sea port and was greeted by king fahd he was to meet privately 
with the exiled emir of kuwait 
on thursday bush and his wife barbara will share thanksgiving 
with servicemen and servicewomen at two desert military sites in 
saudi arabia and on a navy ship in the persian gulf 
if i do nothing else i will convey to them the heartfelt 
thanks of the american people at this very special time of year for 
americans bush said 
he told reporters he would tell the troops that we are going 
to prevail that theyre not there on a mission impossible 
earlier wednesday bush told reporters in paris that he and 
mikhail s gorbachev now see eye to eye on the crisis even 
though the soviet presidents public statements have reflected a 
greater reluctance to use military force 
the president reportedly is seeking support for a un security 
council resolution authorizing military force against saddam if he 
does not leave kuwait by a certain date 
french president francois mitterrand said in paris wednesday 
that the un resolution against iraq would likely be adopted 
within three weeks 
the white house also announced wednesday that bush will meet 
syrian president hafez alassad in geneva on friday on his way 
home 
the two presidents will discuss a number of international and 
regional issues said a short statement issued as bush flew here 
aboard air force one from paris where he had attended a european 
summit 
presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater said the iraqi 
occupation of kuwait was the focus of the meeting but that the 
plight of us hostages in captivity in lebanon also would be 
discussed 
the meeting was expected to last several hours following talks 
in cairo with egyptian president hosni mubarak 
although the united states still considers syria a terrorist 
state the president agreed to the first meeting between leaders of 
the two countries in 13 years because of syrias importance in the 
coalition trying to pry iraq from kuwait fitzwater said 
syria has contributed about 5000 troops to the usled 
military operation confronting saddam across the kuwait and iraq 
borders 
although fitzwater said that the visit did not imply a change in 
us condemnation of syria for terrorist activities an 
administration official travelling with the president said we 
think theres opportunity to move ahead on other issues once the 
crisis is behind us 
fitzwater also disclosed that bush while in paris had tried to 
arrange a separate meeting with lebanons king hussein but that 
hussein couldnt come 
in paris bush attended a threeday 34nation summit meeting on 
ending cold war tensions in europe 
 
the following material embargoed for 6 pm est 
 
in a prerecorded thanksgiving message to us troops broadcast 
on armed forces radio worldwide beginning wednesday evening the 
president said 
you know barbara and i have spent a lot of thanksgivings with 
a family were proud of well this year is no different as we 
spend thanksgiving in the persian gulf 
and as americans celebrate this special day back home know 
that you are in their hearts america is proud of you and the job 
youre doing 
 
end embargoed material 
 
bush already has dispatched more than 230000 us servicemen 
and women to the region and has announced plans to send an 
additional 200000 over the next few months 
the president was to spend the night here then fly east across 
the saudi peninsula to the persian gulf city of dhahran not far 
from the kuwaiti border 
he and his wife top aides and a press pool of about two dozen 
were to board helicopters to visit three sites an army 
installation a marine encampment and a naval vessel in the persian 
gulf 
for security reasons the white house refused to identify in 
advance the location of the bases the name of the vessel or even 
say how long the helicopter rides would take 
still bush said he was not concerned for his safety and that 
i have never felt more secure in going anyplace than i do in 
going to see our troops over thereits not a risky mission in my 
mind 
meanwhile bush suggested he and gorbachev were closer on the 
issue of using force than public statements by both governments 
might suggest 
we see eye to eye on the persian gulf he said and disputed 
accounts that suggested he and gorbachev were at odds 
if we have differences they are extraordinarily minor and 
they can be resolved he said

soviet founder vladimir lenin approved the 
executions of czar nicholas ii and his family in 1918 according to 
new evidence published in the most widely read soviet publication 
the latest edition of the weekly arguments and facts quotes 
scholar eduard radzinsky as saying the signatures of lenin and 
fellow leader yakov sverdlov were on a telegram about the execution 
of the czars family sent to local authorities in ekaterinburg 
the newspaper which has a circulation of 327 million quotes 
former bolshevik leader leon trotsky as writing in his diary that 
the decision was taken in moscow and with the direct 
participation of lenin 
the disclosure of lenins involvement suspected by western 
historians and reported earlier this year in the weekly soviet 
magazine ogonyok is sure to further tarnish the nearholy image 
of the founder of the soviet state 
under the sardonic headline toward a bloody battle lyrics 
from a famous soviet revolutionary song arguments and facts said 
soviet citizens had been misled about who was behind the murders 
it illustrated the article with an iconlike representation of 
nicholas ii 
in july 1918 soldiers acting on bolshevik orders shot nicholas 
and his family in a basement in the ural mountains city of 
sverdlovsk then called ekaterinburg nicholas born in 1868 was 
forced to abdicate in march 1917 as revolutionary discontent swept 
russia 
the communists seized power in november 1917 
for 72 years there was a myth that the decision to shoot the 
czar and his family was taken in ekaterinburg by local authorities 
lenin and the government in moscow found out about it only after it 
happened arguments and facts quoted radzinsky as saying 
lenin has been increasingly criticized in some publications and 
demonstrations in the soviet union 
in what is called red terror lenin is accused of creating 
the soviet secret police and the network of labor camps that came 
to be known later as the gulag 
some groups want the monarchy restored in russia and the soviet 
press has written frequently in recent years about nicholas and his 
fate 
last year the weekly moscow news reported that a former 
policeman had unearthed human remains he identified as those of 
nicholas and his family 10 years ago and kept the grisly find 
secret 
until now moscow news said investigators assumed they could 
not find the bodies of nicholas and the others because they were 
reportedly dropped into a mineshaft where they dissolved under a 
layer of acid only traces of buttons some jewelry and a severed 
human finger were reported to have remained

waiting three years for mail to be 
delivered might seem like a long time but the surprise for 
children at sunset lane school was that it got anywhere at all 
a wine bottle carrying a dozen messages from teacher angelita 
woodworths class was set adrift in the pacific in 1987 more than 
6000 miles later the bottle recently washed up on a rocky beach 
on saipan an island near guam where ted gebhardt discovered it 
it seems like the romantic type of story that you always read 
in those piratetype novels gebhardt a lawyer said this week 
from his home in saipan the largest of the northern marianas 
the children now in the sixth grade couldnt believe it when 
they received a letter from gebhardt along with their original 
notes 
when i first found out i was amazed said 11yearold 
francis kwang i thought it would sink to the bottom of the 
ocean 
ms woodworth has enjoyed success in dispatching messages in 
bottles a previous class bottle was tossed into the atlantic 
ocean near new york in 1986 and was found at scotland within 18 
months she said 
the teacher said her pupils consider themselves much older and 
wiser now and were somewhat embarrassed to reread the letters they 
wrote as thirdgraders 
one of them turned really red and said how could i write 
such a dumb letter ms woodworth said 
twelveyearold brian costales said he would have written his 
letter differently if he had known who would receive it 
i would have asked for money dear lawyer send 5 he 
joked

the former chairman of the miss texas 
pageant who allegedly made lewd comments to contestants today 
severed his ties with the competition at the insistence of the miss 
america pageant 
officials of the national competition said there would be no 
miss texas in next years miss america contest unless b don 
magness stepped aside 
magness voluntary chairman of the texas pageant for 20 years 
resigned in august just before this years national contest but 
he stayed on the pageants board of directors saying news reports

leonard horn said tuesday he would strip the texas contest of its 
franchise barring its winner from the miss america competition 
unless magness stayed off the state board for at least three years 
magness announced his resigned at a news conference today and 
said horns threat amounted to blackmail 
magness countered with allegations of his own contending 
national leaders of the pageant are concerned with the number of 
black winners of the competition and its ability to attract 
sponsors 
magness said horn told him prior to the miss america pageant in 
1989 that it was time for a minority contestant to win that year 
debbye turner who is black was chosen the 1990 miss america the 
1991 winner marjorie vincent is the fourth black to hold the 
title

a row 
a miss america spokeswoman in atlantic city nj said horn 
could not immediately be reached for comment on magness remarks 
in response to a question magness said he was not contending 
that the pageant in 1989 was rigged but added im just telling 
you what he said 
the texas pageant is among the nations largest during magness 
tenure as chairman 18 miss texases have made it to the national 
contests top 10 two of them phyllis george and shirley cothran 
won 
a life magazine article in august quoted magness as yelling 
come on in sluts to a group of miss texas contestants he was 
quoted as making other sexually explicit remarks as well

jest he complained that the magazine article was negative and 
unfair 
later news reports accused magness of other improprieties 
including trying to influence the outcome of local pageants making 
advances to a beauty queen and having a contestant model swimsuits

welcome to paradise for as long as it 
stays above water the people of this chain of palmstudded islands 
fear global warming could condemn their nation to geological 
history 
if the earth gets hotter as some scientists predict the 
maldives could be swamped by rising seas and violent storms the 
indian ocean archipelago almost certainly would be among the first 
casualties of the greenhouse effect 
we may have some islands just disappear that is according to 
the businessasusual scenario i would hope that the international 
community would take note and do something before that happens 
said hussain shihab the maldives director of environment affairs 
according to some estimates unchecked emissions of carbon 
dioxide and other heattrapping greenhouse gases will raise the sea 
level by a foot in the next 40 years submerging much of the 
maldives 175 square miles of land 
the maldives about 400 miles south of india and the same 
distance west of sri lanka are little more than clumps of coconut 
palms fringed by white sand in a nest of coral reefs 
the 1190 islands are clustered in atolls in an archipelago 510 
miles long just 200 islands are inhabited and a quarter of the 
nations 200000 people live on male island which covers barely 
one square mile 
few of the islands are more than 6 feet above sea level so a 
big splash can be devastating as demonstrated in april 1987 when a 
tidal wave rolled over the island nation 
we had a storm that was more severe than anyone could ever 
remember shihab said this really woke us up 
twothirds of male the maldivian capital was flooded by sea 
water the international airport on neighboring hulule was closed 
for two days and entire fishing villages were under water 
shihab said damage totaled 40 million half this nations 
annual gross domestic product 
some experts said the freak storm originated 4000 miles away in 
the south indian ocean underlining the maldives vulnerability to 
faraway calamities 
the disaster forced maldivians to take a more appreciative look 
at their coral reefs the feeding grounds for a stunning array of 
tropical fish the reefs provide a natural barrier from an often 
hostile sea 
the mining of coral the basic building material for most houses 
here was forbidden on reefs connected to islands the ban 
eventually will be extended to unattached atolls although 
importing cement will be costly shihab said 
traditionally dependent on fishing and tuna exports the 
islands energy needs are small there is no heavy industry and 
male has only a few dozen cars experiments with solar power 
promise to further decrease dependency on polluting fossile fuels 
as a result the maldivians have felt few constraints about 
pressing for worldwide controls on emissions of carbon dioxide and 
other greenhouse gases that threaten the islands 
these gases build a shield in the atmosphere which traps heat 
and many experts predict higher temperatures will change weather 
patterns and raise sea levels endangering coastal areas and 
lowlying countries some experts disagree arguing that such 
longterm effects are unclear 
it is the small island states who contribute the least in 
heattrapping pollutants which will suffer the most shihab 
said 
the tropical beauty of the islands is the maldives only natural 
asset and major source of income other than the sea when the first 
tourist resort opened in 1972 the maldives were virtually unknown 
except as a staging post for the british air force dating from 
world war ii the british left in 1976 
this year the number of tourists is expected to equal the 
resident population resorts have gone up on 59 previously 
uninhabited islands catering to scuba divers and sun worshipers 
the influx of tourists has aroused fears of cultural pollution 
in this strict sunni moslem society which has its own unique 
language and script travelers are discouraged from visiting all 
but a few fishing villages outside the resort islands 
passengers arriving on international flights are cautioned not 
to bring alcohol pigs dogs statues for worship pornography 
explosives guns or drugs in that order 
shihab said the loss of cultural identity would be the real 
tragedy if the maldives were overwhelmed by the environment we 
dont want to be refugees of the greenhouse effect he said

president francois mitterrand said today that a 
un resolution authorizing an eventual use of force against iraq 
would likely be adopted within three weeks 
with the passage of time if there is no real progress the 
danger grows mitterrand told a news conference hours after the 
close of a 34nation summit hosted by france 
the french leader said that he was asked by president bush if a 
resolution authorizing the use of force against iraq were needed 
i told him yes 
we are prepared to discuss it mitterrand said reiterating 
frances declared readiness to talk about such a resolution as 
far as its being put into effect thats another matter there is 
nothing automatic 
he said the resolution would be discussed soon and should be 
adopted within the next three weeks 
bush has been trying to gain support for a security council 
resolution that would authorize force against iraqi president 
saddam hussein to get him to withdraw from occupied kuwait 
the american effort was discussed in numerous ussoviet 
meetings during the conference but bush went away from the 
conference with no public nod of consent from the soviets 
asked about the soviet position mitterrand replied it is no 
great mystery mr gorbachev let it be understood that it a 
new resolution would be possible for the soviet union 
especially if that would weigh on the resolve of mr saddam 
hussein 
saddam must be made to understand he must cede and withdraw from 
kuwait or the die will be cast mitterrand said

the us postal service and union leaders for 
660000 workers accused each other wednesday of intentionally 
botching contract talks so wage and job security disputes would go 
to arbitration 
the postal service never had any intention of entering into 
collective bargaining with the unions they kept us dangling never 
once did they get down to the crux of the issues said vincent 
sombrotto president of the 234000member national letter carriers 
association 
but postmaster general anthony m frank said it appeared union 
leaders were the ones who wanted a thirdparty involved because 
they waited until three days before tuesdays midnight deadline to 
propose a 50 billion pay increase package 
why three days ahead of time you would ask for a 50 billion 
increase its just so far off the wall it may well be a not very 
hidden signal that they want to go to arbitration frank said 
the contract dispute was sent to a lengthy binding arbitration 
process after three months of talks between the postal service and 
its four largest unions broke down 
the stalemate was not expected to create any disruption in mail 
service because it is illegal for postal workers to strike 
once an impasse is reached in postal talks federal law provides 
for the establishment of a factfinding commission under the 
direction of the federal mediation and conciliation service to 
review the dispute 
the factfinders will report within 45 days if management and 
labor still cant reach agreement an arbitration panel will settle 
the dispute the two sides could waive the factfinding step and 
move straight to arbitration to speed things up the process could 
take up to three months 
negotiators also could agree to resume bargaining and settle the 
dispute on their own 
key disputes were pay increases and how many parttime workers 
the postal service should be allowed to hire to help it shift to 
automation 
the postal service had offered workers automatic cash bonuses of 
950 over two years and additional performancebased bonuses of up 
to 1100 a year if certain customer satisfaction and budget goals 
were met 
unions seeking a threeyear contract asked for 8 percent pay 
increases the first year and 7 percent raises the next two years 
letter carriers and clerks make between 24000 and 31500 a year 
plus an additional 8500 in benefits 
the postal service said the unions 50 billion pay increase 
package would mean stamp prices would have to be increased from 25 
cents to 43 cents 
the service no longer subsidized by taxpayers must break even 
over time its board of governors already has proposed raising the 
cost of mailing a letter from 25 cents to 30 cents next spring 
regardless of what the contract includes 
in addition to the letter carriers and the postal workers the 
other unions involved are the national postal mail handlers union 
which represents 50000 mail handlers and the national rural 
letter carriers association with about 42000 members

mikhail s gorbachev today urged a un security council meeting 
to discuss the persian gulf crisis french president francois 
mitterrand said a un resolution authorizing an eventual use of 
force against iraq would likely be adopted within three weeks 
iraq meanwhile promised to free 157 more europeans it is 
holding western officials said many have said saddam husseins 
policy of releasing hostages gradually is designed to break the 
world alliance against iraq 
president bush arrived in saudi arabia today after three days in 
paris saying there were only minor differences between himself and 
gorbachev the soviet president on iraqs occupation of kuwait 
bush also said he would tell us troops in saudi arabia that 
they were not there on a mission impossible 
he then will meet with syrian president hafez assad in geneva 
us and syrian officials announced today the two countries said 
the meeting would take place friday 
syrian troops are part of the multinational force massed against 
iraq 
in paris bush met with gorbachev and other world leaders on the 
gulf crisis but failed to win backing from the soviets for a un 
resolution on using force to drive iraq from kuwait 
however bush said he and gorbachev saw eye to eye on the 
subject of iraqs aug 2 invasion of kuwait he said any 
differences between the superpowers were extraordinarily minor 
asked if the united nations might act this month on a un 
resolution to use force against iraq bush said stay tuned 
theres certainly a chance 
later gorbachev seemed to move closer to bushs position the 
soviet leader urged an immediate security council meeting to 
address a very dangerous situation in the gulf and take a 
decision there 
gorbachev did not elaborate on what any un security council 
meeting might discuss or what any solution might involve 
mitterrand said a resolution authorizing the use of force 
against iraq was needed 
we are prepared to discuss it mitterrand said as far as 
its being put into effect thats another matter there is nothing 
automatic 
he said the resolution would be discussed soon and should be 
adopted within the next three weeks 
on tuesday soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze said the 
security council should take stock of things and pass appropriate 
judgment on what it has been doing 
then if necessary he said the body should adopt new 
resolutions with a view to implementing all the previous 
decisions 
resolutions already approved by the security council impose an 
economic boycott on iraq and occupied kuwait call for iraqs 
unconditional withdrawal insist upon restoration of kuwaits 
deposed government and demand iraq free western hostages 
iraq is holding hundreds of westerners many as human shields at 
strategic sites to deter attack by the 350000strong usled 
multinational force in the gulf those troops are arrayed against 
an estimated 460000 iraqi soldiers deployed in southern iraq and 
kuwait 
french rightwing politician jean marie le pen who arrived in 
baghdad sunday will take 83 european hostages to strasbourg seat 
of the european parliament a member of his delegation said le pen 
is a member of the european parliament which is scheduled to 
discuss the gulf crisis on thursday

britons italians germans irish dutch danes belgians 
portuguese and greek 
the head of a swiss parliamentary delegation said today that 
another 36 hostages would leave thursday afternoon on a swissair 
charter flight to zurich those hostages were swiss irish and 
british 
also today the head of personnel for foreign workers at ibn 
albitar hospital said 38 mostly irish staff members would be 
allowed out of the country the group would include two britons and 
a dane said gerry fitzgerald of the irish parc company that runs 
the hospital 
it was not immediately known when that group would be allowed to 
leave 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater in paris with bush said 
baghdads moves to free hostages gradually was an effort to chisel 
away international solidarity against iraq 
our answer is simply sorry it wont work said fitzwater 
on tuesday 
on thursday bush will spend thanksgiving in dhahran saudi 
arabia with us troops deployed there about 250000 american 
troops have been sent to the gulf in the biggest deployment since 
the vietnam war

tens of thousands of texans living along the 
rio grande are still using pit privies and some must travel up to 
30 miles just for a jug of fresh water according to a 
congressional study released wednesday 
a general accounting office study of six border counties in 
texas found 198000 people are living in 842 colonias 
unincorporated rural subdivisions with frequently substandard 
housing inadequate roads a lack of running water or adequate 
sewage systems 
sixty percent of the colonias surveyed have water supplies but 
less than 1 percent a total of three have public sewage 
disposal systems said gao the investigative arm of congress 
im very concerned that the lack of proper waste systems for 
these colonias poses a growing health risk to residents and their 
children its also contributing to environmental problems along 
the border said rep kika de la garza dmission who requested 
the study 
de la garza the chairman of the house agriculture committee 
said the study substantiates the need to continue and strengthen 
our efforts to bring adequate water and sewer facilities to the 
hundreds of thousands of colonia residents along the texasmexico 
border 
the six counties surveyed el paso webb starr hidalgo 
willacy and cameron represent 91 percent of texas colonias 
residents gao said an earlier study by the congressional research 
service found 10850 people were living in 61 colonias in the 
states other 10 border counties in 1987 
the gao also found 14600 people were living in 15 colonias in 
new mexicos dona ana county twelve had access to public water and 
only one had access to a public sewer 
although a colonia may have a water system residents do not 
necessarily have running water the gao said 
in some texas colonias residents have only outside water 
spigots to provide water and do not have indoor plumbing sometimes 
residents have not hooked up to the water system because they 
cannot afford the user fees the study said and local officials 
believe most of the onsite sewage systems used in colonias are 
substandard 
some residents travel as far as 25 to 30 miles to any of three 
county owned water spigots to fill their water containers gao 
said pit privies are the primary method of sewage disposal for 
webb county colonias 
texas voters last year authorized 100 million to fund water and 
sewer projects in counties with economically distressed areas and 
in all border counties with colonias de la garza also included in 
the 1990 farm bill a 60 million program to make loans and grants 
to help bring water and sewage systems to colonias and to hook 
homes to those systems congress must still authorize the funding

europes leaders wednesday pledged to replace the 
cold war with an era of peace and unity but left unresolved 
several bitter disputes 
the final document of the 34nation summit made no mention for 
example of the three baltic republics which were excluded from 
the threeday conference despite strenuous lobbying efforts 
it skirted the issue of cyprus which remains divided unlike 
eastern europe the foreign army occupying part of cyprus 
turkeys is not in the process of withdrawing 
yugoslav president borisav jovic in his address to the summit 
spoke of the need to improve the status of national minorities but 
he made no reference to the mounting ethnic division that threatens 
his own federation 
the foreign ministers of the three baltic republics estonia 
latvia and lithuania protested in vain against the soviet unions 
move to exclude them from the summit deliberations 
soviet officials sought to defuse the complaints saying the 
three breakaway republics were welcome to join its delegation but 
several western european leaders spoke in sympathy with the 
baltics making clear this issue will remain one of europes few 
enduring international disputes 
while barriers fell this year between the former west and east 
germanys citizens in cyprus capital of nicosia still cannot pass 
from one side of the city to another 
turkey invaded in 1974 in the wake of a greek cypriot coup 
attempt and established what it now calls the turkish republic of 
northern cyprus united nations resolutions have called for the 
withdrawal of the 25000 turkish troops that occupy 39 percent of 
the country 
there exists in europe itself a conflict that i cannot let 
pass in silence that of cyprus un secretary general javier 
perez de cuellar said in his speech to the summit monday 
cyprus and turkey were the only countries at the summit which 
remain avowed enemies at a luncheon monday cypriot president 
george vassiliou sat facing his nemesis turkish president turgut 
ozal 
i said to him we must solve the cyprus problem he said 
yes we must that was it vassiliou told reporters 
in yugoslavia the northernmost republic of slovenia is at 
loggerheads with serbia the largest republic serbia the tiny 
fellow republic of montenegro and stillstalinist albania are the 
only european states that have not yet held free elections 
serbia and montenegro plan elections on dec 9 while albania 
where the ruling communists still dominate is due for a vote in 
february 
albania restricted to nonvoting status at the threeday 
conference on security and cooperation in europe objected to its 
continuing exclusion from a forum open to every other state on the 
continent 
it is surprising and indeed incomprehensible that some states 
did not grant the consensus for albanias full participation its 
delegation said in a statement it seems this attitude stems from 
reminiscences about the past

us forces into war against iraq only as a last resort

weapons and this movement toward nuclear capacity cuomo said

patient in the united states to receive marijuana approved by the 
food and drug administration 
an fda spokeswoman confirmed the agency gave approval tuesday 
for someone to use marijuana 
act quoted danny as saying the drug helps me cope with this 
terrible disease 
marijuana reduced the patients nausea vomiting and weightloss 
caused by the aids virus and restored his appetite said the group

the fda has allowed marijuana use by patients for compassionate 
purposes in at least two dozen instances since 1976 
acts president robert randall a glaucoma patient was the 
first to win fda approval 
marijuanas use is widespread and rapidly growing among aids

a 270yearold stradivarius violin named after the 
descendants of composer felix mendelssohn sold wednesday for 176 
million the highest price paid at auction for a musical 
instrument christies said 
the violin known as the mendelssohn was purchased by a private 
buyer in the salesroom who asked not to be identified 
it was owned by an american collector for the past 35 years 
and he probably played it a bit said william hanham the 
auctioneers spokesman 
the fact that it had been off the market for a long time was a 
considerable help to the price he added we believe that more 
expensive instruments have been sold privately 
the previous owner who remained anonymous sold the violin to 
aid the united jewish appealfederation of jewish philanthropies of 
new york 
antonio stradivari made the violin in cremona italy in 1720 
toward the end of his golden period when he produced his finest 
instruments the greatest ones are usually given personal names 
the violin was named after its owners in the 19th century the 
mendelssohn family of berlin 
the previous musical instrument auction record was 122 million 
for a stradivarius cello in 1988 
the same year a baron heath violin made in 1743 by giuseppe

support for an allout war on drugs 
prevailed over concern for civil liberties as the city commission 
wednesday approved an ordinance requiring police to report drug 
arrests to employers 
drug users would get a very very powerful lesson that they 
cannot use drugs with impunity said university of miami 
president tad foote 
foote chairman of the miami coalition for a drugfree 
community said the ordinance will make miami beach a leader in the 
fight against drugs supporters and opponents believe the ordinance 
to be the first of its kind in the nation 
the american civil liberties union opposed the bill and 
commissioners agreed to seek a court opinion on the measures 
constitutionality before any letters go out the commission 
approved the first reading 52 and set final review for dec 19 
supporters in wednesdays debate focused on the need to show the 
determination of the city which accounts for 40 percent of dade 
county drug arrests to fight drugs and related violent crime 
opponents worried about the legality of notification based 
solely on an arrest and the potential legal costs of defending the 
ordinance 
i know in my heart that the employer is going to take that 
letter and probably fire the individual said mayor alex daoud 
who voted against the measure 
its not right it doesnt feel right its not correct 
he also questioned why the ordinance was limited to drug 
arrests and did not include drunken driving rape or other crimes 
but leaders of the miami coalition contended the notification 
letter would safeguard the rights of employees by warning employers 
against taking any punitive action a draft version of the letter 
recommends that employers respond with drug counseling or 
rehabilitation 
supporters included educators physicians the local heads of 
the us drug enforcement administration customs service and 
bureau of alcohol tobacco and firearms and businessmen and 
residents victimized by drugrelated crimes 
the opposition was led by the aclu which charged the ordinance 
would violate due process and privacy rights and the miami beach 
taxpayers association which said the letters would hurt employees 
for life 
a user who gets fired is no longer just a user said 
association spokesman harley willner hes a loser because hes 
got no other means of support 
dorian jones a clothing store owner who said hes been arrested 
three times but has never been convicted of a crime asked since 
when are we putting so much trust in government officials and 
police 
but hotel manager don meginley expressed the sentiment of the 
audiences majority 
weve had it this is not an endall cureall for drug use on 
miami beach but its a start he said 
commissioner bruce singer acknowledged the issue will wind up in 
court but said the costs of human lives far outweigh the cost 
of defending or determining whether the ordinance is legal 
commissioner abe resnick added we have an allout war and we 
have to defend ourselves

the state department reacted sharply wednesday 
to a military campaign launched by leftist rebels in el salvador 
and left open the possibility of increasing military aid to the 
salvadoran armed forces 
deputy spokesman richard boucher strongly condemned the military 
campaign by the fmln rebels accusing the insurgents of violating a 
commitment not to undertake military attacks that affect the 
civilian population 
he said seven civilians were killed and 67 wounded 
americas watch a private human rights group said the rebels 
have been responsible for only a small percentage of the civilian 
deaths in el salvador over the years ann manuel an associate at 
americas watch said the vast majority of the estimated 40000 
civilian killings have been the work of government forces and 
rightist death squads 
an fmln statement said tuesdays attacks were aimed at inducing 
the government to return to the negotiating table 
under legislation approved last month congress cut military aid 
to el salvador to 425 million half the administrations 
request president bush had objected strongly to the congressional 
action 
the legislation would allow the cut aid to be restored if the 
rebels launched a military offensive that threatens the government 
boucher said that provision of the legislation was being reviewed 
in light of tuesdays attacks 
the attacks he said did not appear to pose a threat to the 
governments survival 
other officials said preliminary consultations had begun with 
the staff of the chief sponsor of the legislation sen christopher 
dodd dconn dodd was out of the city wednesday 
the administration had argued forcefully against the aid 
cutback contending it didnt contain sufficient incentives for the 
fmln to agree to a ceasefire and to negotiate a settlement to 
their 10year war with the governent 
proponents of the cutback saw it as an inducement for the 
government to meet the rebels half way in peace talks that began 
earlier this year five rounds have been held since may 
an additional stipulation of the legislation is that all 
military aid to the armed forces would be cut off if the government 
refused to negotiate in good faith 
boucher said the government has made a number of concessions 
during the peace talks 
among other things he said the government has offered to

temporary quarters 
police continued to detour motorists around the area snarling 
downtown traffic district of columbia building inspectors said the

the job done 
schwartz said only a few staffers were in the headquarters 
wednesday with the remainder scattered between press galleries at

in the interim upi will continue operating part of its radio 
network through national public radio headquarters in the nations 
capital schwartz said reuters will also continue transmitting 
upis news photos 
steve arabia spokesman for potomac electric power co said the

the area arabia said 
crews will be working in the area for days he added 
no one was injured in mondays cavein at the halfsquareblock

the sudden collapse swallowed several construction trailers a 
large construction crane part of an adjoining alley and several

pioneer rock star chuck berry said 
wednesday hes eager to resume performing and recording now that 
charges of child abuse against him have been dropped 
i feel fantastic because i hope and believe that the 
clearance will be as prominently exposed as the allegation berry 
told reporters at his lawyers office and therefore i can go on 
with my life 
the 63yearold rock n roll legend whose early hits include 
johnny b goode roll over beethoven and sweet little 
sixteen agreed to serve two years of unsupervised probation on 
a marijuana charge as part of a plea agreement reached tuesday 
berry maintained that the marijuana found during a raid of his 
home was not his but he would accept probation parole he 
called it on a misdemeanor charge 
you want your hands wrung of everything but i can do 10 years 
parole berry said 
berry said the child abuse charges damaged his career since his 
150acre rural estate was raided in june he said promoters have 
shied away and he has done only three concerts last year in the 
same sixmonth period he said he did 30 concerts 
berry said he has one concert booked in march he also resumed 
recording tuesday on an album that he has been working on for four 
years 
in the plea agreement berry dropped his civilrights violation 
suit against st charles county prosecutor william hannah that had 
stemmed from the raid 
hannah said mr berrys level of accountability for the 
criminal activities that we can prove is properly reflected in this 
plea agreement 
the status of an unspecified number of lawsuits related to the 
case was unclear berry and his lawyer wayne schoeneberg said 
other legal action would be forthcoming but refused to comment 
further 
berry maintained that somebody was out to get him 
oh yes of course he said or else this wouldnt have all 
come up im not a bad boy 
the curtain is just rising on these other allegations 
berry was charged july 19 after drug agents searched his estate 
near wentzville about 40 miles west of st louis at hannahs 
direction 
the original felony charges accused him of possession of more 
than 35 grams of marijuana three charges of child abuse alleged 
that berry made nude films of youths under age 17 for sexual 
gratification 
authorities said the raid turned up several plastic bags of 
marijuana some hashish two 22caliber rifles and a shotgun plus 
122000 and various pornographic videotapes slides and books 
the raid came after an informant told authorities that berry had 
received a large amount of cocaine and would have it at his home 
for 10 days police found no cocaine 
berry said wednesday he was contributing 5000 to drug and 
alcohol education and rehabilitation programs its not the first 
one and it wont be the last contribution he said 
schoeneberg said the tape that brought the child abuse charges 
was phony somebody had slipped that videotape into evidence 
seized at his property schoeneberg said 
berry had been free on 20000 bond

county commissioners knew they had a 
problem when four people each got one writein vote for a seat on a 
newly created commission things got worse when they took another 
look 
now they have a fiveway tie 
democracy has its quirks i guess greenfield town manager 
norman thidemann said wednesday we had five writeins for a seat 
where there wasnt even a candidate to begin with 
the race in question is a relatively lowprofile spot on the 
franklin county charter commission a new group that will start 
work on revamping the structure of county government the 14 other 
seats were filled quietly enough but no one ran for the district 3 
seat on the nov 6 ballot 
on tuesday county election officials met to try to break the 
fourway tie by looking at escrow votes ballots that were cast 
nov 6 but were set aside after being challenged because voters 
names could not be found on current lists 
of 23 escrow ballots five were determined to be valid because 
the voters had registered in the past 
but the only thing the new ballots yielded was one writein vote 
for yet another candidate 
county administrator jay dipucchio said he plans to ask the 
writein winners next week if any of them want the job from there 
the county may decide whether to hold a special election to fill 
the seat or the seated members of the commission may appoint 
someone he said 
its no big deal he said 
one of the writein winners is assured a seat regardless of what 
happens in addition to his writein nod for district 3 charles 
mccarthy was elected to the charter commission as an atlarge 
candidate

prime minister margaret thatchers supporters have 
tried to play the iraqi card in the conservative partys leadership 
struggle but her opponent has said he would not change her firm 
policy in the persian gulf 
michael heseltine who is challenging mrs thatcher for 
leadership of the conservative party has called iraqi president 
saddam hussein a destructive loser he has said that war in the 
gulf is both possible and justifiable 
heseltines views on the gulf are a carbon copy of mrs 
thatchers said jack spence a professor of politics at 
leicester university when it comes to the crisis its business 
as usual under heseltine 
as mrs thatchers defense minister from 1983 to 1986 heseltine 
defended her conduct of the falklands war with argentina and 
supported the controversial deployment of cruise missiles he also 
backed development of former president reagans star wars 
program 
hes every bit as strong on defense as mrs thatcher said 
peter jenkins a leading political writer and commentator 
here is a guy who is a patriot on defense who is solidly 
pronato who saw off the campaign for nuclear disarmament during 
his time as defense secretary and he is solid on the gulf 
what heseltine will not have is mrs thatchers stature of more 
than a decade as a prominent world leader and reliable ally of the 
united states 
however jenkins said heseltine is a very satisfactory mix as 
far as the united states is concerned strong on defense but also 
proeurope president bush has made it clear that he likes this 
configuration 
defense secretary tom king has come closest to playing the iraqi 
card against heseltine before heseltine announced his candidacy 
king linked any fight over the leadership with an upcoming visit to 
british troops in the gulf 
if at this moment we had a contest what am i to say to the 
troops i am going to see in the next days about the fact that the 
whole country is behind you the times of london quoted king as 
saying 
a few days later with heseltine in the race and king in saudi 
arabia the defense minister emphasized that the conservative party 
was united on policy toward iraq 
when heseltine became defense secretary in 1983 the euphoria of 
britains victory in the falklands had faded and critics were 
begining to demand answers about the governments conduct of the 
war 
heseltine took them on with the straightforward sometimes 
aggressive style that has become his trademark 
taxed in parliament about britains sinking of the argentine 
cruiser belgrano with the loss of 368 lives heseltine argued that 
it had been in britains strategic and political interests 
heseltine actively pursued mrs thatchers insistence of a 
strong nato alliance confronting the former soviet bloc in europe 
under his guidance britain was one of the first nato allies to 
deploy us cruise and pershing missiles on its territory 
he apparently relished confrontations with demonstrators outside 
the missile bases in britain accusing them of ruthlessly playing 
on the fears of the civilian population 
on dec 7 1985 britain became the first us ally to sign an 
agreement to participate in reagans strategic defense initiative 
also known as star wars 
heseltine rounded on critics who accused him of warmongering 
arguing that sdi is not about war but prevention of war 
a month later heseltine resigned from the cabinet in a row with 
mrs thatcher about the takeover of an ailing defense contractor 
heseltine favored a european buyer mrs thatcher backed an 
american 
spence said a heseltine administration was likely to continue 
mrs thatchers uncompromising line on defense as a matter of 
conviction and to win the support of the partys right wing 
his first priority will be unity and the gulf crisis is a 
great rallying point which he will play for all it is worth 
spence said

sunflowers and other oilseed crops which 
disappeared from much of the northern plains during the 1980s may 
blossom again as a result of a lastminute change in the 1990 farm 
bill 
the new provision tucked into the farm bill also could take some 
of the sting out of the drastic cuts in government subsidies that 
wheat growers face over the next five years 
the government will pay farmers to refrain from planting wheat 
and other subsidized crops and allow them to keep the profits from 
growing sunflowers safflowers canola and other minor oilseeds on 
their land 
the provision could prove to be a real moneymaker for those 
willing to risk investment in a new crop and the four oilseed 
crushing plants in north dakota and minnesota 
farmers may find that they can recoup at least some of what 
theyre losing in federal benefits from the market place said 
john gordley a lobbyist for the national sunflower association and 
us canola association 
some worry that a burst of new production could depress oilseed 
prices the way wheat prices have been hurt by bumper crops 
worldwide this year 
rep pat roberts rkan slipped the provision into the farm 
bill during 11thhour negotiations in october gordley said 
the 092 provision encourages wheat farmers to plant 
sunflowers or other oilseeds other than soybeans by guaranteeing 
them 92 percent of their usual government payment 
farmers also can experiment with oilseeds by planting them on 
the 15 percent of their land that will no longer be eligible for 
government subsidies under the new farm bill 
if the legislation works as intended the sunflower industry 
hopes to double production over the next five years 
the industry hit hard times in the mid1980s as farmers switched 
to subsidized crops and foreign countries stepped up exports of 
cheap subsidized vegetable oils 
us sunflower production fell from 55 million acres in the 
early 1980s to 14 million acres this year 
an oilseed crushing plant at velva nd is in mothballs a 
second plant at enderlin nd went through bankruptcy and is 
operating at well under capacity as are two other plants at fargo 
and red wing minn 
weve lost so much production the last several years that we 
need a good healthy increase said larry kleingartner executive 
director of the sunflower association 
theres a lot of uncertainty right now said guy 
christensen vice president of the national sun industries plant at 
enderlin certainly its going to have a positive impact on 
production

a defiant prime minister margaret thatcher took 
the offensive wednesday against her most serious political 
challenge since taking office dismissing her campaign manager and 
hustling votes in the house of commons 
i fight on i fight to win mrs thatcher declared following 
a meeting with leaders of the ruling conservative party some 
fellow conservatives have urged her to step down rather than 
prolong party strife 
former defense minister michael heseltine however claimed 
support was flowing his way and said he could beat mrs thatcher in 
next tuesdays vote among party members in the house of commons 
also some opinion polls have suggested voters desire a change in 
leadership 
heseltine forced a second ballot tuesday by winning 152 votes of 
the partys 372 house of commons lawmakers mrs thatcher won 204 
votes four votes short of the margin needed to stop the challenge 
sixteen lawmakers abstained 
last night colleagues were indicating that having supported 
her once the situation is now such that the change is now 
necessary and they will be switching their vote heseltine said 
in an interview with british broadcasting corp radio 
some conservative lawmakers who voted for the prime minister on 
tuesday warned that they would back heseltine next time but other 
legislators cheered on mrs thatcher who took office in 1979 
mrs thatcher departed early from a 34nation summit on european 
security in paris on wednesday 
later she replaced her softspoken campaign manager george 
younger and made a rare appearance in the commons tearoom to lobby 
for support 
she replaced younger with energy secretary john wakeham 
mrs thatchers determination to fight discouraged speculation 
that foreign secretary douglas hurd or chancellor of the exchequer 
john major would step forward as a stopheseltine candidate 
both men signed mrs thatchers nomination papers for the second 
round 
some tories have said to her look this is too awful and we 
would entirely understand if you were to walk away from it 
former party chairman norman tebbit told independent television 
news 
it was very clear that there was no better candidate he 
said 
but other conservative lawmakers regretted mrs thatchers 
stubbornness 
i think it is the wrong decision to have made it will mean 
that we have a further week of bloodletting said nicholas 
soames grandson of sir winston churchill 
it would help to clear the air more than if it were left to 
the two to slug it out at the ok corral next tuesday said sir 
geoffrey johnson smith vice chairman of the committee that 
oversees the leadership votes 
mrs thatcher spent more than an hour in the house of commons on 
wednesday reporting on the summit and fielding questions 
although appearing tired she bristled when an opposition 
lawmaker suggested she was in the twilight days of power 
the first 11 years havent been so bad and with regard to 
twilight please remember there are 24 hours in the day she told 
paddy ashdown leader of the liberal democrats 
on thursday she is expected to lead the government in a debate 
on the opposition labor partys motion of no confidence if it 
carried it would bring down the government but heseltine said 
conservatives would stick together to defeat the motion and seek to 
oust mrs thatcher next tuesday 
both mrs thatcher 65 and heseltine submitted their ballots 
for next tuesdays second ballot in which the winner needs a 
simple majority or 187 votes if everyone participates if neither 
wins a third ballot will be necessary nov 29 
heseltine criticized mrs thatchers independent style and her 
brief consultations before deciding to challenge in the second 
round 
were talking about whether the cabinet has a role in the way 
the government is run said heseltine who resigned as her 
defense secretary in 1986 
speculation raged about the trend of tory sentiment 
the information is that something like 30 or 40 people who 
voted for mrs thatcher yesterday out of loyalty are now very 
doubtful whether this ought to go on said sir gerard vaughan 
thatcher loyalist nicholas ridley responded ill give you 
another rumor that quite a lot of people who voted for mr 
heseltine are going to swing back to her 
the longestserving prime minister in europe mrs thatcher has 
led the conservatives to an unprecedented three straight victories 
in national elections 
but the party must call another by mid1992 and the party 
challenge largely grew out of worries that it might lose 
the tories who have trailed labor for 16 months in voter 
opinion polls have been beset by troubles such as strong reaction 
against a new percapita tax defeats in special parliamentary 
elections and continued struggles over britains role in europe 
heseltine 57 also has criticized mrs thatchers reluctance to 
fully integrate britain into the european community 
heseltine has also promised to review the new per capita tax 
which sparked antitory riots in london and elsewhere this year

the first of a string of central american 
peace parks intended to save critical wilderness areas and end 
decadesold border disputes has been launched in costa rica and 
panama officials said wednesday 
the park has been established in the misty mountains of the la 
amistad biosphere reserve which includes the largest tract of 
undisturbed cloud forest in central america 
the reserve straddles the border of costa rica and panama as 
many as 40 percent of its plants and animals are found nowhere else 
on earth 
so far 115 fish species 215 reptiles and amphibians and at 
least 500 bird species have been found there 
similar parks are on the drawing board for a forest that 
overlaps the border of belize and guatemala and for the maya 
biosphere reserve that includes parts of mexico and guatemala 
a third is planned for an area along the costa ricanicaragua 
border said james nations director of the latin american program 
of conservation international a private environmental organization 
in washington dc 
the idea is to defuse the border conflict by creating an 
international peace park in an area that was formerly the haunt of 
the contras said nations 
what were doing is looking for regional solutions to regional 
problems 
central america has more different species of plants and animals 
than any comparably sized region on earth according to 
conservation international it is oneeighteenth the size of the 
united states but has just as many plant species and twice as many 
vertebrates 
nations said conservation international and the organization of 
american states have just completed a management plan for the costa 
rican side of the peace park 
the plan specifies steps that must be taken to protect the park 
including projects to improve the wellbeing of the parks 
residents 
if you allow those people to produce the income they need 
they wont need to move across the hillsides destroying the 
tropical forests their lives depend on 
it is the first time the original residents of the region are 
being treated as equals in deciding how land and resources will be 
managed said hernan seguro a bribri indian and a representative 
to the parks coordinating commission 
the proposed peace park along the guatemalabelize border 
exemplifies the importance of international cooperation in 
preserving ecosystems he said 
the border is crisscrossed by the chiquibul river which begins 
in belize runs through guatemala and then dumps into belizes san 
ignacio valley an agricultural area that supplies most of belizes 
food 
what happens to that river when its in guatemala is vitally 
important to belize he said if you can get the two countries 
talking to protect that forest youve done something positive for 
both countries

a vietnameseborn newspaper publisher 
had threatened so many times to burn himself to death in front of 
the us capitol that friends no longer believed he would do it 
nguyen kim bang set himself ablaze monday near the capitols 
west front apparently in part to protest communist rule in his 
homeland his body was identified tuesday 
dozens of bystanders watched when bang doused his body with a 
flammable liquid and ignited himself 
he said it too many times it was like crying wolf said 
quynh thi publisher of the vietnam daily news in san jose he 
just said i want to die i want to die i want to die in front of 
the capitol for my country 
friends and colleagues described bang 56 as a workaholic who 
never recovered from the trauma of leaving vietnam after the 
communist victory in 1975 
they said the father of five children was forced to spend time 
in a reeducation camp after north vietnam took over he later 
fled vietnam by sea 
some coworkers said they assumed he hoped to bring attention to 
the issues of fellow boat people and the tribulations that 
vietnamese guest workers have endured in eastern europe 
the fiery suicide evoked memories of the june 11 1963 
immolation of thich quang duc a monk who killed himself on the 
streets of saigon to protest the south vietnamese governments 
discrimination against buddhists 
bang had left california two months ago to help start a 
vietnameselanguage newspaper called the capitol voice based in 
northern virginia

monday but he gave no indication that he planned to kill himself 
he left behind several letters to nguyen to his wife and to thi 
all of which were confiscated by authorities 
bang slept in a room at the capitol voice office and left only 
to shower and eat at nguyens apartment friends said 
while nguyen said bangs suicide may have been meant to draw 
attention to the problems of vietnamese refugees thi said she 
thought he was also plagued by emotional problems 
he was very upset and sometimes i think he was in mental 
distress thi said adding that anticommunism had become an 
obsession for bang that was really a mental problem with him

vietnamese army against the communists his grandfather father 
uncle and younger brother were killed in the war

levying a deposit on beverage cans and bottles 
would reduce pollution and conserve energy says a government 
report released wednesday 
the study by the general accounting office the congressional 
investigative agency improves prospects for passing deposit 
legislation next year said rep paul henry rmich 
it addresses all of the industry concerns said henry who 
this year unsuccessfully sponsored a bill to charge a fivecent 
refundable deposit on softdrink beer and mineral water 
containers sen mark hatfield rore pushed similar legislation 
there is no correlation between a bottle bill and a dropoff in 
beverage consumption henry said there is no direct tie 
between loss of container manufacturing jobs and a bottle bill 
william l ball iii president of the national soft drink 
association said a national deposit law would be an unwanted 
albatross around the neck of those who are serious about recycling 
and the environment 
pepsicola co spokeswoman leigh curtin said henrys plan was 
highhanded environmental doubletalk that would impose a 
regressive tax on softdrink consumers 
brewers and bottlers once imposed deposits to encourage 
consumers to return glass bottles but the practice has gradually 
disappeared since the 1950s as cans gained popularity and bottlers 
switched to nonreturnable plastic and glass 
nine states have enacted deposit laws between 1972 and 1983 
connecticut delaware iowa maine massachusetts michigan new 
york oregon and vermont 
california in 1987 established a program where redemption 
centers rather than retailers redeem beverage containers florida 
adopted a disposalfee system in 1988 that affects beverage and 
other containers several other states are considering some form of 
deposit legislation the study said 
the beverage and container industries and retailers have 
thwarted national legislation repeatedly since 1970 they contend 
such laws increase the beverage industrys costs reduce sales and 
hurt some packaging products 
the gao report however said the trend toward cans and 
nonreturnable bottles and away from returnable bottles has 
occurred in states with and without deposit laws 
it is clear that factors other than deposit legislation also 
affect beverage packaging decisions the report said citing 
consumer preference and prices accordingly it is not clear to 
what extent the laws result in job losses in the container 
manufacturing industry 
the report also found that

a congressional report released wednesday 
supports a charge that lenders are miscalculating rate changes on 
adjustablerate mortgages 
the general accounting office in a letter to sen richard 
lugar rind said whistleblower john m geddes basic 
observation that some adjustment mistakes are taking place 
was supported by its research 
however most of the people interviewed by the congressional 
watchdog agency said they believe geddes overstated the extent of 
the problem geddes estimated that 35 percent of all 
adjustablerate mortgages have been misadjusted and that borrowers 
were overcharged 8 billion from 1979 to 1989 
the gaos research indicated the mistakes were accidental and 
were as likely to favor the borrower as the lender 
the gao interviewed officials of five agencies regulating banks 
savings institutions and credit unions two 
congressionallychartered secondary mortgagemarket companies the 
federal trade commission the department of housing and urban 
development the savings and loan bailout agency and 18 private 
mortgage market participants 
none of the government agencies ventured a guess about the 
extent of adjustablerate mortgage mistakes but three of the 
private participants offered estimates ranging from 20 percent to 
30 percent 
geddes was fired by the federal savings and loan insurance corp 
in august 1989 after he said that mortgage miscalculations could 
expose the government to liability for the mistakes of savings and 
loans that later failed and were seized by the government 
geddes based his charges on a study of 5000 mortgages in the 
midwest the gao said interviewees indicated he may be 
overestimating the problem because midwestern institutions have 
less experience with adjustablerate mortgages and therefore tend 
to make more mistakes 
based on the gao study lugar this week asked sen donald w 
riegle jr dmich and the chairman of the senate banking 
committee to hold a hearing on the situation early next year

a board member of the miss texas 
pageant resigned wednesday assailing the miss america pageants 
director and casting racial aspersions on the contests selection 
process 
b don magness ended his 30year association with the texas 
beauty show in response to what he labeled blackmail by leonard 
horn director of the miss america pageant 
horn said in a letter this week that no miss texas would 
participate in the national competition unless the texas board 
jettisoned magness who resigned under pressure as pageant director 
last summer he retained his board seat however 
in stepping down the portly popular and flamboyant magness 
raised questions about horn and his role in the selection of the 
last two miss americas both black 
he quoted horn as saying another black winner would cause deep 
trouble with sponsors and television ratings 
he said horn told him before the 1989 miss america pageant it 
was time for a minority winner debbye turner whos black won the 
title 
im not saying he rigged the 89 contest magness said 
im just saying what he said and it turned out that way 
horn would not take calls from reporters wednesday but the 
national pageant director said in a statement that magness 
comments revealed why the pageant moved against him tuesday 
i am not going to dignify mr magness statement with any 
comment except to say that his comments are again confirmation of 
why the miss america organization does not want b don magness 
involved in our program any longer he said 
magness also quoted from a july 20 article in the new york times 
that mentioned the possibility of a lawyer winning the miss america 
crown marjorie vincent miss illinois was a secondyear law 
student at the time and also a summer law associate at richard 
nixons old new york law firm 
the article said horn disputed the notion that lawyers might 
feel queasy about having one of their own as miss america and 
indicated that such a choice would enhance the legal profession 
on the basis of that article magness said he told a reporter 
before the 1990 pageant that if miss texas did not win the national 
title miss illinois would ms vincent whos black won the 1991 
crown in september 
a lucky guess said magness refusing further comment on the 
times article his own prediction and vincents selection 
magness came under fire last summer after a life magazine ran a 
photograph showing him in a bubble bath smoking a big cigar and 
quoting him as yelling come on in sluts to a group of miss 
texas contestants 
i apologize for the 40th time for the life magazine article 
magness said wednesday i obviously regret doing it i still 
would like some day to see somebody write a fair pageant story it 
hasnt been done yet 
that article touched off other criticism of magness and his 
pageant activities and brought horn to fort worth in october during 
a twomonth investigation of the magness affair 
he said he didnt need to be in texas magness recalled 
quoting horn as saying ive got problems of my own ive got my 
second straight black miss america 
according to magness horn said if it happens again ill be 
in deep trouble with our sponsors and our television ratings 
as far as his own troubles magness said he had the votes to 
retain his board position but added i would never do anything to 
cause the competition to be removed from fort worth 
horns letter he said was a form of blackmail

bill irwin fell to his knees in a 
silent prayer of thanks wednesday after he became the first blind 
man to hike the entire 2167mile appalachian trail 
its just an indescribable feeling of gratitude irwin said 
i feel like i did the best i could at the time and hopefully the 
lord feels the same way 
irwin who set from the southern end of the trail at springer 
mountain ga arrived wednesday morning on a snowcovered trail at 
the remote katahdin stream campground 
in all he spent eight months on the trail 
after sleet and snow at the start of this week the sun shined 
brightly and temperatures were in the high 30s for his arrival 
dozens of friends reporters and other hikers joined irwin for 
the final 24mile leg wednesday but let him walk the last tenth 
of a mile alone he was accompanied only by his guide dog orient 
who was with him every step of his journey 
eighteen fellow members of the peoples memorial christian 
church in irwins hometown of burlington nc sang amazing 
graze as he approached the campground 
about 70 people watched silently as irwin touched a sign 
commemorating his eightmonth trek after irwin prayed the crowd 
broke into cheers 
irwin a 50yearold recovering alcoholic who lost his sight to 
an eye disease when he was 28 decided to attempt the feat as an 
affirmation of his faith in god sponsors helped pay his expenses 
along the way irwind suffered a broken rib when he slipped on a 
stone and his 50pound pack swung over his head slamming him onto 
a rock 
irwins closest brush with death came in maine when he was 
swept off his feet while crossing the west branch of the 
piscataquis river and was carried nearly 20 yards down the icy 
stream said david mccasland a freelance writer who traveled with 
irwin the last two weeks also in maine he was held up three days 
by a snowstorm that left 28 inches on the ground 
last month irwin interrupted his hike to climb milehigh mount 
katahdin site of the trails northern terminus before wintry 
conditions closed that section of the path he spent tuesday 
completing difficult sections of the trail he had previously 
missed

president bush will meet friday with syrian 
president hafez assad a man whose government has been denounced by 
the administration as a supporter of terrorism and oppressor of 
human rights 
the twohour meeting focusing on the persian gulf crisis will be 
held in geneva as bush heads home from a thanksgiving day visit 
with us troops in saudi arabia and talks in cairo with president 
hosni mubarak 
in saudi arabia wednesday bush defended his meeting with the 
leader of a state the us government has branded as terrorist 
syrians want to see saddam hussein out of kuwait just as much as 
we do bush said i have no problem sitting down with him for 
this common objective 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater stressed i dont think 
it the meeting implies any change in our overall relationship 
still there are clear advantages for bush in becoming the first 
us president assad will meet since jimmy carter in 1977 not the 
least of which is solidifying syrian support for the coalition 
against iraq 
the meetings main purpose is to discuss the coalition to which 
syria has committed 15000 troops said fitzwater 
the two leaders will also discuss the plight of 13 western 
hostages among them six americans held by proiranian extremists 
in lebanon he said syria is the main power broker in lebanon 
with 40000 troops who control large parts of the country 
taking advantage of its new alliance with syria the united 
states asked assad to use his good offices with iran to press for 
the hostages release and for iranian compliance with the 
international trade embargo against iraq 
assad went to tehran in late september after secretary of state 
james baker met him in damascus but reportedly came away empty 
handed on both counts 
assad also has much to gain from easing his hardline antius 
policy and joining the antiiraq coalition an immediate dividend 
is the rage of his bitter foe iraqi president saddam hussein 
by gaining points with the united states syria hopes it will 
eventually be removed from the state departments list of seven 
countries that support terrorism and become eligible for aid or 
other economic benefits 
officials have denied that bush brokered a deal for saudi arabia 
to give syria 1 billion since the syrians joined the coalition 
nonetheless a syrian diplomat here confirmed the saudis have 
substantially increased their aid to damascus in recent months 
easing the cutoff in soviet support that sustained assad for much 
of the 1980s 
syria also hopes that by improving its relationship with 
washington it might eventually prevail on the united states to 
pressure its close ally israel into relinquishing the golan 
heights a strategically vital area conquered in the 1967 
arabisraeli war 
us officials bristle at the suggestion that the administration 
is turning a blind eye to syrias record our policy cannot and 
never will be amoral baker said in response to criticism of his 
visit to damascus 
we have an enormous problem with syria because of its 
alleged sponsorship of international terrorism state department 
spokeswoman margaret tutwiler said wednesday we cannot improve 
our relations until the terrorism problem is cleared up it is 
still a very emotional sensitive subject in our country 
at the same time she added it is a fact of life they 
have troops on the groud in saudi arabia its just really 
important to other arabs that they syria not be left out 
baker brought syria documents which cite evidence that a 
palestinian guerrilla group headquartered in damascus was 
responsible for the 1988 bombing of pan am 103 in which 270 people 
mostly americans were killed 
syria responded as it has often in the past that the evidence 
was insufficient to warrant the groups expulsion 
syria has also angered us antinarcotics officials 
the state departments international narcotics control strategy 
report issued last march said we believe that syria tolerates 
and profits from the drug production and trafficking in the areas 
over which it exercises control 
syria controls lebanons bekaa valley where production of opium 
the raw ingredient for heroin increased significantly last 
year 
the syrians arent helping us one official said if 
anything they are hindering us 
syria remains effectively under the rule of an authoritarian 
regime according to the state departments annual report on 
human rights around the world human rights abuses including 
torture denial of the freedoms of speech press association 
continue to characterize the regimes record in 1989 
middle east watch a human rights group said in a recent report 
that syria had executed 10000 of its own citizens over the past 20 
years 
the united states is also worried about syrias chemical weapons 
arsenal considered by experts as dangerous as iraqs if not more 
so acting within a 16nation alliance known as the australia 
group the united states has tried to stop european companies from 
helping syria build its chemical weapons capability 
but syria is known to have begun production in the mid 1980s 
and to have equipped accurate ss21 missiles with chemical warheads 
that can hit neighboring israel

this battered provincial capital 
and most of the rest of the country returned to peace wednesday 
after a brief guerrilla offensive but few expected the calm to 
last 
it is very possible that these sick minds of the most radical 
elements of the fmln will continue or augment these actions 
president alfredo cristiani told the nation tuesday night 20 hours 
after the rebels launched their most extensive and concerted 
military campaign of 1990 
usulutan 65 miles southeast of san salvador was the scene of 
some of tuesdays heaviest combat rebels of the farabundo marti 
national liberation front or fmln struck army posts here and in 
14 other towns and cities 
the fighting left more than 80 dead and nearly 270 people 
wounded according to the us state department which cited 
salvadoran military sources 
as they have in many previous battles of el salvadors 11year 
civil war the citizens of this city of 80000 listened to the 
racket of gunfire through shuttered windows tuesday then returned 
to their affairs at first light wednesday 
with the rebels cleared out of town the market was bustling 
with women selling melons plantains and beans to shoppers buses 
and other traffic circulated normally 
but 25 miles to the west on the flat coastal highway to san 
salvador traffic was backed up more than an hour because of combat 
between guerrillas and government soldiers 
reporters saw at least three soldiers wounded in the fighting 
battles also continued wednesday in sesori about 30 miles north of 
usulutan 
in santa elena five miles northeast of here about 100 
government troops rested or manned guard posts after driving rebels 
out of the town tuesday afternoon 
but the feeling among townspeople was that the rebels had been 
testing the waters and would be back 
im going to stock up for a few days said shopper 
evangelina castillo a 45yearold mother of four 
guerrillas who spoke with reporters on the northern periphery of 
san salvador where fighting was also heavy tuesday had said the 
rebel campaign was designed to last three or four days 
insurgents remained entrenched in quetzaltepeque 10 miles north 
of san salvador 
guerrilla commander german serrano said wednesday in an 
interview broadcast on the clandestine rebel radio said the 
offensive was designed to pressure the army to agree to political 
accords that will permit us to achieve peace 
the state department strongly denounced the offensive and said 
it was weighing an increase of military aid 
once again the fmln is talking about peace settlement while 
raining violence and death on el salvadors citizens the fmln has 
repeatedly stalled the negotiating process over the past four 
months and now claims to be seeking to accelerating it said 
spokesman richard boucher in washington 
under legislation approved last month congress cut military aid 
to el salvador in half to 425 million because of the lack of 
progress in halting rights abuses 
the legislation would allow the cut aid to be restored if the 
rebels launched a military offensive threatening the government 
boucher said that provision of the legislation was being reviewed 
in light of tuesdays attacks 
the bill also called for a complete aid cutoff if the government 
pulls out of peace talks 
five rounds of peace talks this year have produced little 
progress bogging down on the rebel demand for demilitarization of 
society 
the rebels are calling for the transformation of the army into a 
civilianled police force 
cristiani has said his government is willing to reform the armed 
forces but that their abolition is out of the question

although soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachev appealed wednesday for an urgent security council meeting 
on the gulf crisis there is no sign of an agreed resolution or a 
meeting soon 
gorbachevs appeal came after president bush failed to win the 
soviet leaders support for a un resolution to use force to drive 
iraq from kuwait 
gorbachev urged the 15nation security council to address very 
dangerous developments in the gulf and take a decision there 
he did not elaborate but the comments seemed to indicate he was 
moving closer to bushs position 
bush met with gorbachev on tuesday in paris where the two 
leaders were attending a european security summit after the 
meeting bush said that despite his failure to win support for a 
un resolution condoning force he and gorbachev saw eye to 
eye on iraqs aug 2 invasion of kuwait and that any differences 
between the two superpowers were extraordinarily minor 
the united states had been trying to push through a resolution 
to use force against iraq before the end of the month when us 
ambassador thomas pickering gives up the councils rotating 
presidency the position then passes to yemen which is the only 
arab council member and is reluctant to move toward war with iraq 
asked if the united nations might act this month on a un 
resolution to use force against iraq bush said stay tuned 
theres certainly a chance 
nevertheless both the soviet and american un missions said 
wednesday they had no instructions to call a meeting of the 
15nation security council 
finnish ambassador klaus tornudd who is close to both the us 
and soviet missions said of the prospect for such a meeting i 
dont think so not this week 
un spokesman francois giuliani said the un secretariat has 
not been asked to make preparations for a council meeting 
the us mission said the only council action they have in sight 
is a possible meeting friday on a plobacked resolution on israel 
and the occupied territories which would call for deployment of 
un peacekeepers to monitor israeli security forces 
the soviets and americans are known to have prepared texts for 
potential resolutions on the gulf crisis but they differ markedly 
diplomats have said 
resolutions already approved by the security council impose an 
economic boycott on iraq and occupied kuwait call for iraqs 
unconditional withdrawal insist upon restoration of kuwaits 
deposed government and demand iraq free all hostages

former us rep donald lukens conviction 
on a charge of having sex with a 16yearold girl in 1988 was 
upheld wednesday by the ohio supreme court 
lukens resigned from congress last month two days after the 
house ethics committee voted to investigate new charges of sexual 
misconduct against him that involved alleged advances on a 
congressional employee 
lukens a republican from middletown was sentenced in june 1989 
to 30 days in jail and fined 500 after a jury convicted him of a 
misdemeanor charge of contributing to the unruliness of a minor 
he has been free on bond pending appeal 
there was no immediate indication when lukens might begin 
serving his sentence 
franklin county domestic relations judge ronald solove said he 
would have to await paperwork in the case from the supreme court 
once thats done then we will probably set a date for enforcement 
of the sentence solove said 
a call to lukens lawyer thomas tyack of columbus was not 
immediately returned 
lukens attorneys had argued that solove erred by barring 
testimony about the girls juvenile offense record 
the franklin county prosecutors office had no comment on the 
appeal 
a state appeals court upheld the conviction in june 
court records indicated the supreme court justices voted 51 to 
dismiss the appeal with one judge listed as not participating the 
court did not elaborate on its decision 
allegations surfaced in early 1989 that lukens had sex with a 
girl while he was a member of congress a columbus television 
station broadcast a videotape of a november 1988 meeting between 
lukens and the girls mother anna coffman lukens did not know the 
meeting at a restaurant was being taped by a television crew 
lukens served two terms in congress from 1967 to 1970 and then 
made an unsuccessful attempt to gain the gop gubernatorial 
nomination in ohio after 15 years in the ohio senate voters 
returned him to congress in 1986 and he was reelected in 1988 
he lost his bid for a third consecutive term in the 8th district 
gop primary in may he will be succeeded by state rep john 
boehner who won the seat in the nov 6 election

government supporters and opponents 
skirmished in the capital wednesday as parliament prepared to vote 
on a controversial reform package that could decide the fate of 
embattled premier andrei lukanov 
riot police intervened to prevent serious clashes the state bta 
news agency said 
leaders of the governing socialist party and the main opposition 
alliance the union of democratic forces went on national 
television to call for tolerance and restraint before the key 
parliament session thursday 
the legislature is to vote on lukanovs budget package which 
includes steep price hikes lukanov has said he will step down if 
it is not passed 
the socialist premier faces increasing calls for his resignation 
from citizens frustrated by the countrys continuing economic 
decline and food shortages 
on wednesday several hundred supporters of the opposition 
scuffled with progovernment demonstrators who marched through the 
capital witnesses said they said hundreds of helmeted police 
armed with shields and batons surrounded parliament 
three demonstrators and three policemen were slightly injured in 
the scuffles said a police spokesman on condition of anonymity 
a firstaid doctor said he saw one young opposition supporter 
beaten by police after he allegedly attacked progovernment 
demonstrators 
several hundred demonstrators marched to sofias tv station the 
site of prodemocracy demonstrations after bulgarias longtime 
communist leader todor zhivkov was ousted last november police 
said there were no violent incidents 
supporters of both sides also rallied in other cities many 
chanting slogans such as give lukanov a chance or down with 
the socialists there were no reports of violence

from power is to be brought to trial on charges of 
misappropriating millions of dollars in state funds and for abuse 
of power the prosecutor general announced tuesday no date has 
been set 
after zhivkovs ouster the communist party subsequently renamed 
itself the socialist party and introduced reforms that led to free 
elections in june the socialists won a majority and hold 210 of 
the 400 parliament seats 
the opposition which holds 144 seas rejected repeated offers 
by lukanov to form a coalition government that would have broad 
popular support and be better able to push through badly needed 
economic reforms 
the governments inability to stock bulgarian stores with 
staples has caused the socialists popularity to plummet with the 
economys performance 
in an effort to boost food supplies parliament voted wednesday 
to restrict the export of meat and dairy products except in 
exchange for scarce commodities the bta news agency said 
the opposition alliance backed a call tuesday by the labor 
confederation podkrepa for a general strike next week if lukanovs 
government does not resign 
several thousand university students who have been on strike 
for two weeks also staged an antigovernment rally in sofia 
wednesday 
the rector of sofia university announced all classes would be 
canceled from thursday through dec 1 in solidarity with the

chess masters garry kasparov and anatoly 
karpov said wednesday they hope the peace and quiet of this central 
french river city will help their play when they face off this 
weekend for the world championship 
both complained of the noise and activity that surrounded them 
in new york where they ended a 12game contest in a draw with six 
points apiece the second half of their championship play begins 
saturday 
for chess publicity it was better in new york but for the 
chess player it is better in lyon kasparov the 27yearold 
defending world champion told a joint news conference 
karpov 39 said the longtime rivals had hoped to boost the 
popularity of chess among americans by playing in new york from 
oct 8 to nov 7 
he said chess is a lot more popular in europe 
unlike new york where honking horns and police sirens proved 
inescapable the two soviet masters are installed in spacious 
villas in lyon 
its always different between a hotel and a grand villa 
kasparov said 
karpov agreed in new york i was on a very noisy street he 
said adding that he had to move into a hotel one night to get 
rest here i have a nice quiet house 
each player won one game in new york they tied 10 
kasparov likened the match the fifth world championship he has 
played against karpov to the series they played in 1986 in london 
and leningrad which began with only three clear victories in 
london at the time kasparov was defending the title he won a year 
earlier 
we had only three positive results in london and then six 
results in leningrad kasparov said hopefully we will have it 
here again 
kasparov retained the title again in 1987 when the match ended 
at 12 points apiece 
the two men dislike each other but kasparov declined to discuss 
personal animosity wednesday for me to explain it again i would 
have to tell my biography from beginning to end he said 
the talkative flamboyant kasparov who speaks fluent english 
identifies karpov with the official soviet system 
karpov who is frequently portrayed as a colorless introvert who 
plays with surgical precision has often said he has two loves 
communism and chess the first player to win 12 points is victor 
in this years world championship and will receive 17 million of 
a 3 million purse a 1212 tie would leave kasparov with the 
title 
kasparov says he will help victims of the chernobyl nuclear 
power station disaster and promote chess in schools with his share 
of the winnings 
karpov has been quoted as saying that his earnings will finance

in vetoing the promotions of two generals favored by gen augusto 
pinochet the government announced wednesday 
the vetoed officers brig gens carlos parera and ramon castro 
will remain in the army but will not be promoted to major general 
as pinochet wished said defense minister patricio rojas 
parera commander of the santiago garrison will be made 
military attache at an unspecified embassy abroad apparently south 
africa sources said 
castro will remain as military attache in the chilean embassy in 
washington 
rojas said in a communique that aylwin approved all the new 
assignments to the high command that had been proposed by pinochet 
the outcome of the annual army command shuffle seemed to 
strengthen aylwin who took office in march after the first chilean 
elections in 18 years 
wednesdays arrangement marked the first time since the military 
coup that brought pinochet to power in 1973 in which the command 
makeup was not determined by pinochet alone 
aylwins relations with the army are considered among the most 
complex problems he will deal with during his fouryear term 
under a special clause of the 1980 constitution the 74yearold 
pinochet remained commander of the 65000man army aylwin cannot 
fire pinochet

iran said wednesday some embassies in 
tehran are involved in drug trafficking and appealed to europe and 
the united nations to help combat the smuggling of narcotics 
the official islamic republic news agency monitored in cyprus 
said the charge was leveled by mokhtar kalantari commander of the 
islamic revolutions committees and secretary of the antidrug 
headquarters 
kalantari told a news conference in tehran the foreign ministry 
was investigating the alleged involvement of certain embassies in 
drug smuggling but did not specify what ones 
iran is a major transit route for illicit asian drugs reaching 
europe and the united states some drugs are also believed produced 
locally 
he said with european help iran will completely block transit 
of drugs to europe 
unfortunately those countries appear to be indifferent toward 
the fate of their youths no heroin would arrive in europe if 
western countries desired to contribute to our antinarcotics 
campaign irna quoted him as saying 
he did not elaborate on what help he expected europe to offer 
however kalantari also complained that the un fund for 
antinarcotics campaign failed to help fight smuggling he 
suggested the fund could offer assistance to his government 
what we need is some technological assistance such as 
drugdetecting instruments and trained dogs he said 
kalantari estimated the number of iranian drug addicts at 1 
million but said 200000 to 300000 have given up the habit the 
past two years and not single person had become addicted to opium 
in the said period 
un reports have said the number of addicts in iran is at least 
double that reported officially 
irans parliament passed a law in 1988 mandating the death 
penalty for anyone caught possessing narcotics no matter the 
quantity according to official figures 1500 people have been 
executed for drug offenses since then and about 50000 people 
jailed as abusers 
iranian opposition groups and international human rights 
organizations maintain that those executed included political 
prisoners 
kalantari said irans crackdown has broken up about 520 
international drug trafficking rings since 1988 comprising 38862 
smugglers who included 1158 afghanis 
he said members of one ring recently confessed to smuggling 
three tons of drugs to europe he gave no details 
kalantari said afghanis were the main distributors of drugs 
and there are clues that they account for 60 to 70 percent of 
smuggling rings 
on tuesday iranian security forces killed eight notorious 
traffickers and bandits including two afghanis in a clash in 
sirjan in southern hormuzgan province he said

mayor raymond flynn said wednesday he is 
considering a nighttime curfew for young people as city officials 
and civic leaders reel from arrests of teenagers in the halloween 
gang rape and murder of a young woman 
the curfew idea drew immediate criticism from civil libertarians 
who called it an unconstitutional abridgement of freedom but flynn 
said parents have to be made accountable for their children 
im going to talk to parents young kids community leaders 
and see whether or not theres something we can put in place that 
holds parents responsible for the behavior of their children 
particularly in the wee hours of the morning flynn said 
authorities alleged that the rape and murder of 26yearold 
kimberly rae harbour was committed by a gang of teenagers roaming 
the streets in search of women to rob eight black teeagers were 
arrested this week 
flynn suggested a system similar to the curfew put in place this 
week in atlanta where youths under 18 hanging around on street 
corners or in public places are arrested and turned over to the 
custody of their parents 
he said that if he decides to start a curfew he would make it 
effective in the spring when warming weather draws more people 
outside 
the massachusetts chapter of the american civil liberties union 
like its georgia counterpart promised to challenge a curfew in 
court 
there is no way to equitably enforce curfew laws its simply 
impossible said john roberts director of the massachusetts clu 
it will be enforced in some neighborhoods and you know which 
ones it will be enforced vigorously in roxbury in a way that it 
will not in west roxbury 
roxbury is a predominantly black neighborhood that has been 
beset by violent crime in the past several years west roxbury is a 
predominantly white neighborhood and one of the more affluent 
sections of boston 
harbours nude body was found on a grassy knoll in the franklin 
field park in dorchester a neighborhood next to roxbury that also 
has been troubled by crime harbour had been bludgeoned repeatedly 
raped and stabbed more than 100 times 
boston city councilor bruce bolling who is black said the 
curfew idea merits some discussion but he questioned how it 
could be practically enforced 
state sen bill owens criticized police for withholding details 
of the murder and investigation for three weeks he added that we 
do not accept the blanket indictment that the entire black male 
population of our community behaves in this manner 
police compared the attack to one in new yorks central park in 
which a female jogger was raped brutally beaten and left for dead 
allegedly by a group of black teenagers who had gone wilding 
the harbour slaying initially drew little public notice after 
police announced it as a homicide details werent released until 
this week after the arrests of the eight teenagers five of them 
juveniles 
prosecutors are seeking to have the five juveniles charged as 
adults conviction as an adult on a charge of firstdegree murder 
would bring an automatic life sentence without parole if they are 
found delinquent as juveniles they could be released on their 18th 
birthday 
the juveniles are scheduled to appear in court dec 5 three 
adults aged 17 18 and 19 have a pretrial hearing on dec 29

the leaders of latvia lithuania and estonia on 
wednesday denounced what they termed a policy of intimidation 
by the kremlin against the baltic republics according to media 
reports 
their summit was convened in jurmala latvia to respond to 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachevs proposals on strengthening 
the executive branch of government under his control 
the leaders issued a statement asking the parliaments of the 
three republics to meet in an extraordinary joint session citing 
what they said was a real threat to the independence of the three 
baltic states the statement did not elaborate 
presidents vytautas landsbergis of lithuania anatoly gorbunov 
of latvia and arnold ruutel of estonia invited representatives from 
international bodies to attend 
in an interview with interfax news agency estonian presidential 
spokesman tonu kalume said the baltics will not be swayed from 
their course of full sovereignty and independence even if 
gorbachev threatens to introduce direct presidential rule or 
economic sanctions 
in a separate appeal to the soviet parliament landsbergis 
gorbunov and ruutel denounced what they said were direct threats 
to use force to suspend our democratically elected governmental 
institutions and our laws according to the baltic news service 
in the face of these threats we note that the baltic states 
will exercise their inalienable right to resist violence it 
quoted the appeal as saying the people parliaments and the 
governmental bodies of the baltic states will oppose new aggression 
and the repetition of tragic events comparable to those of 1940 
the presidents reiterated their refusal to sign gorbachevs 
proposed union treaty which would redefine the relationship 
between the soviet government and the republics they expressed 
willingness however to take part in negotiations and conclude 
agreements with the soviet union and with other republics on 
political economic and other forms of cooperation 
gorbachev said wednesday support existed in the baltics for 
staying in the soviet union 
he told soviet and french television journalists before leaving 
paris in an interview broadcast on soviet tv 
look what happened during the celebration of the soviet 
revolution day more people took part in the celebration in riga 
than in moscow and latvians poles russians all people who live 
there ukrainians threw flowers at the participants in the parade 
people went there deliberately to demonstrate in favor of 
this the union in favor of preservation yes also for renewal 
so when we analyze these complex processes we have to see the 
entire complexity of the thing not just statements made by 
lithuanian prime minister kazimiera prunskiene landsbergis or 
anyone else 
gorbachev denounced as a provocation a demonstration that 
took place in lithuania on saturday in which protesters marched to 
a soviet military base shouted slogans against the red army and 
scuffled with soliders 
an appeal to the government and the police didnt do any 
good he said the military had to defend themselves without 
using weapons 
the fact is that the great majority of the people are in favor 
of the union i am convinced 
gorbachev rejected the baltic republics declarations of 
independence this year he blocked deliveries of soviet oil 
natural gas and other key supplies to lithuania those sanctions 
ended after the government in vilnius suspended its declaration in 
exchange for the start of negotiations with the kremlin 
latvia lithuania and estonia independent between the two 
world wars were seized by josef stalin in 1940

the new prime ministers of india and 
pakistan agreed wednesday that hostilities between their nations 
had helped keep the region enslaved by poverty 
but in their speeches at the opening of a sevennation south 
asian summit the leaders avoided the contentious issues that led 
to three indiapakistan wars in 43 years and brought them to the 
brink of a fourth conflict earlier this year 
if we fight amongst each other we will not be able to fight 
poverty misery and squalor said indias chandra shekhar 
departing from his prepared text 
it is regrettable that the new wave of conciliation and 
accommodation has not as yet pervaded the south asian region 
said nawaz sharif head of pakistans twoweekold government 
sharif said the south asian nations face underdevelopment in 
all its manifestations and cannot afford confrontations and high 
defense budgets we should harness the requisite political will 
to eliminate the root causes of suspicion and tension in our 
region 
it was the international debut for both men who each came to 
power the last two weeks sharif through general elections and 
chandra shekhar because of the collapse of a previous government 
the summit opening was marked by impatience with the slow pace 
of regional development because of the conflicts and distrust among 
the members of the south asia association for regional cooperation 
known as saarc 
chandra shekhar who was granted a twoday delay of the summit 
while he assembled his government in new delhi said the 
differences should not be allowed to impede economic cooperation 
most of the time saarc meetings and summits are just 
formalities why not try to take up the issues which are agitating 
the minds of the people he said 
india has sought to use the regional association to broaden 
trade economic and financial ties in the region but the smaller 
countries have been reluctant to move too quickly for fear their 
economies would be swamped by their huge neighbor 
the other members of sixyearold organization are bangladesh 
sri lanka nepal bhutan and the maldives afghanistans 
application to join may be discussed by the summit officials said 
preliminary talks by foreign ministers focused on whether to 
seek outside contributions to a regional development fund and on 
harmonizing laws against drug trafficking 
reporters have been kept at a distance from the delegations but 
officials said sharif and chandra shekhar had no opportunity to 
meet before the opening session 
the seven leaders and their top aides were scheduled to spend 
all of thursday in informal talks on an isolated tropical island 
the heads of india and pakistan have not met since the last 
regional summit two years ago 
escalating guerrilla violence and an indian army crackdown in 
the northern kashmir valley nearly brought a fourth war between the 
two countries earlier this year 
india accuses pakistan of aiding seccessionist insurgencies by 
sikhs in punjab state and by moslems in jammukashmir pakistan 
denies actively helping the guerrillas but supports their aims for 
selfdetermination 
the two insurrections have claimed more than 4400 lives this 
year 
as the summit began maldives officials said three local 
magazines had been closed and their editors arrested on charges of 
publishing articles defaming the government 
residents said the offending articles accused defense officials 
of corruption and that seven local journalists had been arrested 
the archipelago nation a chain of 1190 islands with a 
population of 200000 witnessed a coup attempt two years ago by 
dissidents who accused president maumoon abdul gayoom of stifling 
all dissent 
india rushed troops to its neighbor 400 miles off its southern 
coast to crush the coup attempt carried out by sri lankan tamil 
merceneries

the energy department failed to take prompt 
action after inspections showed that some guards at nuclear weapons 
facilities could not shoot accurately and did not know how to 
arrest search or handcuff intruders congressional investigators 
said wednesday 
the general accounting office an investigating arm of congress 
said some shortcomings uncovered in 1985 inspections at the 
departments los alamos argonne sandia and savannah river sites 
went uncorrected for five years 
it said the department gave the argonne facility an 
unsatisfactory rating over the fiveyear period but continued to 
rate security at the others as satisfactory 
the gao report was requested by the house energy subcommittee on 
oversight and investigation and by sens pete domenici rnm and 
jeff bingaman dnm after a 10week strike by the contract 
security force at the los alamos national laboratory last year 
the congressional investigators said many guards hired as 
replacements during the strike did not have the required skills 
they also said an unannounced exercise conducted in april showed 
that 75 per cent of the regular security force failed at one or 
more of the skills required 
for example when the participants encountered an adversarial 
situation many failed to stay behind cover and assess the 
situation the report said instead they left their cover and 
walked up to the potential adversaries to ask what they were 
doing 
consequently it said many of the adversaries were able to take 
out a visible weapon theoretically kill the guard and make off 
with classified documents 
it said 24 participants and hostages were killed during the 
test 
the gao said the department does not routinely conduct 
unannounced tests which it considers disruptive but did so at the 
request of the congressional agency 
the energy department referred inquiries about the report to los 
alamos where anna bachicha a public affairs officer said the 
report was just released today and we just received a copy of it 
this afternoon and have not had time to fully assess it 
if after we review it we find there are any weaknesses well 
take whatever steps are necessary to correct those findings she 
said the department is confident that safeguards and security 
programs at los alamos are being managed in an effective and 
efficient manner 
l ari fleischer domenicis press secretary said he had 
written to energy secretary james d watkins asking him to respond 
to the report 
he is concerned about it of course fleischer said but 
we dont read that to say that there is an imminent crisis out 
there or that doe facilities are in imminent danger or even in 
danger at all 
the agency recommended that the department standardize skill 
requirements for all security force members including strike 
replacements and make sure they all receive required training 
it also recommended that contractors have part of their fees 
withheld if they fail to correct weaknesses in security

when it comes to thanksgiving hunger in america 
this year more people are hurting and fewer people are helping 
some of the people who had been giving are people who need 
help this year said wiley cooper director of the united way of 
americas emergency food and shelter program 
the slumping national economy and fears of war in the middle 
east are cutting into donations charity groups say 
joseph zalenski director of the brotherhood mission in 
philadelphia said some people are disheartened because they cant 
give 
the only thing i can do is to graciously back off and say i 
appreciate your plight zalenski said i understand and i 
only hope it doesnt get worse for you so that you dont come down 
to where these people are right now 
the national coalition for the homeless estimates there are 3 
million homeless people nationwide cooper said there is no 
reliable way of counting the hungry but the people who are 
providing the services are reporting to us their demand is up 
greatly

most said ron cool of the kiwanis club of little rock ark

percent he said people are a little afraid and theyre hanging 
onto their bucks

has been raised so far 
we just pray that the resources come in said ferraez 
salvation army spokesman 
fivethousand households will celebrate thanksgiving with canned 
hams and chickens from the maryland food bank even though the 
agencys holiday food drive has collected 180000 pounds of food 
far short of the 650000 pounds it had hoped for

thanksgiving dinners and deliver an additional 4000 it served 
21000 last year its organizer the rev hosea williams said he 
needs 100000 but has collected just 3000 so far 
we always bail ourselves out at christmas said williams 
but weve never been this short before 
in ohio 547 turkeys were donated by tuesday after the toledo 
seagate food bank announced last week that some 700 families would 
get only bologna and tuna for thanksgiving alice mosiniak food 
bank executive director said plant closings and layoffs have 
heightened the need as donations and surplus food dwindled 
the ones who are bringing the turkeys in for the most part 
are the ones who are having a hard time themselves but they know 
what its like to go without something mosniak said 
at the salvation army in miami donations on monday were 793 
ahead of last year but there are 800 more homeless people said

amos sawyer the president of an 
interim government for warshattered liberia left for the capital 
city of monrovia to be installed in a ceremony expected thursday a 
source in the government said 
sawyer left unannounced wednesday with his entourage the source 
said speaking on condition of anonymity he would not say if the 
party went by ship or by air 
security apparently was the reason for the secrecy warring 
factions have killed prominent politicians and sawyers government 
is opposed by rebel leader charles taylor whose army has overrun 
most of liberia except monrovia 
taylors insurgents have been shelling the port of monrovia this 
week 
three members of sawyers proposed cabinet were threatened by 
rival rebel chief prince johnson and it was not clear whether they 
left with the party 
sawyer a veteran leftist opposition leader and a political 
scientist was chosen as interim leader at a september conference 
of liberian exiles he has the backing of five western african 
nations nigeria ghana guinea sierra leone and gambia which 
have sent a regional task force to liberia to enforce peace in that 
fellow west african nation of 23 million people 
the five nations say the fighting and flood of liberian refugees 
also affected them 
taylor and johnson invaded liberia from ivory coast last 
december to overthrow president samuel doe whom they accused of 
corruption tribalism and brutal repression of opposition 
the rebels fell out in february johnsons fighters a small 
band compared to taylors army won the race to monrovia captured 
and tortured doe to death and since have been cooperating with the 
west african task force 
nigerian jets from the intervention force have been bombing 
rebelheld towns to force taylor to negotiate an end to the 
11monthold war in which more than 10000 civilians have been 
killed 
remnants of does army have signed a ceasefire with johnson 
the two sides say they support sawyers interim administration and 
its mandate to organize fair elections 
taylor says sawyer and his team are puppets of west african 
governments bent on dominating liberia taylor has named a rival 
government 
installation of sawyers administration appears to anticipate a 
west african summit scheduled for monday in bamako mali to 
discuss liberia 
taylor has said he would attend the meeting but he has promised 
to go to other peace conferences without showing up

loud stereo music may have prevented a 
school bus driver from hearing a locomotive warning horn moments 
before the train and bus collided killing him and a young 
passenger authorities said 
a sideview mirror on the bus also may have impaired the 
drivers vision and contributed to fridays accident at a railroad 
crossing in downtown miltona officials said tuesday 
but the crucial factor in the crash was the drivers apparent 
failure to stop at the crossing as required by state law said 
douglas county sheriff terry eilers 
if he would have come to a proper stop as school buses are 
supposed to and taken a look this accident would not have 
happened said eilers 
you can put all kinds of possible causes and factors and 
probabilities into it but unless the driver obeys the law and 
makes sure the track is clear the other factors dont mean much 
said eilers 
driver fred beman 66 and kristian rindahl 9 of rural carlos 
were killed in the crash twentyone students were injured 
eilers said mechanical difficulties had been ruled out as a 
possible cause after a preliminary investigation he said a full 
report was expected in three to five weeks 
the use of stereos on school buses and school bus driver 
training procedures will be reviewed said paul tschida state 
commissioner of public safety

the report said the vatican bank in the late 1960s held a majority 
of shares in the romebased pharmaceutical firm serono which began 
producing birth control pills in 1968 
that same year the roman catholic church reaffirmed its 
opposition to artificial birth control in pope paul vis encyclical 
humanae vitae 
the report came from the german news magazine stern and was 
broadcast on the private television station rtl plus 
according to stern the vatican bank by 1970 had sold its shares 
in serono to a milanbased bank which the report identified as 
banca unione 
but the vatican bank had 20 percent of the shares of the milan 
bank and so profited indirectly from the sales of birth control 
pills according to the report

another batch of locally made eye drops was 
found to be contaminated but with a different bacteria than the 
strain that caused infections so bad that two people lost eyes 
hospital officials said wednesday 
the eyedrops in both cases were sold under the brand name 
indocin by hiebers pharmacy during the second half of this year 
in the most recent case eye amp ear hospital found several 
strains of bacteria in three bottles of indocin eye drops a 
suburban pittsburgh man bought at the pharmacy in july august and 
september 
results of tests to determine the origin and type of the 
bacteria were expected friday said hospital spokesman mark kanny 
prelimary test results ruled out pseudomonas said kanny that 
highly toxic strain found in a batch of the drops believed to have 
been made in october caused at least 12 people to be hospitalized 
with eye infections two of whom required surgery to remove the 
infected eye he said 
it appears one type of bacterium appears in two bottles and 
that some bottles have more than one bacterium growing in them 
kanny said 
it wasnt clear if the bacteria were introduced during the 
manufacture of the eye drops kanny said 
in the newly reported case the bacteria were found in three 
bottles of indocin purchased by karl smith 60 of aspinwall with 
a prescription written by his ophthalmalogist 
smith began taking the drops in july and complained of pain and 
redness in the eyes in october 
his doctor told him to decrease the dosage when the pain 
continued he sought treatment tuesday at eye amp ears emergency 
room 
its like burning in the eyes like fires in my eyes smith 
said wednesday 
indocin is an antiinflammatory agent commonly taken orally to 
treat patients with arthritis or osteoarthritis several pittsburgh 
area doctors have prescribed its use in eye drop form which was 
mixed at hiebers to reduce swelling following cataract surgery 
although not illegal indocin has not been approved by the food 
amp drug administration for use in eye drops 
state and federal officials are investigating how the drops 
became contaminated and why hiebers allegedly without proper 
registration was providing them to doctors and other pharmacists 
for resale to patients 
pittsburgh area officials earlier this month issued a recall of 
all eye drops containing indocin or the generic equivalent 
indomethacin

mikhail s gorbachev on wednesday urged the un security 
council to meet immediately on the gulf crisis and french 
president francois mitterrand said a resolution backing military 
force against iraq could be adopted within a month 
president bush arrived in saudi arabia where he met king fahd 
and sheik jaber alahmed alsabah kuwaits exiled emir he planned 
to spend thanksgiving with american troops deployed under operation 
desert shield and to meet friday with syrian president hafez assad 
in baghdad western officials said iraq had agreed to release 
157 europeans it is holding many have said saddam husseins policy 
of gradually releasing hostages is designed to break the world 
alliance against iraq 
before flying to saudi arabia bush wrapped up a threeday visit 
to paris where he had gone to attend a european security meeting 
the paris conference on peace in europe however was dominated by 
talk of war in the middle east 
bush had hoped to win soviet backing for a security council 
resolution on using military might to drive iraq out of kuwait 
which it invaded on aug 2 but the soviets stopped short of 
supporting any such action 
bush tried to dismiss talk about a conflict of opinion saying 
he and gorbachev saw eye to eye on the subject of iraqs 
occupation of kuwait he said any differences between the 
superpowers were extraordinarily minor 
when asked if the united nations might act this month on a 
resolution to use force against iraq bush said stay tuned 
theres certainly a chance 
on wednesday gorbachev seemed to move closer to bushs 
position the soviet president urged a security council meeting be 
held without delay to discuss the situation in the persian gulf 
and take a decision there 
but gorbachev did not say what any un meeting might discuss 
or when the council might meet at un headquarters in new york 
soviet and us officials said they had received no instructions on 
the matter 
in paris mitterrand said a un resolution authorizing the use 
of force against iraq was needed 
we are prepared to discuss it he said reiterating frances 
declared readiness to talk about such a resolution as far as its 
being put into effect thats another matter there is nothing 
automatic 
he said the resolution should be adopted within the next three 
weeks 
resolutions already approved by the security council impose a 
trade embargo on iraq urge baghdads unconditional withdrawal 
insist upon restoration of kuwaits deposed government and demand 
iraq free western hostages 
iraq is holding hundreds of westerners many as human shields at 
strategic sites to deter attack by the multinational force arrayed 
against iraq others have been released to visiting foreign 
dignitaries 
french rightwing politician jean marie le pen who arrived in 
baghdad on sunday will take 83 european hostages to strasbourg 
seat of the european parliament a member of his delegation said 
wednesday le pen belongs to the european parliament which is 
scheduled to discuss the gulf crisis on thursday 
captives to be allowed to leave with le pen on thursday included 
britons italians germans irish dutch danes belgians 
portuguese and a greek citizen 
the head of a swiss parliamentary delegation said an additional 
36 hostages would leave thursday on a swissair charter flight to 
zurich those captives were swiss irish and british 
also wednesday the head of personnel for foreign workers at ibn 
albitar hospital said 38 mostly irish staff members would be 
allowed to leave although it was unclear when they could go 
bush began his middle eastern tour in an effort to build the 
alliance against iraq and bolster the morale of us forces in 
saudi arabia he said he would tell us troops they were not 
there on a mission impossible 
on thursday bush was to spend thanksgiving in dhahran saudi 
arabia with the 250000 us troops deployed there it was to be 
the first visit by a us president to frontline troops since 
richard nixon went to vietnam in 1969 
bush was also to meet in cairo with egyptian president hosni 
mubarak and then on friday in geneva with assad it would be the 
first meeting between a us and syrian president since president 
carter met assad in 1977 
syria is a hardline arab state accused by the state department 
of sponsoring international terrorism and suppressing human rights 
but relations have warmed since syria joined the usled coalition 
against iraq in august 
the syrians have promised 15000 troops for the 350000strong 
multinational force arrayed against iraq they face an estimated 
460000 iraqi troops deployed in southern iraq and kuwait

the city council voted 116 wednesday to 
authorize the city pension board to grant a loan back to the city 
which is due to run out of money next month 
the emergency council meeting was attended by labor leaders who 
fear the effect a loan to the city with its low credit rating would 
have on a 15 billion pension fund 
were very much interested in helping the city find funding 
sources but not through our pension plan les yost president of 
philadelphia fire fighters union local 22 international 
association of fire fighters said tuesday 
the ordinance passed wednesday does not order the pension board 
to make the loan but removes a ban on such loans the board has 
hired an attorney to look into the legal issues 
mayor w wilson goode and other democratic leaders recently 
urged the sale of 250 million to 300 million in shortterm notes 
to keep city coffers from running dry in december 
the pension fund normally would not be allowed to invest in such 
notes because the citys credit rating has fallen below junkbond 
levels to the lowest among major us cities 
the council vote allows the board to invest in philadelphia 
notes regardless of quality until july 1 
the pension fund is the linchpin of a cash financing at this 
point finance director elizabeth c reveal said last week 
pensioners and city employees counting on future pensions 
bombarded council members to protest the plan 
they dont trust the mayor councilman francis rafferty 
said thats the main beef theyre so afraid of this guy and 
their pension is the only thing theyve got left rafferty cosponsored 
the legislation but changed his mind and 
voted against it

boris n yeltsin said wednesday the 15 soviet 
republics could no longer wait for approval of a new union treaty 
and were proceeding on their own to create an economic union 
separate from the kremlin 
also wednesday victor alksnis leader of a group of rightwing 
legislators threatened to call for soviet president mikhail 
gorbachevs resignation next month unless he begins at last to 
carry out his promises to prevent a breakup of the country the 
newspaper sovietskaya rossiya reported 
the developments amounted to the harshest indictment of 
gorbachev since he proposed saturday to dump his prime minister 
nikolai i ryzhkov and revamp the executive branch under his 
presidential control 
russian president yeltsin signed his republics fourth bilateral 
treaty with another republic wednesday after saying earlier he 
could not be forced to accept gorbachevs proposed union that 
treaty would redefine the relationship between all 15 republics and 
the central government 
yeltsins comments came as he continued butting heads with 
gorbachev their divergent plans for saving the economy and for 
holding this nation of 285 million people together have paralyzed 
power in their rival governments 
yeltsin is more popular domestically than gorbachev wednesdays 
actions indicated he was moving faster to consolidate his support 
among the republics while refraining from taking a stand on 
specific points of gorbachevs plan 
the supreme soviet legislature gave gorbachevs proposals 
initial approval but will consider them further friday 
yeltsin and nursultan nazarbayev president of the central asian 
republic of kazakhstan signed a treaty wednesday to set up direct 
economic political and cultural ties yeltsin signed a treaty 
monday with the ukraine and treaties earlier with moldavia and 
georgia 
the five republics constitute more than twothirds of the soviet 
population and most of its raw materials other republics have 
signed bilateral treaties but russia is the focal point as the 
strongest republic 
yeltsin said officials planned to sign a treaty with byelorussia 
in weeks 
these bilateral treaties could constitute a major solid 
foundation for the future signing of a new union treaty he told 
a news conference in the russian republic headquarters 
they have to be signed to prevent chaos in the economy they 
will be a salvation because personally i dont believe the union 
treaty will be signed in a week in two weeks in three weeks even 
a month 
gorbachev interviewed by french and soviet tv reporters 
wednesday in paris was asked if he could form a government of 
national unity with yeltsin 
he replied that he yeltsin and all soviets are all tied 
together with our responsibility for the destiny of the country 
and this ought to determine positions taken by each of those people 
who were positioned to lead those changes as a result of a 
democratic process 
i dont see any obstacles for cooperation on the basis of the 
understanding of this responsibility 
on saturday yeltsin had said he would consider a coalition 
government with gorbachev 
alksnis leader of the 500member soyuz group of 
parliamentarians said he and some colleagues would demand 
gorbachevs resignation unless he showed progress on solving the 
countrys problems during his address to the congress of peoples 
deputies session starting dec 17 
alksnis said his group had not yet taken an official stand on 
the subject but added this is not only my personal opinion 
sovietskaya rossiya reported 
what action alksnis had in mind was unclear parliament rules 
require a twothirds vote by the 2250member body to recall 
the president 
alksnis also said the group wants vadim bakatin to resign as 
interior minister bakatin came under fire from many republics for 
dispatching interior ministry troops in areas hit by ethnic 
violence 
yeltsin told reporters earlier wednesday at the opening of a 
historical exhibition that gorbachevs proposed strengthening of 
the national presidency seemed to be prepared in a hurry 
probably as a result of the debates in the supreme soviet or 
prompted by the staff of the supreme soviet or presidential 
aides 
but they are not exactly logical not quite consistent for 
one thing and for another such things should be discussed and 
adopted taking into account the will of the republics he said 
without elaboration 
he said the union treaty would be signed only if russias real 
sovereignty is assured either by the national president or the 
legislature and if issues are resolved over ownership of the 
republics bounty of gold diamonds oil gas and other natural 
resources

a new poll wednesday put a previously 
unknown emigre in second place in polands first popular president 
election behind lech walesa but ahead of prime minister tadeusz 
mazowiecki 
but the same survey published days before sundays vote 
indicated mazowiecki could pick up enough votes to beat walesa if 
they had to engage in a twocandidate runoff 
the darkhorse candidacy of wealthy businessman stanislaw 
tyminski who has returned to poland after 21 years of making his 
fortune in canada and peru created a sensation in polish news 
media one commentator said tyminski risks making poland the 
laughing stock of the world if he wins 
prosecutors have announced a slander investigation into 
tyminskis charge on saturday that mazowiecki committed treason 
against poland by creating economic chaos but tyminski continued 
his sharp attacks while on the stump wednesday saying he supports 
a wave of labor strikes against authorities 
with campaigning required to end at noon friday walesa was 
making a last dash around the country and mazowiecki direct from 
the paris summit drew one of his largest crowds to an evening 
rally in warsaw 
i believe we will win in these elections mazowiecki told 
more than 5000 people at warsaw polytechnic institute 
there is no magic wand there are no short cuts to repair 
polands economy he warned 
he arrived in a horsedrawn cart he was coaxed into sharing with 
four young women for a campaign picture 
solidarity chief walesa campaigning in zamosc said it would be 
something horrible to be in a runoff with tyminski 
he offers sausage to some people and they think he will save 
poland he said one must have some background one even must 
have been in prison here one simply must have been living here 
the government polling services random survey of 1490 people 
indicated walesa had 27 percent of the vote tyminski 20 percent 
and mazowiecki 17 percent the remaining three candidates shared a 
total of 12 percent and 24 percent were undecided or did not plan 
to vote 
if no candidate wins more than 50 percent of the vote the top 
two finishers face a dec 9 runoff the poll indicated that if 
walesa and mazowiecki were in a runoff 39 percent of those 
surveyed would vote for mazowiecki and 36 percent for walesa 
the polling agency said its survey was conducted saturday and 
sunday before the controversy over tyminski gathered strength and 
has a 2 percent margin of error 
i think the election results will not reflect the polls on 
the presumption that poles are clever said piotr nowinakonopka 
who resigned as an undersecretary to outgoing president wojciech 
jaruzelski on wednesday to endorse mazowiecki nowinakonopka was 
walesas longtime adviser before moving to jaruzelskis chancellory 
last year 
suddenly in the spotlight tyminski was being questioned about 
his international business dealings his past in canada and peru 
his long absence from poland and his leadership of the ultra 
rightwing libertarian party of canada 
poland used to be the conscience of europe and now we have a 
chance to become the laughing stock of the world gazeta wyborcza 
editor ernest skalski wrote in a frontpage commentary if 
tyminski gets into the second round poland will stop being treated 
seriously 
appearing before thousands of supporters in belchatow tyminski 
said he was being fiercely attacked because of his standing in 
the polls according to the state pap news agency however i am 
not afraid that they will find something in my past 
pap quoted tyminski as saying he would support every strike 
referring to recent labor unrest among miners and transit workers 
demanding higher wages refused by the government walesa and other 
candidates have tried to quell strikes at least until after 
elections 
tyminski gets free television and radio advertising time under 
newly democratic polands evenhanded election law the press has 
tried to give roughly equal news coverage to all six candidates 
because he was given almost no chance tyminski escaped 
criticism until now 
tyminski 42 describes himself as a selfmade millionaire who 
left poland penniless and made fortunes in canada and the amazon 
port of iquitos peru according to his campaign he runs 
transduction ltd a suburban toronto computer automation company 
he leads the libertarian party of canada a fringe party that 
has no representatives in parliament

prosecutors announced wednesday that they would 
not pursue criminal charges against a black county commissioner 
whose dispute with a hispanic policeman inflamed racial tensions 
the district attorneys office decided not to try to bring 
dallas county commissioner john wiley price to trial on an arrest 
in march for painting over billboards with tobacco and alcohol ads 
in predominantly black neighborhoods 
price previously was allowed to take six months probation in 
the signpainting without the case going to trial but after an 
incident in which a policeman accused him of pointing a submachine 
gun nov 5 prosecutors sought to revoke that probation and a judge 
agreed to hold a hearing that could have led to a trial and 
conviction 
price who at one time issued a call to arms over the choice 
of a police chief and police officer robert bernal reached a truce 
during 12 hours of talks late tuesday and early wednesday 
bernal emerged from the talks saying he wanted the district 
attorney to drop the case and a grand jury later agreed 
both commissioner price and officer bernal wish the incident 
had never occurred and apologize to the citizens of dallas that 
their actions contributed to discord at a time when the city needed 
harmony price and bernal said in a joint statement wednesday 
bernal had told his superiors that price pointed an uzi gun at 
his head in retaliation for an insult the officer yelled at price 
as he jogged past the commissioners home price contended he was 
holding a pellet gun which he denies pointing at bernal 
for his part price said officer bernal is probably one of 
many police officers who have been thrust into communities that 
they probably know nothing about and have frustrations that are 
mounting 
acting police chief sam gonzales said an internal affairs 
investigation into bernals conduct was continuing but he 
indicated discipline for bernal could be tempered by his efforts to 
resolve his dispute with price 
we would be remiss if we didnt look at what he may have done 
to ease the tensions in this city gonzales said 
bernals lawyer bob baskett said wednesday he was not 
surprised that police would continue their internal investigation 
it causes me no concern because we are confident that such 
an investigation will not result in any disciplinary action against 
bernal he said 
some civic leaders have said the recent discord surrounding the 
incident could threaten a dec 8 vote on a proposed 
singlememberdistrict city council system that proponents say 
would allow minorities more voice in the citys government

the state department sharply accused burmas 
military government wednesday of persecuting two opposition leaders 
who this week were sentenced to 10 years in prison 
we are dismayed by the sentences we strongly condemn this 
action department spokesman richard boucher told reporters we 
again call upon the military authorities in burma to release 
political prisoners and to heed the overwhelming call for 
parliamentary democracy of the may elections he added 
the two who were sentenced kyi maung and chit khaing officials 
of the national league for democracy are clearly being 
persecuted by the regime in a further effort to negate the results 
of the national elections in may which the league won by a large 
margin boucher said 
the league won more than 80 percent of the 485 seats in the 
national parliament 
the arrest and sentencing of the two opposition leaders has been 
described as the burmese militarys toughest move thus far against 
the party which has been prevented from taking office 
kyi maung and chit khaing were among the successful 
parliamentary candidates of the national league for democracy 
political sources in rangoon have reported that authorities have 
arrested at least 50 other members of the party including about 15 
elected to parliament since the end of october

an appeals court overturned a lower ruling and said 
wednesday that french novelist regine deforges bestseller the 
blue bicycle is not based on margaret mitchells 1936 epic 
gone with the wind 
a civil court in paris ruled last december that the work 
borrowed heavily from the american civil war romance classic it 
ordered miss deforges and her publisher to pay 400000 in damage 
to the trust company bank which manages the rights to miss 
mitchells works 
but appeals judge myriam ezratty said the blue bicycle the 
first volume of a trilogy published from 198284 by editions 
ramsay was not even a partial plagiarism of gone with the 
wind 
the ruling said the theme of a young girl who falls head over 
heels in love with a man who loves another woman and at the same 
time is loved by a man older than she is hardly original 
miss deforges told a reporter last year i know what 
plagiarism is and its a very bad thing from the beginning blue 
bicycle was intended to be a pastiche i never said it was 
suypposed to be anything else 
her book set in nazioccupied france has sold at least 6 
million copies 
french law forbids plagiarism but permits pastiche which it 
defines as a humorous takeoff or remake of a recognizable original

ethiopia appealed wednesday for 
more than 800000 tons of emergency aid to feed some of the 43 
million people it says could starve next year 
ethiopias appeal for aid comes as neighboring sudan also hit 
by drought faces a famine that western relief officials say 
threatens an estimated 11 million sudanese 
the number of threatened people in the two countries by these 
counts is roughly equal to the combined populations of new york 
city los angeles chicago and houston 
in sudan where drought has made some land barren for the first 
time this century the government has refused to recognize the 
threat of famine or appeal for aid calling the problem a temporary 
food shortfall 
but ethiopia reeling from rebel battlefield defeats and on the 
lookout for new foreign supporters with soviet aid diminished 
relief officials have appealed for international help 
ethiopia is again confronted with the task of trying to save 
the lives of over 4 million innocent ethiopians most of whom face 
such a problem for the second successive year in a very difficult 
environment said yilma kassaye head of the state relief and 
rehabilitation commission 
many of the victims are in the warravaged northern provinces of 
eritrea and tigre he said at a meeting with foreign ambassadors 
and representatives of aid agencies 
the rebel eritrean peoples liberation front which has been 
fighting the government for 30 years earlier this year captured 
the red sea port of massawa ethiopias only deepwater harbor and 
a past gateway for relief to the north 
the rebels have rejected appeals by the united nations and the 
ethiopian government to reopen the port saying it would be used to 
resupply an estimated 100000 government soldiers besieged in the 
eritrean provincial capital of asmara 
the united nations and the government have been airlifting food 
and other supplies to asmara where about 1 million civilians are 
trapped 
although the rebels truck relief of their own from neighboring 
sudan aid officials say it isnt enough to feed everyone in the 
two provinces 
the famine could surpass the 198485 tragedy in which 1 million 
ethiopians died said kassaye 
timothy painter the representative for the un development 
program in ethiopia described the governments estimate of 
potential devastation as fairly accurate 
kassaye said satellite photographs and unofficial reports 
indicate a major shortfall in food production in tigre which is 
controlled by the tigre peoples liberation front a smaller 
insurgency 
the provinces of wollo and harar in eastern ethiopia are also 
threatened kassaye said 
a consortium of ethiopian churches has been transporting 4000 
tons of emergency food a month to southern tigre and wollo from 
assab ethiopias second port but the journey is much longer than 
it would be from massawa

president fernando collor de mello 
called wednesday for business leaders to sacrifice some of their 
profits to help the government improve the economy 
in a 10minute nationwide tv and radio address collor said 
inflation was the countrys gravest problem and said he would not 
alter his severe inflationfighting plan which has provoked 
recession and rising unemployment 
i never said the transition would be easy said collor 
one cannot defeat 30 years of inflationary culture easily 
but we are on the right path he said we cant get ahead 
of ourselves and fall into the temptation of using attacks 
thinking that will bring about change 
collor has been under a barrage of criticism from businessmen 
politicians and labor leaders several former political allies have 
resigned this month accusing the government of fraud and 
corruption 
there are those who know only how to criticize said 
collorweve had enough of those who only know how to oppose 
without realizing they do not oppose me but to the new brazil 
bankruptcies and joblessness are on the rise inflation has been 
steadily climbing since may and economists say it will hit 20 
percent in december 
that is down from a monthly rate in march of 90 percent and 
collor insisted his eightmonthold administration had done away 
with the ghost of hyperinflation 
he blamed resurging inflation on the doubling of world oil 
prices as a result of the gulf crisis and on corporate leaders for 
their failure to reduce large profit margins 
we had not expected that a some would be antipatriotic enough 
to continue to abusively mark up prices for profits without 
comparison in the world he said

the coordinator of a witnessvictim 
protection program was fired wednesday for signing a contract for 
movie and book rights in the rape case of a woman who doctors say 
has 46 personalities 
the same day she was fired shelia carmichael filed a letter 
with the trial judge alleging that the woman was still being 
sexually exploited by another person described as a close 
acquaintance 
winnebago county district attorney joseph paulus said ms 
carmichael was fired for breaking county rules that prohibited her 
from profiting from her role as a counselor to the victim in the 
widely publicized case 
ms carmichael signed a contract along with three prosecution 
witnesses in the case that would have guaranteed her 20 percent of 
any profits the victim received from any books or movie about the 
case he said 
ms carmichael said the victim wanted her to be involved in the 
deal and that she received no financial compensation 
paulus called ms carmichaels actions deplorable and compared 
them to the man convicted this month of exploiting the mentally ill 
woman by manipulating one of her personalities to have sex with 
her 
it was always the states position that the victim had been 
manipulated by the defendant its very unfortunate and despicable 
that this has to happen all over again the prosecutor said 
ms carmichael said she never intended to exploit the victim and 
had signed a very limited partnership agreement with three 
prosecution witnesses on nov 14 six days after the rape trial 
ended 
she said she signed the deal at the request of the 27yearold 
victim to ensure that any publication or movie deals would be 
handled properly 
she the victim was very concerned about how she would be 
portrayed in anything that would arise from all of this ms 
carmichael said she wanted to make sure i was involved in all of 
this 
paulus said he would investigate the new allegation that the 
victim was still being sexually exploited 
we already asked the victim and she denied that it is true i 
dont know whether it is true but well look into it if the victim 
denies it is true im not sure theres much we can do paulus 
said 
he also questioned ms carmichaels motives for filing the 
letter with judge robert a hawley the same day she was fired in 
the letter ms carmichael alleged paulus knew about past and 
current sexual exploitation of the woman and didnt bring them up 
to ensure a conviction 
george curtis a lawyer for the victim said his client was 
somewhat overwhelmed by the report of continuing sexual 
explotation 
jurors convicted mark peterson on seconddegree sexual assault 
on nov 8 
prosecutors argued that the 29yearold unemployed grocery 
bagger knew the woman was mentally ill and unable to consent to 
sex they said he manipulated one of her vunerable personalities to 
have sex with him in a park just two days after meeting her 
petersons trial included eerie testimony from six of the 
victims personalities 
peterson faces a maximum of 10 years in prison when he is 
sentenced dec 10 but has hired a lawyer to appeal the verdict he 
has maintained he didnt know the woman was mentally ill until 
after they had sex

a federal judge has approved settlement of a 
classaction lawsuit that claimed state farm insurance companies 
discriminated against minorities and women in its texas region 
under the settlement approved tuesday by us district judge 
david hittner state farm will distribute 12 million it will go 
to the seven women who filed the lawsuit last year and to qualified 
hispanics blacks and women who were not hired recruited or 
promoted in agent or representative trainee jobs before 1984 
state farm also agreed to establish a fund for scholarships 
insurance training classes and recruitment of women and minorities 
company lawyers said in a statement that the settlement did not 
constitute an admission by state farm that it had violated title 
vii of the civil rights act of 1964 which prohibits employment 
discrimination on the basis of race color religion sex and 
national origin 
the lawsuit was filed by seven women who said they were 
unlawfully denied positions as state farm trainee agents and field 
claim representatives between 1975 and 1983 they had sought 100 
million in damages 
the equal employment opportunity commission joined in the 
lawsuit 
it accused state farm of reserving the jobs of sales agents 
claims adjusters and underwriters for white men at the time the 
895 agents in the companys texas region included 126 women and 125 
minorities 
state farms texas region headquartered in austin covered the 
southern half of texas including houston san antonio austin and 
el paso the remainder of state farms texas operations 
headquartered in dallas was not affected by the lawsuit 
in a similar case in california state farm agreed in 1988 to 
name women to half its sales agents jobs and pay millions of 
dollars to women who contended they were discriminated against from 
1974 to 1987 
that lawsuit accused state farm of refusing to recruit women on 
the same basis as men for agent jobs and discouraging women from 
applying for the lucrative jobs 
according to the lawsuit although 80 percent of all state farm 
employees in california were women 98 percent of its agents were 
men

with about 85 percent of the votes 
counted on wednesday nationalist parties appeared headed for a 
landslide victory over communists in bosniahercegovinas first 
free elections since 1938 
the election last sunday in the central multiethnic state 
could decide the fate of yugoslavia as a federation of six 
republics and two provinces 
serbias communist leader slobodan milosevic himself faced 
with dec 9 elections and with his partys failing popularity 
addressed a hastily organized mass rally on wednesday 
the moslem union for democratic action was leading in four of 
bosniahercegovinas seven constituences the serbian democratic 
alliance was ahead in two and the croatian democratic union in 
one 
indications were that the three nationalist parties probably 
would capture about 80 percent of the 240 seats in the republics 
twohouse parliament 
preelection favorites the reformed league of communists and 
federal prime minister ante markovics alliance of reform forces 
were trailing and looked set to split the remaining seats with 
several small parties 
both had campaigned across ethnic groupings and for the 
preservation of a united yugoslavia they had warned that a 
nationalist victory could set off violence 
according to the results the communists who have led the 
republic since 1945 would not be represented in the regions 
sevenseat presidency 
the communists were ousted earlier in the westernmost republics 
of slovenia and croatia new centerright governments there want 
yugoslavia transformed into a loose association of nearindependent 
states 
slovenias parliament on wednesday debated holding a referendum 
january on the republics possible secession from the federation 
such moves have pitted the western republics against serbia and 
the other poorer southern republics that want power to stay 
centralized in belgrade the federal and serbian capital 
bosniahercegovina has steered a neutral and independent course 
in the feuding and the final outcome of its elections could tip the 
balance

moslems it is geographically and politically at the heart of 
yugoslavias bitter ethnic rivalries 
serbia and croatia flank bosniahercegovina and have previously 
made territorial claims on it

primitivism he said the opposition derided his party for 
alleged past mistakes but failed to offer solutions for the future

milosevic and his party are rapidly losing supporters to the 
centerright serbian renewal movement and its nationalist leader 
vuk draskovic 
in slovenia polls indicate most of the 2 million people in the 
republic yugoslavias most prosperous want more independence or 
even secession from the federation

warera union gunboat at the bottom of the tennessee river and they

owner of a camden radio station 
he said they also found an artillery shell about 10 inches long 
and 4 or 5 inches in diameter near the boat on the river 
although the undine was set afire when it was deliberately sunk 
latham said divers believe the damage was confined to the top deck 
they pulled out some pegs and they were burned on the surface 
but down in the wood they werent he said 
despite being underwater for 125 years the ships wooden frame 
is believed intact 
some wood was brought off of it it was white oak and 
wellpreserved you could nail into it latham said

to it easily

a prominent photographer asked a federal 
court wednesday to force authorities to return photos and other 
property it has held for seven months while deciding whether to 
charge him with child pornography 
jock sturges whose nude portraits many of them of children 
are displayed in major galleries across the country contends 
police illegally searched and ransacked his san francisco home last 
april 
papers he filed in us district court say the fbi confiscated 
100000 photo negatives and numerous other items 
police have returned some of the material but turned the rest 
over to the us attorneys office which says it is still 
investigating to determine whether to seek an indictment against 
sturges 
meanwhile the photographer and his lawyer said the fbi has 
been calling around the world to the families of everyone he has 
photographed and every gallery that displays his work telling 
them he is a pornographer and child molester and hunting for any 
possible evidence against him 
its evidence of a government thats run amok sturges said 
at a news conference 
it does not take seven months to study a handful of pictures 
unless of course you become obsessed with them added attorney 
michael metzger 
the case started when a photo lab employee told the fbi that a 
roll of color negatives contained 22 nude pictures of young girls 
joseph semien a fellow photographer and developer who had 
submitted the film was arrested and charged by local authorities 
with child pornography charges that were later suspended 
sturges said his photo enlarger was returned badly damaged and 
many of the negatives he has recovered were also damaged he said 
most of his commercial customers a separate part of his business 
canceled their accounts after learning of the investigation but he 
has continued his artistic work and has recouped some of the 
income through increased sales of prints 
asked when the case might be resolved us attorney william 
mcgivern said we cant pin ourselves to deadlines either 
imposed by potential defendants or imposed by the press 
he said senior prosecutors in his office were still 
reviewing the case and had not yet decided whether to ask him to 
seek a grand jury indictment 
fbi spokesman duke diedrich said sturges photographs were being 
examined by experts on child pornography who know it when they 
see it 
metzger showed reporters what he said was a representative 
sample of the photographs presented by police to municipal court 
judge philip moscone who issued a warrant to search sturges home 
the pictures included nudes of children none of them in 
particularly sexual or provocative poses 
if you find yourself sexually stimulated we have the name of 
a good psychiatrist metzger said 
he argued that neither the pictures nor anything police saw when 
they forced their way into sturges home provided evidence of 
criminal activity that justified a search warrant 
metzger also argued that the warrant was overly broad and 
allowed seizures of all papers childrens toys and even the 
kitchen sink since it could have been used to process photos

antigovernment groups rumors in islamaba pakistan said he was 
in geneva

one marxist government succeeded another in a coup and invited in 
more than 100000 soviet troops an insurrection by moslem 
guerrillas known as mujahedeen began soon afterward and 
continues although the soviets completed withdrawal of their 
troops in february 1989 
najibullah said conditions for a political solution were 
favorable he said his government had embarked on a democratic 
course providing for a free press party pluralism and a more 
westernlike structure of government 
he said a growing understanding between the united states and 
the soviet union could contribute to the peace process 
he singled out pakistan as being chiefly responsible for the 
continued afghan civil war and accused pakistan of preventing 
afghan refugees from returning home 
nearly 3 million afghans fled to adjoining pakistan over the 
past decade and afghan guerrilla operations have been based there 
najibullah said he hoped the new pakistan leadership would 
embark on a sound course 
if they move one step forward we will move 10 steps he

national guard combat brigades from georgia 
louisiana and mississippi will be put on active duty in about a 
week for possible deployment to the persian gulf the army said 
wednesday 
they will be augmented by national guard combat units from 
alabama south carolina and texas to create a combined fighting 
force of about 15100 soldiers the army said 
the announcement was followed by reports that the army had 
decided to halt retirements and discharges as well as transfers 
unrelated to the persian gulf deployment for the present 
the washington post said secretary of defense dick cheney had 
given the services authority to hold personnel in the service under 
a presidential order issued in august and the army had decided to 
use it normally 5 percent to 7 percent of the 760000 soldiers in 
the army would leave each month 
cbs news broadcast a similar report wednesday evening pentagon 
spokesman lt col stuart wagner said he had no information on the 
subject 
separately the air force announced it was sending an 
unspecified number of oa10 lowlevel observation aircraft to the 
arabian peninsula for operation desert shield and the navy ordered 
to active duty 875 reservists from 13 states and the district of 
columbia 
the air force oa10 planes which are used to direct air and 
ground fire at enemy armored vehicles are deploying saturday from 
davismonthan air force base ariz 
more than 77000 reservists from all military services already 
have been called up for desert shield it is the largest reserve 
activation since the 1961 berlin crisis 
included in the army statement was the first official mention 
that two active divisions the 4th infantry division mechanized 
of fort carson colo and the 5th infantry division mechanized 
of fort polk la may be sent to the gulf as further 
reinforcements beyond the deployments already announced 
maj joseph allred an army spokesman said deployment of the 
divisions from fort carson and fort polk was an option now 
available but that no firm decision had been made on whether or 
when they would be used in desert shield 
the guard brigade from mississippi will be assigned to the 4th 
infantry division and the unit from louisiana will be made part of 
the 5th infantry division bringing both of those heavy units to 
full threebrigade strength the army said 
the army said the divisions with their national guard brigades 
could be used as additions to the force now in saudi arabia or as 
rotation forces to replace units that have been there since early 
in the crisis sparked by iraqs aug 2 invasion of kuwait 
the army announcement following two days of official pentagon 
confusion over an activation date for the georgia mississippi and 
louisiana brigades means that the first army combat units of 
citizensoldiers could be digging in against iraqi troops by early 
next year 
no decision on sending them to saudi arabia will be made 
however until after they undergo an unspecified period of desert 
warfare training in california the decision will depend on their 
performance there officials have said 
the men of the 48th infantry brigade mechanized of georgia 
the 155th armored brigade of mississippi and the 256th infantry 
brigade mechanized of louisiana will be sent to their regular 
mobilization stations on or about nov 30 said maj doug hart 
a pentagon spokesman they include about 14200 men 
to increase the warfighting capabilities of the three brigades 
they will be augmented by an armored unit of the 152nd armor at 
oneonta ala an armored battalion of the 263rd armor at mullins 
sc and a mechanized infantry unit of the 141st infantry at 
mcallen texas those three units will total about 900 men 
putting the national guard combat brigades on active duty is 
especially significant in two ways it takes the persian gulf 
crisis beyond the bounds of the professional army and brings it to 
the doorsteps of ordinary citizens in dozens of communities and 
that in turn adds a further dimension to the bush 
administrations challenge of winning public support for possible 
hostilities against iraq 
the defense department had alerted the guard combat units for

when tango fans call 84yearold 
composer and pianist osvaldo pugliese the master it is a 
tribute to the man and the musician 
a composer arranger pianist and band leader pugliese has 
recorded hundreds of songs his own classics include recuerdo 
memory and malandraca ruffians 
in august his band of 12 musicians and two singers celebrated 
its 50th anniversary there were two performances to accommodate 
all the fans the following month the band toured holland and 
belgium last year it played for two months in japan 
pugliese fans say tango may be divided into before and after 
recuerdo a tune he wrote in 1924 that featured bandoleon riffs 
which elevated the accordianlike instrument from the periphery to 
the heart of the music 
at the time pugliese was 19 too young to legally register the 
song in his own name so his father a leather cutter in a shoe 
factory and an amateur flutist took credit 
puglieses signature piece yumba was first performed in 
1946 it showcases his distinctive style of a simple melody a 
onethree beat and the violent stops and starts of the instruments 
bandoleon piano violin and cello that get feet tapping and 
hearts pounding 
in comparison tangos other main exponent bandoleonist and 
composer astor piazzolla revels in complex scores that are meant 
to be listened to rather than danced sixtynine and in poor 
health he acquired his own legion of fans by fusing tango and jazz 
rhythms and experimenting with instruments such as the clarinet 
and the vibraphone his followers compose songs on computers and 
play them on electric guitars 
but theres more to pugliese than music hes a communist who 
never renounced his beliefs a labor leader punished for promoting 
workers rights a government critic who refused the safety of 
exile a factory workers son who won fame but never turned his 
back on his roots 
the gradeschool dropout and selftaught pianist also is a 
forgiving man who accepted public apologies from president gen 
juan peron and others who threw him in jail and denied him work 
over four decades 
his music is great because the man is a giant in every sense 
of the word isidoro gilbert wrote in the prologue to a 1985 
booklength interview of pugliese he is the high priest of 
tango the soul of the city 
pugliese is one of the few people who represent something 
special about buenos aires said theater promoter lino patalano 
you will never hear anyone say a single bad word about him 
puglieses story is well known in this south american capital 
where tango was born a century ago in bars and brothels by the 
docks and thrives today in nightclubs dance halls and when 
pugliese plays theaters that seat several thousand 
jailed or barred from performing more times than he can 
remember pugliese once persuaded a jailer to enroll in the 
communist party in 1961 he composed milonga para fidel for 
cuban leader fidel castro 
during his enforced absences puglieses orchestra would place a 
red rose atop his black piano the words tango is prisoner free 
osvaldo pugliese would appear as graffiti on the downtown 
obelisk symbol of the city 
in 1936 he helped found the argentine musicians union so 
colleagues might get a greater share of proceeds from concerts and 
recordings he still splits earnings with his band and is not a 
wealthy man 
i enjoy good health and many friends he said with a smile 
at tango house a foundation he helped set up to promote the music 
he often can be found at the twostory building playing truco a 
card game sipping mate bitter tea and telling jokes in lunfardo 
buenos aires slang 
success seemed unlikely for pugliese he dropped out of school 
after fourth grade and hired on as a printers apprentice learning 
to play the piano on the side 
but he had a natural gift and tremendous yearning by age 14 he 
was helping family finances by playing piano from 6 pm until 1 
am in cabarets and practicing practicing always practicing 
asked his secret of composition he once said these things 
just come out in an instant they appeared in my head they 
appeared in my heart and bruuuuuum i wrote it 
at 84 pugliese is hard of hearing physically frail and sees 
the world through thick lenses but the passing of years has not 
weakened his cheery good nature unbreakable spirit or his touch 
at his anniversary performance the notes were clear and his 
lefthand mightily swept down the keys between songs he chatted 
with fans who shouted out tunes they wanted to hear next 
one thing surprised me he said afterward when i 
finished everyone was quiet and i thought asleep or bored then 
came the applause i almost had a heart attack

like any proud parents len and debra 
bonamassa will whip out the pictures of their 13yearold son 
joey at the drop of a hat 
but dont look for photos of little joey taking his first step 
or standing at attention in a cub scouts uniform 
instead youll see joey on stage at a hollywood nightclub with 
pop artist stephen stills or backstage at the saratoga performing 
arts center with stills graham nash and david crosby or chatting 
with blues great bb king 
when the bonamassas talk about wanting to limit how much their 
son plays they mean in nightclubs not nintendo and their home 
movies are apt to be a promotional video for joey whose reputation 
as a blues guitar prodigy is growing 
hes been working professionally for two years since the night 
he sat in with blues singer and harmonica player james cotton in a 
nightclub in hamilton ny joey has since opened for bb king and 
jammed with some of the countrys best blues guitarists including 
buddy guy ronnie earl and albert collins 
its just the same as if you go up there with your own band 
said joey its really no different youre just playing with 
another fellow musician 
len bonamassa echoing the critics whove caught his sons act 
says joey plays the blues with maturity and heart and soul far 
beyond his years audiences perhaps skeptical at first of an 
eighthgrader in snakeskin boots who styles himself smokin joe 
on stage are won over from the first notes he plays 
hes definitely going to be a monster guitar player said 
robert dye of guitar world magazine who caught joeys act recently 
at a new york city club hes got feel beyond his years hes 
managed to capture the feel of players in their late 30s or early 
40s 
yet sitting at the kitchen table of the bonamassas ranch house 
in this quiet workingclass suburb of utica joey looks no 
different than any other eighthgrader as the family dog barks up 
a storm in the garage joey asks his mother for a cookie but gets a 
pretzel instead he talks about cars with his father and about the 
local high schools champion sports teams 
in all ways his parents say joey is an average 13yearold 
except when he has a guitar in his hands 
by the time he was 6 he was sounding like something by the 
time he was 7 he was about as good as most guitar players in this 
area said len himself once a member of a duo that played top 40 
songs in local lounges he was able to pull off stevie ray 
vaughan note for note at 7 years old 
with his father initially giving him pointers joey learned to 
play on a scaleddown electric guitar he said he still practices 
about an hour and a half a day more on weekends and during the 
summer 
about the only formal training joey has had was with a local 
jazz guitarist who admitted to his parents that while he enjoyed 
playing with their son he couldnt really teach him anything 
joey first got to meet and perform with the prominent blues 
performers appearing in central new york through his fathers 
contacts with club owners and musicians now he has made enough of 
a name to perform on his own at nightclubs and music festivals 
backed by a band of adult professionals put together with the help 
of his father 
his repertoire includes rocking blues songs made famous by 
vaughan jimi hendricks muddy waters and others 
len bonamassa said he is now looking for a bigtime agent to 
handle his sons bookings and publicity hes ready for some 
professional hands said len a truck driver for a paper 
distributor its just too much for mom and dad 
something about the rhythm of the blues songs he heard as a 
child on his fathers vaughan and allman brothers records appealed 
to him joey says while most kids his age are listening to mc 
hammer or metallica he continues to mine the work of bluesbased 
guitarists including roy buchanan danny gatton collins stills 
and earl for influences 
theyre all in their own little world of heavy metal and 
rap he says of his schoolmates i just want to play the 
blues 
so far except for occasionally singing johnny b goode 
joey has limited his performing to playing the guitar 
im a lot more comfortable playing he said singing is 
something i do because if you dont sing it really isnt marketable 
for a blues guitar players but daddy says why dont you sing a 
few tunes just to let them know you can sing so i do but its 
not the greatest voice in the world

ten years after ronald reagan extinguished 
the sagebrush rebellion by moving into the white house the 
modernday range war is rekindling 
fearful of losing control over their own land and losing access 
to natural resources on public lands at least 50 ranchers miners 
loggers and local government officials plan to meet in las vegas on 
friday to develop a strategy to combat the bush administration and 
the conservation movement 
those who participated in the rebellion in an effort to have 
bureau of land management property turned over to the states say 
president bushs environmental leanings are jeopardizing their 
livelihoods 
i think the new push by president bush that he wants to be 
the environmental president for the century has certainly caused 
an uproar says dean rhoads the nevada rancher and lawmaker who 
spearheaded the rebellion in 1979 
that year rhoads traveled throughout the west spreading his 
belief that public lands management policies would ruin the region 
the federal government owns more than half of utah idaho and 
oregon in nevada rhoads pointed out 87 percent of the state 
belongs to uncle sam 
were operating in a state of 70 million acres on 4 million 
acres i think it makes us a little smaller than connecticut if we 
were to look at the size of private land rhoads said at that 
time 
ranchers complained that livestock grazing land was being 
destroyed by wild horses and that the bureau of land managements 
stringent grazing regulations were killing the sheep industry 
as the rebellion spread legislators in nevada new mexico 
wyoming utah and arizona passed measures calling for the federal 
government to relinquish control of its lands 
but reagan managed to quell the uprising because westerners 
considered him one of their own sympathetic to their troubles and 
sure to solve the regulatory nightmares 
when reagan came in the west felt they had someone there that 
would help them recalls marlene simons a rancher and member of 
wyomings house of representatives who joined rhoads in promoting 
the rebellion 11 years ago when james watt got in as interior 
secretary they thought they had it won 
but since bush succeeded reagan in 1988 those who rely on the 
millions of acres of public lands in the west have sensed a 
tightening of the regulatory noose 
they cite a number of growing concerns 
efforts by the federal government to preserve wetlands 
management decisions emphasizing recreation over timbering in 
national forests 
moves in congress to protect more public land from 
development 
a recent effort in congress to increase grazing fees on public 
lands fivefold by fiscal 1994 
rhoads plans to be at the las vegas session to meet with others 
disenchanted over bushs environmental stances but hes not saying 
what action they will consider 
we kicked around a lot of ideas during an initial meeting 
earlier this year he said in a phone interview from his nevada 
ranch 
according to william perry pendley chief legal officer of the 
mountain states legal foundation any strategy should be built 
around unified opposition to environmental groups who oppose use of 
the nations natural resources 
the side that wants to use the lands are not as wellfinanced 
as environmentalists they are not as aggressive and frankly 
they have got to get back to work he said 
wayne hage a rancher from tonopah nev has written a book on 
the public lands controversy that he says has existed virtually 
since the west was settled 
like rhoads hage believes the climate that spurred the 
sagebrush rebellion is returning 
the sentiment that spurred the sagebrush rebellion has always 
been here in the western states he said its just that 
occasionally depending on how heavy the hand that the federal 
government has been wielding we get an outburst of more intense 
reaction 
todays revival of the movement is tied to what hage calls the 
antidevelopment tactics of the bureau of land management us 
forest service and army corps of engineers 
state and local governments are becoming increasingly alarmed 
as they see the potential for devastating economic chaos settling 
into their own areas he said 
and those in the movement point to the pacific northwest where 
habitat protection plans for the northern spotted owl will curb the 
timber industry in some areas and to nevada and california where 
protection of the desert tortoise is limiting development and 
recreation 
cy jamison director of the bureau of land management disagrees 
on the extent of unhappiness among westerners 
weve really tried to be a good neighbor out in the west he 
said in an interview from his washington office theres still 
some spots especially where we have a lot of resource 
conflicts where theres a deep frustration 
overall i think weve really changed a lot of attitudes out 
there but i could find one person about everywhere you went that 
wouldnt agree with me on that he added 
jamison said the key to resolving the growing discontent is 
compromise 
we have to have a little bit for everybody he said

some compare us to a disfunctional family 
which is unable to talk about its problem even though we all know 
about it 
a midwestern roman catholic bishop made that point at last 
weeks meeting in washington of the churchs us hierarchy but 
his was a lone voice the others skirted the problem 
it is that most catholics reject the churchs prohibition of 
contraception this widespread dissent has been repeatedly 
documented and is widely recognized throughout the church 
but the bishops dont talk about it having been firmly called 
to heel about it by pope john paul ii 
nevertheless bishop kenneth e untener 53 of saginaw mich 
a warmmannered straightforward man standing at a microphone among 
about 300 of his fellow bishops spoke up 
when the people disagree he said it means something 
he urged attention to the sensus fidelium or sense of the 
faithful which as long taught in the church often brings 
fuller understanding of christian truth through ordinary believers 
while the holy spirit acts through the magisterium the 
bishops to guide the church the spirit also acts through the 
people untener said and their convictions should be taken 
seriously 
noting that a document on sexuality that the bishops were 
considering advised those who dissent from the churchs stand 
against contraception to prayerfully reconsider he said they might 
respond 
we will if you will 
it has become obvious that many lay people many priests and 
even some bishops are not convinced that the ban on contraception 
is sound doctrine grounded in biblical principles he said 
the bishops should listen to what this is saying about 
christian understanding of sexuality and what it means for the 
family in marriage he said and added 
if we dont it can cause great damage to the church at 
large 
publically none of the bishops took him up on it although 
several thanked him privately for his courage in mentioning the 
unmentionable one did refer to it glancingly as something to be 
overcome 
there may still be questions and a considerable amount of 
dissent about contraception because we have been reticent in 
asserting our position said bishop james t mchugh of camden 
nj 
we are trying to assert values and principles and inform 
the new generation what that position is he said of the 
sexuality document which gently reiterated the ban and was 
approved 
although not mentioning the particular problem auxiliary 
bishop austin b vaughan of new york wanted the entire sexuality 
document delayed to get response from parents many of whom oppoose 
its call for sex education 
he suggested bishops werent exactly suited to deal with the 
subject 
were all celibate he said none of us are parents by 
us standards were all aging were not experts were a 
little out of touch with whats going on we should give interested 
parents a shot at this document 
mentioned or not the contraception issue has simmered for years 
in the church going back to the second vatican council of 196265 
which started to take up the matter before pope paul vi removed it 
from council consideration 
he put it before a papal commission of bishops theologians and 
various experts eventually a strong majority of them recommended 
modification of the contraception ban 
however pope paul rejected that recommendation and in 1968 
issued his controversial encyclical humanae vitae reasserting 
the prohibition and touching off waves of dissent among theologians 
and others 
several foreign national hierarchies expressed reservations 
about the encyclical 
surveys in this country have found that more than 80 percent of 
catholics do not accept the teaching some scholars have contended 
the encyclical has tended to undermine church teaching authority 
in 1980 archbishop john r quinn of san francisco told a synod 
of bishops in rome that 70 percent of us catholics ignored the 
contraception ban and most priests supported that defiance of it 
his candor somewhat backfired when some news reports implied he 
had criticized the church position he quickly made clear that he 
firmly backed it 
something of a further damper was put on the issue in 1987 when 
pope john paul met with a delegated group of bishops in los 
angeles 
referring to dissent against the contraception ban he said some 
claim this is totally compatible with being a good catholic and 
posed no obstacle to reception of the sacraments this is a grave 
error 
for the bishops this tended to tighten the lid on the 
problem they know its there they just avoid discussing it 
publicly but untener broke that silence cautioning of damage that 
could come from such suppression

heading into the final weeks of 1990 students 
of financial history have some encouraging words to offer savers 
and investors hoping for better times ahead 
if past patterns in american politics and economics are any 
guide these analysts say the health of the stock market and of 
stockrelated investments in places like mutual funds variable 
annuities and employersponsored savings plans could improve 
noticeably in 1991 
the force from which stocks could stand to benefit the approach 
of the presidential election in 1992 
in the words of yale hirsch who documented the political 
stock market cycle years ago in his annual stock traders 
almanac each president of the united states must face political 
realities every four years if he wants to stay in the white house 
or at least keep his party in power 
by implication that suggests that president bush and 
incumbents of both parties in congress will work increasing hard 
to pull the economy and the markets out of their slumps as the 
elections draw closer 
in a similar vein say analysts at the investment management 
firm of wright investors service it wont be long before the 
political machines begin gearing up for the 1992 presidential 
election 
assuming that a recession has indeed taken hold in recent 
months wright asserts one should expect to see the bush 
administration exerting increasing pressure on the federal reserve 
to lower interest rates 
although the dow jones average of 30 industrials hit a new high 
as recently as early summer of this year most broader gauges of 
stock price trends have been falling since september or october of 
1989 
over that span for example the value line geometric average of 
1651 stocks has dropped about 35 percent 
if that eventually defines a phenomenon that goes into the 
record books as the 198990 bear market analysts say it would be 
no historical anomaly 
in fact it would be a pretty fair match for the last three big 
bear markets 198182 197374 and 196970 all of which 
occurred in the first two years following a presidential election 
the ensuing preelection years of 1983 1975 and 1971 
witnessed gains of 10 percent to 32 percent using standard amp 
poors 500stock composite index as a gauge 
in theory at least each administration tends to take painful 
economic policy actions early in the span between elections that 
way there is time to forget the pain of a slump and to begin 
seeing its beneficial aftereffects by the time the voters go to 
the polls again 
few politicians ever acknowledge acting on such seemingly 
coldblooded motives even though many economists argue that 
recessions are inevitable at least once in a while providing a 
process of purging and renewal that is hard to accomplish any other 
way 
neither economics nor politics is ever neat and tidy enough to 
allow such matters to be managed in detail 
in addition there have been signs lately that past patterns may 
be changing in the last postelection period of 1985 and 1986 
stocks rose sharply instead of undergoing their usual setback 
then in the supposedly bullish preelection year of 1987 came a 
market crash 
such twists and turns make it patently risky to base investment 
decisions entirely on a single indicator such as the political 
cycle 
still as hirsch wrote in his almanac our quadrennial 
elections of presidents unequivocally affect the economy and the 
stock market just as the moon affects the tides

president carlos menems enemies 
wonder how he gets away with cracking down on unions business the 
armed forces and even his own peronist party 
similar actions by the previous government provoked 13 general 
strikes three barracks revolts food riots and hyperinflation 
president raul alfonsin was forced to step down more than five 
months early in july 1989 
if i had done 10 percent of what menem has done they 
would have hanged me from a lamppost alfonsin said recently 
in 16 months menem has wrenched the economy from state control 
toward free enterprise and sought closer ties with the united 
states at the expense of third world nations those are major 
shifts for any argentine president particularly a peronist 
he is selling off public companies the unions consider a 
national patrimony used military personnel to break a strike 
ended collective bargaining agreements and held pay increases for 
public employees far below the inflation rate 
what menem is doing is exactly the opposite of what peron did 
what the party stands for and what menem himself promised in his 
campaign said novelist tomas eloy martinez once a follower of 
the late president juan peron 
col mohammed ali seineldin who led an army rebellion in 
december 1988 was forced to retire and many of his followers were 
purged from the service the military budget is so low the 1990 
draft had to be cut by twothirds many officers have second jobs 
in the civilian world 
argentina is in a recession real wages are below their average 
values of the 1980s and one in five adults lacks fulltime work 
the austral currency is greatly overvalued 
despite all that argentina has managed to avert economic 
collapse political crisis social unrest and military 
insurrection catastrophe is always possible in a country that has 
had six coups since 1930 and four currencies in 20 years but it 
does not seem imminent 
supporters credit menem but also cite a change in argentine 
social values and the presidents critics tend to agree 
historian felix luna a member of alfonsins radical civic union 
who finds the menem foreign policy excessively proamerican 
said the people believe its absolutely necessary that 
argentina change 
public services are in terrible condition telephones are 
expensive trains dont run on time and mail gets lost 
a nation accustomed to tripledigit annual inflation was swamped 
in 1989 by hyperpinflation of more than 4900 percent many people 
are willing to accept brutal measures even severe recession to 
keep that from happening again 
there is virtually no public support for a return to military 
rule and menem seems to have placated the armed forces by calling 
off trials of officers accused of human rights abuses during the 
dictatorship of 197683 a pardon for those convicted is pending 
nearly everyone in argentina is suffering to some degree and the 
man imposing the pain of economic conservatism comes in the 
unlikely guise of a peronist 
political analyst carlos escude suggested only a peronist could 
undertake such radical changes and said there are historical 
corollaries nixon and china reagan and gorbachov bush and 
taxes 
saul ubaldini menems chief rival in the peronistdominated 
labor movement criticizes the presidents economic policy but 
insists by no definition am i a political opponent 
for all the criticism no one has proposed a convincing 
alternative to the presidents program 
menem 60 is a son of syrian immigrants who became a lawyer and 
provincial governor as an outsider he scored a primary victory in 
july 1988 over gov antonio cafiero of buenos aires who party 
leaders thought would be the next president 
he tells argentines in direct language that the government he 
inherited was bankrupt the currency almost worthless and the 
economic model of state control an empty shell 
again and again he repeats that radical change was unavoidable 
and asks for patience during the years it will take for the 
sacrifices to bear fruit 
inflation rose by only a single digit in october for the first 
time in 11 months real wages have recovered some of their lost 
value interest rates have fallen and central bank reserves rose 
fortyfold to 4 billion 
there also are signs however that the popularity of menem and 
his policies is wearing thin and that serious opposition may be 
forming 
recent polls put his public support at about 50 percent down 30 
points from its peak 
ubaldini is mobilizing workers against the economic program and 
menems decree restricting the right to strike 
several parties have withdrawn from the political coalition that 
helped menem win the presidency in may 1989 
the peronist governors of chubut and jujuy provinces were forced 
to resign in october by mass protests of workers demanding back 
wages the provinces said they couldnt pay because the federal 
government had withheld funds

drummer buddy rich made his show business debut 
at 18 months singer mel torme who has just finished writing 
richs biography waited until he was 4 before becoming a 
professional entertainer 
torme talked to a lot of people for traps the drum wonder 
including rich artie shaw johnny carson tenor saxophonist 
georgie auld and singer jo stafford who with frank sinatra sang 
with the pied pipers in the tommy dorsey band 
he rich and sinatra were the darlings of the band they sort 
of locked heads fighting for the attention of the public tommy 
stood back and laughed in a weird way he encouraged this said 
torme who visited rich at home the afternoon before he died april 
2 1987 
he said he asked the drummer that day if he wanted the book to 
be a puff piece or warts and all he said warts and all just 
be accurate 
buddy had a mouth on him ive liberally quoted him torme 
said 
his dad had been a blackface comedian with minstrel shows at 
the turn of the century he was a hard taskmaster life was made 
very tough for buddy i feel his occasional abrasiveness came out 
of that he was extremely tough on his bands thats why they were 
superb he used to say i give 110 percent every night i expect 
nothing less from you when they did play well he was ecstatic 
when they dogged it he went bananas 
we occasionally had our outs one time i didnt talk to him 
for 2 years i allude to the argument without the hurtful 
quotes torme said 
i made the book as objective as i could make it im not 
settling old scores for him or with him he was wildly witty and 
if you believe the phrase his talent was godgiven 
torme said that rich as an infant was keeping time with a 
vaudeville band during a rehearsal the manager of the theater 
comes over why dont you put the kid in your act tonight 
buddys father carried him out by his belt put him in front of 
drums and they played stars and stripes forever they had to play 
it three times that night 
his vaudeville name until he was 12 was traps the drum 
wonder then he became buddy traps his real name was bernard 
rich the book will be published by oxford university press next 
fall torme intends to give richs grandson 30 percent of the 
profits 
tormes debut came with the band led by carleton coon and joe 
sanders at the blackhawk hotel in chicago my parents took me in 
to hear them one night joe sanders said to them why does this 
kid know all the tunes i can see he knows them tormes father 
explained hed heard them on the radio so on invitation the tiny 
torme sang youre driving me crazy 
i became a monday night feature made 15 every monday night 
and dinner for me and mom and dad my family was musical but not 
professional my mother whos 89 played piano and my dad 92 
danced 
rich and torme met in 1944 when rich sat in on hawaiian war 
chant with charlie spivaks band he played it as if hed 
played it all his life he had played a different arrangement with 
tommy dorsey he could sense everything 
the last time he played professionally was in january 1987 at 
the paladium in a show i hosted a salute to tommy dorsey the last 
thing he played was the dorsey arrangement of hawaiian war chant 
 
torme turned 65 in september the november issue of life 
magazine lists him among the nations six most enduring singers 
torme lives in beverly hills calif with his fourth wife ali 
he has five children ages ranging from 17 to 37 
while here for a months performances at michaels pub a table 
in his hotel room holds a small blender and packets of slim fast 
i started on it in may 1988 he said i just got to the point 
i wasnt comfortable in my clothes singing i was having trouble 
with breath control because i was too heavy 
he lost 35 pounds in eight months last year executives of slim 
fast whose offices are in the same building as michaels pub saw 
his show and invited him to make a tv commercial for them he did 
it after writing his own jingle 
tormes been busy this year he and george shearing performed at 
a new zealand jazz festival and he and cleo laine toured together 
during the summer torme also recorded the stephen sondheim song 
live alone and like it for warren beattys movie dick 
tracy 
torme the buddy rich band and the mcguire sisters will start an 
extensive us tour next february

roman catholic leadership at present says no 
to some theoretical changes that a prominent theologian and a 
bigselling priestnovelist imagine as happening 
they cast their visions in different forms one in a scholars 
hypothetical scenario of a new popes election the other as a 
fictional account of an american bishops pathbreaking innovations 
if their fancies precede reality then roman catholicism one of 
these days will officially take up ordaining women and allowing 
priests to marry if they choose 
that doesnt appear plausible under the present firm stance 
against it by pope john paul ii and the shunning of the idea by the 
recently concluded vatican synod on the priesthood 
however surveys find majorities of american catholics would 
approve it and it comes to storied fruition in a new novel the 
shepherd and also flowers in the speculations of notre dame 
scholar the rev richard mcbrien 
in the novel the rev joseph f girzone an albany n y 
priest tells of a dutiful midwestern priest who is named a bishop 
and begins a series of drastic reforms 
these include assigning married priests to evangelizing tasks 
ordaining women as deacons a first step toward the priesthood and 
forming a unified ministry with lutheran methodist and episcopal 
bishops 
girzone whose previous bestselling novel joshua portrays 
a modernday jesus figure keeps joshua around in the new novel to 
advise and encourage the bishop in critical moments 
dont put new wine into old wineskins joshua advises old 
molds are part of the past and are not sacred new situations need 
new tools if the church is to help people through difficult 
times 
the publisher has sent copies of the novel to all the countrys 
cardinals archbishops and some bishops 
the fictional bishop david campbell meets stiff opposition even 
on his own staff but gets confidential support by many bishops 
though they fear to take similar steps 
he also has the secret backing of the pope himself who strives 
to hold off upset vatican officials on the popes death the 
reformer campbell by a fluke of circumstances succeeds him 
mcbrien head of the theology department of the university of 
notre dame envisions the reforms as coming with the conjectured 
election of a new pope john xxiv about the end of the decade 
in a syndicated column mcbrien says the imaginary new pope 
named after the late reforming pope john xxiii immediately 
announces the calling of another ecumenical council vatican iii 
among its surmised concerns would be the churchs ban on 
contraception ignored by most catholics the shortage of priests 
the requirement of priestly celibacy and the ordination of women 
i expect that some members of the church who were pleased with 
many ecclesiastical policies during the past decade will not be 
comfortable with the changes i have announced the fancied new 
pope tells a news conference 
he nullifies the vaticans recently promulgated loyalty oath 
and expanded profession of faith for priests and announces the 
resignation of the vaticans doctrinal watchdog cardinal joseph 
ratzinger 
the church itself must remain acutely conscious of its own 
sinfulness and weakness the new pope says that is why i will 
issue no call for discipline and obedience unless it is good news 
and unless it is obedience to the reign of god which is a reign of 
justice and peace 
unlike the previous vatican council the imaginary new one would 
include lay persons as well as bishops as many women as men and 
delegates of other christian churches would have the right to 
participate in debates 
as the church enters a new century and a new millennium we 
must show the world what it means to be a community of 
understanding of patience of mercy and compassion says the 
fancied new pope 
in girzones novel the shepherd the reformist us bishop 
also finally becomes pope but only after his revamping of church 
practices gets him exiled to an isolated desert post 
girzone keeps his theology folksy writing in a simple almost 
fairytale style his previous novel joshua has sold nearly a 
million copies 
in the new novel the bishop gets regular encouragement from the 
almost ubiquitous joshua about the difficulties of introducing new 
and revitalizing forms of ministry 
god is concerned about his children not about structures 
which exist only to aid gods children joshua says when you 
ask yourself what would jesus do the answer is simple but to 
follow is the way of the cross 
church leaders are no different than anyone they may have 
the good of the church at heart but they like others rarely ask 
what would jesus do

new york ap episcopal presiding bishop edmond l browning 
has criticized a recent fundraising letter by an episcopal faction 
as a total fabrication 
the letter sent by the rev todd wetzel executive director of 
episcopalians united for revelation renewal and reformation said 
browning supports not only inclusive language but also the 
ordination of practicing homosexuals and blessing of homosexual 
unions 
after wetzel rejected brownings request to retract the letter

straight wetzel said the eurrr apologized for the tone of part 
of the letter but we believe that he is in favor of those three 
items 
 
st louis ap reporting on a study of jewish division into 
orthodox conservative and reform wings queens college sociologist 
samuel heilman told the executive council of the american jewish 
committee 
majorities of both rabbis and rabbinical students do not think 
that american jews were ever unified rather most of both groups 
believe with the exception of the orthodox that jewish unity is 
not as important as pluralism 
 
washington ap a joint eastern orthodoxroman catholic 
statement affirms common beliefs about the sanctity of marriage 
but notes that differences in practice remain on such matters as 
divorce and remarriage 
a dialogue tem of bishops of the two traditions at an october 
meeting in johnstown pa said both see marriage as a way to 
experience through human love the liberating effect of divine 
love 
the statement noted that the orthodox churches permit divorce 
and remarriage under certain circumstances while in roman 
catholicism a second marriage is approved only if the previous one 
is found to have been null 
it also was noted that in orthodox marriages the priest is the 
minister of the sacrament while catholicism considers the 
couple as ministering the sacrament to each other to which the 
priest is witness

civil rights advocates are questioning 
president bushs commitment to fighting discrimination despite the 
administrations aggressive prosecution of some groundbreaking 
voting rights and housing bias cases 
they cite bushs veto of the civil rights act of 1990 which 
would have made it easier for victims of discrimination to sue 
their employers 
that fallout is going to take some time to clear said drew 
days who ran the civil rights division under president carter 
ralph neas executive director of the leadership conference on 
civil rights had a harsher assessment once again we have an 
administration defying the bipartisan consensus that exists on 
civil rights he said 
still civil rights leaders acknowledge there are bright spots 
in the bush administrations record 
bush actively courted black voters during the 1988 campaign 
invited coretta scott king to the republican national convention 
and spoke about healing racial divisions he is credited with 
appointing more blacks to political jobs than his predecessor 
ronald reagan 
attorney general dick thornburgh tried to reestablish ties with 
civil rights leaders that were left badly frayed by conservative 
william bradford reynolds who ran the justice departments civil 
rights division under president reagan 
he also played a major role in ensuring passage of the americans 
with disabilities act which bars discrimination against people 
with mental and physical handicaps 
the justice department also has made enforcement a priority 
adding lawyers to bring cases under a new statute that expands the 
governments authority to counter housing discrimination 
it has forced municipalities to drop restrictions against group 
homes for mentally retarded people the agency recently won a jury 
verdict against a landlord for refusing to rent apartments to a 
drug program to house recovering addicts 
the justice department filed suit to force the allmale virginia 
military institute to admit women cadets it moved to overturn 
georgias election system which it says discriminates against 
black office seekers 
when i came here it was with the understanding with the 
attorney general that i would be responsible for the vigorous and 
the complete enforcement of the civil rights laws said john 
dunne who was named assistant attorney general for civil rights 
after the senate judiciary committee blocked bushs first nominee 
william lucas 
no matter what the subject area we have been extremely 
aggressive dunne said 
civil rights advocates want more 
they are going to have to make a record across the board its 
not going to be sufficient to carve out enclaves where they are 
vigorous and leaving others untouched and uncared for days said 
neas says he finds very few substantive differences in 
justice department policy from the reagan administration when it 
was headed by attorney general edwin meese iii 
and on many major issues of dispute involving the 1990 civil 
rights bill the thornburgh justice department was much worse 
than the meese justice department neas said 
thornburgh strikes you as being the planet jupiter a failed 
star you would have anticipated much more from him said barbara 
arnwine an attorney for the lawyers committee for civil rights 
under law 
the bill bush vetoed would have restored an evolving legal 
standard dating back 18 years for discrimination cases involving 
employer policies that have a disparate impact on women and 
minorities 
bush said it would spawn hiring quotas by encouraging businesses 
to employ and promote minorities simply to avoid costly court 
suits 
civil rights lawyers accuse the president of using divisive 
rhetoric to mischaracterize the bill which contained language 
stating that no provision was designed to promote quotas 
its dividing people when this was the president who was going 
to try to heal those divisions said william taylor a washington 
civil rights lawyer 
both taylor and arnwine charge that the bush administration 
wants to eliminate disparate impact cases to protect business 
from the costs of discrimination suits 
they believe that if somebody didnt intend to discriminate 
they shouldnt be held accountable arnwine said 
dunne rejected this view providing figures showing that the 
since bush took office the civil rights division has brought nine 
disparateimpact suits against state and local governments 
but civil rights activists contend that the department wastes 
valuable time and resources pursuing reverse discrimination cases 
such as a recent lawsuit accusing the maryland lottery commission 
of discriminating against white males by setting aside 12 positions 
for women and minorities 
we dont apologize for bringing reverse discrimination 
cases said roger clegg one of dunnes deputies who also served 
in the reagan administration the law requires us to enforce the 
law in an evenhanded fashion 
the bitterness that lingers following bushs veto is fueled by 
charges that the administration failed to bargain in good faith 
with the bills supporters 
the sense of many in the civil rights community is that the 
administration strung people along giving them the sense there 
really was room for negotiations and compromise when there really 
wasnt days said 
the administration is going to have to work very hard to 
reestablish its good faith he said

economic and political problems 
are growing in brazil and president fernando collor de mellos 
conservative government is under attack from all sides 
businessmen say the country is being driven into an unnecessary 
recession labor leaders complain that paychecks are eaten up by 
inflation 
professional grous rail against authoritarian government 
officials and even collors congressional allies are in open 
rebellion 
the government is growing increasingly isolated said walder 
de goes a political science professor at the university of 
brasilia it has lost almost all support from organized sectors 
of society the president must show a greater willingness to 
negotiate and less arrogance 
inflation has risen steadily since may it totaled 137 percent 
last month and many observers predict nearly 20 percent in 
december 
business bankruptcies are up unemployment is increasing and a 
steep recession appears to be developing 
bad economic news has led to harsh public confrontations between 
the government and businessmen who had been collors most 
enthusiastic backers the president has said corporations cause 
inflation by not reducing their profit margins 
we need more love for our motherland instead of for only 
whats in our pockets he told brazilian reporters during a trip 
to japan in november 
in response businessmen say they are being made scapegoats for 
the administrations economic failures 
just because theyre too incompetent to beat inflation we 
cant all be held responsible antonio ermirio de moraes 
director of the huge conglomerate grupo votorantim said in an 
interview with the rio daily o globo he also said there were 
thieves in the government and justice minister jarbas 
passarinho threatened him with legal action 
jair meneguelli president of the workers central union the 
largest and most radical labor federation has threatened to 
withdraw from governmentsponsored talks on a national social 
pact 
one round was postponed in november and meneguelli said his 
union would meet with its traditional enemy the federation of 
industries of sao paulo state to draw up a joint proposal for the 
social pact negotiations 
the government has reason to fear this union because capital 
and labor have a strength and that strength can change the 
governments plans said the union leader who represents 12 
million workers 
early in november the brazilian bar association urged collor to 
reverse a decree limiting the sex and violence content of 
television programs in prime time tales castelo branco 
association president said the decree was unconstitutional and 
amounted to censorship 
presidential spokesman claudio humberto rosa e silva responded 
id like to suggest the association president return to school 
and if he lacks the humility to return to school he should at 
least read the constitution 
at a ceremony launching a lowincome housing program collor 
declared no one is going to put a straitjacket on this 
president im going to continue to work for the needy without 
fear of those who want to continue oppressing our people with lies 
radicalism and violence 
a poll published by the newspaper folha de sao paulo indicated 
support for collors economic austerity measures was at a record 
low the survey conducted in brazils 10 largest cities found 43 
percent of respondents opposed 26 percent supporting collor and 
the rest neutral 
in midnovember the government suffered several important 
defeats in congress where it technically has a comfortable 
majority collor lost one vote on retirement benefits by a 
humiliating 26441 
the government has a majority but not an organized 
majority it commands said rep gastone righi of the conservative

his party would now condition its support on economic results 
renan calheiros collors longtime political ally quit as the

southern hemisphere summer 
public opinion is basically shut down for the next few 
months he said if the government can regain control of the 
economy in the near future collor will be able to recoup at least 
part of his prestige

the disorder is often misdiagnosed in adults and 
even when identified some physicians are reluctant to prescribe 
the proper medication speed and related stimulants it was 
discovered that the hyperactive child syndrome persisted into 
adulthood in 1971 but now scientists are upping the numbers for 
the adult population 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
up to seven million american adults may be 
suffering from a disorder they dont know they have it was first 
described in the medical literature in 1902 but its name is still 
being debated 
most of these adults know something is wrong but they dont 
know what says dr alan zametkin a psychiatrist at the national 
institutes of mental health 
best known as the hyperactive child syndrome the scientific 
name is attention deficit hyperactivity disorder residual type 
adhdrt when it persists into adulthood 
in 1971 dr paul wender of the university of utah a pioneer in 
the field recognized that it sometimes persisted into adulthood 
since then researchers have found increasing numbers of adults 
still suffering from the syndrome it is now estimated that 40 
percent to 60 percent of diagnosed childhood cases persist 
about 3 percent to 6 percent of all children are diagnosed with 
the disorder it is the most common reason for referrals to mental 
health specialists 
it is generally accepted that it affects five times more boys 
than girls but university of yale medical school pediatrician dr 
sally shaywitz believes girls are significantly undercounted 
it is the squeaky wheel that gets referred the child who 
appears motor driven cannot stay in his seat cannot concentrate 
cannot wait for his turn speaks out in classrooms has a short 
attention span an insatiable need for attention is very 
impulsive appears far too independent for his age has few social 
skills and frequently bullies other children 
twothirds of adhd children also suffer from a specific 
development disorder dyslexia being the most common 
those missed are often milder cases or very bright children who 
really may not have to concentrate children with no comorbidity 
and children who do not outwardly manifest the hyperactivity 
some adult cases especially those not diagnosed in childhood 
can be difficult to diagnose other psychiatric problems may 
accompany the disorder and physicians just arent looking for it 
the reason the diagnosis is often missed is that it is never 
even considered says dr ivan goldberg a new york city 
psychopharmacologist who treats adult cases 
one who agrees is dr barry garfinkel director of child and 
adolescent psychiatry at the university of minnesota and chairman 
of the committee that will seek to redefine and perhaps rename the 
disorder for the diagnostic and statistical manual dsm iv due 
out in 1993 
we trained doctors to believe adhd disappeared with 
adolescence the patients whom we didnt train are way ahead of the 
clinicians says dr garfinkel if you throw in a patient 
without the hyperactivity the physician for sure would be at a 
real loss in putting it all together 
the core of the disorder is the attention deficit not the 
hyperactivity despite its name the hyperactivity is the most 
dramatically recognizable symptom however there are cases where 
the hyperactivity is not present and the sufferer appears 
hypoactive scientists say only 10 percent lack hyperactivity 
the sad thing is that up to 85 percent can be helped with 
medication most sufferers feel isolated and alone not realizing 
they have so much company or that medication is available 
the disorder untreated can destroy lives some women who 
suspect something is wrong have chosen not to have children because 
they did not want to pass along this monster with no name others 
are working in jobs far beneath their intellectual abilities the 
prison population is probably rife with sufferers 
many adults retain traces of the hyperactivity but have learned 
to cope in such a way that it is not so evident but the attention 
deficit has not decreased 
zametkins research using a pet scan on 25 adhd adults and 50 
normal controls was the lead article in the prestigious new england 
journal of medicine on nov 15 an accompanying editorial by dr 
gabrielle weiss of montreal childrens hospital said the findings 
represent a clear advance in our understanding of 
hyperactivity 
zametkin found that the parts of the brain that control 
attention dont work as hard as normal brains it may be the best 
evidence yet that an abnormality in the brain is at the root of the 
problem 
im not going to say its the cause said zametkin but 
its possible this has something to do with the cause 
wender suggested that the cortex the higher part of the brain 
may be sluggish because of faulty control signals from a more 
primitive part of the brain 
dr c thomas gualtieri a neuro psychiatrist at the university 
of north carolina in chapel hill predicts that within five years 
pet scans will be able to diagnose the disorder 
that would certainly have helped one man blessed with 
extraordinary intellectual gifts he was hypoactive and guesses he 
saw 20 psychologists and psychiatrists before he got what is 
probably the correct diagnosis attention deficit disorder without 
hyperactivity 
he prefers to remain anonymous but describes his attention 
deficits 
i claw for every word in reading writing and speaking he 
says appearing laconic as he struggles for precisely the right 
word 
his brain fleet agile and retentive is cursed to move at the 
anguished gait of a tortoise to even touch his gifts requires 
herculean efforts and untold time 
ignorance here would indeed be bliss but that is not the 
reality

the great lakes huron erie ontario michigan and superior 
were for a period rich in history and lore the main american 
arteries of commerce 
timber to build cities floated down from the canadian shores 
iron ore to make steel sailed out of superior grain stone coal 
and copper filled cargo holds but the ships also carried human 
cargo and their belongings fur traders immigrants pioneers 
laborers homesteaders 
the wooden boats and steel freighters never were a match for the 
sudden fury of the inland seas where unexpected west winds in an 
afternoon can drive up waves three stories high 
the great storm of 1913 a sixday blow sank 10 ships and 
killed 235 seamen gales from 1878 to 1898 ravaged nearly 6000 
ships and sank more than 1000 of them 
modern ships have fared little better in 1964 a huron storm 
tore the ore freighter daniel j morell in half only one of its 
crew of 29 survived eleven years later the freighter edmund 
fitzgerald and its crew of 29 went down in superior seconds after 
the captain radioed that he was holding his own 
the great lakes have become an archaeologists paradise where 
the water is deep and cold decay is arrested and each wreck 
remains a frozen moment of history 
the preservation is so remarkable that bodies can last for 
years skeletons for centuries archaeologists excavating the wreck 
of the rockaway in lake michigan found the remains of salted meat 
in the galley and rope made from corn leaves still sitting in a pot 
used to mix caulking the schooner went down in 1891 
the sort of hollywood concept of what a shipwreck looks like 
actually exists in the great lakes said rockaway archaeologist 
ken pott from his museum in south haven mich short of a 
skeleton lashed to the wheel its all there 
for example the hamilton and the scourge two canadian 
battleships from the war of 1812 went down in 300 feet of water in 
lake ontario pott says a searcher using submersible cameras found 
the ship intact replete with cutlasses cannons guns bones and 
masts 
but the conservation work of maritime archaeologists such as 
pott is up against an army of black marketeers and souvenir 
seekers 
simple wood blocks that litter wrecks by the hundreds fetch 500 
in an antiques store collectors will pay 10000 for a ships bell 
or a wood steering wheel a carved ships figurehead is almost 
priceless 
such stripping was legal in michigan until 1980 when the state 
passed a law allowing salvage only under permit wisconsin only 
recently toughened its law all of the great lakes states and 
ontario outlaw stripping to some degree but some such as 
michigan are willing to grant salvage permits especially to 
divers picking up things for museums 
archaeological surveys take years the pillage can occur 
overnight witness the fate of the us coast guard cutter 
mesquite 
that crippled buoy tender was buried at sea last july dropped 
intact to the bottom of lake superior 
the stripping started immediately dinner plates from the boats 
galley tools from the work rooms hard hats from lockers dress 
jackets out of the closets of crew members 
i am appalled at what happened says michigan archaeologist 
john halsey in lansing it was like a feeding frenzy were 
talking in hours in days 
because of that many explorers go to great pains to hide their 
discoveries charles feltner an engineer for ford motor co found 
the 1856 wreck of the brig sandusky in the straits of mackinac he 
dove on it for years in secrecy then he made the find public 
people stripped the thing in a couple of months feltner 
says things like dishes tools all the blocks belaying pins 
deadeyes you name it 
the original ships rams head figurehead no longer remains 
divers bolted it back down after someone tried to steal it too 
wouldbe looters persisted until divers removed the original for 
preservation and last year installed a lookalike 
that was 10 years ago feltner thinks the advent of divers such 
as biniecki signals a change in ethic today feltner feels the 
looting would take years not months 
its still bad enough to where divers 25 years from now arent 
going to have much to look at feltner says the whole idea of 
seeing a virgin wreck will be gone

barking dogs are barking two black pugs 
petey malcolm their owner sylvia sidney calls out 
quiet you be quiet in there the barking heard from the 
bedroom of her hotel suite quickly fades 
animals hardly intimidate an actress who faced down football 
players in beetlejuice sidney is 80 years old a tiny woman 
built to last last spring she caught pneumonia and was 
hospitalized for several weeks but she gets around quite well now 
not even needing a cane 
luck and excellent medical care are the secrets she 
insists also a strong mind sidney has no use for sentimentality 
she doesnt gush about her old movies and shrugged off a tribute 
being given by the film society of lincoln center on nov 30 
joking if they dont get to it now god knows what is going to 
happen 
her colors today black leather pants and matching vest a black 
turtleneck sweater and gold rings and bracelets the eyes are 
bluegreen large and round ready for anything acting is 
listening she notes and just watching her eyes will give you an 
idea of what shes thinking lighting up when shes excited or 
rolling in disbelief 
ugh god she groans as she remembers alfred hitchcocks 
sabotage a 1936 thriller in which sidney murders her husband 
oscar homolka after discovering hes a saboteur 
if you did not know i was already an established fine actress 
if you had never heard of me had never heard of homolka you would 
have looked at it and said what are those people doing 
it was all hitchcock it had nothing to do with people acting 
it was carefully timed it was easy to indulge in the ego my 
performance but it was because of hitchcock he was a cinema 
man 
shes equally dryeyed about todays movies most young 
directors dont impress her i think im too tough for 
spielberg she snaps tim burton of beetlejuice is an 
exception 
i turned it down so many times because i couldnt understand 
the script says sidney who played a cranky social worker from 
the great beyond i finally had a long conversation with them 
and they said read the script again i said youll have to send 
another one because i threw the other one away so they sent me one 
again 
i had never heard of tim burton he met me the morning i 
arrived in california we had breakfast together we had lunch 
together and i was in love his sensitivity how he thought 
about scenes 
look what happened with that film alec baldwin geena davis 
winona ryder she was just a baby then she used to hang around 
me a lot i think because her mother said whispering shes an 
old actress 
sidney a descendant of russian jews was born sophia kosow in 
new york city in 1910 her parents were divorced when she was 
young and her mother took another husband dr sigmund sidney a 
dental surgeon 
she began taking dancing lessons at age 10 and was a teenager 
when she made her stage debut appearing in the title role of the 
theatre guilds production of prunella in 1926 after breaking 
into films in the late 20s sidney became one of paramounts five 
leading actresses along with claudette colbert marlene dietrich 
miriam hopkins and carole lombard 
the others were tough and sharpwitted the way sidney is in 
person but her specialty ironically was playing victims the 
slum girl who loses her boyfriend to a socialite in an american 
tragedy shelly winters had the same role in the 1951 remake a 
place in the sun the nice girlfriend of racketeer gary cooper 
in city streets the nice girlfriend of falsely accused 
murderer spencer tracy in fury 
tracy james cagney and other leading men were good guys men 
of the theater she also has kind words for cary grant who made 
madame butterfly with her in 1932 a poorly regarded film that 
came out a few years before grant became a major star 
a few years ago i got the surprise of my life sidney 
recalled they were showing madame butterfly up in rochester 
ny and i came in at the end of the film i saw a closeup of 
cary grant and it was one of the most extraordinary pieces of 
acting i had seen he was more talented than we thought he was 
she liked fury director fritz lang and william howard who 
worked with her on the 1935 film mary burns fugitive another 
personal favorite is rouben mamoulian the director of city 
streets whom sidney credits with helping her to develop as a 
film actress 
oh indeed indeed she says brightly if it hadnt been 
for mamoulian i wouldnt have been in films ever first of all 
i had great faith in him because i had known him in new york and 
he talked my language theater also i was thrown in that part so 
quickly i didnt know which way was up he said dont worry ill 
take care of you 
sidney endured quite well in 1973 she received an academy 
award nomination for best supporting actress for summer wishes 
winter dreams in which she played joanne woodwards mother she 
won a golden globe in 1986 and was nominated for an emmy for an 
early frost 
she married three times all ending in divorce and had one 
child jacob who died in the mid1980s of lou gehrigs disease 
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis sidney has done extensive work for 
the national als foundation 
now living in a house in danbury conn sidneys hobbies 
include gardening and needlepoint about which she has written two 
books she also makes occasional trips to manhattan 
her illness changed her priorities she says and she plans to 
leave all her money to charities such as covenant house anything 
to do with children 
i plan to die without a nickel she notes calmly i will 
be penniless but not a pauper it will all be gone at least 
whats in cash the rest will be disseminated among my friends 
but sidney has plenty to do right now malcolm and petey are 
barking again its lunchtime their lunchtime they need to be 
fed quiet she shouts be patient rice is on the menu 
one of their favorite dishes a special treat for her beloved pets 
and as the actress turns and faces the bedroom theres no doubt 
those dogs will eat every morsel

before the tears dried before the body was 
cremated tshirts and posters hit the streets in death john 
lennon gained immortality partly through his music and partly 
through the merchandising efforts of his widow yoko ono on the 
10th anniversary of his slaying the author of revolution and 
working class hero has become a cottage industry 
 
imagine no possessions 
i wonder if you can 
no need for greed or hunger 
a brotherhood of man john lennon imagine 
 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
imagine coffee mugs and tote bags imagine 
greeting cards and prescription eyewear imagine doodles turned 
into limitededition prints 
in the 10 years since john lennons murder such items have 
become part of the legacy of the exbeatle eternal rebel and 
author of such songs as revolution working class hero and 
gimme some truth 
lennons death on dec 8 1980 ended his comeback after five 
years as a reclusive homebody but his name face and voice are 
still out and about thanks largely to the enthusiastic efforts of 
his widow 
since 1981 i promised myself and the fans that i would 
keep on dishing out something of johns every year yoko ono said 
in an interview a few days before lennons 50th birthday on oct 9 
i simply dont like the idea that john would just become a 
library item 
a library item no but posthumously lennon has become a 
cottage industry living in the cottage of course is ono and 
her constant companion sam havadtoy 
their office studio one is on the ground floor of the gothic 
dakota apartment house where lennon was killed as yoko looked on 
the wall behind havadtoys desk is covered with lennons photos and 
album covers a reminder of who still makes the money here 
attempts to cash in on lennons memory began even before his 
body was cremated laura senft recalls working in a rochester 
ny record shop the day after lennon was shot when she received 
a phone call from someone peddling a john lennon frisbee she hung 
up but offers of lennon dinnerware and charm bracelets followed in 
quick order 
ono was never involved in this flood of lowbudget merchandise 
she spent her days holed up in the dakota with son sean but a year 
after the slaying ono was back running the lennon empire 
she ended the 1980s with a reported net worth of 500 million 
yet she says bad karma dogged her through the decade 
double fantasy producer jack douglas collected about 27 
million in a settlement with ono after suing her for royalties 
elephants memory the backup band at lennon and onos 1972 
madison square garden concert sued for 70 million claiming in 
the process that yoko was musically so inept that her keyboard was 
unplugged during the show 
ono had to pay an undisclosed amount to the writers of the song 
makin whoopee for copyright infringement in her own song 
im your angel 
in his acerbic biography the lives of john lennon albert 
goldman depicted the legend as a vain anorexic hypocrite who spent 
much of the last five years of his life in a drugged haze 
fred seaman lennons former assistant systematically stole 
lennons diaries tapes and slides from the dakota he pleaded 
guilty to seconddegree grand larceny and received five years 
probation 
ono locked horns with lennons exwife cynthia over the best 
way to mark johns 50th birthday yoko reportedly undercut 
cynthias plans by refusing to allow any of lennons music to be 
played at the latters planned tribute her own concert in 
liverpool was described as an uneven tribute in rolling stone 
equals 
on the night of dec 8 1980 john lennon was returning home 
with ono after a session for her walking on thin ice single he 
stepped from the limousine and moved toward the entrance of the 
dakota apartments 
a demented fan mark david chapman was waiting on the sidewalk 
with a copy of the catcher in the rye and a charter arms 
38caliber revolver after lennon passed him he opened fire 
the slaying produced a worldwide outpouring of grief tens of 
thousands of people gathered in new yorks central park for a 
ceremony that culminated in 10 minutes of silence the dakota front 
gate became an instant shrine three distraught fans committed 
suicide 
but even as john lennon died his legend had been born lennon 
and onos double fantasy lp was climbing to the top of the 
charts and starting over was to become his most successful 
single 
magazines were filled with lennons story how he and ono 
rescued their relationship after lennons 18month lost weekend 
in los angeles in the mid70s how he took several years off to 
help raise his son sean how he had agonized about ever recording 
and playing again 
that image prophet of peace and love devoted family man 
seminal rocker was virtually uncontested for eight years until 
the publication of goldmans 719page barrage goldmans lennon was 
a violent liverpool thug who descended into a howard hugheslike 
world of drugs and paranoia 
but lennons life so glaringly public and intensely documented 
served to refute some of goldmans charges imagine a movie 
culled from vaults of previously unreleased film footage showed a 
healthy and happy lennon making love to his wife talking about 
life and politics singing his own songs 
imagine was just one of lennons many forays in the decade 
lennon was married to his first wife cynthia when he met ono at 
a london art show in the late 60s in short order lennon divorced 
his wife married yoko and in 1970 left the beatles john and 
yoko collaborated on everything bedins avantgarde films music 
and finally a son sean born in 1975

at this point lennon says he became a househusband to their 
child while yoko ran the family business the arrangement continued 
until lennon told the woman he called mother it was time to 
make music again double fantasy followed just before johns 
death although it was not to be lennons swan song 
bruce springsteen has released three albums since 1980 michael 
jackson two in contrast lennon or more accurately ono has 
released five albums milk and honey menlove ave the 
movie soundtrack imagine the john lennon live in new 
york collection and a boxed cd collection for christmas 90 
in addition the lost lennon tapes featuring hours of 
unreleased lennon music became a popular syndicated radio program 
ono has overseen all these projects 
people ask me what would he have done in the 80s i say 
lets talk about what he has done in the 80s because he has 
definitely she said in spirit i think hes alive and were 
getting the benefit 
others charge ono with turning her memories into millions 
without concern for lennons image a fame magazine profile derided 
her as the merry widow the nowdefunct weekly 7 days described 
her as the decades premier celebrity civil defendant 
greed insensitivity egomania none of onos alleged faults are 
apparent in an interview 
in october a barefoot ono greeted a visitor to the dakota in a 
highceilinged firstfloor room with white carpet and black onyx 
walls curled up on a chair she serenely sipped herbal tea from a 
mug decorated with a lennon drawing of john and yoko with the 
inscription grow old with me 
the mug is one of an assortment of lennon collectibles available 
by appointment only from bag one arts inc the entity that 
controls reproductions of lennons art work 
some of that black on white artwork which includes doodles 
jotted down on napkins the margins of letters or stray scraps of 
paper has been colorized or redone in neon at onos order 
people would ask if we had anything in color says lynne 
clifford who runs bag one for yoko and yoko said i feel 
confident enough to add the color myself so she took the original 
sketches and we made plates and she added colors 
lithographs that sold for 400 four years ago have increased as 
much as 10 times in value she says and new ones cost between 600 
and 700 
although bag ones gallery a few blocks from the dakota deals 
primarily in lithographs it also sells the collectibles including 
3 laminated bags that bear lennons drawings 
yoko wanted everybody to be able to walk away with 
something explained clifford 
where does all the money go 
yoko is very funny about saying where the money goes 
but some goes to the spirit foundation she said the foundation 
established by lennon and ono before johns death has contributed 
to causes ranging from a home for drug addicted children to 
bulletproof vests for police officers 
is there anything that will never bear lennons sketchwork 
socks clifford said yoko said she couldnt imagine people 
walking around on johns drawings 
back at the dakota ono receives a familiar question is this 
all commercialism has the iconoclastic exbeatle been sold out 
she laughs 
no i didnt sell out john and im sure john would be happy 
im still keeping him out there theres a commercial aspect 
yes but i mean why not i was a partner and i still feel that 
im a partner

drummer andy newmark was touring with roxy music 
in the summer of 1980 when he got the call that changed his life 
he was to play on john lennons new album 
lennon had been in virtual seclusion for five years busy taking 
care of his son sean and admittedly out of songwriting ideas but 
in 1980 he suddenly felt inspired again and planned to return to 
the studio to make an album with his wife yoko ono 
it was more than a superstar session afterall lennon gave no 
press conferences and didnt attend clubs or concerts rare photos 
occasionally emerged and he looked different in each one lennon 
jokingly referred to himself as greta hughes and howard 
garbo 
producer jack douglas who had worked with lennon as an 
engineer recruited newmark bassist tony levin guitarist hugh 
mccracken and other new yorkbased sessions players recording was 
to take place at the hit factory in manhattan 
to newmark lennon was a hero and only a hero he didnt know 
him and was nervous about working with him the drummer guessed he 
was something like the intense irreverent young man of the movies 
help and a hard days night lennon was those things and 
more 
his personality seemed so consistent with all we had ever 
heard about john lennon said newmark who still lives in new 
york and works with former roxy music singer bryan ferry 
his straightforwardness was as visible and apparant as the 
stories and images we had created i didnt see anything that 
seemed startlingly new to the myth it just appeared to be what we 
had imagined down to earth direct so direct it could not offend 
people 
newmark spent just one month in the studio playing on the songs 
that eventually ended up on double fantasy and milk and 
honey lennons final albums it was the best experience of my 
life he insisted the highlight of my career 
the nerves quickly settled once recording began lennon was 
just a working musician with the same goal as everyone else 
finishing the album the music was mostly mainstream pop no 
18minute jams or political anthems i hate all that fancy 
stuff lennon told his drummer keep it simple like ringo 
he was a happy man at this point and his singing was higher 
sweeter than on earlier albums lennon was hoping to get back in 
touch with his audience and the songs were melodic the production 
lush 
dear yoko and grow old with me were tributes to his 
wife beautiful boy darling boy was for sean lennon defended 
his selfimposed retirement on watching the wheels and summed 
up his feelings about turning 40 on borrowed time capping the 
line good to be older with a selfassured you bet 
between takes lennon jammed on buddy holly songs and played 
host sushi was the food of choice the strongest drug was 
brazilian coffee freshly ground guys im taking off lennon 
would say as he poured himself another cup 
and there were plenty of stories about the beatles the 
bs as john called them reunions were out of the question a 
return to adolescence in his opinion but talking about the old 
days seemed the nicest kind of high 
by this time he was old enough to look upon the work they did 
and be proud of it newmark said when he talked about the 
bs it was as if it was his band he was the spiritual leader i 
felt that a lot through the sessions 
by the fall newmark had finished working on the album and his 
contact with lennon was limited to an occasional visit to the 
studio but he had planned on working with him again milk and 
honey was to come out the following year and lennon wanted to 
tour using many of the same musicians 
life is what happens when youre busy making other plans 
lennon once sang 
it took the drummer a long time to recover from lennons murder 
the night of dec 8 1980 he didnt even feel like working for the 
next few years everything else suddenly seemed second rate 
newmark never listens to the record but still hears woman 
on the radio when he thinks about it now its not so much a 
particular song that hurts him its the daytoday stuff the 
jokes and wisecracks the coffee and the stories no one had a 
reason to remember all that at the time those werent supposed to 
be farewell sessions 
when i looked in his eyes i felt a tremendous depth of 
character and a tremendous understanding of the human condition a 
tremendous amount of compassion newmark said he was totally 
friendly and open to everybody including the janitor he had time 
for everybody that working class hero thing he was trying to be 
real about that

the numbers are black and white the reasons 
are decidedly gray 
in primetime television 91 percent of all directors are men 
of producers 85 percent are men of writers 75 percent are men 
a yearlong study titled whats wrong with this picture 
examined all 80 of last seasons primetime entertainment programs 
for their treatment of women both behind the camera and in front of 
it 
since its release by women in film and the washington dcbased 
national commission on working women the reports findings have 
been called shocking horrendous and bizarre by the few topranking 
females in the business but to ask why is to receive far more 
muted answers 
lynn loring the president of mgmpathe communications corps 
television division said discrimination is not easy to define 
i feel it more than see it loring said like when im in 
a room at an important meeting and theres 14 people at the 
conference table theres only one woman and thats me 
there is a boys club in television said loring and they play 
basketball together but i can outski all of them she added 
with characteristic dry wit im too short to play basketball 
lengthy interviews with some of the most powerful female 
television executives in hollywood produced a wide range of 
theories about why women are underrepresented in the tv industry 
the most common television mirrors society until there is 
equality for women in real life most of the women said there will 
be none for females in the makebelieve world of tv 
the second most common response i dont know 
of the women interviewed for this story not one said they had 
suffered sexual discrimination rather they said discrimination 
is so subtle and so far entrenched that it simply can be part of 
the landscape 
discrimination does not always mean a casting couch experience 
most of the time these women said it is insidious 
but betty friedan who helped launch the modern womens movement 
with her book the feminine mystique disagreed 
they may have never been told we wouldnt give you this show 
because youre a woman but theyre not giving shows to women the 
numbers dont lie it represents a kind of unconscious myopia 
friedan now heads women men and media a research foundation 
that reports on womens representation in the newspaper magazine 
broadcast and film industries 
the organizations reports have found that few newspaper 
publishers are women and that network television correspondents 
overwhelming tend to be men 
friedan calls the small number of female media executives a 
symbolic annihilation of women 
the figures she said speak for themselves you cant measure 
what doesnt exist 
of the 555 television characters surveyed in the women in film 
study with few notable exceptions most female roles perpetuated 
male fantasies of halfclad halfbrained women who needed to be 
rescued 
i would say that getting raped or being in jeopardy is 
probably the no 2 or no 3 job on television and in films today 
said linda bloodworththomason whose hit show designing women 
was one of a handful cited in the report as providing realistic 
depictions of women 
im so tired of women being depicted as mindless and 
unadventurous whining and victimized bloodworththomason said 
im embarrassed for my sex 
designing women chronicles the lives of the sugarbaker 
sisters and their two female colleagues who own their own interior 
design company in atlanta none of the women is mindless 
unadventurous or victimized 
not one has to have a man to be happy bloodworththomason 
said they talk about newsweek and rock lyrics and bad doctors 
they talk about the same things that men talk about 
bloodworththomason who with her husband harry thomason also 
produces evening shade the new cbs series starring burt 
reynolds marilu henner and hal holbrook was asked why there 
arent more women directing producing and writing for television 
i dont know she replied there is a good ol boys 
network you have to have something that they want so bad you can 
penetrate the network 
the programming chiefs of nbc cbs abc and the fox broadcasting 
co all are men none would comment for this story 
besides designing women the report lauded murphy brown 
and its acerbic title character played by candice bergen and 
china beach and its lead character the multifaceted nurse 
colleen mcmurphy played by dana delany 
john sacret young executive producer and cocreator of china 
beach called the reports statistics pretty shocking 
but he added in the 60s and 70s women were making great 
strides there was a door that was open very wide our society is 
now wrestling with a conservative leaning that has helped make that 
opening smaller 
loring of mgmpathe wonders if the whole problem of 
discrimination television or no might not be moot today if 
society was better at teaching equality than jumping up and down 
about it 
if in the last 10 years we had spent more time educating our 
children that girls can throw footballs too i dont think 
wed be in the shape were in today she said 
she also wonders why she doesnt hear more from women who want 
an equal opportunity in television 
out of the hundreds of writers who pitch to me maybe 5 
percent are women you tell me why when theres a woman president 
of a major television division why are those women not calling 
here to pitch to me i have had one call this entire season about a 
female director to maybe 250 calls about men directors 
the women who have attained power in the land of television say 
they probably didnt experience overt discrimination because they 
are not the types to be silent about it 
there are things i wont accept as a human being and i wont 
accept that loring said 
so she has never felt that her sex was a problem 
loring laughed i think my insolence and arrogance is worse 
she replied 
suzanne depasse the emmywinning executive producer of 
lonesome dove and president of gordydepasse productions 
formerly motown productions calls herself the ultimate 
hyphenate 
i will always be defined as a black woman producer said 
depasse it has been my experience that there is only one true 
way to have any impact and that is to do good work 
being militant about equal representation is not the answer 
depasse said neither is getting angry 
the only way to get more women into high positions is to let 
your good work speak for itself and to help other women on the way 
said depasse echoing statements made by the other female 
executives 
as much as i hate it im not willing to chuck my career in 
the porcelain receptacle to call attention to something thats 
obvious depasse said 
i can do far more in the position that im in than if i go 
burn a cross on the door of walt disney studios

in a closeknit town of 1400 people word 
has a way of getting around 
some folks now say it was known for years that douglas marks was 
molesting his male students but no one did anything about it 
how could it continue for three decades marks reputation as a 
devoted teacher peoples unwillingness to believe such improbable 
allegations the young victims reluctance to talk his wealthy and 
influential family which includes a brother who once was speaker 
of the montana house 
school board chairman david rieder dissects each theory and 
finally concludes that he just doesnt know 
it was fairly common knowledge of his sexual preference 
said rieder a rancher who has known marks all his life with all 
the psychological problems doug had for some reason these red 
flags went unheeded 
i think theres a tendency for everyone to submerge these bad 
thoughts i think people tend not to want to deal with the darker 
side of life and i include myself in that 
boulders loosely kept secret went public in february when 
marks 63 was charged with molesting four of his students between 
1985 and 1989 
he pleaded guilty and was sentenced nov 14 to 20 years in 
prison and ordered to pay 25000 for counseling for his young 
victims 
county attorney richard llewellyn said he knows marks molested 
at least 45 students including sons of victims he attacked a 
generation ago but some residents and victims say its likely 
marks molested several hundred students during the past three 
decades 
all the victims didnt remain silent 
we know now that they told some people rieder said 
the school board has hired two investigators to determine if 
teachers principals or counselors failed to protect students 
it was dr phillip pallister a physician who forced the school 
board to oust marks from boulders high school in 1959 for 
molesting three students who forced officials to investigate 
again 30 years later 
it also was pallister who helped marks get another teaching job 
in 1960 at nearby clancy where officials say four to five 
students may have been molested and pallister who encouraged the 
boulder school board to rehire marks as an elementary school 
teacher in 1965 
i thought of him as a homosexual then not as a pedophile 
pallister said calling his decision a terrible mistake 
paul myrhow now 24 said he first was molested by marks in a 
school restroom in 1980 after a seventhgrade sex education class 
marks had volunteered to teach their relationship continued for 
years 
myrhow blew the whistle twice the first time in 1985 when he 
approached daryl craft a longtime friend who had become a 
jefferson county deputy sheriff 
craft did not doubt the story he too had been molested by 
marks 
in my graduating class more than half were victims said 
the deputy who graduated in 1973 with 12 to 14 other boys if 
paul hadnt come forward i dont have any doubt that doug would 
still be doing the same thing 
and marks did do the same thing for five more years all four 
of the offenses to which he pleaded guilty in july occurred after 
myrhow first reported him 
craft took myrhow to sheriff tom dawson who later told the 
deputy that he was having trouble locating victims and witnesses 
myrhow had named pallister said he knows the sheriff investigated 
but no charge was filed and marks continued to teach 
the sheriff wont talk about it 
myrhow said he believes marks molested boys in every class 
every year but that the boys apparently never told one another 
sometimes i think he would be molesting every male in his 
class and sometimes only one or two myrhow said 
marks began recruiting boys in elementary grades with 
touching and petting then arranged to take them on school trips in 
the seventh or eighth grades myrhow said 
hed usually take three kids because if you had two double 
beds one would get stuck with sleeping with him 
myrhow is certain that townspeople knew what was going on 
at a bar that marks favored myrhow said doug would come in 
for a sandwich and when he left people would joke about who he was 
taking on trips this year 
llewellyn said he doubts the molestation was widely known in 
this rocky mountain ranching and mining town some victims told him 
their parents did not believe them and some said they did not tell 
their parents 
some tried to tell some school people but the message 
oftentimes was missed llewellyn said some of the victims 
apparently were trying to tell people for some time 
myrhow persisted in june 1989 he made his second effort to 
expose marks this time he went to pallister 
pallister took myrhow to llewellyn who asked the state attorney 
generals office for help but when school began marks still was 
teaching and pallister found that none of the victims myrhow had 
identified had been contacted 
pressed by pallister llewellyn hired his own investigator in 
december and accumulated enough evidence within two months to file 
charges 
as a teacher theres no argument marks was widely admired he 
quietly donated part of his salary to the school each year spent 
vacations painting the school and bought shoes for needy students 
two sections of the high school were dedicated to him wall 
plaques quietly removed after his guilty plea extolled his 
years of service to the community 
but eyebrows were raised over the fact that marks lived in the 
elementary school except on weekends sleeping on a cot in the 
nurses room 
that bothered me rieder said but i didnt do anything 
though some people still strongly defend him rieder said marks 
had steady detractors 
there were people who wanted him out of there rieder said 
there was a lot of anger things under the surface i was hoping 
doug would resign for several years 
im tired of hearing he was such a good teacher that it 
justifies anything he was harming kids in ways other than the 
sexual molesting psychological abuse 
lillian larson a substitute teacher who graduated from high 
school with marks in 1944 is one who fears the good he did will be 
forgotten she does not dispute that he is guilty though she says 
many of the offenses were patting and pinching and have been 
overblown by the news media 
i dont know how to tell you how i feel about it she said 
guilty is guilty its just that i feel sorry for him hes my 
friend 
why did it take 30 years to stop marks 
i dont think the system failed said former school board 
chairman jan anderson it worked just right marks is out of 
the classroom at last and thats the important thing she said 
it will be four years before marks is eligible for parole one 
condition imposed by the sentencing judge would prohibit him from 
having contact with anyone younger than 18 
the longterm effects on his victims and on the town of 
boulder are uncertain 
the school board has set aside an initial fund of 3000 for 
students who request counseling and some have responded rieder 
said 
i think in the long run were going to be a community where 
any kind of abuse sexual or otherwise simply is not going to 
happen again he said 
i guess well never know the full extent of it i guess thats 
part of the shock of it

zhang yueliang set out from qufu in northeastern 
china with five tons of fresh grapes in his truck by the time he 
reached his destination 550 miles down the coast hed lost the 
grapes and nearly his shirt 
all along the way he found roadblocks set up by local 
governments charging for the right to pass he handed over his 
cash a tarpaulin finally grapes when zhang reached the buyer 
five days late the remaining grapes were rotten 
the peoples daily told zhangs story and quoted him as saying 
if they dont get the roadblocks under control no one will dare 
work in transport 
beijing once could have solved the problem with an edict 
prohibiting such local customs barriers today regional conflicts 
are too strong and the central governments moral and economic 
power has eroded 
as national leaders try to develop an economic plan to lead the 
country into the 21st century they are forced to consider not just 
what will work or be ideologically correct but what strong special 
interests will accept 
the one man who used to keep everyone working together 
86yearold deng xiaoping has lost prestige since endorsing the 
army attack on prodemocracy demonstrators last year his public 
appearances are rarer than ever and appeals to his authority 
appear to have little effect 
nothing illustrates the leadership vacuum better than the 
governments inability to produce new five and tenyear plans the 
basic blueprints of chinas economy the current plans expire dec 
31 
premier li peng has said the central committee of the ruling 
communist party will meet before years end to discuss new plans 
before that the party wants a consensus among provincial and 
central officials on spending priorities new development projects 
and economic reforms drafts have been circulated and meetings 
held but there are few signs of progress 
provincial governments are competing for state aid and other 
favors 
i suggest that all keep a clear head li told one gathering 
of provincial officials after apparently being besieged by 
petitions for new development zones 
all five existing special economic zones areas of capitalist 
experimentation and technological growth are along the coast and 
western provinces want a share they also seek higher prices for 
their coal iron and other raw materials which are sold to eastern 
factories at discount rates 
an influential government economist ma hong publicly endorsed 
the western provinces plea last week and advocated giving the 
region more freedom to experiment that indicates a deal may have 
been struck 
there has been no agreement to get rid of the provincial customs 
barriers which went up in the past year as regional officials 
tried to reserve their markets for local products during a 
nationwide decline in consumption 
conflicting regional interests are not the only fragmenting 
force officials with opposing ideological positions are struggling 
for personal power and control of chinas future 
most unusual is the inclusion of widely divergent views in the 
official media which generally stress uniformity 
leading economists who met this month were quoted as advocating 
such radical reforms as turning state factories over to public 
shareholders and letting the market determine most prices 
conservatives who halted the momentum of reform two years ago 
want two more years of slow growth but are mindful of communisms 
collapse elsewhere and concede some reform is needed to save china 
from a similar fate 
without reform it is impossible to show communisms 
superiority and increase its attractiveness said government 
spokesman yuan mu a leading conservative 
he said the market must play a role but that state planning and 
ownership should remain dominant 
that was the idea 10 years ago when deng first grafted limited 
free markets and private enterprise onto chinas planned economy 
the free market was to be a supplement 
in practice the unplanned sector has flourished while the 
favored state sector has wilted 
fewer than onethird of state factories will make a profit this 
year and the government will pay 115 billion to bail out the 
rest according to official figures 
factories outside the state plan including private ones and 
those set up by villages and towns now produce half the gross 
national product 
a western diplomat in beijing said the era of planners may be 
over 
the economy has become so complex she said on condition of 
anonymity the information revolution has overtaken china to 
say nothing of the need for speedy product development a planned 
economy cant react quickly enough 
perhaps deng has recognized this 
recently he called for better more rapid and more 
effective reforms his remarks were made public by a leading 
economic official chen jinhua but received only passing notice 
and seemed to have no impact on the fiveyear plan debate 
in the words of a western banker who deals with leading chinese 
economists the battle is continuing im not at all clear that 
we will have anything released except platitudes for a good 
while

president bushs persian gulf policy is being 
tested on the home front in senate hearings this week and next 
forums for debate and defense of the course that threatens war with 
iraq 
force at least the threat of it is an option bush wants 
strengthened not put into question to that end he needs solid 
not slipping support in congress and the country 
congressional policy questions could serve his aim but only if 
the administration can deliver answers that rally political support 
for the presidents course 
and there also is the risk that policy hearings will reinforce 
doubts thats happened before senate hearings became an early 
rallying point for opposition to vietnam war policy a generation 
ago 
since debate is inevitable in a prolonged confrontation the 
administration task will not be easy as secretary of state james 
a baker iii observed democracy can sometimes be messy 
thats a special problem in the 16th week of a crisis in which 
the threatening message is crucial but the public support behind 
it appears to be fraying the white house has said the 
administration welcomes a national discussion of the us role in 
the persian gulf but that differing views should signal no lack 
of will or purpose in confronting iraq 
the senate armed services committee opens three days of hearings 
on tuesday baker is to testify before the senate foreign relations 
committee on dec 5 as part of a twoday policy review there 
house hearings are likely too 
while secretary of defense dick cheney had spoken approvingly of 
public hearings and the debate they will bring he is not on the 
witness list for next weeks sessions he had been invited to lead 
off but neither he nor other administration officials were on the 
schedule issued wednesday 
that yields the first phase of the public review to statements 
by former cabinet and defense officials some of them critical of 
administration policy 
sen sam nunn dga the committee chairman has raised 
critical questions about it too since bushs nov 8 order that 
us forces in saudi arabia be doubled to about 400000 in 
inviting cheney to testify nunn said he wanted to ask about the 
rationale for that move 
nunn the democrats leading man on defense matters has said 
that if those forces are to be used in an offensive operation bush 
must get congressional approval in advance he says the 
reinforcements represented a chance in policy from the original 
mission of deterring any iraqi move against saudi arabia and 
enforcing the united nations economic embargo 
nunn also has questioned the wisdom of a course that could lead 
to a ground war in the desert suggesting that air power could be 
used instead if it comes to combat in addition he has asked how 
the administration would meet us military responsibilities 
elsewhere in the world with so large a force committed to the 
middle east 
cheney and gen colin powell chairman of the joint chiefs of 
staff have appeared twice before at open congressional hearings on 
the persian gulf operation so has baker and all of them have been 
back to the capitol to brief groups of senators and house members 
in closed sessions bush says he has been consulting with congress 
too more than any other president in history 
but that process didnt work to the congressional satisfaction 
before bush announced the increase in troop strength there was 
advance notice to some congressional leaders but others were 
missed they were told not consulted 
the expansion led to debate and in turn to a republican 
suggestion that congress be called to emergency session to vote on 
and presumably for persian gulf policy the white house didnt 
like that idea nor did democratic congressional leaders who 
settled on policy hearings instead 
cheney said open public hearings will be a forum for debate and 
thats as it should be to air the issues he and powell have 
debated with skeptics in closed sessions he said it needs to be 
done without giving saddam hussein cause to doubt the us 
commitment to stand firm against him 
we should have democratic debate in this country particularly 
on issues that are as fundamental as the issues we are here dealing 
with baker said before his latest overseas mission seeking to 
strengthen the alliance against iraq but in the course of that 
debate we should do everything we can to try and send a consistent 
and uniform signal 
that assumes debate will lead to consensus 
sometimes it does

cmon girls a man in the doorway of 
the dairy barn shouted come ooon get in here 
from the dirt path came the steady sound of hooves and the 
lilting melody of a japanese song the brown swiss cows horns 
intact came around the corner first behind them was yumiko kan 
swinging a short stick and singing 
she came from japan to camphill village kimberton hills for a 
threeyear training course in biodynamic farming shes learning to 
treat cows with homeopathic medicines grow crops without 
chemicals enrich soil by burying manure in cow horns and 
understand cosmic rhythms 
the farmers and trainees from all over the world also come for 
a chance to live communally and provide a social service roughly 
onethird of the 130 people who live and work at kimberton hills 
including the man in the dairy barn are mentally handicapped the 
farm about 30 miles west of philadelphia is owned by camphill 
village usa 
the land is farmed without pesticides herbicides or artificial 
fertilizers farmers rely on crop rotation composting and a 
living soil to produce healthy crops 
the 420acre farm has fields of corn wheat oats barley 
soybeans and hay vegetable gardens orchards and hilly pastures 
for sheep and cows complete the landscape 
not many farmers understand or accept the biodynamic approach 
and its combination of science and spiritualism 
the few who have heard of biodynamic refer to it as cow 
dung and horns said roger wentling an agronomist its not 
a viable option to them 
but wentling who worked several years for the federal soil 
conservation service said he has seen the benefits citing a farm 
couple who used several methods to grow oats 
the oats they had looked good until i got to see the 
biodynamic oats he said ive never seen oats look that good 
and ive walked farms for over 10 years 
there are about 100 biodynamic farms in north america with 
pockets in pennsylvania north dakota northern california new 
england and wisconsin said rod shouldice director of the national 
biodynamic farming and gardening association based in kimberton 
shouldice said the largest concentration is in southern ontario 
where government policies allow biodynamic farms to operate more 
profitably 
biodynamic farmers say their methods are discriminated against 
by us subsidy programs which reward singlecrop agriculture and 
a high use of chemicals for increased yield 
there are signs of change however as support grows in congress 
and the department of agriculture for what is known as lowinput 
sustainable agriculture 
lisa seeks to reduce the use of chemical pesticides and 
fertilizers thereby reducing farmers costs and damage to the 
environment a section of the 1990 farm bill authorizes 40 million 
a year to pursue these methods an eightfold increase over the 
previous bill 
a lot of it has to do with the changing perspective of the 
public that chemicals need to be reduced in our environment said 
john haber staff member of the senate agriculture committee 
howard kerr director of the usdas office of small scale 
agriculture resents the attention and funding given to lisa 
if it works for them we should support them he said but 
to say its the path for everybody i dont buy that 
costeffectiveness is difficult to measure kimberton hills 
farmers said bristling even at the question and who will pay 
the cost of groundwater pollution asked michael wildfeuer the 
dairyman biodynamics puts value back into the land 
the aim of organic farmers has never been to produce the most 
for the least amount of money and the issue is further complicated 
at kimberton hills 
the farm is part of the international camphill movement of 75 
communities worldwide the handicapped people work the farm and 
benefit from being contributing members of the community 
the dairy is the center of the farms operation 
cows are magic he said they go out and eat grass and 
then they come back and give milk they make manure and they give 
meat they give back to the land and to humanity 
in return wildfeuer said the farms 30 dairy cows live as 
naturally as possible they graze in large pastures and keep their 
horns in conventional dairies horns are usually removed to 
prevent cows from hurting one another when kept in close quarters 
he said 
the preparations are what many people focus on perhaps because 
they sound mysterious and strange in one preparation fresh cow 
manure is packed into cow horns and buried for six months during 
the winter 
when the horns are dug up the manure has become compost 
changing in a way it would not change if it were not in a horn 
said jim barausky who manages the field crops at kimberton hills 
barausky said one horn is prepared for each acre the compost is 
combined with water stirred for an hour in a vortex and then 
sprayed on the fields in the evening 
it stimulates root hairs thats been pretty clearly 
demonstrated he said it makes a big difference in plants 
especially if theres a drought that year 
barausky is sensitive to what he said is too much emphasis on 
the preparations he said biodynamics was one of the earliest forms 
of organized organic agriculture and pioneered many methods 
including composting which have since become standards 
what has kept biodynamics apart barausky said is its 
philosophy biodynamics grew out of a series of lectures given in 
1922 in silesia a region in southwestern poland by the late 
rudolf steiner a philosopher known for anthroposophy meaning 
wisdom of man 
barausky said biodynamics incorporates science and spiritualism 
scientific research has been used to prove some biodynamic methods 
he said but unlike laboratory experiments plants do not respond 
the same way for everyone 
it seems to be something else thats involved there which 
then people dont understand and therefore it opens this whole 
realm of questions he said some of the questions go into what 
people call the occult almost superstitions which i think 
biodynamics doesnt want to fall into 
despite the criticism the farm sells most of the crops it 
produces and threefourths of the milk barausky said the milk is 
not pasteurized or homogenized and he said there is a larger 
market for raw milk than the farm can supply

the use of oileating microbes has 
become an accepted and safe method of cleaning up oil spills but 
not a panacea researchers say 
scientists who used fertilizers to speed the biological 
degradation of alaskas massive oil spill are pleased with the way 
bioremediation worked there 
they are skeptical at best however about claims of overnight 
success on a spill in the gulf of mexico and the performance of 
laboratorygrown rather than natural bacteria 
its not a magic cure said james clark an aquatic 
biologist at the environmental protection agency lab in this 
panhandle barrier island community there are times when it wont 
be very effective 
clark represents epa in a joint program with exxon and the 
alaska department of environmental conservation it began last year 
after the tanker exxon valdez spilled nearly 11 million gallons of 
crude oil in alaskan waters 
in 1989 fertilizers were applied to 74 miles of shoreline to 
make oileating microbes already present grow and devour the crude 
faster 
it was the first time bioremediation had been used on a us 
spill and the largest such project ever undertaken prior uses have 
included treatment of sewage and hazardous wastes 
the monitoring and research show that it had no adverse 
ecological effects we saw no algae blooms no toxicity to the 
fish clark said the basic understanding of increasing the 
bacteria by adding nutrients is going to be an accepted 
technique 
bioremediation however represented only a fraction of the 
cleanup effort in alaska where 1245 miles of coastline had been 
coated with oil 
studies show nitrogen and phosphorous fertilizer some of it 
just like that used on lawns and gardens increased the degradation 
rate by 30 percent to 50 percent clark said 
that still means it could take from a few weeks to four years 
depending upon the amount of oil present to complete the 
decomposition he said 
the next step in the laboratory and at spills is to see how 
bioremediation strategies may vary from site to site we may have 
to use different kinds of fertilizers or do something different in 
the gulf of mexico than alaska clark said 
texas officials in july claimed a major success for 
bioremediation they applied 100 pounds of laboratoryproduced 
microbes to one acre of an oil slick in the gulf from the june 8 
explosion of the supertanker mega borg 57 miles off galveston 
it was the first time bioremediation had been used in open 
water texas land commissioner garry mauro said surface oil was 
reduced by 30 percent in some samples a day after the application 
while no such reduction was found in an untreated portion of the 
slick 
we remain skeptical of the results clark said our 
studies have shown oil degradation occurs in the course of days and 
weeks not hours its very hard for us to understand how it would 
degrade overnight 
clark called the controversy a touchy issue for epa which 
officially says more research is needed about bioremediation at 
sea 
a blunter assessment came from jim mueller a microbiologist for 
southern bioproducts an atlantabased bioremediation company epa 
has hired to help with research 
i dont think it worked i think they sank the oil mueller 
said studies we have done with very high concentrations of 
organism optimum nutrient optimum temperature show it still 
takes days and weeks 
experiments are under way with two brands of commercially grown 
microbes but preliminary evidence shows they are no better than 
natural bacteria clark and mueller said 
on the other hand research on new ways to apply fertilizers has 
been promising 
in alaska a special oilattracting fertilizer known as inipol 
eap 22 made only by the french company elfe aquitaine was sprayed 
in liquid form gardenvariety watersoluble fertilizer was applied 
in granular form with lawn spreaders 
while inipol has been more effective in cleaning up visible oil 
watersoluble fertilizers are better at seeping below the surface 
mueller is experimenting with simply hosing down oiltainted 
shores with watersoluble fertilizer in liquid form 
potentially what we can do is get on a boat with a fire hose 
and just blast the beaches with soluble nutrient let the rocks 
bathe in it during low tide he said 
that would make application simpler and cheaper bioremediation 
already costs less than most other cleanup methods 
bioremediation in the past has cost about as fourth as much as 
incineration for cleaning up hazardous waste sites mueller said 
clark figured the price difference would be at least that much for 
oil cleanups in which the alternatives include physically wiping 
off rocks or dumping them in landfills

albert einsteins letters and the example 
of couples like the curies contributed to the belief that his 
theory of relativity was a collaboration between einstein and his 
first wife 
evan harris walker a research physicist at the armys aberdeen 
proving grounds said there are a dozen instances in which einstein 
referred to our work in letters to his first wife mileva 
einsteinmaric 
it becomes clear from what he has to say himself that mileva 
played a significant role in the early work walker said 
recently 
several einstein historians disagree 
but louis pyenson a science historian at the university of 
montreal said such a collaboration would not be unusual 
considering the number of other wellknown husband and wife 
scientific teams at the turn of the century including marie and 
pierre curie known for their work in radioactivity 
walker said his theory also would help solve a puzzle over the 
development of his landmark theory einstein denied later in life 
that previous work on the speed of light by the american physicist 
albert michelson influenced his work 
walker said the influence likely came from einsteinmaric 
in one letter walker noted einstein wrote how happy and 
proud i will be when the two of us together will have brought our 
work on the relative motion to a victorious conclusion 
the letters were part of the einstein papers published in 1986 
by princeton university where he worked for several years 
the theory of relativity was the foundation for much of physics 
since einstein published three groundbreaking papers in 1905 that 
eventually led to his winning the nobel prize in 1921 the theory 
deals with the relationship between time and space and proposes 
that time moves slower for objects traveling at greater speeds 
i dont see that theres any evidence she contributed in the 
way they claim said clifford will a physics professor at the 
mcdonnell center for space science at washington university in st 
louis i guess they looked at some of the letters and tried to 
infer she was involved 
part of this is the myth that einstein needed help with 
mathematics and there is simply no evidence in his career that 
this is true will said the mathematics in relativity is 
simple all that was needed to develop the theory was physical 
insight the brilliant physical insight that einstein had 
einsteinmaric a mathematician and physicist was several years 
older than einstein who was in his early 20s when he began work on 
relativity and may have been the leader early on walker said 
the two met as students at the swiss federal institute of 
technology in zurich and were married in 1904 a year before 
einstein published the three papers strengthening walkers case is 
their 1919 divorce agreement in which einstein agreed his former 
wife would receive any nobel prize proceeds einstein might win 
the case for her role also is bolstered by a german research 
linguist senta troemelploetz of the german research society in 
bonn she reported reading an account by the late russian 
physicist abram joffe who said he had seen the original 
manuscript of the paper on special relativity with the names of 
einstein and his wife on it pyenson said 
walker said einsteinmaric studied in heidelberg germany where 
michelson had visited several years earlier 
without michelson the problem the theory of relativity would 
have answered wasnt there thats why physicists said the theory 
was puzzling walker said mileva was on the scene and had 
access to information of that sort and she probably played the role 
of inseminating those ideas 
light like other waves had been thought to require a medium 
dubbed the ether to travel through some physicists theorized that 
because earth was moving through this substance it would slow down 
or speed up light depending on the direction the light was 
traveling in relation to the ether 
michelsons experiments in the late 19th century compared the 
amount of time it took two beams of light pointed in different 
directions to travel from their source bounce off a mirror and 
return despite repeated attempts at increasing distances the 
times were always the same confusing scientists 
einsteins 1905 paper on the photoelectric effect of light 
disproved the ether theory 
on one paper she helped with the mathematics and on the 
papers on relativity and light she did something very 
fundamental walker said that she helped is beyond question 
its the degree of help 
einsteinmaric studied under phillip lenard a german physicist 
and most likely brought to einsteins attention lenards work on 
light walker said 
it is true we dont have any direct evidence for precisely 
which equation einsteins first wife told albert about that kind 
of information is seldom available pyenson said 
what does seem clear and there is no question is the pattern 
of young physicist couples in the 1900s is a clear trend in 
europe he said all you have to do is look at the curies

barry alpert is learning that the gift of gab 
can be as critical to his medical practice as skill with a scalpel 
doctors say poor communication with patients is a leading cause 
of missed diagnoses lawyers say the problem is cited in many 
malpractice lawsuits 
a lot of malpractice cases go away simply because they like 
the doctor said pittsburgh attorney edwin h beachler iii 
alpert a cardiologist at west penn hospital in pittsburgh said 
he cant evaluate his own communications skills but he said 
patients have come to him after having difficulty dealing with 
other doctors 
he said he suspects some of his own former patients may have the 
same complaint about him 
alpert is not alone roughly 80 percent of 300 doctors surveyed 
nationwide by the pharmaceutical division of miles inc regard 
effective communication with patients as extremely important 
only onethird said they communicate very well 
a lot of physicians are exceptionally sensitive about their 
relationships with their patients alpert said they dont want 
to be told how to conduct their practice 
in an effort to improve his abilities alpert took part in a 
seminar offered by miles at west penn earlier this year the 
fourhour program has been presented this year at two dozen 
hospitals medical schools and health maintenance organizations 
around the country 
vaughn keller who led the pittsburgh session told doctors part 
of the problem stems from differences in background 
physicians are trained to rely on a rigorous decisionmaking 
process in making a diagnosis keller said patients on the other 
hand rarely get right to the point with physicians said j 
gregory carroll a corporate training specialist at miles a west 
haven conn company 
a patient may start by telling a story about lower back pain 
and may be warming up to something theyre not ready to talk 
about carroll said the patient may wait til the end of the 
interview when he has his hand on the doorknob to say oh by 
the way doctor should i be worried about this swelling 
doctors need to be able to recognize when a patient is hedging 
and should try to draw out relevant pieces of the clinical 
puzzle he said 
its not just an educational gap its really two different 
world views keller said 
terminology can be a problem too 
eller urged seminar participants to encourage their patients to 
be more open about medical problems and said doctors should give 
specific instructions for medication exercise therapy and other 
treatment 
the extra effort keller and carroll prescribe can have benefits 
for doctors several attorneys said better relations can reduce a 
physicians chance of being sued for malpractice 
the doctors who dont get sued are the ones who take the time 
to explain this could happen or this could happen and give their 
patients what we call informed consent said beachler 
without exaggeration in half if not threequarters of these 
cases one of the complaints these people have is they dont like 
the way they were treated 
a typical patients hospital stay might involve seeing four or 
five doctors sometimes you feel like youre on a conveyor 
belt said pittsburgh attorney john c conti who represents 
physicians 
in the last decade many medical schools added courses designed 
to teach students how to conduct efficient discussions with 
patients 
its one of those things that people used to say well you 
pick it up said dr stanley k dorst who teaches a required 
course introduction to patient care at the university of 
pittsburgh school of medicine 
dorst disagrees that communication is part of the art of 
medicine and cant be taught its a skill and you need to 
practice it

the deaths of seven endangered florida 
panthers this year have wildlife officials pushing for a captive 
breeding program by early next year 
three of the seven were killed in fights with other panthers 
two died of infections and one was killed crossing a road one 
cause of death hasnt been determined 
two deaths were particularly critical because the cats had 
founder genetic material meaning they had some of the purest 
genetic material available and havent been subjected to 
inbreeding said dennis jordan florida panther coordinator for the 
us fish and wildlife service in gainesville 
in terms of the goal of the program to protect existing 
genetic material weve lost some jordan said 
under the program about half the existing florida panthers 
would be captured for breeding programs at zoos and private 
preserves that some biologists say could prevent the extinction 
of the cats no more than 50 panthers are believed to exist most 
of them in southwest florida 
biolgists had hoped to begin capturing panthers last spring but 
began reassessing the program after environmentalists complained 
that wildlife agencies were rushing into the project without proper 
studies

the wife of genentech incs president has 
settled insider trading allegations that she tipped her brother 
about confidential merger talks the company was holding with roche 
holding ltd 
according to the securities and exchange commission mollie e 
raab did not trade for herself but her brother told a friend who 
allegedly made some 127400 in illegal profits 
genetech completed a merger with roche in september 
without admitting or denying wrongdoing mrs raab of 
hillsborough calif agreed to pay 162400 in penalties and 
interest to settle a civil action filed by the securities and 
exchange commission at federal court in san francisco on tuesday 
neither genentech nor mrs raabs husband g kirk raab chief 
executive officer of the san franciscobased pharmaceutical and 
biotechnology company were accused of any wrongdoing 
mrs raab did not profit on the stock trades raab said in a 
statement issued by genentech she knows it was wrong to have 
told her brother who was having prolonged financial difficulty 
and she accepts her penalty we are both sorry for any 
embarrassment this incident has caused to genentech and its 
employees the statement concluded 
also settling with the sec were mrs raabs brother michael 
gaylord painter and one of his friends joseph jeffries both of 
san antonio texas 
some of the circumstances in the case resemble the controversial 
insider trading case against broker robert chestman in new york 
a federal appeals court overturned chestmans conviction earlier 
this year on the grounds there was insufficent evidence chestman 
knew information he got from a family member of the waldbaum 
supermarket chain owners about a pending merger with aampp was 
confidential 
the government is appealing that court decision 
though the issues framed for litigation would have been 
interesting mr painter was not required to disgorge any money or 
to pay any penalty and under the circumstances he decided to 
dispose of the matter rather than engage in costly litigation 
said his lawyer washington attorney richard morvillo 
but harry weiss an associate director of the secs enforcement 
division said the misappropriation theory used in the raab case 
is not an issue in the chestman appeal 
in the chestman case said weiss the issue is the proof the 
government must offer to establish whether a person getting a 
confidential stock tip knows the tipster is illegally violating a 
trust or duty 
in the raab case were alleging sufficient evidence to 
establish the exisitence of a relationship and a breach of that 
relationship said weiss 
mrs raab is not an officer of the company but she has a 
relationship of trust and confidence with her husband the breach 
of that duty is the misappropriation with which she was 
charged 
weiss noted that in any event the defendants settled without 
going to trial 
the sec alleged that jeffries made about 127400 in illegal 
trading profits using the information painter got from his sister 
with the understanding that the two men would split it although 
lawyers declined to say whether painter actually ever took 
possession of any of the profits 
the sec also alleged that jeffries also told other people who 
made an additional 70000 in trading profits 
they were not accused of insider trading because there wasnt 
enough evidence to conclude they knew the information had been 
stolen said weiss 
as part of the settlement however jeffries will pay 133700 
in illegal profits plus interest the government waived additional 
penalties for him and painter after they gave sworn statements that 
they were unable to pay 
although there was no allegation mrs raab traded illegally for 
herself under the insider trading sanctions act however she 
could have been ordered to pay penalties equal to the profits made 
by those she tipped 
the 162400 she will pay was part of the negotiated settlement 
said weiss 
according to the sec complaint mrs raab learned about the 
merger negotiations from her husband and sometime between jan 22 
and feb 2 she told her brother to buy a few thousand dollars worth 
of genentech stock saying buy now even if he had to borrow 
money 
she told her brother good things were about to happen to 
genentech and that he should keep his purchase and her comments 
confidential according to the sec 
at the time genentech stock was trading at about 21 a share 
painter in turn told jeffries who bought option contracts to buy 
genentech securities which he agreed to split with painter an 
option contract is an agreement to buy stock at a later date for a 
fixed price if the price of the stock goes up before the contract 
date the buyer makes the difference in profit

most people in the turkey business love 
november not roger bassett owner of bassetts original turkey 
fastfood restaurants 
when homecooked thanksgiving leftovers make such good 
sandwiches at home why would you pay 5 for a sandwich at one 
of his restaurants the answer he said is they dont 
sales usually drop 50 percent for three days following the 
holiday 
but bassett said he understands 
you have a wonderful dinner at home and you make sandwiches 
with the leftovers he said 
bassetts original turkey has grown from a small oven set up at 
a sundae bar to a ninerestaurant chain in pennsylvania new 
jersey maryland and virginia 
the latest franchise opened to brisk business last week at a 
mall in downtown philadelphia 
bassett 29 stood back and watched the people line up to buy 
his cold sandwiches and his hot openedfaced platters 
people like turkey he said people are tired of pizza and 
cheesesteaks 
bassett is a fifthgeneration member of the centuryold 
bassetts ice cream co 
he originally carried on the familys tradition of selling ice 
cream when he was 19 he opened a small sundae bar in 
philadelphias reading terminal market 
his father visited the market on a regular basis but grew tired 
of eating greasy hamburgers and sloppy pizza 
so he asked me if i would fix him a turkey sandwich whenever 
he came in bassett said 
after setting up a small oven at the ice cream stall bassett 
wandered through the market and bought tomatoes lettuce bread and 
a turkey 
i cooked a turkey sandwich for him he said then some guy 
saw him eating and asked where he got the sandwich the next day i 
cooked two turkeys they sold out strictly on word of mouth 
he finally gave in and bought the equipment to make turkey 
sandwiches on a larger scale 
the business was an immediate success he said within five 
years he opened up three more stores of his own in 1989 bassett 
sold his ice cream stand as more malls wanted his turkey in their 
food courts he turned to selling franchises for the next five 
stores 
bassett will concentrate on the northeast first but wants to 
sell franchises nationally in five years ive already got offers 
in california florida and canada he said 
he said his menu is perfect in mall food courts because it 
offers an alternative for healthconscious consumers 
pat glickman agreed as he sat down to eat the turkey sandwich he 
just bought 
i love turkey said glickman 26 of philadelphia its 
healthier for you than mcdonalds or burger king 
another customer jennifer landis said she had passed bassetts 
turkey stores several times without stopping before she gave in and 
ordered a platter 
one of my favorite lunches is an openfaced turkey sandwich 
said landis 32 of suburban jamison i enjoy it at home i eat 
it a lot

treasury secretary nicholas f brady broke his 
public silence on the socalled credit crunch with a plea to 
regulators to soften their crackdown on bank lending 
be mindful of the effect your behavior can have on the 
willingness of banks to take even the reasonable risk of lending to 
good credits brady said tuesday in remarks directed at the 
nations bank examiners 
we need a banking system that is a taker not a shedder of 
such risks he said 
a text of the speech delivered to the arthritis foundation in 
new york was released in washington brady also signaled that the 
administration wants the dollar to stop falling 
his comments on the credit crunch come amid growing concern that 
banks reluctance to lend is holding back an already weak economy 
president bush conducted a series of meetings last week 
discussing the economic lull with top advisers senior regulators 
and business executives 
bankers and some business owners have complained for nearly a 
year that regulators were cracking down too hard in the wake of the 
savings and loan debacle 
regulators responded that they were simply urging prudence in 
response to more fragile economic conditions particularly in the 
commercial real estate industry 
brady conceded that traditional lending standards applied by 
many banks clearly eroded during the long economic expansion of 
the 1980s 
but he cautioned to the regulators id like to say publicly 
what ive said privately many times use some judgment apply some 
balance dont use unrealistically negative scenarios in evaluating 
loans dont overreact 
a federal reserve survey of lending officers released monday 
found that bankers were becoming increasingly cautious about making 
loans not only to commercial real estate developers but also to 
large corporations and home buyers two types of borrowers 
generally considered safe 
let me offer a word to banks brady said i urge you to 
keep lending to your good customers lets not overreact to the 
economy or to the regulators 
your franchise depends upon your continued willingness to 
stand by your customers i urge you not to walk away from those 
whose trust you have worked so hard to earn 
some banks have come under pressure to cut back lending by the 
need to meet stricter capital standards taking effect in january 
under an international agreement but brady said banks had 
alternatives including cutting costs reducing dividends or 
seeking a merger partner 
brady also sought to calm fears about the condition of the 
banking industry saying the banks of 1990 are not the sampls of 
the 1980s they are as different as chalk and cheese 
he said banks have a capital cushion of 200 billion to absorb 
losses 6 percent of their assets compared with 10 billion for 
sampls in 1987 or 1 percent of their assets 
regarding the dollar brady said the deficit reductions in the 
1991 budget adopted by congress last month should promote renewed 
and welcome stability in exchange markets and he said 
policies that promote stability in the dollar exchange rate are a 
plus not just for the united states but for the world economy at 
large 
until tuesdays speech treasury officials have expressed little 
concern about the dollar which has been declining for most of the 
year and is trading near postworld war ii lows against the german 
mark it also has fallen sharply against the japanese yen 
a weak dollar worsens inflation in the united states by driving 
up the cost of imports but it improves the us trade performance 
by making american goods cheaper on overseas markets

the lisbon evening newspaper diario de 
lisboa will close at the end of november after 69 years of 
publication the editor said wednesday 
the daily is the latest victim of a portuguese press crisis that 
has seen eight major daily and weekly papers close in the past two 
years 
chief editor antonio ruella ramos said wednesday the last issue 
of diario de lisboa will hit the streets nov 30 after 
negotiations with the projornal media group failed to find a 
formula to save the paper 
the centerleft tabloid was reportedly loosing 18 million 
escudos or 138000 a month and circulation had fallen to 10000 
from almost 30000 in 1987 
ruella ramos blamed the closure on a contraction of the 
portuguese advertising market a lack of state funding and a change 
in reading habits away from afternoon papers 
in the 1960s the diario de lisboa was one of the few papers to 
challenge the strict censorship imposed by rightist dictator 
antonio oliveira salazar 
after a 1974 revolution restored portuguese democracy many 
leading journalists of the newlyfreed press came from diario 
lisboa 
the portuguese press boomed at the end of the 1980s but the 
market was unable to sustain the increasing number of titles in 
this country where almost 20 percent of the 103 population is 
illiterate 
the centerright government is hoping to boost the press by 
privatizing stateowned papers 
several titles have been sold and the last remaining stateowned 
paper the prestigious diario de noticias is scheduled for 
privatization early next year

if usx corp decides to sell off its steel 
business the united steelworkers union wants the right to match 
any offer the company receives 
the union asked during contract negotiations for the right to 
equal any bid made by potential suitors the union represents 
18000 usx employees 
the unions chief negotiator andrew v lefty palm said 
tuesday the usw wants to know more about the companys longrange 
plans for its steel business 
are they going to keep it in one piece chop it up spin it 
off palm asked were concerned about speculators coming in 
who could care less about our jobs our community 
financier carl c icahn has pressured usx to sever its cyclical 
steel business from its more profitable energy unit which accounts 
for about 70 percent of the companys revenue and operating income 
icahn usxs largest stockholder thinks his 339 million shares 
would be worth a lot more if the steel business were shed 
last week icahn threatened to nominate his own slate of 
directors at usxs annual meeting in may unless the company quickly 
moves to restructure its steel business options include selling 
the steel division in whole or individual plants or spinning it 
off into a separate company and selling all or part of the stock 
usx announced three weeks ago that its board had authorized the 
conversion of the steel unit into a wholly owned subsidiary 
chairman charles a corry said the move gives usx the flexibility 
for any steel restructuring 
palm said the unions request to match offers for the steel 
division must be dealt with before there can be agreement on a 
contract to replace the one that expires feb 1 no date is set for 
resuming the talks which broke off after the two sides failed to 
meet a selfimposed deadline on nov 10 
the union said it would swing the deal through an employee stock 
ownership plan a buyout technique that gained favor in the 1980s 
particularly in the steel industry 
weirton steel corp was created in 1984 when the west virginia 
steel makers 7700 employees bought the company from national 
steel for 386 million other employeeled buyouts in the industry 
include northwestern steel and wire of sterling ill republic 
engineered steels of massillon ohio and pittsburgh forgings 
usx spokesman thomas ferrall declined to comment on the unions 
request to match any offer for the steel unit but many analysts 
believe usx would balk at such a deal however several said the 
success of other steel employee stock ownership plans pressure 
from icahn the softening steel market and other factors might 
force usx to accede to an employee buyout

when james w arnett flunked out of 
college and went to work as a shoneys inc cook flipping burgers 
and stirring soup the thought of running the company was the last 
thing on his mind 
but in his 20year career at shoneys arnett has gradually 
moved from the frying pan of a kitchen into the fire of a 
bigbusiness boardroom making decisions that affect 28000 
employees in a network of restaurants and hotels in 30 states 
i guess its easier to teach somebody when you know how to do 
it yourself said arnett 41 i said awhile back that id still 
like to be a teacher somebody pointed out thats what i do 
today 
arnetts elevation to president and chief operating officer of 
shoneys announced last month is unusual in an era when companies 
usually fill top executive positions with numbercrunching mbas 
many executives dont necessarily have experience on the 
assembly line shop floor or in this case the kitchen where 
arnett began toiling in 1970 for a minimum wage 
i worked hard arnett said in a recent intervew in his 
office at shoneys nashville headquarters i took out the trash 
swept mopped whatever it took 
arnett said his selfimposed discipline stems from flunking 
school and anxiety over becoming a loser in life 
he was living with his parents when his casual attitude about 
studying and grades resulted in a nearzero grade point average at 
tennessee tech in cookeville a 90minute drive east of nashville 
i think i made a c in something he said 
arnetts father a retired marine corps sergeant major demanded 
repayment of 1400 in tuition money and ordered his son to get a 
job he found one at shoneys a growing chain of restaurants known 
for its big boy burgers and for pioneering the family style 
breakfast bar buffet 
theres no doubt in my mind that fear of failure is what keeps 
jim arnett motivated arnett said his father he said 
literally picked me up and carried me to work every day 
arnett gave most of the earnings from his 80hour week to his 
father eventually repaying the 1400 at the same time arnett 
said he discovered something he could do well 
he soon became kitchen manager then store manager before 
working his way up into the higher levels of the company 
shoneys has since grown into a large publicly held company that 
owns and operates 1600 restaurants and motels including shoneys 
restaurants shoneys inns captain ds fastseafood chain lees 
famous recipe chicken fifth quarter and pargos restaurants 
six feet tall and slightly overweight due to sampling our 
foods all the time arnett says he enjoyed his early cooking 
career and still makes occasional forays into a company kitchen 
just a few weeks ago for example he did a stint at a captain ds 
to assess its efficiency 
the reason is sometimes you have a tendency to overcomplicate 
things arnett said you have to keep it simple to put the food 
out in a reasonable amount of time 
arnetts appointment has been widely praised among securities 
analysts who follow shoneys which is under pressure from a large 
debt load and must seek ways to economize and become more 
efficient arnetts experience in everything from menu planning to 
mixing vegetable soup gives him an advantage 
in our opinion that was the correct move for the company 
said john lawrence of morgan keegan amp co in memphis 
as the no 2 executive arnett is heirapparent to chairman and 
chief executive officer leonard h roberts 
shoneys founder ray danner who retired as chairman but is 
still on the companys board and executive committee said arnett 
was a good kid and now hes a great man 
i would say he has all the ingredients to maybe one day be a 
ceo of the company in my opinion he certainly has the 
qualities danner said 
arnett credits his success to simple hard work 
i still consider myself an employee ill go around pouring 
coffee he said 
if you dont go to the stores youre making your decisions in 
a void its easy not to go to the stores it would be easy to have 
a fancy office 
arnetts office is not fancy it has a desk work area five 
chairs and no paintings on the walls 
instead a wall near his desk holds framed copies of the goals 
of shoneys divisions along with a statement of the companys 
business philosophy 
our philosophy is you cant run a business from an office 
he said 
arnett declined to disclose his salary though he said it was 
close to the compensation of predecessor gary spoleta who 
according to the companys latest proxy statement earned 388202 
in fiscal 1989 thats a far cry from the 125 an hour arnett 
pulled in 20 years ago 
let me put it this way arnett said i owe more money now 
than i did then 
the company plans to more than double its operations to 3400 
motels and restaurants mostly shoneys family style restaurants 
and the captain ds and lees chicken fast food outlets by 1995 
despite signs of a economic sluggishness that is huring many 
restaurant companies shoneys still anticipates a big jump in 
sales this year from the 860 million it earned a year ago 
im positive other leaders will say their sales will by down 
42 percent this year arnett said and theyll hit their 
goals were looking for 1 billion

laventhol amp horwath the nations 
seventhlargest accounting firm filed for bankruptcy protection 
today under the weight of lawsuits seeking damages for allegedly 
faulty audits 
the firm filed a chapter 11 bankruptcy case in us bankruptcy 
court in new york said jaimie walthour a clerk in the court 
under chapter 11 of the us bankruptcy code a company seeks to 
reorganize its operations while it remains in business 
a series of tragic circumstances brought this proud firm to 
this sad day robert levine the firms executive partner and 
chief executive officer said tuesday 
levine blamed the collapse on high litigation costs and the 
increasing number of lawsuits being filed against accounting firms 
the lawsuits were filed primarily by businesses challenging audits 
or by shareholders contending they received faulty financial 
information 
the company reportedly had to pay nine creditor banks at least 
30 million last year of which only 185 million was covered by 
insurance over its auditing of the grabill corp of chicago 
laventhols audits of jim bakkers ptl ministry are the subject 
of an ongoing trial in charlotte nc 
most accounting firms are suffering from high litigation costs 
and our firm is no exception levine said on tuesday because 
of the raised expectations of plaintiffs and the popular 
misconception of auditors as allseeing and allknowing the number 
of lawsuits against accounting firms has skyrocketed 
the firm had 4200 employees 360 of which were partners in the 
firm in its 50 offices across the country laventhol reported 
350 million in domestic revenue last year 
response in the firms offices nationwide was diverse 
we will close said nick iacuzio department head of 
accounting and auditing for the firms boston office which let its 
160 workers go its very devastating theres a lot of sadness 
and grief 
offices in ohio connecticut and philadelphia also folded but 
partners and senior executives in the kansas city mo office say 
they plan to open a firm of their own stanley h house managing 
partner in kansas city said the new firm will be known as house 
park morriss amp co 
in tampa fla two laventhol partners have already set up their 
own firm aidman piser and co 
its certainly very hectic right now but weve gotten 
enthusiastic support from our clients said philip c piser who 
is setting up the new firm with terry aidman they had previously 
headed laventhols audit and tax practice departments in tampa 
the firms 360 partners could remain liable for debts created by 
the national firm said leslie d corwin an attorney and partner 
in the new york citybased law firm morrison cohen singer amp 
weinstein 
once assets are sold off whatever liabilities are left after 
the firms insurance pays off becomes the responsibility of the 
individual partners corwin said 
two of the laventhols largest clients praised the accounting 
firms work even while they scrambled to find new accountants 
ed ashburn accounting controller for trans world airlines inc 
in suburban new york said laventhol handled the airlines audits 
for the past four years 
if they are unable to perform the audit work we should not 
have any difficulty in awarding the contract to another firm he 
said adding that twa has received several offers from other 
accounting firms 
chicagobased hyatt corp had worked with laventhol for 15 
years said hyatt spokeswoman karen rugen but is now reviewing 
other firms to do its yearend audits

puerto ricos tuna canning 
industry which accounts for more than half of us tuna 
processing is struggling to stay afloat in a sea of far east 
competition and efforts to save dolphins 
this year two of the islands five tuna canneries closed and a 
third reduced operations putting about 2000 people out of work 
puerto rico is the center of the us tuna packing industry a 
634 millionayear business that at its height employed 8000 
people last year 535069 tons of tuna were processed in the 
united states more than half of it in puerto rico according to 
the us department of commerce 
most of the tuna canned here comes from the eastern pacific 
ocean where dolphin and tuna swim together dolphins are 
airbreathing mammals that drown when captured in nets along with 
tuna 
in april the three largest tuna canners in the world 
starkist bumble bee and chicken of the sea responded to an 
international outcry and said they would stop buying and selling 
tuna caught with dolphins 
that led tuna fishing boats to move to the western pacific and 
indian ocean where tuna and dolphins swin separately according to 
industry spokesmen 
companies say the expense of transporting tuna from those 
regions to puerto rico is too high to meet the competition also 
attracted by cheaper labor in the far east companies are 
relocating 
in late july bumble bees plant in the puerto rican city of 
mayaguez laid off 800 employees and said it was transferring part 
of its operation to santa fe springs calif and thailand 
this industry is laborintensive it will go where the rates 
are more beneficial said bumble bee plant manager pat vella in 
an interview 
in july van camp which cans chicken of the sea tuna closed 
its plant in the southern puerto rican port city of ponce and said 
it was moving operations to indonesia and american samoa neptune 
the sole tuna cannery of the japanese conglomerate mitsui closed 
its puerto rican operation in august 
puerto rico is left with just three plants star kist caribe 
the largest cannery in the world the mitsubishiowned caribe tuna 
and a scaleddown bumble bee 
the main problem with the tuna industry is costs said jimmy 
seda a vice president at neptune 
many fear such plant closings if they continue could topple 
puerto ricos tuna industry and hurt the islands overall economy 
it would be catastrophic said jorge orama monroig chairman 
of the puerto rico senates treasury committee which is studying 
incentives for local tuna canneries if an industry that big 
leaves the island youre also going to have indirect job losses 
in mayaguez its an important part of the economy 
in july star kist and bumble bee were among the top 25 
employers on the island with star kist employing 5900 workers and 
bumble bee 2000 
puerto rico a us commonwealth is subject to many us laws 
the minimum wage here matches the mainlands 385 an hour in 
thailand where much of the tuna is now being canned it is about 
2 to 3 a day 
seda said that with added expenses such as health insurance 
workers here cost about 7 an hour 
but its not just wages he said adding that environmental 
and health regulations are less restrictive in thailand than in the 
united states our waste water treatment plant alone was costing 
about 1 million to operate he said 
lured by tax incentives and cheaper labor the tuna canning 
industry expanded in this caribbean island in the early 1980s when 
star kist bumble bee and van camp closed their pacific coast 
operations in california 
american companies operating in puerto rico enjoy the benefits 
of a federal tax code provision that exempts them from paying 
federal income tax on profits earned by their puerto rican 
subsidiaries 
commonwealth officials are asking the international trade 
commission for higher tariffs on tuna imported to the united 
states under current tariffs oilpacked tuna is taxed at a rate 
of 24 percent while waterpacked tuna preferred by consumers is 
taxed at 125 percent 
if the united states does not review its import tariff policy 
the whole industry here is going to be in trouble said seda the 
neptune vice president 
raul velez president of the tuna employees association is 
doubtful the lobbying will be effective because it faces opposition 
from the large tuna canneries themselves asian owners control the 
major tuna processors except star kist so higher import tariffs 
are not in their interest he said

who knows what evil lurks in the hearts of the 
securities and exchange commission the shadow sec thinks it does 
the selfappointed panel of five mostly freemarket economists 
intends to shadow and secondguess the real sec a presidentially 
appointed panel entrusted with keeping the stock markets fair and 
honest 
the real sec an independent panel of five commissioners backed 
up by a staff of lawyers accountants and economists not only 
oversees the trading of stocks and bonds but oversees mutual funds 
and investment advisers affecting the jobs investments and 
futures of millions of americans 
at its first meeting in a swank washington hotel the shadow sec 
debated the real secs policies on two hot issues the effect of 
program trading on stock market plunges and the voting rights of 
shareholders in takeover battles 
the shadow sec voted for the elimination of a rule approved 
this year by the real sec limiting index arbitrage a form of 
program trading on the new york stock exchange when the market 
rises or drops 50 points the panel also called on the real sec to 
revise rules governing shareholders absentee ballots or proxies 
critics have called the body irrelevent or presumptious even 
those who think there is a place for a shadow sec think its role 
will be minor 
samuel hayes investment banking professor at harvard 
universitys business school thinks the concept of economic 
criticism is an excellent idea i just dont take too seriously 
the establishment of a regulator in exile 
frankly i dont understand why some people are so upset about 
a shadow sec said sec commissioner philip r lochner there 
are 1000 conferences a year around the country on securities 
matters and this is one of them he added 
thats precisely the attitude the shadow sec which includes 
1990 nobel prizewinning economist merton h miller and former sec 
commissioner charles c cox wants to change 
gregg jarrell a finance and economics professor at the 
university of rochester and one of the shadow bodys creators told 
reporters at the first meeting earlier this month one of the big 
purposes of this is to spur greater progress in research among the 
academic community to create one more outlet besides the normal 
run of academic conferences one thats a little different perhaps 
a little more exciting 
i dont know whether well reach the sec itself said 
miller who teaches at the university of chicago i think we 
will but by a very indirect route 
the sec as an institution has no official position on its shadow 
self even richard c breeden the usually outspoken sec chairman 
declined to comment on the matter 
but sources inside the commission say more than a few sec 
feathers have been ruffled by the interlopers 
following its first meeting sec general counsel james doty 
needled the shadow sec in a speech to securities lawyers saying he 
was worried do they have a shadow general counsel too 
in an interview doty said his speech was clearly facetious 
but it had a serious point about the importance of the private 
securities bars input 
there is room for all disciplines to comment on the law and 
the rules but i dont think economists can infer they have a 
superior vantage point any more than lawyers can he said 
meanwhile the securities industry association is totally 
against a shadow sec and believes it will be disruptive said art 
samansky a spokesman for the new yorkbased trade association 
the shadow sec sponsored by the university of rochesters simon 
graduate school of business administration is financed by the john 
m olin foundation ibm corp twentyfirst securities corp and 
mesa limited partnership the firm of takeover strategist t boone 
pickens 
theyre good people with basically a conservative economic 
viewpoint trying to make sure everybody involved pays enough 
attention to economic theories in the regulation of the stock 
market said prominent washington securities lawyer arthur 
mathews but i dont perceive it as a group thats going to 
have any power or particular influence 
if the first shadow sec meeting had been a movie it could have 
been called the revenge of the economists panelists noting 
that the five current sec members are all lawyers complained that 
statistical studies had been downplayed or ignored in the sec 
rulemaking process 
in addition to jarrell cox and miller who teaches at the 
university of chicago the shadow sec consists of ronald j gilson 
a law professor at stanford university and hans r stoll a finance 
professor at vanderbilt university 
steven manaster former chief economist for the commodity 
futures trading commission now teaching at the university of utah 
heads the shadow sec staff 
thats one hell of a line up concluded edward h 
fleischman the only member of the real sec to attend part of the 
shadow session 
the reams of raw data presented was fascinating he said 
adding i think its very healthy for an organization especially 
a socalled fourth branch of government agency to be publicly to 
account in a constructive way 
lochner who did not attend the session but sent an observer 
said economists have something to teach lawyers but i think its 
kind of a foolish notion that we should wait until all the data is 
in because all of the data is never in youve got to make 
decisions with whats available at the time

declines 
the market is closely watching persian gulf developments and the 
interplay between president bush and soviet leader mikhail 
gorbachev 
the theory is that the closer gorbachev is to bushs thinking 
the more likely food aid or export credits becomes for the soviets 
on tuesday apparently seeking to dispel doubts about the 
soviets resolve on using military action gorbachev said the un 
security council should address the situation in the persian gulf

michael milken climbed quietly to the 
mountaintop of american finance his descent was much louder 
born and raised in california milken was a math whiz helping 
his fathers accounting business by age 10 he studied arcane 
business tracts while others marched for civil rights and peace 
during the 1960s in his early years on wall street milken 
digested financial documents during a twohour commute 
with the same passion milken avoided the limelight after 
gaining market prowess shunning interviews and refusing to pose 
alone for drexel burnham lambert incs annual report 
milken became a familiar figure only after named by speculator 
ivan boesky in the governments fraud investigation in late 1986 
the most prominent financier in the securities industry in the 
booming 1980s milken became prosecutors main target 
his quirky personality and stupefying wealth have contributed to 
widely divergent public views of the 44yearold financier 
on the one hand he is considered a financial genius economic 
visionary and generous philanthropist who has enabled many 
businesses to prosper through his masterful selling of highrisk 
highyield junk bonds 
on the other hand milken is an admitted felon whom some equate 
with the excesses of the takeo iraq from kuwait were on track in addition 
to 
bushs personal diplomacy secretary of state james a baker iii 
met for several hours with soviet foreign minister eduard 
shevardnadze to discuss the persian gulf conflict 
the president who has sought a tougher international stand 
against iraqs saddam hussein told reporters that i leave paris 
feeling that we are still together as countries who want to see 
this situation reversed and want to see this man unilaterally get 
out of kuwait 
the president talked to reporters twice within two hours once 
during a meeting with greek prime minister constantine mitsotakis 
and again at the us embassy in paris where he spoke to 
officials both times he sought to minimize any differences with 
the soviets over a united nations resolution authorizing force in 
the persian gulf 
im encouraged very encouraged about this holding together of 
a coalition in the sands and on the seas of the gulf he said 
bush said he believes the united states is in good 
synchronization with other nations on how to cope with the 
persian gulf crisis 
asked whether he had set a deadline for saddam to get out of 
kuwait he replied just watch the way all this develops 
everybody is convinced they must get out of kuwait with no 
concessions and thats whats emerging here 
asked if he was concerned about the risks of going into a 
potential combat zone he replied it really doesnt enter my 
mind at all it is not a risky mission in my view id tell you if 
i felt any tremors i dont 
bush spent three days in paris for the 34nation conference on 
security and cooperation in europe dealing with the future of 
europe in the postcold war era 
the soviets did not rule out bushs proposal for a un 
resolution but instead counseled patience 
gorbachev interviewed on french television said all 
political leaders strive to avoid a military solution but we 
cannot tolerate saddam hussein and his regime bringing the world 
community to its knees 
he said the un security council will make an analysis of the 
situation and will reach a wellconsidered solution 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater refused to confirm a 
report that one resolution being discussed would call for automatic 
military action if saddam did not withdraw within a few months 
there are any number of approaches that are being considered we 
will not comment on any one of them he said 
resolutions already approved by the security council impose an 
economic boycott on iraq and occupied kuwait call for iraqs 
unconditional withdrawal and insist upon restoration of kuwaits 
previous government 
even before one trip was over bush was planning a second the 
white house said he would visit greece and turkey early next year 
meanwhile us and soviet officials unveiled plans for a 
superpower summit in moscow early next year to sign a treaty on 
reducing longrange nuclear weapons 
fitzwater said there was no firm date for the summit although 
he said both countries were aiming for january he said having a 
nuclear arms treaty to sign was a prerequisite for the summit but 
holding the session in january is what we have been talking about 
and shooting for

federal regulators liquidation of tiny freedom 
national bank earlier this month has prompted a wave of protest 
from state and federal officials against what they call the 
governments double standard for insolvent institutions 
in closing the bank the federal deposit insurance corp was 
unable to come up with a buyer the fdics 100000 limit on 
guaranteed deposits caused painful losses to many charities that 
invested money at the bank one of two blackowned banks in new 
york 
but critics assert the episode illustrates a federal policy that 
favors the giants and squeezes the meek they say the fdic has been 
much more accommodating to larger busted banks 
this week rep henry gonzalez texas democrat and chairman of 
the house banking committee and rep charles rangel of new york 
fired off separate letters to fdic chairman william seidman asking 
for a full explanation of the circumstances surrounding freedoms 
liquidation 
new york state attorney general robert abrams also wrote to 
seidman asking him to reimburse charitable organizations with 
accounts in freedom 
critics say that federal regulators in their handling of 
hundreds of troubled institutions these past two years have 
pursued an unwritten too big to fail doctrine regulators 
critics say will go all out to save large banks to prevent 
repercussions from rippling through the financial community 
freedoms lack of political and economic clout they say made 
it a candidate for a less common option too small to rescue 
freedoms largest depositors stand to take substantial losses 
as a result of this kind of twotiered policy one for the larger 
banks and one for the smaller banks said stephen verdier senior 
legislative council at independent bankers association of america 
a group representing communitybased banks 
following the freedom liquidation several large charitable 
groups which provide programs including foster care elderly 
services and housing assistance to crime victims stand to lose 
hundreds of thousands of dollars in deposits 
these depositors were under the mistaken impression that as long 
as each of their accounts did not exceed the 100000 limit covered 
by federal insurance their deposits would be covered but last 
friday the groups learned that the fdic totaled all their accounts 
in applying the 100000 cap all told roughly 11 million in 100 
freedom accounts exceeded the insurance limit compared to about 
80 million that was covered according to the fdic 
some of the charities assert that their separate accounts are 
actually being held in trust for different depositors which may 
enble the fdic to apply a separate 100000 cap to each account 
the fdic is looking into these claims 
accounts of more than 100000 often make it through a bank 
failure in one recent case more typical of the way the fdic 
handles insolvency all depositors of the national bank of 
washington dc even those with accounts in a branch in the 
bahamas were able to recover their funds regardless of the size 
of their deposits 
in this instance the fdic arranged a sale of the 15 billion 
bank to riggs national bank of washington which took over the 
failed banks assets in the process the fdic decided to cover 37 
million in the failed banks nassau bahamas branch 
the fdic justified the decision at the time by saying it was 
meant to help soothe foreign investors who account for a large 
percentage of deposits in big american banks 
but the decision was vigorously opposed by small banks which 
are being hit hard by increases in their deposit insurance 
premiums 
these larger banks and particularly their foreign depositors 
are totally protected while for small banks in the middle of 
depressed areas the fdic finds it somehow more convenient just to 
liquidate them said verdier 
the fdic says that of the 153 troubled banks it handled in 1990 
freedom was one of only six for which the fdic could not find 
buyers and had to liquidate instead 
fdic officials maintain they did all they could to find a buyer 
for freedom spending four weeks sifting through a list of 55 banks 
and investors including minority banks and investors in most 
instances four weeks is more than enough time said fdic 
spokesman david barr 
just after the banks failure was announced new york city 
business leaders met to raise the 6 million needed to replenish 
the banks depleted capital 
but the fdic says it was too late by then to consider the offer 
because the bank had already been shut down and the group of 
investors needed to obtain a bank charter to be considered 
critics however argue that the federal regulators should have 
tried harder to rescue the blackowned bank 
what we are trying to investigate is why in this particular 
incidence they chose a bank that is in an area that has a 
tremendous problem keeping any banks at all said peggy miller of 
the consumer federation of america a group representing 
depositors why suddenly in this particular case did they choose 
to get hardnosed

the association of italian floor traders 
decided wednesday to suspend their protest strike which has 
blocked trading since friday 
the suspension will be effective until nov 30 when traders 
will evaluate the progress made in adopting legislation modernizing 
the stock market and simplifying a proposed capital gains tax 
the decision followed a meeting early wednesday between 
representatives of striking floor traders and members of the 
finance committee of the chamber of deputies 
trading on italys 10 regional stock exchanges which are 
dominated by the milan bourse is expected to resume thursday 
the floor traders had called the strike to protest a new 
government proposal for a 30 percent capital gains tax they fear 
that the way the government intends to collect the tax will scare 
investors away from the stock market and shift business to other 
european markets 
the government has said it is willing to consider technical 
improvements in the implementation of the law but that it isnt 
willing to renounce the capital gains tax itself

guinness plc the british beer and liquor group 
said today it has agreed to make an offer of 518 million pounds or 
102 billion for la cruz del campo spains largest brewer 
the deal would be one of the largest ever foreign buyouts in 
spain 
guinness said it has the backing of shareholders in control of 
more than half the ordinary shares of sevillebased la cruz del 
campo which controls 22 percent of the spanish market 
but the spanish firms board insisted all shareholders receive 
the same opportunity to sell shares meaning the boardrecommended 
offer hinges on a vote planned at an extraordinary cruz del campo 
shareholders meeting set for the first half of december 
the takeover would make guinness the worlds 12th largest brewer 
by volume up from its current position as 17th 
the acquisition of cruzcampo provides guinness with a key 
strategic base in the fastgrowing spanish beer market now the 
secondlargest in europe guinness chairman anthony tennant said 
the spanish company whose shares are not traded publicly had 
been up for sale for more than a year drawing offers from the 
worlds premier brewing firms including the netherlands heineken 
nv denmarks carlsberg and elders ixl ltd of australia 
the guinness purchase could be completed as early as the end of 
next january cruz del campo said 
talk of a cruz del campo sale emerged after the uss stroh 
brewery co of detroit sought to sell its 28 percent share in cruz 
del campo 
guinness said it had reached an agreement with stroh not only to 
purchase its cruz del campo shares but strohs 30 percent stake in 
the cruz del campo unit henninger espanola sa it will pay 18 
million pounds or 3528 million for the henninger stake 
cruz del campo owns all or part of five other smaller spanish 
brewers 
guinness said it also planned to offer to buy those minority 
shares not owned by cruz del campo in its subsidiaries for an 
estimated price of 15 million pounds or 294 million 
cruz del campo currently holds a 22 percent share of the 
fastgrowing spanish market up from 17 percent a decade ago 
net profit last last year rose 18 percent to 1059 billion 
pesetas or 98 million and in the five years prior to last year 
rose an average 26 per cent per year the company said 
the decision to sell the group has not been an easy one but 
we reached the conclusion in 1989 that cruz del campo had reached 
the limits of what it could achieve on its own cruz del campo 
chairman ignacio ybarra mendaro said in a statement 
to continue development and profitable expansion we needed 
the resources and experience of an important and solvent 
international group he added

guinness plc said wednesday it has agreed to buy 
spains largest brewer la cruz del campo for 102 billion in a 
deal that will make the british company the worlds 12th largest 
brewer 
the acquisition would be one of the biggest foreign takeovers in 
spain where closely held cruz del campo commands a 22 percent 
share of the fastgrowing beer market 
guinness which ranks 17th among the worlds brewers said it 
already had the backing of shareholders who control more than half 
the sevillebased companys stock 
guinness said it also has reached an agreement with the stroh 
brewery co of detroit to buy both its 28 percent holding in cruz 
del campo and its 30 percent holding in henninger espanola sa a 
cruz del campo subsidiary the purchase price of the henninger 
stake is 18 million pounds or 355 million 
the acquisition of cruzcampo provides guinness with a key 
strategic base in spain said guinness chairman anthony tennant 
the decision to sell the group has not been an easy one but 
we reached the conclusion earlier this year that cruz del campo 
had reached the limits of what it could achieve on its own said 
cruz del campo chairman ignacio ybarra mendaro 
the spanish brewer whose shares are not publicly traded was on 
the block for nearly a year and had attracted interest from a 
variety of foreign brewers 
guinness said it would pay for the acquisition with cash and 
existing credit lines it said the purchase was not expected to 
dilute its earnings per share in the first year after the deal is 
completed the purchase subsequently should enhance earnings 
guinness said 
the deal is expected to be completed in january 1991 
philip morrisey an analyst with the london investment firm 
kleinwort benson securities said the acquisition would help 
balance guinness income from brewing and distilling morrisey 
estimated that adding cruz del campo would raise brewing results 
from 17 percent to about 21 percent of guinness pretax profit 
but analysts questioned whether cruz del campo would be able to 
continue expanding at its current rate industry projections called 
for a slowdown in the growth of spanish beer sales to about 1 
percent this year from the 4 percent average of the 1980s 
analysts said nationwide expansion could be difficult because of 
strongholds that other brewers have in regions outside andalucia 
where cruz del campo dominates 
spaniards are loyal to regional brands and it wont be easy to 
convince them to change said carlos de la serna an analyst with 
iberagentes sa in madrid 
cruz del campos aftertax profit jumped 14 percent last year to 
81 million dollars sales rose 12 percent to 467 million 
guinness had aftertax profit of 472 million pounds or 930 
million last year on revenue of 307 billion pounds or 605 
billion

michael r milken climbed quietly to the 
pinnacle of highfinance in the 1980s he descended with a 
shattering crash into disgrace and prison where hell likely spend 
a good chunk of the 1990s 
born and raised in california milken was a math whiz helping 
his fathers accounting business by age 10 he studied arcane 
business tracts while others marched for civil rights and peace 
during the 1960s in his early years on wall street milken 
digested financial documents during a twohour commute 
with the same passion milken avoided the limelight after 
gaining market prowess shunning interviews and refusing to pose 
alone for the annual report of his employer drexel burnham lambert 
inc 
milken became a familiar figure only after speculator ivan 
boesky fingered him in the governments fraud investigation in late 
1986 the most prominent financier in the securities industry in 
the booming 1980s milken became prosecutors main target 
after insisting he was innocent milken changed his mind in 
april under a plea bargain he pleaded guilty to six felony counts 
and agreed to pay 600 million in penalties and restitution to 
defrauded investors 
the 44yearold former head of drexels junkbond department was 
sentenced wednesday to a 10year imprisonment and three years of 
probation he must serve at least a third of the prison term 
to some it might sound ironic but i have spent a lifetime 
trying to avoid publicity milken wrote in letter to us 
district judge kimba wood prior to sentencing my parents taught 
me if you worked hard and knew you did a good job you should not 
need recognition from others 
milken was born on the fourth of july in 1946 as a child he was 
a star student and said he was embarrassed when his fourthgrade 
teacher singled out his perfect scores 
he graduated the university of california at berkeley in 1968 
and went on to the university of pennsylvanias prestigious wharton 
school in between he married lori anne hackel his high school 
sweetheart 
in 1970 at age 24 milken joined drexels new york office as 
head of fixedincome research commuting from his southern new 
jersey home by bus by 1973 he was head of highyield bonds his 
compensation was set in a 1975 formula and never altered that 
gave him a portion of the departments profits 
milken was to become infamous for the 11 billion he earned 
from 198387 550 million in 1987 alone milken has said the 
wealth was a byproduct of his work raising money for companies 
i went to wall street with the desire to help change society 
for the better not to find a fortune milken told the judge 
i felt that working in the financial community created the 
best opportunity for social change making capital available where 
it hadnt been before he wrote

a flash point of the cold war has become a focus 
of the cola wars 
since the berlin wall opened last year cocacola and pepsicola 
have spent millions of dollars trying to establish a presence in 
what was formerly east germany 
pepsico inc representatives with television cameras rolling 
handed out cans of pepsi when the wall was dismantled and when 
east germany allowed advertising on national tv for the first time 
this spring a cocacola co spot was among the first to air 
the first unification of germany was soft drink unification 
said emanuel goldman an industry analyst for painewebber inc in 
san francisco 
the cola makers are concentrating now on building a distribution 
system and inching toward fullscale manufacturing in the region 
which for nearly half a century was closed to most western 
products 
the companies also are moving along with the type of aggressive 
public relations and advertising that have characterized soft drink 
competition elsewhere for decades 
already coke says it is outselling its nearest competitor 
10to1 a contention which pepsi dismisses 
atlantabased coke which has a bottling operation running in 
what was east berlin says it has sold 7 million cases of cocacola 
products since entering the former communist country in february 
pepsi a division of purchase nybased pepsico entered the new 
german market in january but says it does not yet have reliable 
sales figures 
either sideis guessing its a little too early in the 
game said tod mackenzie a pepsicola spokesman theres no 
independent measurement in the eastern sector to represent what 
your share of the market is 
we can say we shipped so much but thats not a measure of 
consumer take just how much we sent out the door 
the soft drink makers say theyre expecting great things in the 
newly united germany that assessment is shared by analyst goldman 
its good for both companies goldman said adding that coke 
begins with a head start because of the commanding presence it had 
in west germany and most of europe 
we think east germany will reach the consumption levels of 
west germany in the next few years ralph cooper president of 
cokes european community group said in a recent interview we 
think thats a very achievable target 
nearly 70 percent of the people have tried cocacola in the 
first months said cooper whose division accounts for about 
onequarter of cokes international sales 
according to coke east german soft drink consumption in 1989 
was 315 eightounce servings per person compared with 334 in west 
germany west german consumption of coke products was 167 
eightounce servings per person in 1989 and company officials 
estimate that east german per capita coke consumption is now about 
30 
in the united states the world leader in soft drink 
consumption the per capita rate for cocacola products was 283 
coke is the no 1 soft drink company in the united states with 
about 41 percent of the domestic market though most of the 
companys recent growth has come overseas 
pepsis per capita figures were unavailable 
goldman said it is easier for coke to get established in the new 
market because it literally can move its west german operations 
next door pepsi has a much smaller operation there about 
onefifth the size of cokes he said 
for pepsi its good he said for coke its spectacular 
they know how to sell it there they know the whole market there 
pepsi however says its strong presence for nearly 20 years in 
such eastern bloc nations as the soviet union poland yugoslavia 
and czechloslovakia gives it an advantage 
pepsis historical leadership position throughout the eastern 
bloc has provided significant leverage to power us into the east 
german market as well said mackenzie 
pepsis initial activity in eastern germany has involved 
building a distribution system across the key southern commercial 
belt which includes leipzig and dresden manufacturing is still 
down the road for pepsi mackenzie said 
coke has concentrated its efforts on distribution but it also 
is creating an infrastructure for manufacturing bottling and 
sales cooper said 
we want to be a part of everyday life there he said 
cooper said the company tapped into its west german operation 
for help on the other side of the border once the wall opened 
coke has plastered cities with advertising posters and has 
sponsored a number of local events pepsi put up a 40foot 
permanent billboard on a major thoroughfare in east berlin and 
advertises on public transportation 
its amazing how quickly a consumer open goods market has 
taken over there mackenzie said 
mackenzie said pepsi also has tried to respond to the germans 
heightened environmental awareness by offering its products in 
recyclable plastic bottles

hands of investors rise 
it is widely believed that the central bank relaxed its monetary 
policy last week amid mounting evidence of economic deterioration

oil prices rose moderately wednesday as the 
futures market turned bullish over a drop in the crude supply and 
frances prediction that the un security council will authorize 
military action against iraq 
light sweet crude oil moved up 72 cents to 2963 per barrel for 
january delivery contracts on the new york mercantile exchange 
erasing much of tuesdays fall of 181 per barrel 
volume was about as light as it has been for any session since 
iraq invaded kuwait in august as traders prepared to take off for 
the thanksgiving holiday the oil market reopens friday but some 
traders planned to take a fourday weekend 
i suppose were having one of the dullest days weve had in 
several weeks around here said bob baker an oil analyst with 
prudentialbache securities inc 
traders were generally unwilling to enter into new oil contracts 
because of the possibility of unexpected developments in the 
persian gulf where president bush was spending the holiday with 
us troops 
in the back of peoples minds theyre thinking anything could 
happen with him over there said peter beutel an analyst with 
pegasus econometric group inc in hoboken nj 
oil opened higher in response to an american petroleum institute 
report issued that night before that showed stocks of crude oil and 
refined products dropped in the previous week 
crude then hit its high for the day of 3020 per barrel after 
french president francois mitterrand said he had told bush that a 
un resolution authorizing force against iraq was needed the 
french leader said such a resolution would likely be passed within 
three weeks 
adding to the markets bullish mood were perceptions that the 
united states and the soviet union had become closer in their views 
on the gulf crisis 
the soviets who were talking about being against military 
intervention earlier in the week have kind of backpedaled said 
brian tagler a broker with shearson lehman brothers inc each 
day we find they agree more and more with president bush 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev on wednesday urged the 
un security council to meet immediately on the gulf crisis 
as oil moved ahead refined petroleum products tagged along 
unleaded gasoline rose 148 cents to 7895 cents a gallon on 
december contracts with later contract months moving higher as 
well home heating oil was higher for all delivery months with the 
december contract up 79 cent at 8524 cents a gallon 
baker said heating oils relatively weaker performance reflected 
a belief among traders that no supply problems seem likely this 
winter 
natural gas futures traded lower with the january delivery 
contract falling 2 cents to 261 per 1000 cubic feet

mobil chemical co unjustly fired a top 
executive after he refused to go along with a company coverup of 
environmental problems a federal jury found wednesday 
the jury awarded the employee valcar bowman 375000 in 
compensatory damages and 1 million in punitive damages it also 
found in favor of his wife pamela for loss of spousal support 
but awarded her no money the jury rejected two counterclaims 
filed by mobil against bowman 
the panel was asked to decide whether the oil giant fired bowman 
in 1986 because he would not go along with company attorneys who 
wanted to sanitize reports that documented mobils environmental 
problems 
valcar also claimed he was fired because he objected to plans to 
remove records from a company plant when attorneys realized a raid 
by law enforcement officials was imminent 
justice prevails bowman said after the verdict was read 
of course the money is important but the fact that the jury 
recognized that something wrong was happening here was also very 
important 
mobil attorneys had argued that bowmans job as the no 2 
environmental officer at mobil chemical co was eliminated as part 
of a costcutting program 
its a bad decision and mobil plans to appeal said mobil 
attorney richard ribstein there was no evidence to support any 
of the claims 
company attorneys attacked bowman in closing arguments as a 
fraud and a liar intent on starting his own business by 
getting money from mobil the nations second largest oil company 
behind exxon corp 
bowmans attorneys responded that mobil was trying to distract 
the jury from the evidence with a wellfunded smear campaign 
in his closing arguments attorney stephen wiley produced a 
series of memos that indicated mobil planned to abolish the 
position of the manager of environmental affairs as a way to get 
rid of bowman 
we should be prepared to live without the position of 
environmental manager for some time eg up to two years said a 
company memo dated six weeks before bowmans dismissal 
wiley scoffed at mobils contention that bowman was dismissed in 
a costcutting move he noted that in 1986 the year bowman lost 
his job mobils chemical division earned a record 140 million up 
164 percent from 1985 
mobil attorneys spent most of their closing arguments trying to 
shred bowmans personal credibility with a parade of resumes 
applications and affidavits that showed bowman had lied in the 
past 
in one case highlighted by mobil attorneys bowman swore on an 
affidavit about 10 years ago that his wifes daughter from a 
previous partner was his 
the jury also witnessed a parade of excerpts from the dictionary 
blown up and highlighted on 2by4foot cards of the 
definitions of the words bogus swindle hypocrite and 
heist

kimba m wood the rookie federal judge who gave 
michael r milken a 10year prison term wednesday lived up to her 
reputation 
friends and acquaintances of wood said the judges handling of 
the most explosive case in her short tenure on the manhattan 
federal bench was characteristically thorough and precise 
i think she went through the most searching careful and 
methodical and thoughtful process said lloyd constantine head 
of antitrust enforcement for new york state and a friend of wood 
she did not treat the matter lightly constantine said i 
cant recall a sentencing where a judge invested so much time and 
effort 
wood was besieged with hundreds of letters from milken 
supporters and critics alike she blazed through mountains of legal 
documents from thedefense and prosecution one portraying milken 
as a gentle philanthropist the other painting him as an arrogant 
crook it was clear she believed neither 
perhaps most important acquaintances said was the 
extraordinary hearing wood convened last month into unproven 
allegations of milkens wrongdoing beyond the six felonies he 
admitted it showed both her skepticism and desire to leave no 
question unresolved in her final reckoning of milkens fate 
laura handman a manhattan attorney and another friend of wood 
said she felt confident the judge reviewed all the evidence and 
weighed all the considerations very closely in reaching her 
decision 
wood 46 is the youngest judge on the manhattan federal bench 
one of the busiest in the nation she was appointed two years ago 
and received milkens case through the courts random assignment 
system 
she had no prior sentencing history in major criminal cases 
leaving legal experts little on which to speculate few anticipated 
shed give milken 10 years of the maximum 28 he faced 
the severity of the term more than triple the time given 
milkens chief accuser ivan f boesky was seen as a strong message 
to the financial community that securitieslaw abusers will be 
dealt with severely 
people familiar with wood have described her as a sensitive 
hardworking judge whose quiet demeanor and dark good looks belie a 
sharp mind and a gift for remembering detail even her husband 
time magazine journalist michael kramer recently described woods 
appearance as misleading to the unwary 
shes always had this very calm exterior and yet shes very 
tough kramer said i mean in the judicial sense in a 
steeltrap mind way 
the few nationally prominent cases wood handled prior to the 
milken case suggested she was willing to be bold 
in october 1988 she reversed a ruling by the immigration and 
naturalization service that had denied refugee status to a ghanian 
soldier who plotted a coup against his government last year she 
upheld the right of a 76yearold new york state judge to seek 
reappointment although he had passed retirement age 
wood was born jan 2 1944 in port townsend wash her parents 
decided to name her kimba after a small town in south australias 
eyre peninsula theyd found on a map 
she attended the sorbonne in paris got her ba from 
connecticut college masters degree from the london school of 
economics and law degree from harvard university before she became 
a federal judge she practiced antitrust law in washington and new 
york

law enforcers praised the 10year prison term 
given to michael r milken on wednesday but some legal experts 
said it was unusually stiff and the financiers supporters called 
the punishment excessively brutal 
from washington to wall street to the west coast where milken 
made his home the sentence provoked the kind of mixed reaction 
that underscored the widely divergent public opinion of the famous 
junkbond pioneer 
milken former head of drexel burnham lambert incs highyield 
bond division was sentenced by us district judge kimba wood for 
six felonies stemming from his role as a powerful investment banker 
of the past decade 
outstanding richly deserved said bruce baird a former 
assistant us attorney who led the initial stages of the 
prosecution i think judge wood is sending a message to wall 
street that its time to stop mewing about technical offenses and 
time to start obeying the law 
attorney general dick thornburgh praised the sentence milken 
received as both fair and appropriate to the circumstances 
former securities and exchange commission chairman david s 
ruder said he was pleased and surprised i did not expect it to 
be that severe but i think the penalty is quite in accord with the 
severity of his conduct 
some lawmakers though said that the sentence no matter how 
severe could not undo what they called the damage brought by 
milkens crimes 
the harsh fact of the matter is that it will take the american 
public much longer than 10 years and much more than 600 million to 
pay for the mess these financial engineering schemes have left 
behind said rep john dingell dmich chairman of the house 
energy and commerce committee which oversees the sec 
on the other hand some legal experts said the sentences 
severity while justified seemed to outstrip the nature of 
milkens crimes 
i think the sentence is all symbolic its got nothing to do 
with the need to protect society from any future threats from 
milken said arthur mathews the lawyer for takeover speculator 
paul a bilzerian who received what had been the stiffest sentence 
in the wall street fraud scandal four years before wood 
announced milkens fate 
implicit in the sentence is that this was more than an 
aberration in her view and this was systemic he said 
there was also little sympathy on wall street where nearly 
everyone has a friend who has been laid off as a result of the 
downturn in the financial markets since the stock market crash 
three years ago 
when th sentence was handed down shortly before noon a loud 
commotion could be heard for about five seconds on the floor of the 
new york stock exchange brokers said similar to the reaction 
when a stock price takes a quick dive 
it was nothing like a wild panic the damage is done already 
and weve all got to go on from here said steven schaeffer a 
floor broker with lawrence helfant hopefully hes the last of 
the yuppies to go 
frank kettles 31 a wall street telecommunications worker 
learned of milkens sentence while drinking with a friend at 
houlihans bar in manhattans downtown financial district 
yeah he shouted raising his fist wall street got a bad 
name because of people like him 
down the block kecia montgomery 25 a former drexel worker who 
quit two years to become a nurse because the profession is about 
caring not taking took time out from chatting with a hotdog 
vendor to say that milkens sentence inspires little sympathy with 
her 
if you cant do the time dont do the crime said 
montgomery its not fair that he did his dirty work and hurt a 
lot of people 
but in greater los angeles where milken lives and used to work 
many of his friends reacted with dismay and outrage 
its like they hit me over the head with a sledgehammer what 
a waste of talent said richard riordan a prominent lawyer and 
philanthropist who has been an ally of milken in many business and 
charitable activities

nutrasweet co officials were singing the blues 
wednesday about a federal appeals court decision that the pastel 
blue color of the companys equal brand sweetener packets is not a 
trademark 
nutrasweet based in north suburban deerfield went to court in 
february 1989 seeking to halt stadt corp and cumberland packing 
corps use of blue packets for their lowcalorie sweet one brand 
sweetener 
the us district court for the northern district of illinois 
denied nutrasweets motion for an injunction in the fall of 1989 
nutrasweet a division of monsanto co of st louis appealed the 
case to the seventh us circuit court of appeals which upheld the 
lower court ruling in a decision issued earlier this month 
nutrasweet spokesman rich nelson said the company is considering 
appealing the decision to the us supreme court 
we believe the use of color alone can be used as a tredemark 
just as other courts have found nelson said wednesday 
nutrasweets lawsuit contended that the blue packets in which it 
has packaged equal since 1982 distinguish the aspartame sweetener 
from other sugar substitutes such as sweet n low which comes in 
pink packets and sugar twin which is packaged in yellow 
nutrasweet conceded the sweet ones packets are not the same 
shade of blue as equals but said the color is confusingly 
similar to equals 
nutrasweet based its argument mainly on a 1985 federal appeals 
court ruling from another circuit in a case involving owenscorning 
fiberglas corp maker of pink fiberglass insulation in that case 
the court established a limited rule that in certain situations a 
particular color could be registered as a trademark 
in the nutrasweet decision senior district judge john w 
reynolds wrote that the general rule prohibiting registration of 
color as a trademark should continue to be the law in this 
circuit partly because changing the law would result in 
infringement actions that could soon degenerate into questions of 
shade confusion similar to the nutrasweet case 
how different do the colors have to be reynolds wrote 
under nutrasweets proposed test the only way to answer that 
question is through litigation 
officials of stadt and cumberland could not be reached wednesday 
for comment
