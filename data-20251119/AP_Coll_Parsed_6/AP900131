president bush won democratic praise wednesday 
night for his plan to cut us and soviet forces in central europe 
while senate gop leader bob dole said the proposal would put the 
united states on the offensive at the bargaining table 
rep les aspin the democratic chairman of the house armed 
services committee said the president should be congratulated 
for the plan outlined in a state of the union address 
trying to negotiate lower limits on forces deployed in europe 
is clearly a good idea said the wisconsin democrat 
said dole the ball is now in soviet leader mikhail 
gorbachevs court 
at the same time they were hailing his troop cut proposal 
democrats made plain their intention to battle with bush over other 
issues in the current electionyear session of congress 
in a nationally televised speech that served as the formal 
democratic response house speaker thomas s foley said his party 
would work with the president wherever and whenever we can on 
some issues we will have difference because we care deeply about 
certain principles he said 
he scoffed at bushs call for a meager 2 percent rise in 
education spending and said democrats would battle the 
administration this year on legislation dealing with capital gains 
taxes child care and clean air as for abortion he said we 
will continue to defend a womans right to choose for we are 
convinced that politicians cannot and should not attempt to make 
the choice 
house democratic leader richard gephardt of missouri faulted 
bush for not being more specific about how he intends to 
strengthen our economy and lift the economic fortunes of people who 
work for a living 
republicans applauded bushs statement that the last thing we 
need to do is mess around with social security with gop house 
whip newt gingrich of georgia saying the presidents position is 
going to be clearly the only acceptable political position saying 
that nothing affecting benefits can be considered 
sen daniel patrick moynihan dny in an attempt to block the 
government from using surplus social security taxes has proposed 
rolling back a tax increase that took effect jan 1 and to reduce 
another increase scheduled for next year 
following the speech moynihan said despite bushs promise not 
to fool with social security theyre messing around with social 
security where theyre using the trust fund as general revenue 
overall dole called bushs speech an optimistic can do 
state of the union which advances a hope agenda one in sharp 
contrast with the democrats nope agenda 
but house democratic whip william gray dpa said bushs 
speech ought to be introduced to his budget theres a 
disconnect 
but domestic issues aside lawmakers on both sides of the aisle 
chorused their praise of bushs proposal to reduce troops in the 
socalled central front in europe to 195000 for each 
superpower 
sen john warner of virginia ranking republican on the senate 
armed services committee said bush skillfully seized the element 
of surprise and thereby seized the opportunity to put the united 
states back into the forefront of negotiations to reduce 
conventional forces 
sen sam nunn dga the chairman of the senate armed services 
committee said the reduction plan makes the arms control 
proposal that we have on the table much more relevant to the 
changing circumstances in europe and also much more in keeping with 
some of our fiscal pressures 
earlier in the day foley told reporters he would welcome a 
suggestion that we could make further troop cuts in europe 
i dont think the united states should totally withdraw from 
western europe but very substantial reductions are not only 
possible but i think inevitable he said 
bushs proposal is a response to the tumultuous changes in 
eastern europe where the push for democracy has led to the 
downfall of hardline communist regimes 
one longtime advocate of reduced us troops in europe rep 
patricia schroeder dcolo said she was delighted with the 
plan theres hope schroeder said 
just when you thought you had a cold war budget boom said 
schroeder a senior member of the house armed services committee 
aspin coupled his praise with a caution we should be careful 
in this whole process not to give the soviet union a reason to keep 
more troops in eastern europe than it would without an agreement 
for both sides it should be a ceiling not a floor 
rep pat williams dmont said bush is rushing to catch the 
reality of eastern europe 
sen william cohen rmaine said the united states was 
falling behind the curve of popular will on the issue of troop 
reductions 
rep dave mccurdy dokla a member of the house armed services 
committee and the democratic caucus pointman on defense 
questioned the absence of a military strategy from the 
administration 
it was unwise to build up on military strength in the 1980s 
without a national strategy but it is even more dangerous to build 
down without one mccurdy said 
dole defended the president as a middleoftheroad president 
ultra liberals and ultra conservatives may not like tonights 
speech which tells me george bush is right in step with the 
american people he said

a blizzard is blowing and dawn is an hour 
away but socialist candidate nobutaka tsutsui is shivering at a 
factory gate trying to entice votes away from the conservatives 
who have governed japan for 35 years 
wrapped in a wool coat and fortified by handwarmers in his 
pockets he zeroes in on the unpopular sales tax that the liberal 
democratic government introduced last year called a consumption 
tax in japan 
good morning my name is nobutaka tsutsui the smiling 
45yearold candidate for parliament tells workers as they arrive 
or leave during a shiftchange at an electronics factory 
lets join our forces to scrap the disgusting consumption tax 
and end the ldps tyranny 
no fancy speech about socialism and he gets encouraging 
responses even in this traditionally conservative ricegrowing 
constituency in northern japans snow country 
good luck says a young woman in a factory uniform i will 
vote for you to get rid of the consumption tax and so will many of 
my friends 
the socialists are counting on millions of likeminded people to 
knock the liberal democrats into the minority when ballots are 
counted from the feb 18 election which is expected to set the 
tone for japanese politics in the 1990s 
the conservative party appears to be facing the greatest threat 
ever to its dominance socialist candidates like tsutsui a 
populist lawyer who wears trendy clothes and moves around the 
snowbound district in a fourwheeldrive mitsubishi are expected 
to grab many normally conservative votes 
the liberal democratic party now holds 295 of the 512 seats in 
the lower house of parliament polls indicate it could lose its 
majority in the chamber which elects the prime minister 
the socialists are the largest opposition group and have a 
chance to increase their seats from 85 now to more than 140 under 
the leadership of popular chairwoman takako doi 
if that happens and the parties with their deep ideological 
divides try to form a coalition government japan could be headed 
for a period of political uncertainty 
tsutsui fell 7000 votes short of a seat in the last election in 
1986 but he is regarded as frontrunner among a halfdozen 
candidates vying for the two seats in the constituency 
i am aware i have some advantages this time he said as he 
plowed through the snow in a jeep but my weakness is that i 
still lack prominence compared with the liberal democrat 
incumbents 
if tsutsui wins one of the two liberal democrat incumbents will 
be out fourterm legislator katsuhiko shirakawa 44 is trying 
hard to win that other seat 
this is nothing but a fight for political survival for me 
shirakawa said as he was driven from one campaign stop to the next 
he told about 25 factory managers who gathered at a supporters 
house in rural takada i can protect the interests of people in 
the jyoetsu district and make the area thrive 
new train lines and new highways are going to be built in the 
next four to six years as a result of my efforts said shirakawa 
fixing his gaze on each person in the audience in turn we can 
expect a huge amount of public works followed by hundreds of 
thousands of tourists and new business opportunities 
pork barrel politics is the origin of much of the liberal 
democrats success over past decades as they spread public works 
around japan enabling them to campaign on a record of bringing 
local prosperity while building japan 
shirakawa is appealing to company executives smallbusiness 
owners and farmers trying to persuade them that he can help the 
local economy grow 
he says he has no way of stopping those who dislike the sales 
tax from voting socialist so he tries to strengthen my grip on 
the conservative votes and try not to let them go to the socialist 
or the other conservative party candidate 
the tax which imposes a 3 percent levy on all goods and 
services has become the focal point of the campaign polls 
indicate more than a third of voters pegged the tax as the no 1 
issue less than 10 percent thought the big issue was socialism vs 
conservatism the liberal democrats campaign theme 
hurt by sex and bribery scandals and the sales tax the liberal 
democrats lost their majority in the upper house in july elections 
and two prime ministers from the party had to resign last year in 
an extraordinary show of political disarray 
opposition parties are united in their calls to scrap the tax 
entirely the liberal democrats insist it is essential to support 
the budget in the 21st century though they promise to review and 
improve the tax 
i just hope that too many voters wont turn to the 
socialists only because of the tax issue disregarding other 
important national and international issues shirakawa told about 
50 female workers at a backers semiconductor factory who had 
gathered during a lunch break 
at about the same time tsutsui was kneeling on a reedmat floor 
with about 25 people in the home of a supporter telling them 
japan needs a new type of leadership that is fitting for a new 
era but the ldp is suffering from metal fatigue and it must be 
replaced 
and the very first thing we should do is to scrap the 
consumption tax which we all hate the tax has a symbolic 
significance of what a long oneparty dominance will cause

when heather harlan transferred to 
wesleyan university last year she had an image of a school with 
rigorous academic standards and a long tradition of liberalism 
now harlan and other students find themselves defending the 
private university against a new druggie label they say has 
been unfairly pinned on the central connecticut school 
the whole thing has been blown out of proportion said 
harlan who transferred from new york university ive seen 
people use drugs but id say the overwhelming majority of students 
dont use drugs 
wesleyans image problem stemmed from an incident last october 
when only one student was arrested among an estimated 400 attending 
an annual campus marijuanasmoking party known as the smoke 
out some students estimated 100 students smoked marijuana at the 
party 
a storm of publicity followed the oct 27 party most of it 
focusing on assertions by several students that wesleyan 
administrators were willing to look the other way when it came to 
drug use and did little to stop the party 
they didnt really do anything to stop it they brought in a 
few cops instead of a whole army said sophomore marc flacks 
wesleyan spokesman bobby wayne clark defended the single arrest 
made during the party saying by the time police arrived most of 
the students who were smoking pot had stashed it 
but three months later the 3400student university is still 
reeling from the unwanted attention 
and although administrators insist they are not soft on drugs 
the hullabaloo has prompted them to review the schools drug policy 
dean edgar beckham said administrators are considering 
strengthening the wording of their policy to get out a tougher 
message about the schools attitude toward drugs 
wesleyans current policy is to work with middletown police to 
make drug arrests on campus including tipping them off when they 
know a big party is scheduled where drugs are likely to be used 
beckham said 
the universitys code of conduct defines the sale of any illegal 
drug as a serious breach possession of cocaine and heroin also 
has that classification but the code does not specifically mention 
marijuana or lsd 
students who break the universitys rules are subject to 
penalties ranging from a warning letter to expulsion 
beckham said the school is considering either deleting any 
mention to specific drugs so as not to give the impression some 
drugs are condoned or adding marijuana and lsd to the list of 
drugs considered serious breaches 
but many students and administrators said they were tired of 
defending a policy they say does not need defending 
when were encouraging police to come on campus and make 
arrests whenever possible then i would say thats a harsh policy 
not a lenient policy said beckham 
with an annual tuition approaching 15000 and a competitive 
admissions policy students say wesleyan is not a school where 
people go to party 
were being called a druggie school but i dont think thats 
accurate compared to other institutions said senior eric ford 
but there are students who think administrators should put more 
teeth into enforcement 
a good place to start they said would be to crack down on 
large campus parties like the smoke out and uncle duke 
day an event that is usually held the following day 
uncle duke day named after the selfindulgent drugabusing 
character in the doonesbury comic strip is openly advertised 
on campus and students know the days activities will include drug 
use 
if youre going to do any type of drug enforcement at all why 
dont you start with the obvious uncle duke day said junior 
elan grossman 
but administrators said policing every party would be impossible 
there are institutions that have codes that sound tough but 
arent said clark wesleyan has a code that puts the burden of 
responsibility on students and we believe that works

president bush is expected to sign legislation 
that provides for trade sanctions against china but allows the 
president to suspend them if he finds it is in the national 
interest 
the senate voted 980 late tuesday for the measure which was 
passed by the house in november before congress twomonth holiday 
break 
prompted by beijings crackdown last june on prodemocracy 
demonstrators the sanctions are part of a 97 billion measure 
authorizing activities of the state department for the 1990 and 
1991 fiscal years 
the legislation would suspend 
financial underwriting through the overseas private investment 
corporation for us companies doing business in china 
aid under the trade and development program 
issuing licenses for controlled munitions or crime control and 
detection equipment 
export of usbuilt satellites certain bilateral nuclear 
cooperation and liberalization of multilateral export controls 
most of the sanctions reflect actions bush himself had already 
taken in the wake of the bloody suppression of prodemocracy 
demonstrations in beijing on june 4 and their place in the bill is 
regarded as mostly symbolic 
the administration already has begun to lift some of those 
sanctions including the one barring export of satellites citing 
improved conditions in china 
the bill approved tuesday would permit bush to terminate any of 
the sanctions if significant political reform occurs in china or if 
bush finds waiver of the sanctions is in the national interest 
of the united states 
there was almost no debate on the bill in contrast to the 
showdown last week over whether to uphold bushs veto of a measure 
that would have protected chinese students in the united states 
from deportation 
the senate narrowly upheld the veto after the white house waged 
an allout campaign to pressure republican senators to back the 
president an administration official described the fight as not 
a battle over how to handle china but a battle over who should be 
handling china 
democrats used the occasion to again accuse bush of toocozy 
relations with a regime that has done little to adhere to us 
human rights standards 
the largest amounts in the bill 33 billion this year and 
37 billion next year are for the state department primarily 
for salaries and the expenses of running embassies and consulates 
around the world 
also included are about 2 billion over two years for the us 
information agency and 600 million for the board for international 
broadcasting which runs radio free europe and radio liberty

prosecutors appear to be building a drug case 
against mayor marion barry by securing the cooperation of a man who 
law enforcement sources say accused the mayor of drug use 
james mcwilliams a district of columbia employee pleaded 
guilty to a misdemeanor drug charge tuesday and then immediately 
began testifying before a grand jury investigating barrys ties to 
convicted drug dealer charles lewis 
this is another significant step in this investigation us 
attorney jay b stephens said the mayors arrest was a 
significant step and this was a significant step too 
in another development a source familiar with the case said 
several members of the mayors city security detail are expected to 
testify before the grand jury in the near future 
the guards who are assigned to the mayor on a roundtheclock 
basis are expected to be asked whether they ever witnessed the 
mayor using drugs or helped get drugs for him said the source who 
spoke on condition of anonymity 
at a news conference stephens refused to say whether he intends 
for the bodyguards to testify before the panel but said 
prosecutors will want to cover any witness that might be able to 
provide information regarding this case 
barry who was arrested jan 18 on a misdemeanor cocaine 
possession charge has denied under oath using drugs with lewis at 
a downtown washington hotel more than a year earlier in december 
1988 
the charge against mcwilliams stemmed from allegations of visits 
to lewis hotel room some of which prosecutors say coincided with 
barrys visits 
meanwhile washingtons wrctv quoting unnamed sources said 
barry could be indicted within two weeks by the grand jury which 
has been looking into allegations of perjury and cocaine possession 
mcwilliams a city motor vehicles department employee and a 
longtime lewis associate declined to comment either before or 
after his grand jury testimony he pleaded guilty to a charge of 
aiding and abetting drug possession which carries a maximum 
penalty of one year in prison and a 100000 fine 
according to a source familiar with the case mcwilliams has 
told authorities he was present once when the mayor and lewis 
disappeared into the bathroom of the hotel room for a short time 
mcwilliams told prosecutors he smelled crack cocaine and then 
saw the mayor emerge from the bathroom under the influence of the 
drug the source said 
the washington post in todays editions quoted assistant us 
attorney richard w roberts as saying that during the hotel 
episode mcwilliams loaned money to lewis for lewis to purchase 
drugs and later lent his car to lewis so that lewis could go 
purchase additional drugs 
mcwilliams 57 was called before the grand jury investigating 
the case last january but refused to testify 
carole bland jackson a former business partner of the woman who 
was in a hotel room when barry was arrested this month in an fbi 
sting also said in weekend interviews that she was present when

an institute devoted solely to aids research 
will open this year in manhattan launched with 114 million in 
foundation and city funds and is expected to grow into one of the 
worlds largest aids laboratories 
dr david ho 37 an aids researcher and member of the aids 
advisory committee of the us centers for disease control will be 
director of the new aaron diamond aids research center 
the center will concentrate on creating an aids vaccine and 
preventing the damage aids causes to people already infected 
officials said 
when a cure for aids is found it will be in a place such as 
this mayor david n dinkins said at a news conference 
the sponsors said the center would rank in size with such 
leading aids programs as the pasteur institute and the national 
institutes of health in bethesda md in about two years 
the center started with 3 million from the diamond foundation 
and 34 million in city construction and renovation funds is 
expected to open in about six months and will be housed rentfree 
in the citys department of health laboratories building 
the diamond foundation also has promised 1 million a year

its immediate goal is to attract about 50 topnotch scientists 
many of whom already have federal research grants and gather them 
under one roof for collaboration said ho who was lured from the 
university of california at los angeles 
ho predicted it will take several years for researchers at the 
center or elsewhere to develop a successful aids vaccine and 
several more years to put it into widespread use

thousands of starving people are being 
held captive in the besieged southern capital of juba where rebels 
and army forces are at a standoff in some of the civil wars 
fiercest fighting relief workers say 
the relief workers who were evacuated from the city this week 
said tuesday that government soldiers have prevented residents from 
leaving so many people are digging trenches to shelter themselves 
from rocket attacks by rebels ringing the city 
juba has become a death trap said irishman daniel eiffe 
people live in terror from the shelling this is a whole new 
dimension 
eiffe of the agency for cooperation and research in 
development a londonbased relief group flew to khartoum on 
monday with three other westerners as part of a un airlift 
fourteen other westerners flew to nairobi kenya and they too 
spoke of terror and starvation an italian doctor said he saw 
security forces beat back two groups of people attempting to leave 
mainly women and children 
civilians fleeing the fighting in the countryside have swollen 
jubas population to nearly 300000 and food is running out 
another doctor who fled to nairobi said people fear riots over the 
meager stocks that remain 
the angst is exacerbated by the uncertainty of what will come if 
rebels of the sudan peoples liberation army end their long siege 
of the city with a military advance 
the rebels end broadcasts on their clandestine radio station 
with the ominous signoff black people be ready 
john garang a renegade army colonel began the bush insurgency 
in africas largest country in 1983 the rebels are fighting the 
moslemdominated government in khartoum for increased economic and 
political autonomy for the predominantly christian and animist 
southern half of sudan 
hundreds of thousands have died in the civil war most of them 
victims of a famine caused by farmers being driven from their 
fields to seek refuge in governmentcontrolled places like juba 
750 miles south of the capital 
the rebel push around juba is their fiercest offensive in nearly 
seven years they have captured 11 communities south and west of 
the city virtually ending access to it by road 
the army has 9000 to 10000 troops and several thousand armed 
civilians and militia in juba which sits on the west bank of the 
white nile and is the largest town in southern sudan 
about 5000 rebels are thought to surround the city and 
military sources in khartoum said the insurgents lack the firepower 
or manpower to take juba 
the rebels have shelled the city twice on jan 21 and last 
friday eiffe said at least 23 civilians were killed in the 
attacks on monday rebel radio said the shelling would resume and 
advised residents to leave 
eiffe said the city was paralyzed he said businesses and 
schools were closed and food distribution so limited that rations 
were half of what is considered minimal daily fare under 
international standards more than half of jubas residents are 
displaced people who live in crude camps 
the government banned relief flights to the south on nov 3 
because of intensified fighting and jubas only source of food has 
been daily sudan airways flights chartered by the lutheran world 
federation in nairobi 
the flights bring in 50 to 60 tons of food a day but the city 
needs 150 tons a day to adequately feed people relief workers say 
the sudan airways pilots are very brave eiffe said they 
fly in despite attacks on them 
thousands of people gather around the sudan airways office in 
juba trying to get tickets out he said they fly out around 80 
to 100 sudanese daily 
eiffe said juba residents fearing new shelling had been crowding 
into his office begging for shovels and picks to dig bunkers in 
which to hide others fled to the deep banks of the nile for 
protection 
some of the western evacuees blamed both the army and the rebels 
for jubas desperation all spoke on condition they not be 
identified by name or organization 
they said the rebels shelled juba indiscriminately with rockets 
that make terrifying noises when they explode and burst into 
hundreds of pieces of maiming shrapnel 
the army in turn has planted land mines as part of a security 
cordon around the city the evacuees said the troops also refuse to 
let residents leave apparently hoping their presence will keep the 
rebels from trying to invade 
one evacuee said many juba residents sympathize with the rebel 
cause but nobody can understand their purpose in shelling the city 
he said residents listen to government and rebel propaganda and 
feel trapped in the middle 
a few weeks ago food was the major concern eiffe said 
now thats changed and its terror from shelling

despite her federal fraud conviction coupon 
connie says her couponclipping was just the zealous performance 
of a housewifes duty but shell never clip again 
you should never use coupons connie santos arvidson said 
tuesday after being convicted in a 2 million counterfeit coupon 
scheme i wont ever again 
the boca raton fla woman could be ordered imprisoned 15 years 
when she is sentenced march 23 for mail fraud and conspiracy 
she insisted during her threeweek us district court trial 
that she didnt know the manufacturers coupons she began buying 
and trading through a magazine advertisement were counterfeit 
codefendant david rees of center point was convicted of 
conspiracy and printer james floyd richards of san antonio was 
cleared of three counts 
the defendants were accused of counterfeiting more than 600000 
copies of coupons issued by 47 companies including procter amp 
gamble nabisco brands inc and campbell soup co 
mrs arvidson who has also been called the dumpster lady 
because she rooted through garbage bins looking for coupons used 
some to buy products and then sold them at flea markets said 
prosecutor steve sucsy her main income came through selling the 
coupons for more than she paid for them he said 
basically its just a story of greed sucsy said in closing 
arguments her statement to the effect she was only doing what 
any number of innocent housewives were doing was not so 
prosecutors said mrs arvidson purchased bogus coupons from san 
antonio counterfeiter david rackmill 
rackmill pleaded guilty to mail fraud and conspiracy and acted 
as an informant as did six others indicted in the case 
mrs arvidson 34 testified that she earned about 30000 in 
1988 in rebates price breaks and free products from manufacturers 
and used the proceeds to buy furniture toys to make a down 
payment on a bmw and pay for cosmetic surgery for herself 
the counterfeit ring was indicted in august after a fourmonth 
investigation by the us postal service

federal reserve board chairman alan 
greenspans good news message a lower risk of recession coupled 
with stable inflation is being interpreted by financial markets 
as bad news for interest rates 
greenspan in testimony tuesday to the congressional joint 
economic committee said the risk of a recession in the next six 
months to a year is lower now than it was last spring inflation 
while still unacceptably high at 45 percent is stable he said 
his seemingly mild comments unsettled stock and bond markets 
where traders interpreted them as a sign the central bank will not 
lower interest rates anytime soon a volatile new york stock 
exchange session ended with the dow jones average of 30 industrials 
down 1014 points 
what hes really saying is if you want to get inflation 
down it may be you have to live with crummy economic growth not 
for a few quarters but for a few years said economist bruce 
steinberg of merrill lynch 
thats a blow to president bushs prospects of trimming the 
federal budget deficit bushs budget released this week relies on 
relatively strong growth to boost government revenue and lower 
interest rates to hold down the cost of carrying the national debt 
earlier this month bush pressed the fed to lower interest rates 
the fed last eased just before christmas when it nudged a key 
bank lending rate down by a quarter of a percentage point it was 
the latest step in an effort begun in june to stimulate the economy 
with lower interest rates 
before that the central bank emphasized fighting inflation over 
battling a recession and pushed rates up 
now signaling an apparent return to a tougher antiinflation 
stance greenspan said 45 percent inflation is unacceptable 
because it is very difficult in that type of environment to 
prevent it from accelerating 
inflation at this stage represents the greatest threat of 
recession that we have because it will bring with it the types of 
imbalances which hold us back he said 
despite some caveats analysts said greenspan was clearly more 
optimistic about growth than he was last july when he told 
congress fed policy had shifted toward avoiding an unnecessary 
and destructive recession 
there was a greater stress on inflation and less worry about 
the possibility of recession than weve heard from the fed in the 
recent past said economist david wyss of drimcgraw hill inc a 
lexington mass forecasting firm 
i dont think it means theyre going to tighten but it does 
mean theyre not going to loosen right now he said 
on other matters greenspan said 
its difficult to say if an increase in inflation 
expectations in the united states was causing japanese investors to 
shy away from purchasing treasury securities sold to finance the 
national debt 
there is probably some element of shift because interest 
rates in japan have risen sharply compared with us rates he said 
the administrations economic forecast of 24 percent growth 
this year and 32 percent growth in 1991 are not by any means 
unreasonable private economists have accused the administration 
of issuing a rosy forecast to make it easier on paper to trim the 
budget deficit 
greenspan cautioned however that the administrations economic 
forecast was conditioned on congress passing the presidents budget 
proposal in total 
comments by white house spokesman marlin fitzwater that lower 
rates are justified were inappropriate such statements from 
the administration are better made in private he said

despite a few complaints about federal 
enforcement a private conservation group says historic provisions 
in 1985 farm law will help farmers move rapidly toward eliminating 
severe soil erosion on much of the nations cropland by the 
mid1990s 
a study of more than 1000 farms in selected areas across the 
nation showed the conservation provisions of the 1985 food security 
act have been a main force in prodding farmers into protecting soil 
and water resources 
the report released in washington tuesday by the soil and water 
conservation society of ankeny iowa focused on the laws 
provisions governing the use of fragile highly erodible land and 
wetland areas 
specific deadlines were set for farmers to comply with 
agriculture department regulations for conservation planning and 
project completion 
the law also established a 10year conservation reserve program 
with a goal of removing 40 million to 45 million acres of highly 
erodible cropland from production by the end of this year about 34 
million acres have been signed 
under the program farmers must plant the idled land in 
protective grass or trees in return they get federal costsharing 
payments to establish the soil cover plus annual rental payments 
for 10 years those average about 50 per acre annually 
for the first time in history receipt of most federal farm 
program benefits commodity price supports agricultural credit 
and crop insurance became legally contingent on the application 
of appropriate land stewardship practices by agricultural 
producers the report said 
the laws four conservation parts outlined the conservation 
reserve program or crp and socalled sodbuster swampbuster and 
compliance provisions that the report said have been generally well 
accepted by farmers 
we may well accomplish a greater measure of erosion control on 
the nations cropland in the next five years than we have 
accomplished in the preceding 50 said project director max 
schnepf 
but this report makes it clear that a great deal remains to be 
done by farmers and by the federal government if we are to realize 
the full potential of the 1985 farm bills conservation 
provisions he said 
schnepf said the project began in mid1988 and the report is the 
first of several planned for a threeyear evaluation 
norman a berg a member of the societys steering committee and 
former head of the soil conservation service in usda said the farm 
law for the first time linked farm policies and program benefits to 
sound conservation practices 
the law provided leverage we did not have before to curb 
erosion and protect wetlands berg said 
society officials said the study which had financial support 
from the joyce foundation of chicago was by no means a 
statistically valid survey of all us land however the project 
did entail a close look at conservation work in 22 representative 
counties 
the report said 
crp field checks show soil erosion will be reduced 91 percent 
on land enrolled in the program although the total tonnage of soil 
saved may be lower than the usda has reported 
sodbuster and swampbuster provisions with the potential loss 
of federal benefits appear to be discouraging farmers from 
improperly cultivating fragile land and converting wetlands to crop 
production however there have been violations and usda 
officials are not adequately monitoring or enforcing the policies 
in some areas 
conservation compliance which requires farmers to adopt and 
carry out conservation plans will result in significant reductions 
in erosion if the plans are implemented but final implementation 
will be difficult for a significant number of farmers unless 
they adopt additional lowcost erosioncontrol practices

an agriculture department survey shows wind 
damage to land in the great plains is down sharply from a year 
agos nearrecord losses that resulted from the 1988 drought 
wilson scaling chief of the departments soil conservation 
service said tuesday 174 million acres were reported damaged in 
november and december down almost 20 percent from 216 million 
acres damaged in the same two months of 1988 
even so the damage in november and december was nearly 60 
percent above the 20year average for those months 
lingering drought and limited snow cover were the major reasons 
for the damage he said weve had several years of drought with 
resulting lack of crop residue and poor vegetative cover 
scaling added 
texas with 576000 acres reported damaged accounted for about 
onethird of the total north dakota was close behind with a state 
record of almost 553000 acres damaged by wind 
november and december are the first two months of an annual 
sevenmonth season when winds are highest and the soils are driest 
in the great plains surveys were made in 541 counties of the 
10state region 
in 198889 143 million acres were damaged by wind in the great 
plains the most since the agency began keeping records in 
195455 damage was reported at nearly 16 million acres 
according to the survey the statebystate breakdown comparing 
damaged acres in november and december with the damage during the 
same two months a year earlier included 
colorado 65041 acres damaged this season and 28795 in

fourteen government programs including 
medicare and the new agency handling the savings and loan bailout 
are high risks for fraud and abuse a congressional report says in 
warning of possible major losses of taxpayers money 
the general accounting office said tuesday that many of the 
problems have persisted for years because there is no way to force 
government agencies to correct them 
gao provided the list to two congressional committees saying it 
decided to identify the government agencies and programs most at 
risk following disclosures last year of widespread management 
problems at the department of housing and urban development the 
chairmen of the panels promised hearings to review the problems 
i have been concerned about the possibility of other hudtype 
problems for some time and unfortunately i am convinced that they 
do indeed exist comptroller general charles a bowsher said in a 
letter accompanying the list 
bowsher warned that unless reforms are implemented major 
losses of federal funds and collateral fraud and abuse incidents 
will continue 
gaos list included 
the resolution trust corp the agency set up by sampl bailout 
legislation to handle the sale of assets of failed thrifts worth 
an estimated 200 billion to 300 billion a sale of this 
magnitude is unprecedented in history bowsher said the desire 
and potential to acquire these assets at bargainbasement prices 
will make this area highly susceptible to fraud waste and abuse 
management of seized and forfeited assets stemming from drug 
and other investigations the gao said the two agencies that handle 
these properties the customs service and marshals service have 
significant internal control weaknesses that invite abuse 
medicare gao said this multibilliondollar program is riddled 
with waste saying 527 million in inappropriate payments in 1985 
alone illustrate the magnitude of potential savings 
defense department inventory management and purchases of major 
new systems gao said at least 30 billion of the 100 billion in 
dod inventory was not needed and the opportunity for fraud was 
plentiful as the department handles more than 900 billion in 
planned purchases following established management controls to 
deliver capable and supportable weapons to the user when and where 
needed and at a reasonable cost has been the exception rather 
than the rule gao said 
among the other areas gao said it singled out for special 
attention were the irs failure to collect more than 60 billion it 
is owed the management of loan and grant programs for students 
farmers and mass transit the reliance of the energy department 
the environmental protection agency and nasa on private 
contractors the state departments overseas construction program 
and government oversight of the 2 trillion private pension system 
the committee chairmen rep john conyers of the house 
government operations and sen john glenn of the senate government 
affairs said they hoped the bush administration would cooperate in 
determining ways to correct the problems 
we simply cant afford to sit around and wring our hands over 
this situation while more taxpayers money is wasted or put at 
risk glenn dohio said in a statement the real question now 
is what is being done to fix these problems 
conyers dmich laid the blame for governmentwide management 
problems on reagan administration deregulation policies 
ten years ago we were told by the incoming reagan 
administration that the answer to so many of our problems was less 
government conyers said today we see that the chickens have 
come home to roost and the legacy of the reagan administrations 
get the government off our backs mentality is mismanagement 
taxpayer ripoffs and outright fraud

defense secretary dick cheney accused of 
putting a political gun to the head of congress with a base 
closing list says hes open to the idea of a blueribbon panel 
studying the controversial issue 
but cheney in an interview tuesday with wire service reporters 
rejected charges from house armed services committee chairman les 
aspin that the list was partisan and would be used to influence 
lawmakers votes on legislation 
the idea that somehow i tried to put a gun to the head of 
congress is not a valid one cheney said arguing it is congress 
job to make the tough choice between their districts desires and 
cutting defense spending 
it seems to me eminently reasonable that if you are going to 
shrink the size of the force have fewer tanks and fewer ships you 
need fewer bases to support them the secretary said 
rep les aspin dwis said there was potential in cheneys 
list of more than 72 domestic facilities and 14 overseas 
installations that could be closed or scaled back 
but he objected to the way the administration wants congress to 
deal with the list and introduced legislation that would create a 
bipartisan commission to make new recommendations 
this is merely a list of candidates for closure aspin told 
reporters at a news conference the upshot is that the list can 
be changed bases can be deleted or perhaps added that creates 
hostages for the administration vote against a veto override your 
base is safe vote to override your base is threatened 
the process is dead aspin said of cheneys approach 
cheney queried about aspins proposed commission said i 
wouldnt rule it out completely but insisted that his approach 
wasnt dead either 
obviously congress is going to take a look at it im 
perfectly happy to talk to les aspin or anybody else cheney said 
aspins suggested panel similar to a commission created by 
congress in 1988 would produce an allornothing list of closings 
for approval or rejection by the defense secretary and congress 
the recommendations of the 1988 panel to close 86 bases were 
adopted by congress last year 
cheney in presenting his 2921 billion military spending plan 
for fiscal 1991 proposed on monday a list of bases for closing or 
realignment that would be considered by lawmakers on an individual 
basis 
this puts a political gun to the head of a member with a base 
in his or her district aspin said 
the lawmaker contended the process opens an enormous 
bargaining bazaar and creates a lot of bargaining chips for the 
administration when time comes to influence votes 
aspin charged that of the 32 bases hed looked at 22 were in 
democratic districts making the list clearly partisan 
rep patricia schroeder dcolo a senior member of the house 
armed services committee said cheney has produced an unbalanced 
partisan hit list that is unacceptable 
however house speaker thomas s foley dwash declined to 
accuse the bush administration of playing politics saying with a 
grin ive heard some republicans are very angry with the 
selections 
cheney argued there may be more bases targeted in democratic 
districts because there are more democrats in congress and because 
a large number of military installations are in 
democraticcontrolled states 
california gets about a third of the defense budget texas 
has a large number of bases its really not political he said 
thats a petty kind of game that i dont think serves 
anybodys interest i didnt sign on as secretary of defense to get 
democrats if id wanted to do that id have stayed in the house

sen jesse helms says he is going to work to 
slow down senate ratification of a united nations convention 
banning torture because he wants the bush administration to provide 
more information about it 
there are scores of questions we need to analyze said the 
north carolina senator the ranking republican on the foreign 
relations committee this is such a complicated subject i hope we 
dont just move it along 
helms also said he was upset that only four senators himself 
committee chairman claiborne pell dri larry pressler rsd 
and frank murkowski ralaska showed up for a hearing on the 
subject tuesday 
officials of the bush administration joined human rights 
activists in telling the panel they want the senate to vote by a 
twothirds majority to ratify the convention 
early ratification of the convention by the united states will 
clearly affirm our known abhorrence and condemnation or torture 
abraham sofaer the state departments legal adviser said 
the administration has said there is an urgent need for 
senate approval of the measure to send a signal to other countries 
around the world that torture will not be tolerated 
sofaer said the convention will have little effect on the united 
states where laws are clear but it will give the administration a 
voice in working against torture 
nevertheless the administration wants to attach a few 
reservations to the documents to ensure no conflict on 
technicalities of us law 
generally the convention requires parties to prevent torture 
within their territories to make all acts of torture a political 
offense and to bring those accused of torture to justice 
human rights activists are enthusiastic about the measure 
appropriate ratification will contribute significantly to 
the enforcement of the international prohibition against torture in 
practice said winston p nagan chairman of amnesty 
international 
among the groups supporting the convention are the us catholic 
conference bnai brith international and the american bar 
association 
although nobody favors torture helms said he was disturbed 
that countries such as afghanistan bulgaria china and the soviet 
union which helms says have promoted serious human rights 
violations have also ratified the convention 
he asked if parties to the convention had condemned china for 
the massacre of students last summer in beijing i guess running 
over people with tanks is not torture helms said 
fiftyfive nations have ratified the convention including 
libya a nation the united states has accused of promoting 
terrorism twentytwo nations have signed the treaty indicating 
they intend to ratify it 
the torture convention came into force on june 26 1987 under 
the convention a committee of 10 experts was established with 
power to investigate allegations of torture and receive reports

american officials and lawmakers just back 
from the philippines are offering a mixed assessment of president 
corazon aquinos chances for political survival after the aborted 
coup last december 
the political situation remains unsettled and many wonder 
whether the government can recover from the blow sufficiently to 
restore popular confidence and make lasting strides toward 
stability said deputy assistant secretary of defense carl w 
ford 
we are hopeful that the near loss of hardwon democracy will 
energize the philippine public and private sectors to work even 
more closely and effectively he told the house foreign affairs 
subcommittee on asia and the pacific on tuesday 
deputy assistant secretary of state david lambertson said he 
came back from manila impressed again with the determination and 
resilience of the government and its people 
but the danger of another coup attempt exists he said 
he said aquino must regain confidence by eradicating corruption 
and improving inefficient government services to avert another coup 
attempt 
corruption remains a real problem in the philippines and its 
corrosive effects hamper government operations he said 
president aquino is fully aware of the problem and has made 
efforts to deal with it both by example and by exhorting her 
people 
a member of the subcommittee rep jim leach riowa said 
congress would be unwilling to pay the price demanded by the 
philippines for extending the rights to the clark air force and 
subic bay naval bases once the leases expire next year 
leach and the officials suggested a growing wave of filipino 
nationalism coupled with a decline of the soviet military threat 
and the tight us budget raises doubts about the survival of the 
bases 
the bases are very important but its conceivable there are 
alternatives leach said 
there are alternatives ford responded but they are much 
more expensive ford said the united states believes it can 
overcome the surge of new nationalism in the philippines and reach 
a new base agreement 
lambertson said negotiations would begin within several months 
initially between us ambassador nicholas platt and filipino 
foreign secretary raul manglapus a special negotiator will be 
appointed for more detailed work later he said 
the administration witnesses also said the aquino government is 
becoming the third large recipient of us foreign aid in the world 
after israel and egypt 
for the fiscal year which began oct 1 the administration asked

the bush administration should reevaluate its 
military strategy and reduce us forces in europe by almost 
200000 in light of the push for freedom in the eastern bloc says 
a former defense secretary 
james r schlesinger a past hardliner against cuts in nato 
forces told the senate armed services committee failure to respond 
to the changes with troop cuts would ultimately be 
selfdefeating 
we should plan now radically to scale back our forces in 
europe the time for that planning is now implementation may 
extend over months or years as circumstances warrant but the 
reduction should not be precluded by the ongoing negotiations in 
vienna schlesinger told the panel 
under questioning from the committee schlesinger said the 
united states should keep between 75000 to 100000 troops in 
europe down from the current american level of about 305000 
last may prior to the fullfledged drive toward democracy in 
many of the warsaw pact nations president bush proposed a ceiling 
of 275000 on us and soviet ground and air force personnel which 
would require a reduction of about 30000 us troops and about 
325000 soviet troops 
but schlesinger said if the united states sticks to its current 
position on reductions in negotiations in vienna it may fall into 
the trap of legitimatizing the longterm presence of soviet 
forces in eastern europe which might otherwise be withdrawn 
it would be far worse if the nations of eastern europe were 
to hold the united states or nato responsible for the continued 
presence in their countries of soviet forces schlesinger added 
the senate armed services committee is holding a series of 
hearings on now the united states should respond to the lessening 
soviet threat and its effects on the military budget 
sen sam nunn dga chairman of the panel agreed with much of 
what schlesinger said in his testimony 
the question of when we make these changes is an important one 
but it seems to me that you make a case of great persuasion that 
planning for these changes need to start now nunn said and if 
we do not start the planning now then were not going to make 
rationale decisions on todays budget 
nunn said he had spoken to defense secretary dick cheney and 
stressed it will be important that cheney spell out his vision for 
defense over the next five years 
where is this budget leading us said nunn i hope were 
not going to simply have a fiscal approach here its got to be a 
reassessment of the threat and reassessment of americas response 
to it

some 1800 usair workers who have been 
represented by the teamsters are no longer members of the union 
after a vote by other workers for the airline 
the teamsters lost an organizing drive to represent 8000 
employees who load the airplanes for usair company and aflcio 
representatives said tuesday 
the election was an allornothing event for the teamsters who 
already represented usair workers in pittsburgh philadelphia 
buffalo and boston the unions defeat means those workers no 
longer are members 
it was the teamsters third election at usair since 1981 and the 
largest representation election in the private sector in four 
years the union won the first two contests at usair 
rex hardesty a spokesman for the aflcio said the two weeks 
between the call for the election and the mailing of the ballots 
did not give the teamsters adequate time to campaign 
i have every indication from the teamsters that they will be 
back and that they felt they were hurt in this campaign by the fast 
election and all the insecurity felt these days in the 
transportation industry hardesty said theres fear and 
concern among all workers and it makes them less willing to 
organize 
david shipley spokesman for the arlington vabased usair 
said the teamsters needed 4002 votes to win the election but only 
slightly more than half that voted for the union he said he did 
not have precise figures 
we felt that this particular group did not need representation 
by the teamsters obviously the employees agreed with us 
shipley said 
shipley said the ballots were mailed dec 15 to employees 
nationwide who work in 180 airports fleet service workers handle 
baggage cargo and load food onto airplanes 
the ballots were counted on tuesday 
a call to the home of a teamsters spokesman was unanswered 
the teamsters represented cargo workers at usair before its 1989 
merger with piedmont airlines whose employees were not members of 
the union 
on dec 1 the national mediation board ordered the election to 
determine whether workers at usair and former piedmont employees 
would be represented by the teamsters three other unions 
representing pilots flight attendants and mechanics at usair 
gained the right to represent the piedmont workers without 
elections

the department of transportation is seeking to 
require new school buses to display a regulation stop sign every 
time the bus door opens to permit children to enter or depart 
the departments national highway traffic safety administration 
also proposes to improve crossview mirrors on school buses to 
provide drivers better visibility in front and along the sides of 
the vehicle 
both proposals are subject to regulatory action 
jerry ralph curry the agencys administrator said tuesday that 
35 to 40 school children are killed each year in accidents related 
to school buses 
curry said stop signals and improved mirrors could help prevent 
many of those accidents when coupled with increased training for 
drivers of the buses 
more than 30 states now require a stop signal attached to school 
bus doors the safety administrations proposal would standardize 
the equipment and apply in all states 
it would consist of a stopsignal arm which would swing out from 
the left side of the bus to display the standard redandwhite stop 
sign

supreme court justice antoni scalia has 
refused to bar the television program inside edition from 
broadcasting scenes filmed with a hidden camera inside a new york 
city doctors office 
he rejected without comment tuesday an emergency request in 
which dr stuart m bergers lawyers sought to block the broadcast 
an inside edition spokeswoman said the program plans to 
include the scenes in a segment about berger 
a federal judge in detroit ordered the program to keep the 
secretly recorded scenes off the air but a federal appeals court 
panel overturned the judges order as an unconstitutional prior 
restraint of free speech 
berger author of several widely sold diet books is under 
investigation by the new york state department of healths office 
of professional medical conduct for alleged unethical and 
fraudulent conduct 
in its own investigation of berger the television program sent 
one of its producers to the doctors office as a patient producer 
amy wasserstrom said in an affidavit she surreptitiously videotaped 
two visits she made to the office 
ms wasserstrom said berger diagnosed her as suffering from an 
allergy to yeast and from chronic fatigue but another doctor told 
her she had no such ailments 
bergers lawyers said airing the office scenes will do 
irreparable harm to his reputation and the sanctity of his 
office

at fire houses police stations schools and 
hospitals long island residents still reeling from the avianca 
jetliner crash that killed 73 people and injured 86 are beginning 
to help the helpers 
even as the dead are buried the injured treated and the 
survivors consoled some mental health and social workers are 
turning their attention to the people who rushed to the crash scene 
thursday night and found a nightmare of death injury and 
mutilation 
in most cases experts say they need nothing more and nothing 
less than talk 
after the crash theres an emotional aftershock said joan 
imhof director of the nassau county office of volunteer services 
you need to talk about the experience what you remember how you 
felt about it any symptoms you might be experiencing 
you have to come to grips with the fact that you and your body 
have suffered a traumatic experience 
the clinical term is posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms 
can include fatigue nausea muscle tremors appetite loss 
appetite gain poor concentration flashbacks anxiety and 
depression 
ms imhof lives near the crash site at cove neck on the northern 
shore of long island and worked there throughout the night 
as rescue workers carried children away from the wreckage we 
felt awful that we couldnt find their parents and reunite them 
then she recalled but there were so many serious injuries we 
just had to ship them out to hospitals 
asked about efforts to comfort the rescuers she spoke about her 
own memories of the night in great detail 
asked if she too needed to talk about her experiences in order 
to deal with them she replied you got it 
the boeing 707 en route from colombia ran out of fuel and 
crashed on a wooded hillside thursday night 15 miles northeast of 
its destination kennedy international airport 
helpers at the crash site were not the only ones in need 
spanishspeaking staffers at the states pilgrim psychiatric center 
in brentwood worked for days with crash survivors and the families 
of passengers at several hospitals 
emotionally im still in shock said sonia 
palaciogrottola a social worker it really hasnt sunk in yet 
were still emotionally charged and we need to have some peer 
counseling to come down from this ordeal 
in addition to debriefing sessions offered by fire police 
and rescue departments for their own workers several hospitals and 
agencies are reaching out to the public 
north shore university hospital in manhasset for example is 
offering free group or individual counseling 
dr victor fornaci a staff psychiatrist said it was too early 
to say how many people would need help because it can take weeks or 
months for symptoms to develop 
in addition the county mental health department offered 
counseling for area residents at oyster bay high school at local 
schools teachers and students were discussing the crash and the 
american red cross planned to set up counseling sessions for rescue 
workers later this week 
when were finished well do some counseling but there are 
still dozens of family members that need our help said peter von 
berg of the red cross right now were still on adrenaline 
we need to get our feelings out he said i went home 
sunday night and cried for an hour 
for some the reality of thursday night already had sunk in 
we keep reliving what we did and saw oyster bay fire chief 
tom reardon said after a sunday church service that focused on the 
crash what i saw that night was carnage and we just tried to do 
the best we could to help those people now were trying to get 
everything back to normal

scientists say they are 
delighted with the condition of a rescued science satellite 
because the wear and tear it received during six years in space was 
just what they wanted 
thats why we sent it up there to find out what happens to 
materials after a long time in the space environment william h 
kinard project chief said tuesday after getting his first look at 
the satellite since its return 
wearing contaminationproof clothing and standing on an 
observation platform several feet away kinard and other scientists 
watched as the shuttle columbias 60footlong cargo bay doors 
swung open to reveal the 11ton satellite known as the long 
duration exposure facility 
columbias astronauts retrieved the laboratory 200 miles in 
space on jan 12 snaring it just weeks before it probably would 
have been dragged by gravity to a fiery death in the atmosphere 
the satellite eventually will be moved to a nearby sterilized 
building for close examination 
at the johnson space center in houston the commander of the 
shuttle mission said the damage to the experiments aboard the 
laboratory will provide clues to what materials best withstand the 
harsh environment of space 
i think it does certainly bring home the point that we have to 
take a good look at anything we do over a long duration in space 
commander dan brandenstein told reporters tuesday 
kinard said the laboratory appeared to have suffered a little 
more wear and tear than the pictures taken by the astronauts in 
space indicated 
it looked a little more weathered than we concluded earlier 
he said there are lots of small micrometeoroid craters and there 
are some other places where there are reactions that may have been 
started my micrometeoroids 
he said there was some discoloration and that foil covering some 
experiments had been torn 
were delighted with the condition kinard said 
there are 57 experiments attached to the satellites exterior 
and scientists and engineers are eager to see how the various 
materials in them fared during their long exposure to atomic 
oxygen radiation micrometeoroids and other phenomena in space 
the results will help in designing future longduration 
spacecraft including the freedom manned space station to be 
assembled in orbit starting in 1995 
four teams will study the recovered laboratory here for about 
three weeks photographing it and jotting down their observations 
the teams are composed of specialists in space debris materials 
spacecraft systems and radiation 
starting in midfebruary the experiments will be covered with 
protective aluminum and removed onebyone from the satellites 
racks they then will be delivered to scientists throughout the 
nation and western europe for detailed study 
the satellite carries 21 materials coating and thermal systems 
experiments five power and propulsion experiments 17 science 
experiments and 14 optics and electronic experiments they 
represent more than 200 investigators 33 private companies 21 
universities seven national aeronautics and space administration 
centers and eight foreign countries 
also aboard are 125 million tomato seeds a few will be planted 
in research labs but most will be sent to schools where students 
from fifth grade through university level will plant water and 
nurture the seeds for research into such things as germination 
rates chromosome and genetics studies and full tomato growth 
kinard said the seeds will be among the first experiments 
removed so that the students have time to work with them before 
the school year ends

diary entries by former president reagan 
contain information of significance for john poindexters 
irancontra trial a federal judge says in ordering the excerpts 
turned over to the defense 
us district court judge harold greene on tuesday ordered the 
former president to provide diary excerpts from more than 29 
different dates by next monday but said he will conduct a lengthy 
review process if reagan invokes executive privilege 
such a step could delay the scheduled feb 20 start of the 
trial which already has been moved back a month due partly to 
poindexters efforts to subpoena documents and testimony from 
reagan 
reagan in las vegas for a speech tuesday night told reporters 
he would not comment on the judges order 
greene has not decided whether to approve a request by 
poindexter the former national security adviser to subpoena 
reagan as a witness the former president is resisting such a 
subpoena 
poindexter is charged with conspiracy two counts of obstructing 
congress and two counts of making false statements in connection 
with aide oliver norths assistance to the contras and a november 
1985 shipment of hawk missiles to iran 
if reagan invokes executive privilege greene said he would 
revisit the issue of whether the diaries are material to 
poindexters defense greene noted a similar procedure was followed 
during the watergate scandal when the special prosecutor sought 
access to white house tapes in the case against several of 
president nixons aides 
greene then would provide the former president and the justice 
department with a secret document poindexter submitted to the court 
outlining why he needs the diaries 
after court filings by all sides the court will make a final 
decision with respect to enforcement of the subpoena for the 
diaries greene said 
greene said the vast majority of more than 100 diary entries 
turned over to the court for review last week contain no 
information that is material to the poindexter case but entries 
covering more than 29 dates in 1985 and 1986 do contain 
information of significance 
reagan was ordered to give poindexter a diary entry relating to 
a successful trip poindexter took in december 1985 to central 
america 
the entry includes a somewhat ambiguous comment arguably 
indicating that the former president knew of poindexters 
activities on behalf of the contras greene said 
the judge said poindexter is entitled to diary entries in which 
reagan describes an effort to persuade the government of honduras 
to release a seized arms shipment that had been destined for the 
contras 
greene also said poindexter must receive diary entries focusing 
on us militarytype assistance to an unidentified central 
american country that may have been used in support of the contras 
the entries may show what types of aid president reagan 
thought could legally be provided for the military or paramilitary 
operations of the contras greene said 
poindexter also is entitled to reagans diary entries concerning 
meetings with poindexter and others in december 1985 to discuss 
the sales of arms to iran green said adding that one entry 
addresses briefly the issue of the proceeds from these sales 
greene said none of the diary entries shed any light on the 
question of what president reagan may have known about the 
diversion of proceeds to the contras from the administrations 
secret sale of arms to iran 
reagan has denied knowing about the diversion and poindexter 
testified before congress that he didnt tell the president 
poindexter contends reagan knew of and approved activities 
undertaken in the iran and contra initiatives and that therefore 
poindexter had no reason to conceal these activities from congress 
as charged in the indictment

the bush adminstrations refusal to deal with libya 
is complicating an international campaign to rid africa of a deadly 
pest that threatens livestock wildlife and even humans 
the parasitic screwworm fly is proving to be a political 
insect said a source at the un food and agriculture 
organization the united states has the expertise and libya has 
the pest 
so far washington has agreed to allow critically needed us 
technology to be used in libya to combat the insect but us 
sanctions against libya mean the technology cant be quickly 
authorized and crucial months have passed 
also the united states has refused a request by the un 
organization to allow americans with vitally needed experience go 
to libya to help eradicate the insect 
we would have been able to have the fullscale eradication 
campaign under way if it werent for the obstacles from the us 
side said the fao source who spoke on condition of anonymity 
the screwworm fly lodges in wounds or tick bites and can kill 
its hosts including humans by eating away at tissues in addition 
to livestock wildlife such as zebras and antelopes as well as some 
endangered species are threatened 
a small but undetermined number of people in libya have been 
infested with the parasite 
time is crucial to containing the fly which until its 
appearance in libya had not been seen outside the western 
hemisphere 
earlier this month president bush renewed sanctions against 
libya the ban on us travel to libya and economic dealings dates 
back to the administration of ronald reagan who accused libyan 
leader col moammar gadhafi of sponsoring international terrorism 
a us official who declined to be identified said the united 
states agreed to help with the screwworm fly after we received 
assurances no resources would be given directly to the government 
of gadhafi 
the united states is cooperating because the insects threat 
goes beyond libya 
experts say the infestation could suddenly spread to libyas 
neighbors especially tunisia and egypt then move down the nile 
river valley into central africa southern europe also is 
considered vulnerable 
if the pest moves beyond libya said un official bjorn 
sigurbjornsson we may not be able to eradicate the fly from 
africa at all 
the us technology consists of a special way of irradiating 
flies to make them sterile under the strategy tens of millions of 
flies would be sterilized at a specially outfitted usmexican 
laboratory in mexico and released in libya matings would 
eventually cause the insect to die out 
the united states became the unquestioned expert on screwworm 
flies after years of devastating infestation in the us southwest 
in 1982 the insect was declared wiped out in the united states 
thanks mainly to two relatively cold winters the warmthloving 
fly has been contained to a swath across northern libya east and 
west of tripoli said edgar yates a technical expert at the 
international fund for agricultural development another romebased 
international agency 
yates said the screwworm fly probably came to libya through an 
infected animal from latin america where the pest is still a 
problem 
faos request to the united states was made last may about a 
year after the fly was confirmed in libya the fao source said 
in january us secretary of agriculture clayton yeutter asked 
the senate to amend a treaty which the united states signed with 
mexico that currently allows the sterilization flies to be 
dispersed only in the americas 
approval is expected in march said paula henstridge of the 
deparments legislative department 
the earliest the flies could be released would be early autumn 
yates said so far the united states has been unbending on letting 
american technicians go to libya as far as were concerned the 
mexican expertise is sufficient said elizabeth bonkowsky of the 
us state department 
sigurbjornsson disagrees saying us technicians will be 
essential when the fullscale fly release scheduled to last up to 
two years is under way 
the us government has cooperated in other ways larval samples 
have been analyzed in a north dakota facility and ms bonkowsky 
said a libyan was granted a visa to work with us experts there 
there are also problems between the fao and the united states 
the united states has refused to pay its full assessment which 
accounts for onequarter of the agencys budget 
the dispute goes back to 1985 when reagan accused the 
organization of being biased against the united states and of 
inefficient administration

city officials are hoping that a good 
tree trimming will do what inflatable snakes poison corn 
christmas lights and a sticky limb coating couldnt keep pesky 
birds out of the pear trees 
stillwaters concern about the trees runs deep 
city manager carl weinaug said the community has spent thousands 
of dollars during the past four years to make the birds feel 
unwelcome 
the city commission approved the pruning in hopes of reducing 
the roosts and rousting the flocks of grackles english sparrows 
and other birds that seek refuge in the 47 pear trees 
winfrey houston of a downtown merchants group proposed the trees 
be trimmed significantly to make them unattractive to the pear 
pests 
although the trees may be unattractive to people for a short 
time he said that was a better alternative than to get rid of the 
trees 
the trees height will be slashed nearly in half to about 12 
feet 
the board also voted to place netting on some of the trees and 
to test dwarf pear trees

some restaurants in northwest montana no 
longer automatically plop a slice of tomato onto their burgers 
the reason the tomatoes cost more than the hamburger 
tim dutter manager of the kalispell dairy queen says he now 
pays 149 a pound for hamburger and 2 a pound for tomatoes 
dairy queen has not changed its policy on tomatoes however 
because customers have routinely paid a nickel extra for a slice of 
tomato 
we dont raise the price of the hamburger to cover the cost of 
the tomato he explained just the same dutter said were 
taking somewhat of a loss on tomatoes at the moment 
at wendys in kalispell tomatoes have become a request item 
only according to assistant manager virginia neuhausen 
with large tomatoes costing 62 cents apiece compared with 10 
or 11 cents normally nobody gets one without asking the policy 
has prompted no complaints neuhausen said 
the price rise was triggered by an unusual freeze in the south 
earlier this winter according to ron vivit produce manager at 
rosauers supermarket in kalispell 
in area food stores tomatoes are selling at 239259 a pound 
but theyre not selling quickly

a woman believed to be the nations oldest flight 
attendant has retired at age 70 after logging nearly 4 years in 
the air during a career that began in 1948 
i had to have a goal for something and i figured it might as 
well be old connie walker said tuesday after she stepped off a 
northwest airlines flight from seoul 
with a sparkle in her eye that might have been a tear she said 
her feelings were torn 
the body is ready to quit and the heart wants to keep going 
she said 
walker her union and company representatives said that as far 
as they were aware she was the nations oldest flight attendant 
about three dozen friends and coworkers greeted walker at 
seattletacoma international airport with flowers balloons hugs 
and a chorus of for shes a good lady 
among the wellwishers was denise flanagan who walker helped 
deliver on a flight to anchorage 36 years ago northwest flew 
flanagan from her home in ludlow mass and her mother lorraine 
magenau from akron ohio to help walker celebrate her retirement 
they have remained in touch and walker who never married calls 
flanagan her daughter 
were unofficial family love not blood flanagan said 
magenau said it may have been anxiety that brought on the labor 
during the flight when walker came to help magenau remembers her 
saying i dont know anything about babies but ill do what i 
can 
walker started at age 28 in 1948 flying between portland ore 
and billings mont she has spent nearly 4 years of her life in

portable computer owners will be able to tap 
into central computers from almost anywhere without using 
telephone lines through a nationwide radio network being developed 
by ibm and motorola inc 
were giving the mobile worker access to data hes never had 
before said jack blumenstein an international business machine 
corp executive who was named president of the joint venture 
called ardis 
motorola had offered a similar service to clients in new york 
chicago and los angeles and had designed a nationwide inhouse 
system for ibm service technicians the companies said tuesday they 
decided to combine the networks to get a payback from hundreds of 
millions of invested dollars 
for motorola it provides a national radio network to market to 
new clients ardis officials said sears roebuck and co and new 
york life insurance co are among major companies testing the 
system 
potential users include field service personnel such as 
equipment maintenance technicians real estate brokers 
packagedelivery workers police officers and insurance agents 
by using a handheld terminal hooked to the radio network a 
mobile home appliance repairman could be told by his headquarters 
what service calls to make and in turn could check on the 
availability of parts from his companys warehouse 
the service which will be available in april would appear to 
be in competition with cellular telephones by using cellular 
phones and a modem a portable computer can be hooked up to a 
mainframe computer 
but ibm and motorola say their system is more useful because it 
is on line all the time theres no need to dial up a computer in 
addition they say it provides the ability to store and recall 
messages that are sent to the terminal when the user is not 
monitoring it cellular phones have difficulty penetrating 
buildings made of certain materials but the computer system would 
have no such problems the companies said

doctors at a london hospital say they have carried 
out what they believe is the first successful fetal heart surgery 
dr lindsey allan of the fetal cardiology unit at guys hospital 
said tuesday that doctors had corrected a heart valve defect in an 
unborn boy using a balloon catheter 
as far as i know this is the first successful operation of its 
kind she said 
two operations were carried out on the fetus during the mothers 
pregnancy in december one at 31 weeks and the second at 33 weeks 
she said she did not say why there had been a delay in disclosing 
the details 
allan said the baby was born prematurely on jan 4 one week 
after the second operation and underwent surgery for the third 
time a few hours after birth 
the child is still quite seriously ill but we have given him 
a chance he would not otherwise have had allan said she said 
the parents who do not want to be identified live outside london 
most fetuses with the rare defect called critical aortic 
stenosis die in the womb and few who are born survive for more 
than 24 hours she said the defect blocks the aortic valve making 
it unable to pump blood at the right pressure leading to heart 
failure 
the operations involved inserting a catheter down a hollow 
needle directly into the chest wall and heart of the fetus once in 
place the balloon was dilated to open the heart valve the doctors 
said 
a catheter is a slender flexible tube inserted into a body 
passage vessel or cavity its normal uses include passing fluids 
and making examinations 
allan said the team that pioneered the technique included 
herself michael tynan professor of pediatric cardiology and 
darryl maxwell director of the hospitals fetal medicine unit 
she said there were always ethical obstacles to this type of 
operation 
i am not sure that we should be meddling sometimes there is 
always discussion as to whether it is a reasonable request to make 
of the mother on the other hand one knows that the alternative is 
almost universally fatal she said 
in the operation a hollow needle measuring 004 of an inch in 
diameter and about 10 inches long was inserted through the mothers 
abdomen and uterine wall directly into the chest and heart of the 
fetus 
using a high resolution ultrasonic scanner maxwell guided the 
needle into the heart through the left ventricle 
the catheter was then passed down the needle attached to it was 
the deflated balloon and a piece of platinum wire 
the pumping action of the heart took the wire and the balloon 
directly across the aortic valve the balloon was then inflated by 
pumping saline solution down the tube when inflated the balloon 
tore and split the valve to improve the blood flow 
the dec 18 attempt failed because of difficulty in positioning 
the device across the aortic valve the balloon burst when inflated 
and snapped off the catheter while being removed 
the remains of the dec 18 balloon are still in the babys 
heart maxwell said he said an operation to remove it was too 
risky leaving it there does not seem to have caused any 
problems he said 
the dec 28 operation went more smoothly because less fluid was 
pumped into the balloon maxwell said the needle was in the heart 
for about 30 minutes during the twohour procedure 
the mother who also has two daughters was awake during the 
operations the doctors said only local anaesthetic was 
administered to her abdominal wall to ensure the fetus was awake 
and in the right position 
the mother was allowed to go home after the dec 28 operation 
and a week later she went into premature labor her son was born 
six weeks early by normal delivery and within hours was taken to 
guys where the third operation was performed to make sure the 
valve had been properly opened 
guys hospital is part of britains staterun national health 
service

county supervisors voted to ask the state 
attorney generals office to review the mcmartin preschool 
molestation trial as prosecutors considered refiling charges 
against raymond buckey 
buckey 31 and his 63yearold mother peggy mcmartin buckey 
were acquitted jan 18 of 52 child molestation counts at the 
nowdefunct mcmartin preschool in suburban manhattan beach 
a mistrial was declared on 13 other counts against buckey when 
jurors could not reach a verdict 
prosecutors were expected to announce today whether they would 
refile those charges 
parents of children involved in the nations longest and 
costliest criminal proceeding cheered a vote tuesday by los angeles 
county supervisors to ask the state attorney generals office to 
review the 6yearold case 
state officials were asked to review trial transcripts and 
comments some jurors reportedly made afterward that they felt 
molestations might have occurred but that the prosecution failed to 
prove its case against the defendants 
the countys call for a state investigation would be dropped if 
the charges were refiled said supervisor michael antonovich 
author of the motion 
at a news conference tuesday victims rights activists called 
for a new trial 
child sexual abuse is no longer taboo in this country but an 
epidemic and its an epidemic we do have a cure for said lynne 
lamb bryant of the group victims of incest can emerge survivors in 
action 
doreen kinney of families of crimes of silence said her group 
had received 6000 letters demanding that buckey be retried 
we believe those people are trying to tell us that no one 
has a right to hurt the children she said 
douglas wolf of the adam walsh child resource center said his 
group supports a bill that will be introduced in the legislature 
that would lift the statute of limitations on prosecuting child 
molesters he declined to discuss the bill in detail or name its

chinese authorities have recently allowed a 
large number of imprisoned prodemocracy activists to receive 
visits from their relatives a probeijing newspaper reported today 
wang dan the movements top student leader and liu xiaobo a 
teacher and one of the last hunger strikers were among those 
visited according to the chineselanguage wen wei po 
the paper quoted unidentified sources as saying both wang and 
liu were in relatively good health and spirits liu has been 
incarcerated since june 
on june 4 liu and three other hunger strikers led several 
thousand students from tiananmen square after soldiers killed 
hundreds perhaps thousands of prodemocracy protesters in other 
parts of beijing 
wang a history student at beijing university went into hiding 
after the protests but was arrested apparently during the summer 
when a reporter from taiwan unwittingly led police to him 
the paper said the visits which began shortly before saturday 
the chinese new year were the most allowed since the june 4 
crackdown on the prodemocracy movement 
the procommunist paper said the decision to allow the visits 
was made in tandem with the ending of martial law in beijing it 
said both moves indicate that chinas political situation is 
daily becoming more stable 
china said recently it had freed 573 people arrested for taking 
part in the crushed prodemocracy movement but thousands more 
reportedly remain jailed in beijing alone 
the article did not say how many of these people were granted 
the right to see their family saying only that people identified 
as intellectuals and academics were allowed visits

a banker charged with hiding illegal drug 
profits in a 32 million moneylaundering case says he was tricked 
by federal agents and now faces guilt by association to his former 
customer manuel noriega 
amjad awan who once claimed to control noriegas secret 
accounts is charged along with four other officers of the bank of 
credit and commerce international and a colombian with laundering 
cash they knew to be drug proceeds 
in opening arguments tuesday prosecutors wove an account of how 
undercover agents infiltrated a colombian drug lords operation 
picked up cocaine profits from us middlemen and went to the 
bankers to help hide the source of the cash 
its easy after the fact to look back and secondguess 
countered awans attorney john p hume but its standard 
practice bankers never ask where the money comes from it 
embarrasses customers and drives people away 
hume said robert musella who was actually a customs agent 
posing as a highstakes launderer never had a deal with the 
bankers to launder drug cash 
he never said he was engaged in criminal conduct he never 
gave awan an opportunity to get in or to get out hume said 
although awan testified before a us senate panel in 1988 that 
he once handled 23 million in noriegas accounts the defense 
attorney also warned the government to keep the deposed panamanian 
leader out of the case 
this is guilt by association by focusing in on panama and 
general noriega theyre causing you not to focus in on the 
problems of the transactions hume told jurors 
the other defendants are colombian rudolf armbrect of medellin 
syed aftab hussain who was operations officer of the 
luxembourgbased bank in panama akbar a bilgrami of miami a 
director of the latin american division sibte hassan who was an 
officer with the paris branch and ian howard french country 
manager based in paris 
they are accused of conspiracy to traffic in drugs conspiracy 
to launder drug profits and money laundering 
prosecutors said the bankers proposed a scheme in which millions 
in drug profits were converted into certificates of deposit at the 
banks panama city branch and then used as collateral for loans 
that gave drug barons a source of cash 
undercover agents recorded 148 meetings and more than 2000 
telephone calls that prosecutors said will show the defendants were 
aware they were handling drug money 
it was a policy of the bank to take in as many deposits as you 
can as fast as you can and dont be too careful about where it 
comes from assistant us attorney michael rubenstein said 
my clients are the biggest drug dealers in colombia the 
prosecutor quoted the undercover agent as telling awan 
its not any business of mine who the customers are awan 
replied according to rubinstein 
rubenstein said the bankers were motivated by ambition 
their career goals he said were more important than the 
laws of any country 
before the start of jury selection two weeks ago two divisions 
of the luxembourg bank one of the worlds largest private 
financial institutions pleaded guilty to moneylaundering charges 
as part of a plea bargain the bank agreed to forfeit a record 
14 million in assets frozen earlier by the government and to 
cooperate against other defendants

woody allen rob reiner phil 
alden robinson oliver stone and peter weir are the directors guild 
of americas nominees for 1989 directorial achievement 
allen was nominated for crimes and misdemeanors reiner for 
when harry met sally robinson for field of dreams 
stone for born of the fourth of july and weir for dead poets 
society 
im just stunned said robinson a firsttime nominee i 
didnt think i stood a chance 
i think we have some interesting choices this year 
commented barry levinson last years winner for rain man as 
he announced the nominees tuesday 
reiner robinson and weir were somewhat surprising choices 
since several critics have overlooked their achievements in favor 
of such films as paul mazurskys enemies a love story edward 
zwicks glory bruce beresfords driving miss daisy and 
spike lees do the right thing 
said robinson bruce beresford deserved a nomination im 
surprised ed zwick didnt get a nomination and a lot of people 
were pulling for paul mazursky 
crimes and misdemeanors is an alternately funny and haunting 
story of infidelity starring allen alan alda and anjelica huston 
when harry met sally is perhaps the lightest movie in 
competition a romantic comedy with billy crystal and meg ryan as 
best friends who become lovers 
field of dreams set in an iowa corn field features kevin 
costner as a baseball fan who recaptures the past by building a 
ballpark on his farm born on the fourth of july is stones 
account of the life of ron kovic played by tom cruise a 
patriotic soldier whose life is shattered in vietnam 
dead poets society casts robin williams as an unconventional 
teacher working within the confines of a conventional boys boarding 
school 
the guild says its awards have deviated from the academy awards 
only three times since 1949 
three years ago steven spielberg won the dga award for the 
color purple but academy of motion picture arts and sciences 
members didnt nominate him for an oscar the directing oscar that 
year went to sydney pollack for out of africa 
some observers believe the guilds 9000 members all of whom 
have a vote represent a more divergent electorate than the academy 
four of the 1989 nominees have been up for the dga award before 
allen was nominated for annie hall 1977 manhattan 1979 
and hannah and her sisters 1986 reiner for stand by me 
1986 stone for platoon he won in 1986 and weir for 
witness 1985 
the awards will be presented at the dgas 42nd annual dinner to 
be held simultaneously in new york and los angeles on march 10

some potential jurors in the criminal 
trial of former exxon valdez skipper joseph hazelwood say they 
already have made up their minds or could lose their jobs if picked 
for the jury 
the exxon valdez rammed a charted reef march 24 and dumped more 
than 10 million gallons of crude into prince william sound in the 
nations worst oil spill 
ten of the 91member jury pool were questioned tuesday four 
were excused 
two people said they might lose their jobs if forced to serve on 
a trial expected to run six to eight weeks the other two said they 
had made up their minds about who was responsible for the spill 
this would be a tough one for me one of the prospective 
jurors a heavy equipment operator told the court a lot of 
damage has been done 
another who said he had caused a 10000gallon spill himself 
while working for the oil industry in alaska told lawyers 
hazelwood should not have been charged 
hazelwood 43 is being tried on one felony charge of criminal 
mischief and misdemeanor charges of reckless endangerment 
negligent discharge of oil and operating on a vessel while 
intoxicated 
the maximum possible penalty for conviction on all counts is 
seven years three months in prison and a 61000 fine 
the tanker hit bligh reef a few hours after taking on a load of 
north slope crude oil at the transalaska pipeline terminal at 
valdez 
oil released by the huge gashes in its hull coated hundreds of 
miles of shoreline killed thousands of marine mammals and prompted 
what exxon said was a 2 billion cleanup involving thousands of 
workers 
the trial began monday with superior court judge karl johnstone 
rejecting another round of defense efforts to get charges against 
the veteran seaman dismissed 
defense attorney dick madson had argued that charges should be 
dismissed because the state lacks jurisdiction 
alcohol abuse command responsibilities and pretrial publicity 
are figuring heavily in jury selection 
have you formed any opinions of roles or responsibilities of 
the various parties madson repeatedly asked 
despite excusing four potential jurors johnstone kept the 
process moving he pushed lawyers from both sides to speed their 
examinations 
its going much faster than i expected said madson who 
complained the judge was limiting questioning 
asked if 12 jurors could be seated by friday he replied if 
he keeps cutting off questions like he is yes

gov jim florio accused exxon corp of lax 
handling of a 570000gallon oil spill in a bird and fish 
sanctuary and said the state had learned from the exxon valdez 
spill not to trust the company 
exxon responding to florios comments tuesday defended its 
response to the jan 2 spill and to the valdez disaster and 
said it would fulfill its responsibilities for the cleanup 
florio said the state department of environmental protection has 
determined that a pipeline operator and supervisor on duty at the 
time of the spill in the arthur kill lacked the certification 
required by new york authorities which shares jurisdiction for the 
waterway 
a portion of pipe will be pulled out of the waterway which lies 
between new jersey and the new york city borough of staten island 
and transported to ohio for lab tests that could help determine the 
cause of the spill florio said exxon confirmed it was removing 
the pipe today for tests at its expense 
florio the democrat elected governor last year after a strong 
proenvironment campaign said new york and new jersey authorities 
had mapped out a strategy to restore the important east coast 
spawning ground for birds and fish which scientists say absorbed 
serious damage from the spilled heating oil 
no dollar figure has been assigned to the damage nor have 
cleanup costs been established 
i want to make it clear to everyone in new jersey that this 
will not be another valdez florio said referring to the march 
28 wreck that spilled more than 10 million gallons of oil into 
alaskas prince william sound exxon will not be allowed to hit 
and run 
my impression of whats happening in valdez is that exxon 
seems to be inclined to wipe its hands sooner rather than later 
florio said were not going to allow that approach to be 
duplicated here 
exxon spokesman leo mclean defended exxons cleanup in alaska 
and said the company was cooperating with authorities to assess 
potential impacts and work toward agreement on the arthur 
kill cleanup 
florio reiterated claims that pipeline operators ignored 
warnings of a possible leak exxon has attributed the slow 
detection of the pipelines problems to equipment failure rather 
than human error 
florio said james fitzgerald a console operator at exxons 
bayway refinery had not obtained the certification required of 
pipeline operators by the new york fire department 
george leth the shift supervisor who trained fitzgerald also 
was not certified to operate the equipment florio said 
the lack of certification was another piece of information we 
will factor into the ongoing investigation the attorney general is 
conducting florio said 
mclean said he could not confirm or deny the certification claim 
until the company completed its own investigation

as the africanized killer bees 
swarm ever closer to their longawaited us border crossing 
scientists are meeting to develop a strategy for battling the 
invasion which may occur by the spring 
the bees were sighted recently at soto la marina mexico about 
150 miles south of the border city of brownsville said anita 
collins bee reseach leader for the local agricultural research 
service station 
scientists from the research service the department of 
agricultures animal and plant health inspection service and the 
texas aampm agricultural experiment station attended a bee strategy 
meeting tuesday 
we are trying to draft specific plans for who is going to do 
what and when and how when we start seeing bees coming across the 
border collins said and the idea is to protect the public and 
the bee industry in texas 
there is no reason to panic collins said 
it is not a black cloud about to descend on south texas she 
said this is the natural spread of a population in small groups 
of bees called swarms 
the killer bees buzz off when sprayed with insect repellent 
and if no repellent is available the best advice is to run 
because you can outrun a bee collins said 
the bees a hybrid of the european honeybee and the pure african 
queen bee gained the killer label not because their sting is 
more poisonous than the european bees but because of their 
defensive behavior in which hundreds or thousands of the bees 
attack intruders 
twentysix africanized queen bees that escaped a research center 
in brazil in 1957 are to blame for the swarms that have crept 
steadily northward through central american and mexico 
the bees spread at the rate of 200300 miles annually according 
to research by john thomas a texas aampm extension entomologist 
texas aampm sought 690000 for a control program to slow the bee 
spread but the state legislature turned down the request last year 
said fred meyer of the us agriculture department 
once the bees arrive meyer said funds should be available to 
eradicate the hives of the africanized bees survey the areas where 
they are found and quarantine bees in affected areas 
several swarms of africanized bees that arrived on ships from 
latin america already have been found at seaports in the united 
states

fortythree leftist guerrillas some of 
whom tried to kill president augusto pinochet in 1986 were at 
large today after escaping from a downtown prison through a tunnel 
that took a year to dig 
authorities said seven other inmates who escaped tuesday were 
quickly captured by police including one who had proved too big 
for the tunnels exit and was found stuck in it 
horacio ojeda director of the national prison system said the 
inmates dug a tunnel about 300 feet long and 20 inches wide from a 
cell block to a nearby lot where a subway station was under 
construction 
the tunnel passed under a busy road 
the escape was discovered at 230 am ojeda said 
several hours later a man who identified himself as one of the 
escapees called radio cooperativa in santiago with details of the 
operation 
the caller said construction of the tunnel took more than a year 
and that 24 inmates took part in planning and carrying out the 
escape 
the tunnel has a ventilation system operated with blowers 
the man said it has electric light and a rail system we used to 
take out the removed material 
after we left the tunnel remained open and we think it was 
used by other prisoners who were not part of our plan the caller 
added 
the details desribed by the caller coincided with what reporters 
saw at the prison 
the entrance to the tunnel was inside a cell the inmates used a 
heavy cement block to cover the hole and hide it from the prison 
guards 
ojeda described all the escapees as leftist guerrillas and said 
several were convicted in a sept 7 1986 ambush of pinochets 
motorcade southeast of santiago 
pinochet was unhurt but five bodyguards were killed and 11 
wounded in the attack carried out by the procommunist manuel 
rodriguez patriotic front 
pinochet took power following a 1973 coup that topped elected 
president salvador allende he is scheduled to turn over power to a 
civilian government in february 
other escapees were front members implicated in the smuggling of 
more than 30 tons of rifles rockets bazookas grenades and other 
weapons into the country in august 1986 ojeda said 
a list of the escapees disclosed by prison authorities includes 
several top commanders of the guerrilla organization some belonged 
to other leftist groups 
according to a local organization of prisoners relatives four 
of the escapees had been sentenced to death but were awaiting the 
outcome of appeals three were convicted in the pinochet 
assassination attempt and the other for killing a policeman

the dollar rose sharply against the japanese yen in 
tokyo today while the key index on the tokyo stock exchange made 
up most of its morning losses and ended marginally lower 
the 225share nikkei stock average closed at 3718895 down 
2672 points or 007 percent the index which rose 4197 points 
tuesday fell briefly below 37000 in the morning for the first 
time since friday 
the dollar closed at 14440 yen up 115 yen from tuesdays 
14325yen finish it opened at 14490 yen and ranged between 
14395 and 14500 yen 
traders attributed the dollars strength to its sudden leap in 
new york after the cable news network reported tuesday afternoon 
that soviet president mikhail gorbachev might step down as 
communist party chief 
yuji nakao a trader with chemical bank said sales of yen for 
profittaking helped the dollar maintain its strength 
the dollar suddenly turned down after hitting 145 yen he said 
as the bank of japan was reported selling dollars to support the 
yen heavy dollarselling by some trading companies in tokyo also 
helped stem the dollars advance he said 
japans central bank was seen intervening in the market at 
around 14465 yen and again at around 14425 yen the bank does not 
officially comment on its exchange market activities 
nakao added that later reports by the kyodo news service of a 
soviet denial that gorbachev might step down calmed market players 
and slowed the dollars rise against the yen kyodo quoted 
unidentified soviet sources 
todays fluctuation was all because of position adjustments 
triggered by the rumor he said 
he said the dollar surged because market players sold yen in an 
attempt to reduce their overbought yen positions 
but the dollar could not go on getting stronger because of the 
shrinking interest rate gap between the united states and japan 
nakao added 
on the stock exchange dealers said the index fell as the yens 
plunge discouraged japanese stock investors 
an overnight decline in the dow jones industrial average on wall 
street also disheartened market players said izumi yazaki at 
nippon kangyo kakumaru securities co 
the index then made up some of its earlier losses as market 
players bought back issues whose prices had fallen she said 
the rumor shook a market that had been already unstable ahead 
of the election ms yazaki added 
a general election for the lower house of japans parliament is 
expected feb 18

legislators approved a bill early today 
requiring minors to get parental consent before having abortions 
and defeated an effort to repeal a dormant law that penalizes 
doctors who perform abortions 
this is going to be a shot heard around the world said 
republican rep robert welch wisconsin is a liberal state taking 
a moderate stand on abortion 
the assembly had sifted through 30 proposed amendments before 
its 7224 vote early today for a bill that would require girls 
younger than age 18 to have the consent of at least one parent or a 
court consent would not be required of incest and rape victims 
were elated said barbara lyons executive director of 
wisconsin right to life inc i think it deflates all the rhetoric 
that the prochoice movement was sweeping the country prolife 
isnt dead its alive 
the measure is expected to go to a senate committee where its 
prospects were uncertain welch said 
democrats control the assembly 5542 but partisan affiliation 
had little effect because there were more antiabortion democrats 
in the assembly than prochoice republicans 
assembly speaker thomas a loftus a democrat said the bill 
fails in the areas of reality compassion and common sense 
on tuesday the assembly rejected by 5442 an amendment to the 
bill that would have excluded pregnant girls deemed suicidal by a 
professional therapist or doctor 
thats sick said rep louis fortis a democrat how can 
you call yourself prolife when youre rejecting an amendment that 
would save the life of a teenage girl 
the assembly voted 5739 earlier against a floor vote for a bill 
to repeal a law that penalizes doctors or others who perform 
abortions 
the law was made unenforceable by the us supreme courts 1973 
roe vs wade ruling that legalized abortion but abortion foes want 
it kept on the books in the hope the roe vs wade decision will 
someday be overturned 
the supreme courts ruling in a challenge to a missouri abortion 
law last summer opened the way for state legislatures to challenge 
existing abortion statutes 
the michigan senate was expected to consider next week a 
parental consent law that has was approved in december by the state 
house 
pennsylvania in november approved a law that restrict abortion 
after 24 weeks and requires a husbands notification for abortions 
in most cases

short of money and haunted by the 
suicide of their skipper the crewmen of the soviet yacht fazisi 
are depending on raffle ticket sales to keep them in a prestigious 
roundtheworld yacht race 
by the time the fourth leg of the whitbread round the world 
race 7190 miles from auckland to punta del este uruguay starts 
sunday the team hopes to have raised about 200000 from raffle 
tickets for a luxury bmw 
the car was donated by a new zealand company and the raffle ends 
today 
we need new sails for the voyage around cape horn said the 
new skipper skip novak 
new zealanders have adopted the 83foot aluminum yacht and its 
mixed crew of 12 soviets two americans one new zealander and a 
frenchman 
many were touched by the crews plight and the suicide of 
skipper alexei grishencko who hanged himself from a tree in punta 
del este after the first leg of the voyage 
he walked away from the hotel and we found him two days later 
he had been depressed and under pressure said novak 
new zealand yachtsmen organized a party for 1000 people in a 
boatyard and raised 7200 a local radio station is hosting a 
60a plate dinner and a fashion show thursday night 
also helping the fundraising are sales of red tshirts with the 
hammer and sickle emblem of the soviet union emblazoned above the 
yachts name 
unlike the other contestants fazisi doesnt have a corporate 
sponsor pepsi cola withdrew its sponsorship because of negative 
feedback over its support for a communist yacht novak said 
it wasnt the imaginative thing to do considering the changes 
that have been going on in the soviet union since we started in 
september last year he said 
the crewmen who come from all over the soviet union have found 
it frustrating trying to keep up with the momentous changes taking 
place at home 
at sea we listen to the bbc but the guys dont get the full 
story when they get to port they get all the papers novak said 
novak 37 a professional sailor from chicago offered himself 
as a consultant to a soviet team planning to sail in the 
37950mile race 
the yachts construction was financed by fazisi a joint venture 
of a soviet georgiabased state enterprise and a west german 
company with interests in fishing forestry and trade 
construction of the yacht started so late that it had to be 
airfreighted from the soviet union to britain aboard the worlds 
largest airplane an antonov 124 
it was finished barely in time for the race start 
novak said fazisi standing eighth overall in the fleet of 23 
yachts from 13 countries is doing better on its shoestring budget 
than some yachts with millions of dollars in sponsorship and a year 
of trial racing 
he estimates that the total cost of the fazisi challenge will be 
3 million about one quarter of other challenges 
the money raised in new zealand will get them to uruguay 
we dont know what we do when we get there novak said we 
are hoping that we can pick up some american sponsorship for the 
leg to fort lauderdale fla so we can finish the race 
we need another 400000 but we are philosophical and keen to 
finish he said

thousands of people live in fear and have a right 
to know if rocky flats has adversely effected their health says 
the attorney who filed two classaction lawsuits against the 
nuclear weapons plants former operators 
also tuesday a 2 billion lawsuit was filed in ohio against a 
former operator of another federally owned nuclear factory the 
fernald uranium processing plant nlo inc and its parent company 
were accused of subjecting employees to a hazardous radioactive 
workplace 
the denver lawsuits allege that rockwell international corp and 
its predecessor dow chemical co were careless and negligent in 
the treatment of hazardous wastes at rocky flats the plant 16 
miles northwest of denver has manufactured plutonium triggers for 
nuclear weapons since 1953 
energy secretary james watkins suspended plutonium processing 
operations at rocky flats in november he said the shutdown would 
remain in effect until doe is convinced safety and health standards 
are being met 
the lawsuits filed in us district court seek independent study 
of health risks posed by the nuclear weapons plant 250 million in 
economic damages for devaluation of property and 300 million in 
other damages former workers also want an unspecified amount of 
money because the stigma of their past employment prevents them 
from finding new jobs or health insurance 
they the plaintiffs want to be told the truth by someone who 
is independent and not controlled by the government or the 
operators of rocky flats said attorney bruce deboskey 
this is not a lawsuit to close rocky flats but to have it run 
properly he said 
the lawsuits said that actions by dow and rockwell led to 
repeated releases of both radioactive and nonradioactive hazardous 
substances into the atmosphere and violations of state and federal 
environmental health and safety laws 
five neighbors of the plant filed one of the lawsuits on behalf 
of about 10000 property owners and up to 50000 people who live 
near the plant they asked the court to halt the further releases 
of hazardous substances 
dow chemical operated the plant from 1953 until 1975 when 
rockwell took over last year the department of energy replaced 
rockwell with egampg inc after the fbi and the environmental 
protection agency raided rocky flats looking for evidence of 
illegal disposal of hazardous wastes 
the other lawsuit was filed by the building and construction 
trades department aflcio and the construction trades council on 
behalf of more than 10000 current and former plant workers 
that suit asks the court to order the defendants to create a 
fund to finance reasonable medical monitoring and surveillance 
including independent scientific studies of adverse health effects 
rockwell officials in el segundo calif declined to comment 
saying they had not seen the court documents dow chemical 
officials at company headquarters in midland mich did not reply 
to calls seeking comment 
deboskey said the lawsuits stem from peoples concern and 
their fear over whether or not they have lost money and whether or 
not their health has been affected by the operations at the plant 
that fear was heightened by the fbi raid last summer 
deboskey said in a telephone interview people are afraid 
theyre afraid and they want to know the truth from people other 
than the ones who have caused the pollution 
doe last year identified rocky flats as the most hazardous site 
in the nations nuclear weapons complex saying toxic chemicals 
contaminated an underground reservoir and threatened nearby city 
water supplies 
the ohio lawsuit filed in us district court in cincinnati 
accused nlo and parent nl industries inc of failing to properly 
store or contain highly radioactive substances at the feed 
materials production center in fernald 
the plant 18 miles northwest of cincinnati processes uranium 
for the energy departments production of nuclear weapons 
the lawsuit says the employees suffered loss of income 
emotional distress including increased fear of cancer and 
diminished ability to obtain other jobs or insurance 
it seeks 2 billion in damages plus unspecified punitive damages 
and payment for extended medical monitoring of the employees

a princeton university graduate has asked 
the state supreme court to require two campus eating clubs to admit 
women 
sally frank now an instructor on discrimination cases at new 
york law school on tuesday urged the high court to end what she 
called 21 years of discrimination at the ivy club and the tiger 
inn which do not admit women 
ms frank said the clubs and princeton university have a 
symbiotic relationship that removes them from protection under 
laws governing private organizations 
but attorneys for the clubs compared the groups to fraternities 
and sororities and said they have the right to choose their own 
members 
we have to make the distinction between civil rights and 
social relationships said barbara strapp nelson who represented 
the ivy club whether one should maintain a social relationship 
with another is not regulated by the state 
the clubs are among 13 private eating clubs at princeton most 
of the juniors and seniors at princeton eat at these clubs which 
are in privatelyowned houses near the campus 
since princeton began admitting women in 1969 only the ivy club 
and the tiger inn have refused to change their rules and admit 
females 
the high court heard the case after a three judge panel of the 
appellate division of superior court last year reversed a 1987 
decision by the state division on civil rights the civil rights 
agency had ordered the clubs to admit women 
ms frank who began her protest as a junior at princeton in 
1979 said the university has billed the eating club in its 
publications as part of the princeton experience 
deputy attorney general susan reisner one of several attorneys 
who represented ms franks case said the clubs had such a close 
connection to princeton they could not claim exemption to 
antidiscrimination laws as a strictly private club 
attorneys for the clubs countered that the clubs are not part of 
the university 
russell beatie jr representing the tiger inn said the case 
pits discrimination laws and privacy laws 
he accused ms frank of seeking admission for purposes other 
than a true desire to be a member of the tiger inn calling her 
energy looking for a cause 
attorneys for the clubs asked the court to give them another 
hearing to dispute facts presented by ms franks attorneys 
ms frank estimated after the hearing that if the court returns 
the matter to a lower level it could take six more years to 
settle however she vowed to continue her fight 
there is a continuing and ongoing interest by female 
students to join these clubs ms frank said

a lightskinned black woman who contends she was 
fired as an irs clerktypist because of her color said her 
darkerskinned boss told her that her life was too easy an 
attorney said 
in opening arguments tuesday in us district court michael 
weinstock attorney for tracy lynn morrow said she was fired from 
her irs job after she was harassed based on her personal physical 
characteristics 
ms morrow testified her irs supervisor ruby lewis told her 
the way you look is your problem 
but assistant us attorney s lark ingram representing ms 
lewis said ms morrows problem wasnt her skin it was her 
typing her grammar and her attitude 
ms morrow is suing ms lewis and the internal revenue service 
seeking up to 60000 in back pay and other payments plus 
reinstatement to her 14000ayear job with the irs atlanta 
office where she worked from early 1985 until she was fired in 
march 1986 
if ms morrow wins her lawsuit she would become the first black 
worker to collect damages from a black supervisor because of 
skintone discrimination according to her attorneys and federal 
equalopportunity officials 
weinstock said that the tone of her skin is the central 
issue in how ms morrow was treated at the irs 
weinstock said ms lewis made demeaning references to ms 
morrows status as a lighterskinned black such as you need 
some sun and youve had it too easy 
ms morrow testified that ms lewis was concerned about race 
telling the workers were a black office we had to watch how 
white people might look at us 
midge l wilson a professor at depaul university who has 
studied intraracial bias among blacks said both light and 
darkskinned blacks sometimes exhibit signs of discrimination 
against the other 
they might create a payback situation to make life 
uncomfortable she said 
but ms ingram argued that ruby lewis did not perceive the 
plaintiff as having different skin color from she 
she said the issue was ms morrows job performance 
from the time ms morrow arrived she couldnt type ms 
ingram said she couldnt write simple sentences 
ms lewis and other irs supervisors tried to work around ms 
morrows problems including attempts to find her another position 
ms ingram said she said it was another irs supervisor not ms 
lewis who decided to fire ms morrow 
the nonjury trial is expected to last all week

with the familiar sign of the golden arches 
embellished by the soviet hammerandsickle flag mcdonalds opened 
in moscow today to offer russians their first taste of western 
consumerism not to mention hamburgers 
hundreds of people tried gingerly to get their fingers around 
their first american hamburger they tried eating them onehanded 
they picked them apart to examine the contents 
one young woman finally squashed her big mac in order to fit her 
lips around it 
it tasted great said a 14yearold boy a sesame seed still 
stuck to his nose 
the restaurant is a lot different from a stolovaya he 
continued referring to the rundown dirty cafeterias that slop 
out dishes like rice and fat or boiled sausage in the soviet 
unions closest approximation to fast food 
the restaurant was 14 years in the making but finally thanks 
to the reforms of president mikhail s gorbachev people got a 
firsthand look at such alien concepts as efficiency and fast 
friendly service 
unlike nearly all other western firms opening up in moscow 
mcdonalds is selling for rubles which are worthless outside the 
soviet union and wont even buy much in the shortageplagued 
country it expects to serve 15000 people a day 
hundreds of people lined up for the longawaited grand opening 
reaching eagerly for mcdonalds flags and pins handed out by the 
hamburger chains brigade of workers an hour before opening the 
mcdonalds crew handed out advertising leaflets at the pushkin 
square metro stop a few yards away 
normally dourfaced citizens broke into grins catching the 
infectious cheerful mood from youthful soviet staffers hired for 
their ability to smile and work hard accordions played folk songs 
and women in traditional costumes danced with cartoon characters 
the line of about 500 people moved steadily thanks to 
mcdonalds decision to build and staff 27 cash registers 
i only waited an hour and i think they served thousands before 
me said a happy middleaged woman from the aluminum plant on 
dmitrovskoye highway and it was only 10 rubles for all this 
she said pointing to a bag packed with unfamiliar treats like 
cheeseburgers and filayofeesh sandwiches im taking it 
back for the girls at the factory to try 
beeg maks were priced at 375 rubles and double 
cheeseburgers at 3 rubles about two hours pay for a starting 
mcdonalds staffer or the average soviet worker thats a bit high 
compared to state restaurants but much cheaper than the private 
cooperative outlets that have sprung up in the past year 
three armenian students said they flew 1250 miles from yerevan 
to moscow just for the mcdonalds opening 
it was magnificent said ida zakharyan gushing over the 
clean brightly colored interior and the 10minute service she 
experienced 
well my wife makes better food said victor kunyasev of 
moscow but it was nice a good place to take a break and grab a 
bite to eat 
the restaurant which is a joint venture of mcdonalds of canada 
and the city of moscow limited purchases to 10 big macs per 
customer to prevent a local entrepreneur from setting up an 
unauthorized subsidiary around the corner 
mcdonalds built its own factory including a bakery a dairy a 
meatprocessing plant and even a potato storage yard to provide 
its own guaranteed supplies in a country where as much as 25 
percent of the harvest rots on the way to the consumer 
one mcdonalds associate in the crowd said the firm wound up 
importing wooden crates from finland for storing potatoes because 
when they went to build crates they found there was no wood and 
no nails they found you need a permit to buy nails 
the enormous investment of 50 million was likely balanced 
however by the free publicity the firm is receiving from an army 
of correspondents who nearly outnumbered the customers at the 
opening hour

slayings last month of robinson and a federal judge in alabama gave 
samples of his blood saliva and hair to the fbi 
robert wayne oferrell a 46yearold junk dealer in enterprise 
in southeast alabama was taken by police to a hospital where he 
spent 45 minutes providing samples requested in a federal grand

oferrell has been questioned extensively in the fbis 
investigation of the slayings of 11th us circuit court of appeals

a jetliner crash survivor was charged at a 
hospital with drug possession after passing about 5 ounces of 
cocaine through his digestive tract and whats believed to be the 
first crash lawsuit has been filed 
antonio zuluaga who was critically injured was the second 
passenger from avianca flight 52 alleged to have been carrying 
condoms containing cocaine inside his body police said 
the boeing 707 en route from bogota and the colombian drug 
capital of medellin smacked into a hillside thursday night 15 
miles northeast of kennedy international airport the crash killed 
73 people and left 86 survivors 
zuluaga was being treated at nassau county medical center in 
east meadow for a fractured spine broken ribs a dislocated hip 
and possibly a broken knee 
each of the 19 condoms he passed had about 8 grams of the drug 
police sgt richard snizek said tuesday 
another man jose figueroa was found to have cocainefilled 
condoms in his intestines when doctors operated on him the day 
after the crash to stop internal bleeding authorities said 
figueroas body may contain as many as 70 more cocaine packets of 
varying size and police were waiting to determine the amount before 
charging him said donald kane deputy chief of detectives 
the us district court lawsuit filed tuesday by a new jersey 
man who said he was disabled in the crash seeks 2025 million 
from the airline it says avianca was negligent because it failed 
to furnish a safe aircraft and a competent crew 
the plaintiff jesus manuel pinzon 31 of elizabeth nj 
suffered multiple broken bones cuts and internal injuries he was 
returning from a visit to relatives in bogota 
his lawyer robert a solomon said pinzon was permanently 
disabled and unable to return to his 400aweek job at a new 
jersey clothing factory he is being treated at elizabeth general 
hospital 
pinzons 2yearold son brian who was sitting in the seat next 
to his father suffered minor head injuries and was not 
hospitalized 
a telephone call to aviancas offices for comment was not 
answered 
a final report of the crash is unlikely for at least nine 
months reports so far have centered on who was responsible for the 
decision not to land when fuel was running low 
as the plane circled around new jersey about 45 minutes before 
the crash captain laureano caviedes hoyos asked for priority 
to land rather than declaring an emergency investigators said 
the lead investigator barry trotter of the national 
transportation safety board said the controllers responded to 
caviedes request by moving the flight from a holding pattern to an 
approach pattern although the plane was not moved to the first 
slot among approaching planes 
the pilot apparently thought when he came out of the holding 
pattern that he had enough fuel and thats why he appears in taped 
conversations to be calm and cool trotter said tuesday 
but what we dont think he was aware of is that he was going 
to be vectored all around long island for 37 minutes before being 
cleared for landing at kennedy 
trotter said avianca does not require its pilots to declare a 
fuel emergency when levels drop below a certain point and other 
airline officials said it is typically up to the captain to make 
such a declaration 
an american airlines jet was brought in shortly before the crash 
when its pilot told controllers it had just 14 minutes of fuel 
remaining bad weather delayed landings at kennedy for many flights 
the night of the crash 
caviedes had 17 years experience flying into kennedy including 
three trips the month before the crash trotter said

bulgarias opposition today rejected a 
communist offer to share power before the first free elections in 
more than four decades 
petar beron spokesman for the loose opposition umbrella group 
the union of democratic forces spoke on sofia radio the state 
news agency bta said 
opposition leaders have rejected previous communist offers to 
enter what communist party chief petar mladenov called a 
government of national concord before the elections they had 
called the offers a communist ploy to get the opposition to share 
responsibility for four decades of mismanagement 
the opposition has been holding talks with the communists on 
powersharing 
mladenov reiterated the communist offer to share power in an 
opening speech tuesday to a party congress where he is trying to 
avoid a formal split between reformers and hardliners 
the congress was moved up from 1991 after bulgaria was caught up 
in the prodemocracy movement sweeping eastern europe bulgarias 
hardline communist leader todor zhivkov was outsed nov 10 after 
35 years in power 
mladenov gave no details of how much power the communists would 
have in his proposed powersharing cabinet 
governments dominated by noncommunists are running east germany 
and czechoslovakia prior to their free elections in march and june 
respectively 
mladenov also said tuesday that bulgarias first free elections 
should be held in may not in november as the opposition had 
demanded 
it was one of the few points of the party chiefs speech that 
was applauded by the 2752 congress delegates 
according to bta beron told radio sofia today that his group 
has decided to consent to may elections because it believes the 
present communistdominated parliament simply cannot enact any 
substantial reforms 
reformers made a strong showing today as the communist party 
congress entered its second day 
reformminded journalist stefan prodev chief editor of the 
weekly narodna cultura who was chosen two days ago to head the 
official journalists union said communists could win public 
support only by shedding dogmas of a harmful ideology that he 
charged still dominated the views of most party members 
politburo member alexander lilov one of the triumvirate running 
the country with mladenov and fellow politburo reformer andrei 
lukanov said 
while the party and country are in a crisis we have not yet 
reached the climax our party cannot start an offensive now because 
of a lack of confidence he said the party must be radically 
overhauled to win elections 
unlike their comrades elsewhere in eastern europe bulgarias 
communists face a relatively weak opposition and have not 
relinquished much power since zhivkov was ousted leaders such as 
lukanov consistently have expressed confidence the communists can 
still win a substantial share of the vote or even a majority at 
the may elections the opposition disputes that 
lilov a possible contender for the party leadership if mladenov 
gives up the post said the party has been hurt by failing to 
implement reforms 
we are lagging behind if the programs are not competent and 
realistic we will lose he told the congress he accused premier 
georgi atanassov a holdover from the zhivkov era of failing to 
work out an economic program 
atanassov retained his post after zhivkovs ouster apparently 
because he backed mladenov and other politburo colleagues who 
engineered the removal of zhivkov after 35 years in power 
but he has done nothing to tackle what mladenov conceded tuesday 
was mounting economic chaos bulgaria has been hit in the past two 
weeks by unprecedented labor stoppages teachers went on strike as 
the congress opened 
miners who walked off the job across the country last week 
resumed work but they continued negotiations with the government 
for better conditions

of dbaiyeh and police said they were moving into a nearby militia 
barracks

think tank had fallen to aouns troops 
a police spokesman said the house of the future compound fell 
to aouns forces in about 30 minutes the militia force guarding it 
did not number more than 20 men 
those who escaped the fighting withdrew to the nearby barracks

automatic fire was also reported in the suburb of aukar where the 
us embassy is located it gave no details

demanding support for the rebellious general surrounded it

areas of the 310squaremile christian enclave were not answered 
the police official who cannot be named under regulations said 
aouns troops surrounded lebanese forces barracks in adonis and

lackey of the syrians who control most of lebanon and back moslem 
militias aoun has pledged to keep fighting until syria withdraws 
its 40000 soldiers from lebanon

army to alter the policy theyve been following we have the 
patience of job but this cannot go on forever 
ive ordered all the lebanese forces fighters to stay in their 
barracks and defend them geagea said 
aoun in a brief statement broadcast by his radio lebanon spoke 
only of scattered disorders that the troops have been ordered to 
put an end to 
the police official said all police patrols in christian east 
beirut were ordered back to headquarters and their stations to 
avoid being caught in crossfire in case the clashes spread 
the statement reflected the police concern the clashes might 
engulf other traditional lebanese forces strongholds in east 
beirut 
the clashes broke out despite intensified efforts to head off a 
showdown between aouns troops and geageas militia for control of 
the christian enclave 
aouns troops established control tuesday over four barracks 
that geageas militia maintained on beiruts eastern and northern 
edges and later moved into a compound that commands the main 
coastal highway north of beirut 
aoun said tuesday his fighters were ordered to take over all 
lebanese forces barracks in the christian enclave 
aoun first moved against the lebanese forces in february 1989 
when his forces flushed out the militia from the metn mountainous 
regions northeast of the capital in a fourday crackdown that 
killed 82 people and wounded 200

a judges decision blocking a book critical of 
church of scientology founder l ron hubbard is a dagger in the 
heart of the first amendment the publishers lawyer says 
it really threatens to impair the right of biographers and 
scholars to study the works of other people who are of great public 
interest melvin wulf said tuesday after the ruling by us 
district judge louis l stanton 
stanton said parts of the book which is still in manuscript 
form violated the copyrights of hubbards authorized biographer 
the judge said a piece of blue sky could be published after 
infringing passages were deleted something he said could easily be 
done because much of the material was set off at the beginning of 
chapters 
wulf an attorney for the publisher carol publishing group 
said the judge showed a total misunderstanding of the fair use 
law which says copyrighted works can be used for criticism news 
reporting teaching or research 
the ruling stemmed from a lawsuit by new era publications 
international which holds copyrights to hubbards private papers 
for the writing of his authorized biography the company also is 
the publisher of scientology books 
new era lawyer jonathan rubell said his client had never 
intended to stop the books publication 
it was the use of expression rather than factual presentation 
that we were complaining about he said 
hubbard who died in 1986 wrote dozens of books about 
scientology and his philosophy he taught that spiritual competence 
is achieved by erasing mental images in the unconscious mind 
that cause irrational behavior 
a piece of blue sky was written by jonathan cavenatack who 
became disillusioned with hubbards teachings after following them 
for nine years 
according to stantons decision atack came to believe that 
scientology is a dangerous cult and that mr hubbard far from 
being the gentle prophet portrayed in church literature was a 
paranoid vindictive and profoundly disturbed man 
after receiving permission from stanton to review the 
manuscript new era said 121 passages less than 3 percent of the 
book were from copyrighted sources

west german officials and media today praised 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev for softening his view on 
german reunification and said it could give hope to disheartened 
east germans 
disgraced former communist party leader erich honecker was 
released from prison tuesday night after justice officials 
determined he was too frail to withstand the rigors of imprisonment 
while awaiting trial on treason charges 
gorbachev said tuesday in moscow that he believed one germany 
was likely in the future but he added that germans should not 
decide this important question on the streets 
he referred to the growing number of demonstrations in east 
germany in support of reunification 
gorbachevs statement was his most tolerant yet on the subject 
of a single germany which has been opposed by communists for more 
than 40 years east german communists on tuesday endorsed for 
reunification for the first time 
in west germany foreign minister hansdietrich genscher told 
west german radio that gorbachev had correctly analyzed the 
situation and again shown his political skill 
west german officials and media praised gorbachevs view as 
realistic and described it as an important sign of hope for 
east germans who have lost faith in their government 
communist leaders launched their uphill campaign for march 18 
parliamentary elections with a news conference to unveil their 
european concept that aims for a united and demilitarized 
europe 
party ideologist peter brie said the communists support the 
togetherness of the german nation and urged a thoughtful and 
measured approach to reunification 
in an interview with the west german bild newspaper party 
leader gregor gysi complained that the reunification drive is 
moving too quickly 
asked if the communists oppose reunification gysi told the 
newspaper no not at all this process cannot be stopped any 
more but it is irresponsible to do things in such a way now as if 
it were possible tomorrow 
the reunification issue promises to dominate the election 
campaign that will seat a new leadership in less than seven weeks 
increasing numbers of east germans have demonstrated for union 
with wealthy and prosperous west germany as their own economy 
tumbles and an exodus of skilled workers continues unchecked 
more than 340000 people fled east germany last year having 
lost hope that their spartan living conditions would improve the 
devastating flight has included as many as 2500 people daily since 
jan 1 
the communists are widely distrusted because of corruption 
scandals that have surfaced since the peaceful prodemocracy revolt 
last fall and because they carry the blame for leading east 
germany into its current economic and political crises 
the man most blamed for the countrys problems honecker was 
set free after an east berlin court rejected a request that he be 
kept in prison until his trial in march he was jailed monday 
the court decided that despite the severity of the charges 
against honecker the state of the accuseds health does not permit 
imprisonment the official adn news agency reported 
a spokesman for chief prosecutor hansjuergen joseph promised 
that the investigation against honecker would proceed 
adn said the court acted on advice from two doctors who examined 
honecker independently honecker 77 underwent surgery on jan 8 
to remove a malignant kidney tumor 
honecker was ousted from the leadership on oct 18 after 
massive prodemocracy demonstrations he was expelled from the 
communist party in december and has since been accused of treason 
and abusing his power

with a final sweep of an underwater 
vacuum workers at the three mile island nuclear plant have wrapped 
up the fouryear effort to remove fuel from the damaged reactor 
a color monitor inspection of the unit 2 reactor followed by 
the vacuuming on tuesday marked the end of the project said mary 
wells spokeswoman for gpu nuclear corp which operates the plant 
since 1985 more than 99 percent of the 100 tons of uranium fuel 
were pulled from the reactor and shipped to a federal laboratory in 
idaho for study and disposal gpu nuclear said fuel removal was the 
heart of the 1 billion cleanup 
unit 2 was damaged in march 1979 in the worst accident ever at a 
us commercial nuclear plant the nuclear core lost cooling water 
overheated and partially melted 
the remaining fuel poses no hazard at the plant which is 
scheduled to go into longterm storage beginning next year ms 
wells said it simply could not be reached she said weve 
gone to extraordinary efforts to get the fuel out 
the cleanup required development of new tools so workers on a 
shielded platform above the reactor could pick up radioactive 
debris through 40 feet of water 
decontamination work on other plant systems will continue for 
the rest of the year gpu nuclear is working on a system to boil 
away 23 million gallons of slightly contaminated water left from 
the accident and cleanup 
kay pickering a spokeswoman for the antinuclear group three 
mile island alert said people shouldnt think the cleanup is 
finished were concerned about what happens now she said 
our concern is that it remains a highly radioactive site 
gpu nuclear has asked the nuclear regulatory commission to 
authorize a license change permitting the longterm storage plan 
the containment building around the reactor would be sealed and 
monitored for several decades to allow radiation levels to drop

chinas ruling communist party issued stern 
orders today for tighter control of unions and other mass 
organizations and said they cannot be used as opposition bases 
a party circular said officials should strengthen leadership 
over the unions the communist youth league and womens federations 
so that these organizations keep to the correct political 
orientation and identify themselves with the party central 
committee in politics thinking and action 
on no account is any organization allowed to raise political 
advocacy against the party it said by no means will any 
political organization opposing the four cardinal principles or 
undermining state power be allowed to exist it must be banned 
according to law as soon as it is discovered 
the four cardinal principles of the party set forth by senior 
leader deng xiaoping in 1979 are socialism the leadership of the 
communist party the peoples democratic dictatorship and 
marxismleninismmao tsetung thought 
the principles are stressed most in times when political 
conservatives dominate policy as they have since the june 
crackdown on studentled prodemocracy protesters 
the circular was approved by the party central committee on dec 
21 but issued publicly only today the official xinhua news agency 
said without giving any reason for the delay 
it said the aim was to guard against and prevent any tendency 
to cast off or weaken the leadership of the party 
all unions and mass organizations in china are set up and 
supervised by the state and the government has made it clear in 
the past it will not tolerate unofficial worker federations such as 
polands solidarity which became the spearhead for revolt against 
communist rule 
some officials of the national trade union federation openly 
supported last springs democracy movement but the party moved 
quickly to discipline them and assert its control an independent 
union formed by a group of beijing workers during the protests was 
declared illegal and its leaders were arrested 
the communist youth league a kind of junior division for young 
wouldbe party members donated tents to the student protesters 
camping in tiananmen square and the allchina womens federation 
joined dozens of groups in urging authorities to hold a dialogue 
with students who began a hunger strike 
the party circular said unions the youth league and womens 
groups must participate in handling social contradictions 
especially unexpected public events meaning they must help the 
party educate their members in the official position on any event 
they also must guide workers young people and women to 
subordinate their personal interests to the interest of the state 
finally they should serve as democratic channels for the 
public to take part in and discuss state affairs in an organized 
and disciplined way under leadership the circular said deng has 
said repeatedly he is opposed to westernstyle democracy with 
uncontrolled public debate on issues

major opposition parties today 
denounced the revolutionary governments plan to continue governing 
while competing in elections and warned that a new dictatorship 
could emerge 
opposition groups have angrily criticized the ruling national 
salvation front which assumed power during the bloody december 
revolt that toppled nicolae ceausescu for reneging on its promise 
to run romania only until the may 20 elections 
they had demanded the interim government not field candidates in 
elections it will oversee and accused it of trying to establish 
oneparty rule 
on tuesday the interim government said it would share power 
until the elections and split into two groups one to govern and 
the other to contest elections 
the opposition national liberal party said the move failed to 
answer its objections because it would still be running the 
government and participating in elections 
this is illegal we asked the front to transform itself into a 
political party party spokesman nicolae enescu told the 
associated press if it takes part in elections and represents 
the interests of the state it seems like a dictatorship again 
the other major opposition group the 260000member national 
peasant party charged that if the nationl salvation front wins it 
will establish another communist dictatorship with a human face 
critics noted that the front controls the military bureaucracy 
and industry and has restricted opposition access to the mass media 
senior front member silviu brucan offered the coalition 
government and announced the split in comments to selected 
reporters a transcript of which was made avaliable to the 
associated press 
the concessions follow growing public dissatisfaction with the 
fronts ruling tactics and international criticism of it for 
allowing progovernment demonstrators to besiege the headquarters 
of two opposition parties on monday 
opposition leaders claimed they had been the target of 
governmentorganized harassment noting that many of the protesters 
were workers who arrived in the capital in governmentowned trucks 
and buses 
on tuesday the us state department accused the front of 
intimidating the opposition and said department human rights 
director richard schifter was in bucharest forcefully stating our 
concerns 
we are deeply troubled by what appears to be active 
intimidation of legitimate organizations which are seeking a 
legitimate independent role in romanias new political order 
state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler said in washington 
schifter met with opposition leaders tuesday and was to confer 
with key government figures today 
the demonstrators monday broke into liberal party headquarters 
and surrounded the offices of the national peasant party forcing 
its president to flee in an armored personnel carrier provided by 
authorities 
on sunday thousands of protesters had converged on government 
headquarters demanding the front share power or resign 
many opposition groups have accused the front which is 
composed of military officers intellectuals and disaffected 
communists of seeking to continue communist rule 
brucan declared tuesday 
we believe it is illegal for the front to hold political power 
and take part in elections at the same time 
that is why we have split into a provisional national council 
to hold legislative power on the one hand and the national 
salvation front which is to take part in the elections as a 
political organization on the other 
he said the government would suggest opposition parties take 
part in the provisional national council in order to guarantee the 
objectivity of the elections when talks between the government 
and opposition resume thursday 
in other developments a military tribunal was told that 
ceausescus defense minister vasile milea was not killed on 
ceausescus orders as had been believed but killed himself rather 
than give orders to fire on anticeausescu demonstrators 
milea has become a hero of the romanian revolution for trying to 
keep the army from firing on unarmed demonstrators as ordered by 
ceausescu 
his death helped turn army units against ceausescu in the 
popular uprising that ended the dictators brutal 24year rule 
at the trial of four close associates of ceausescu col 
corneliu pircalabescu testified that milea asked him to tell his 
wife and children he couldnt order defenseless demonstrators 
killed minutes later he shot himself in the heart said 
pircalabescu head of the civilian reserve force 
pircalabescu is not a defendant in the trial 
his testimony some of the most moving in the threeday trial 
contradicted an account monday by defendant emil bobu that the 
dictator ordered the generals assassination for opposing the order 
to shoot bobu was the no 3 official in the ceausescu government 
the trial which began saturday was adjourned until thursday

if white america is shocked by what it sees 
the newly authorized national museum of the american indian will be 
doing its job says suzan shown harjo 
but i think the white majority culture is tough enough to 
understand that slavery and subjugation are not a good idea says 
ms harjo former executive director of the national congress of 
american indians and a moving force in the museums establishment 
ms harjo 44 a cheyenne and creek who was born in el reno 
okla is president of the morning star foundation an organization 
advocating respect for the cultural rights of indians 
she was named monday as one of the 12 indians required by 
congress to be included in the 25member board of directors of the 
national museum of the american indian 
the museum was authorized last year as the last smithsonian 
museum to be built on the national mall it will be squeezed 
between the air and space museum and the capitol a companion 
museum also will be built in new york citys custom house 
when completed in 1992 the museum will consolidate the 
smithsonians big indian collection with 1 million artifacts 
40000 books and 86000 photos in new york citys museum of the 
american indian which was short of space and running low on money 
the new york collection is possibly the worlds largest 
in an interview ms harjo said the museum will acquaint white 
americans with a fresh view of history if i have anything to do 
with it 
and that view may be shocking in a capital where even the name 
of the professional football team the washington redskins is as 
insulting to native americans as other epithets would be to other 
groups she said 
if the museum succeeds even such a simple schoolday lesson as 
columbus discovered america will have to be freshly thought 
through ms harjo said 
with a laugh she suggested that america discovered columbus 
or indians had a lax immigration policy would be a more 
accurate way to describe what happened in 1492 
her point was that the continent called america was here and 
populated by developed civilizations long before columbus 
discovery 500 years ago 
they came we welcomed they killed short history for the 
quincentennial she said 
ms harjos grievance with the way american indians history is 
presented is that it treats them as relics we are not discussed 
in the present tense therefore we have no future she said 
the fact is that history has never been written accurately 
about native peoples she said it is written by the colonizer 
and is designed to justify the land grabs and continued 
colonization the subjugation of a people 
as the result when the indian won a battle it was a 
massacre when white troops won it was a victory 
telling the truth doesnt mean presenting indians always in 
the most positive light ms harjo said it just means telling 
the truth we need an educational program to humanize us in a 
way that will counter the dehumanizing stereotyping and cartooning 
that has taken place

pope john paul ii traveled to the christian 
heartland of southern chad today and paid homage to missionaries 
killed during decades of civil strife 
on the last full day of his eightday tour of africas sahel 
region the pontiff celebrated mass before more than 100000 people 
in this capital of the cottongrowing region where roman catholic 
missionaries set up their first base 60 years ago 
he called mondou the cradle of the catholic church in chad 
the great majority of chads 400000 baptized roman catholics 
and 153 foreign priests live in the south most of the nations 
moslems who make up about 50 percent of the population of 55 
million live in the north 
in his homily the pope paid tribute to the former bishop of 
mondou gabriel balet a swiss national who was killed in the crash 
of a french airliner in niger on sept 19 the uta dc10 exploded 
during a flight from ndjamena to paris a bomb was suspected 
i express again from all my heart my deep sympathy to the 
families in mourning and to the diocesan community john paul 
said speaking in french at mondous stadium of peace 
a highlight of the ceremony came when a chief of the nomoate 
ethnic group danced up to the altar and placed a beaded cap with 
brown plumes on john pauls head the pope held the hat on his head 
and smiled broadly 
since becoming independent in 1960 chad has often been torn 
apart by fighting between north and south between different tribes 
and political factions and between libyanbacked rebels and 
government forces 
in august chad and libya agreed to put an end to 16 years of 
hostility and agreed to reach a political settlement over the 
45000squaremile aouzou strip that separates them 
referring to the missionaries who evangelized chad the pope 
said many of them during the tragic events of these past years 
paid with their life for their attachment to jesus and their 
fidelity to the service of their community 
he praised the catechists who traveled to areas of fighting to 
spread the faith 
for this country rebuilding itself after so many ordeals 
their presence and their actions are a sign of hope the pope 
said before leaving to conduct a special service in sarh and 
returning to the capital ndjamena 
a crowd of 150000 to 200000 attended the mass in a huge open 
field that is to be the site of a soccer stadium the pope 
encouraged the faithful to fill the ranks of priests and 
catechists there are only 26 chadian priests 
the theme of reconciliation and unity has dominated the popes 
stay in chad 
repression by a christianled government in 1965 against moslem 
populations in the center and north of chad led to fighting 
throughout the country that ended only two years ago 
the chadian church has placed great emphasis on the need for an 
islamicchristian dialogue 
upon arriving in chad on monday the pope spoke in a cathedral 
that was restored after being destroyed by fighting 10 years ago

a political reform initiative that won 
voter approval 19 months ago has wound up like many so many other 
california ballot measures in recent years in court 
testimony began tuesday in the federal court trial of 
proposition 73 the omnibus campaign cleanup measure that outlawed 
public financing of political races limited contributions and 
banned transfers of donations between candidates committees 
the proposition is the latest in a series of voterapproved 
ballot questions including measures dealing with insurance rate 
reform and toxics cleanup that have become ensnared in legal 
tangles 
opponents of proposition 73 led by assembly speaker willie 
brown the democratic party and several unions want us district 
judge lawrence karlton to throw out the initiative they contend it 
is unconstitutional and denies women minorities and grassroots 
groups their rights by unfairly limiting the amount of money they 
can raise to run against wealthy incumbents 
in addition an advocate for one of the states most powerful 
and wellheeled lobbies the 240000member california teachers 
association testified that proposition 73 has put a crimp in the 
teachers political activities 
alice huffman who heads the associations political action 
committee that distributes hundred of thousands of dollars annually 
to legislative candidates said the measures contribution 
restraints restrict the groups contacts with its members by 
limiting the number of campaign endorsement letters it can send 
the authors of proposition 73 said their initiative is supported 
by the public and opposed only by democratic politicians seeking to 
bolster their power 
opposition is coming from some of the most powerful 
politicians and special interests in california said initiative 
coauthor ross johnson of fullerton the republican leader of the 
state assembly those groups dislike provisions that apply the same 
limits to all candidates he said 
johnson said the initiative has hamstrung runaway campaign 
donations but critics including the political watchdog group 
common cause contend the measure has had an uncertain impact on 
californias highstakes political campaigns 
joseph garcia an attorney for the state fair political 
practices commission said the lawsuit was politically motivated 
and not based on merit 
in this case these facts are about politics and these 
plaintiffs are politicians garcia said not here before the 
court today are the three million voters who overwhelmingly 
approved proposition 73 in 1988 by 58 percent of the vote 
the measure was approved 314 million to 223 million votes 
the initiative puts a 1000 ceiling on individual contributions 
to a state or local candidate in a single fiscal year 2500 from 
a political committee and 5000 from a socalled broadbased 
political action committee or political party the measure put no 
restrictions on spending 
on may 19 karlton ruled in favor of the plaintiffs issuing a 
temporary order that overturned some provisions the judge lifted 
the ban on transfers between one candidates committees removed 
the limit on labor union contributions for endorsement mailings 
and said candidates could use funds raised before jan 1 1989 
when most of the provisions took effect to back or oppose other 
candidates 
his order remains in effect pending the outcome of the trial 
karlton is hearing the case without a jury and he said the 
trial will probably be completed by early next week 
other initiatives that have resulted in court fights include 
proposition 103 the insurance reform measure backed by consumer 
advocate ralph nader and proposition 65 the antitoxics 
cleanwater initiative that was supported by environmentalists but 
opposed by farmers and manufacturers

senator investigated alleged communist influence in the film 
industry

president bush may not outshine a thousand 
points of light or top a kinder and gentler nation but hes 
bound to try out a new catchphrase or two in tonights state of 
the union address 
presidential speechwriters always strive for those few pithy 
words or flowing lines that will live on after the applause has 
died 
but the ghostwriter who put those earlier words in bushs mouth 
and taught us to read his lips peggy noonan is now persona non 
grata at the white house since becoming a tellitall author and 
neither bush left to his own devices nor his current 
speechwriters have been having much luck at matching the old noonan 
nuggets 
the underpinnings of the united states the state of the 
union is not bad bush told a group of newspaper publishers last 
week when asked to preview tonights address 
not bad might be an honest assessment but it doesnt have 
much ring 
meanwhile bushs speechwriters seem to be straining for soaring 
passages 
with all the flash and fluff in the world today theres 
something we cant afford to lose sight of something deceptively 
simple its who we are that makes this nation what it is was 
one recent offering 
in his 1989 inaugural address bush spoke lyrically of a new 
breeze blowing through the totalitarian world he promised 
democratic leaders an age of the offered hand and he summed up 
the nations budget woes in six words we have more will than 
wallet 
noonan again 
it was the last speech she wrote for george bush white house 
sources said there was a falling out between noonan and white house 
chief of staff john sununu and other top bush advisers in early 
1989 partly due to her own growing fame as a wordsmith 
noonan recounts her experiences as a speechwriter for bush and 
former president reagan in a book what i saw at the revolution 
a political life in the reagan era published last week 
bush has made no secret of his disdain for insider or 
kissandtell books written by former aides the publication of 
noonans book did little to heal the rift 
when she began writing speeches for bush in the 1988 campaign 
noonan writes he gave her a list of words with special meaning 
to him family grandkids love decency honor pride 
tolerance hope kindness loyalty freedom caring heart faith 
service to country fair fair play strength healing 
excellence 
from those threads she began weaving bushs speeches but she 
ran up against one major obstacle george bush hated to say i 
i became adept at pronounless sentences noonan says 
instead of i moved to texas and soon we joined the republican 
party it was moved to texas joined the republican party raised 
a family 
noonan suggests bushs modesty came from his doughty old 
mom dorothy walker bush who used to rap his knuckles for 
bragging a brag apparently being defined as any sentence with the 
first person singular as its subject 
she confesses visions of bush taking the oath on the capitol 
steps with these words do solemnly swear will preserve and 
protect 
bushs characterization of a kinder gentler nation 
contained in his acceptance speech to the republican national 
convention has become one of the presidents signature phrases 
but noonan writes it was just kinder nation in her first 
draft she later scribbled in gentler 
bushs no new taxes line also in the same widely acclaimed 
acceptance speech was suggested by jack kemp now the secretary of 
housing and urban development noonan says 
but she takes all the credit for read my lips even though 
bush aides took it out because there is no history of 
presidential candidates making personalorgan references in 
acceptance speeches 
bush left it in one line he scratched out a reference noonan 
proposed to michael dukakis slight stature 
noonan claims full credit for bushs thousand points of 
light but allows it might have been influenced by a line from a 
favorite author thomas wolfe who wrote in the web and the 
rock of a thousand points of friendly light 
bush uses the phrase to this day to praise volunteer efforts 
why a thousand a hundred wasnt enough and a million is too 
many noonan writes 
white house communications director david demarest in charge of 
white house speechwriters says noonan who now lives in new york 
has not worked on any recent bush speeches and that all 
presidential speeches are prepared inhouse 
however work on bushs state of the union address was partly 
farmed out to an old hand from the campaign new york media 
consultant and image guru roger ailes 
white house speechwriter daniel mcgroarty wrote most of the 
speech and white house chief of staff sununu helped refine it 
ailes worked with bush on monday and again today on final 
preparation sources said

thousands of black demonstrators 
in two cities today peacefully protested police tactics and a 
boycottbreaking tour by english cricket players 
seeking to avoid a repeat of violence that marred previous 
unauthorized protests the government authorized the two 
demonstrations a march in cape town protesting alleged police 
brutality and a rally in bloemfontein outside the stadium where the 
english team was playing 
large police contingents watched the protests but there were no 
reports of disturbances 
in cape town 3500 marchers met at a methodist church then 
walked to police headquarters to present a petition condemning 
police actions during a protest march in the city on jan 23 
police had blocked the intended parade route with barbed wire 
then used rubber bullets and a water cannon against the protesters 
sparking a rampage in which scores of youths smashed windows of 
shops and cars 
by contrast todays march was peaceful 
it has shown very clearly that if there is any violence or 
disorderly conduct it is entirely the fault of the police said 
the rev allan boesak a prominent mixedrace activist who led the 
march 
the government gave permission for another protest march in cape 
town on thursday organized to demand that president fw de klerk 
appoint a commission to investigate allegations about police 
assassination squads 
in bloemfontein 1000 blacks arrived by bus and van to protest 
the english cricket team which was in the second day of a 
threeday match against a team of university players 
among the spectators in the stadium were scores of black youths 
who had been given tickets by a group supporting the tour 
the english players face bans of five years from international 
competition for making the trip in defiance of the sports boycott 
imposed to protest south africas racial segregation policies 
since the teams arrival two weeks ago there have been repeated 
clashes between police and protesters on tuesday police used 
batons rubber bullets and tear gas to prevent 1000 blacks from 
marching to the stadium

deputy premier frantisek pitra 
the last of the old guard communist leaders left in power after the 
peaceful revolution resigned today as leader of the czech 
republic the ctk news agency said 
it was expected pitra also would give up his cabinet position 
once his resignation from the czech post was approved by parliament 
pitra 57 had strong links with the orthodox communist 
leadership that took over after the crushing of the 1968 reform 
movement and ruled until last falls prodemocracy revolution 
pitra lost his seat on the ruling communist party politburo on 
nov 24 along with hardline party leader milos jakes and others 
closely linked to the post1968 crackdown 
however he survived as czech premier after revamping his 
republics government to become the first in czechoslovakia since 
1948 that was not dominated by communists 
that paved the way for similar changes at the federal level 
pitras position as the czech premier automatically gave him the 
deputy premiers post in the national government 
ctk did not give the reason for pitras resignation which came 
a day after the communists ended a 40year dominance in the 
national parliament by relinquishing more than 100 of their seats 
to prodemocracy groups 
the realignment completed an effort to include czechoslovakias 
emerging reform groups in parliament before free elections which 
are scheduled june 8 
parliament swore in 120 new deputies tuesday only nine of them 
communists under an agreement to replace more than onethird of 
the 350member legislature 
the action sliced the communists representation from 242 to 
139 nearly all the new seats went to the opposition and other 
established political parties 
more than 40 political parties have emerged in the two months 
since parliament removed the constitutional provision guaranteeing 
the communist partys leading role 
in other developments foreign minister jiri dienstbier today 
met with a papal representative on restoring ties between 
czechoslovakia and the vatican and state radio announced plans to 
resume broadcasting masses and other religious programs 
dienstbier meeting with special papal nuncio archbishop 
francesco colasuonno also discussed the visit of polishborn pope 
john paul ii planned for april 2122 as the new government seeks 
to restore sanctioned religious observances following decades of 
repression 
the official ctk news agency said the talks concerned the 
early resumption of diplomatic relations between czechoslovakia 
and the vatican czechoslovakia broke ties in the 1950s in line 
with communist dogma followed throughout the east bloc 
poland last year became the first east bloc nation to restore 
diplomatic ties with the vatican 
last week the czechoslovak parliament said priests no longer 
will have to obtain licenses from the state the licenses had been 
used in the past to screen clergymen considered politically 
troublesome 
czechoslovakia and israel are expected to restore diplomatic 
ties on feb 8 when foreign minister moshe arens of israel visits 
prague 
czechoslovakia one of israels strongest supporters after the 
jewish state was founded in 1948 broke ties after the 1967 middle 
east war when israel captured arab lands

a black man accused of 
involvement in guerrilla attacks was found hanged in his cell 
police said today he reportedly was a former lover of jailed black 
leader nelson mandelas daughter 
within hours of the police announcement president fw de klerk 
ordered a judicial inquiry into the death a step not taken after 
scores of previous incidents in which black activists died while in 
police custody 
according to local newspapers the 20yearold man clayton 
sithole was a former lover of zindzi mandela and the father of her 
child 
there was no immediate comment from the mandelas but associates 
of the family said they believed the report was accurate 
sithole and four other suspected african national congress 
guerrillas were arrested friday in soweto the vast black township 
outside johannesburg police accused the group of killing 10 
people including two policemen in attacks with hand grenades and 
automatic rifles over the past two years 
police said sithole was found hanging from a shower pipe tuesday 
in his cell at john vorster square johannesburgs central police 
station the police said an investigation into the death had 
started and would include a post mortem by a state pathologist 
within a few hours of the police statement law and order 
minister adriaan vlok announced that de klerk had appointed an 
inquiry commission headed by a judge to investigate sitholes death 
neither vlok nor de klerk gave any indication whether the 
decision was related to the reported connection to the mandela 
family mandela 71 is widely expected to be freed within the next 
few weeks after more than 27 years in prison for his role in 
planning the start of the ancs guerrilla campaign 
audrey coleman a prominent human rights activist welcomed de 
klerks move saying she could not recall such a swift and emphatic 
response to any of the scores of other deaths of detainees which 
she has monitored in recent years 
she said sitholes family who suspected the young man had been 
mistreated would hire a pathologist of their own to conduct an 
independent post mortem thursday 
police said sithole had made a confession to a magistrate prior 
to his death implicating himself in several killings 
about 100 anc guerrillas and antiapartheid activists have died 
in police custody in the past 25 years according to police 
suicide by hanging has been the most common cause of these deaths 
but human rights groups have insisted that many of these prisoners 
had been mistreated by interrogators 
in announcing the arrests monday police headquarters said 
officers had seized an arms cache that included a sovietmade 
automatic rifle a revolver and 27 rounds of ammunition 
the african national congress was outlawed in 1960 and the next 
year began a bombing and sabotage campaign intended to undermine 
the whiteminority government 
the guerrilla campaign has slackened in the past two years with 
a marked decrease in the number of bombings in which civilians 
could be at risk during this period however black policemen have 
remained a frequent anc target 
police said in their daily unrest report today that a policeman 
was among three people killed in political violence in black 
townships around the port city of durban the report gave no 
details 
police headquarters confirmed that a prominent black activist 
peter mokaba had been detained last weekend under the internal 
security act which allows indefinite detention for interrogation 
purposes 
mokaba is a leader of the militant south african youth congress 
and a close associate of winnie mandela wife of jailed anc leader 
nelson mandela

president mikhail s gorbachev today denied a us 
broadcast report that he is considering resigning his post as 
communist party chief 
no one has said this and i certainly didnt make any such 
statement the soviet president and party general secretary said 
any such suggestions are groundless 
the cable news network reported tuesday quoting an unidentified 
party source that gorbachev had spent eight days holed up at his 
country house outside moscow with his top advisers where he was 
considering resigning his leaderhip of the party 
the source was quoted as saying gorbachev would have retained 
the presidency a government position he proposes to convert from a 
largely ceremonial post to a substantive one 
i have no intention of doing so gorbachev said when asked 
about the report during a photo session at the start of a kremlin 
meeting with presidentelect fernando collor de mello of brazil 
foreign ministry spokesman gennady i gerasimov speaking at a 
regular news briefing also denied the cnn report 
president bush today phoned gorbachev to discuss arms control 
and other issues asked if the two discussed the cnn report white 
house spokesman marlin fitzwater said the president said there 
was no direct discussion of that 
the official tass news agency said the two leaders discussed 
international affairs the situation in europe and arms control it 
did not say if bush asked gorbachev whether he intended to resign 
as party chief 
in a related discussion published in the communist party daily 
pravda four scholars urged that the presidency be strengthened to 
protect the head of state from efforts to oust him and allow him to 
act more decisively 
the discussion in pravda appeared aimed at telling readers that 
party power still is paramount and that the presidency is not 
strong enough to be the countrys main leadership post 
historian yevgeny ambartsumov said in pravda that gorbachev 
appeared unable to take decisive action because of the threat to 
his position 
the cnn report touched off a temporary flurry of selling on 
western stock markets and sent the dollar soaring in new york and 
japan 
secretary of state james a baker iii said he did not know how 
to respond to what he termed a rumor 
the ruling communist party has traditionally been the power base 
for soviet leaders however the party has been widely blamed for 
failing to solve the countrys dire economic crisis and reformist 
lawmakers are demanding that the communists give up their monopoly 
on power 
the presidency has become a more visible and substantive 
position in recent months still there is little question that the 
partys politburo and central committee retain the political power 
gorbachev told journalists he had just returned from the south 
apparently referring to his retreat on the black sea where he was 
preparing for next weeks meeting of the communist partys 
governing central committee which is planning a potential critical 
party congress for the fall 
the meeting comes at a time of political turmoil for gorbachev 
and the ruling communists the breakaway lithuanian communist party 
rejected gorbachevs efforts to bring it back within the fold and 
the president was forced to send troops into the warring southern 
republics of armenia and azerbaijan to restore order and crush an 
effort by azerbaijani nationalists to seize power in baku 
the rumor about gorbachevs stepping down was fed by an 
announcement that baker was again postponing by a day his scheduled 
twoday trip to moscow for talks with foreign minister eduard a 
shevardnadze and almost certainly gorbachev as well initially 
baker was to go to moscow on feb 6 on tuesday the state 
department said it had suggested the visit begin on feb 8 
shevardnadze told the associated press in an interview last week 
there is widespread concern in the west that gorbachev may not 
survive politically but he attributed it more to a desire that 
gorbachevs reforms succeed than to any real threat to the soviet 
leaders political power 
i believe that this particular preoccupation stems from 
sincere feelings from sincere support for the process of 
perestroika that is under way in the soviet union shevardnadze 
said he was the one who spearheaded this arduous but holy 
struggle 
baker asked about the rumor on tuesday told reporters were 
following the story as i know you are and well have a comment if 
we ever determine its something more than just a rumor 
baker said american diplomats in moscow know just about the 
same thing that all the rest of us know right now that theres a 
rumor out there to this effect and thats all we know 
white house chief of staff john sununu told reporters tuesday 
that the administration has been trying for the last few hours to 
try and get some additional assessments but i dont have anything 
at all

defense minister yitzhak rabin today ordered a 
temporary halt to the expulsion of palestinians living in the 
occupied territories without residency permits a practice that has 
torn apart hundreds of families 
the announcement which cited humanitarian reasons came a day 
after the us state department expressed concern over the 
expulsions 
palestinian activists claim the expulsions have been stepped up 
and are part of a longterm strategy to force palestinians out of 
the occupied west bank and gaza strip where the palestinian 
uprising against israeli authority has claimed hundreds of lives 
over the last 26 months 
israeli officials deny the claim 
according to an army official 251 palestinians including 88 
women and 78 children were expelled from the occupied lands in the 
past year because they did not have residency permits 
the official did not have figures for preceding years 
rabin told reporters today he decided to stop expulsions and 
review the policy to prevent a case in which half a family will 
be forced out while another part will be allowed to stay 
he indicated however that expulsions would resume we cannot 
afford in principle that a person who comes as a tourist or as a 
visitor takes the liberty to stay forever he said 
the armyrun government in the occupied lands has adopted 
stringent residency regulations under which only palestinians who 
lived in the occupied lands during a september 1967 census are 
automatically eligible for permits 
others must apply for permits and the vast majority of 
applications are turned down 
rabin told parliament tuesday that since 1967 military 
officials have received 88429 requests for family 
reunification and that 13509 of those were granted 
the group most affected is palestinian women whose families fled 
to jordan when israel seized the west bank and gaza in the 1967 
middle east war and who later married men from the occupied lands 
inevitably these women and their children become part of the 
demographic war between israel and the palestinians 
some palestinians see increasing their numbers as a way to give 
weight to their argument for statehood at the same time israel 
wants to limit the number of arabs under its control 
wives denied residency permits usually enter the occupied lands 
on threemonth visitor visas and then face the choice of leaving 
their families and returning to jordan or staying illegally 
palestinian human rights groups have said that in the past few 
months soldiers have raided several remote west bank villages to 
round up illegal residents placed them in taxis and escorted them 
to the allenby bridge which links jordan and the west bank 
the expulsions universally take place in the middle of the 
night with no immediate warning wrote the palestinian news 
service sanabel which published details of several cases 
rabins announcement of freezing the expulsions came after 
statement department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler said tuesday 
that israeli officials are well aware of our concern 
particularly with regard to divided families 
the swift israeli response came at a time when usisraeli 
relations are strained over differences on how to make peace with 
palestinians and when some american politicians are urging cuts in 
aid to the jewish state 
also today arab activists stabbed to death a palestinian 
suspect of collaborating with israel and israeli soldiers shot and 
wounded three palestinians in the occupied territories arab 
reports said 
a strike ordered by the plolinked underground leadership of the 
uprising brought transportation to a halt and kept students out of 
school 
the death of 35yearold adwa aziz el masri a taxi driver 
brought to 175 the number of palestinians killed after being 
accused of collaborating with israel at least 651 palestinians 
have died of israeli gunfire during the rebellion and 43 israelis 
have been slain

the government today accused pakistan of 
encouraging terrorism and subversion in kashmir where indian 
security forces are trying to put down a moslem rebellion 
pakistans foreign minister sahabzada yaqub khan on tuesday 
accused india of trying to supress the freedom movement in 
kashmir through atrocities khans speech was broadcast by 
national radio and television 
an indian foreign ministry spokesman aftab seth said khans 
statements were deliberately fallacious and amounted to 
direct incitement to subversion violence and terrorist activties 
in a part of india 
the indian government faces a violent islamic separatist 
movement in kashmir that has grown more strident in the past two 
months in an effort to end the rebellion indian troops and police 
launched a crackdown jan 20 
at least 72 people most of them moslem protesters shot by 
indian security forces were killed in kashmir between jan 20 and 
jan 25 according to figures compiled from government spokesmen 
police sources and witnesses the government says there have been 
no deaths since jan 25 
khan had claimed in his speech that thousands of kashmiris were 
being detained and hundreds have died in the crackdown 
india has often accused pakistan of aiding the militants in 
order to annex the kashmir valley a predominantly moslem region 
sandwiched between northwestern india and northeastern pakistan 
india and pakistan fought wars in 1965 and 1971 over border 
disputes in the region 
pakistan denies helping the militants but says it supports 
kashmiri separatism calling it a movement for selfdetermination 
seth said khans speech indicated that his government persists 
in its efforts to involve itself in our internal affairs we would 
like to firmly reiterate that kashmir is and will continue to be an 
integral part of india 
a portion of kashmir has been under dispute since 1947 when 
india and pakistan were partitioned on gaining independence from 
britain india controls most of the mountainous region and 
pakistan occupies a smaller sector 
seth said the only issue that remains to be resolved in 
kashmir is the vacation by pakistan of territory illegally occupied 
by it he said khans efforts to justify pakistani policies will 
fuel tension in kashmir 
kashmiri separatists who earlier demanded union of kashmir with 
pakistan now demand independence and the formation of a neutral 
country

older people who take one variety of commonly used 
blood pressure pills called diuretics may reduce their risk of hip 
fractures by onethird according to a study 
the study found that people over 65 who used the type of 
diuretics known as thiazides appeared to suffer significantly fewer 
broken hips than nonusers 
they said that if the medicines work the way they believe 
21600 hip fractures might be avoided annually if all older 
americans took the medicine 
however they cautioned that more study will be needed before 
the drugs could be prescribed solely to prevent fractures they 
said experts will have to be sure that the benefits of this 
treatment outweigh the potential hazards 
experts long have known that thiazides can prevent the body from 
losing calcium however the medicines also can have unwanted side 
effects including potassium deficiency and high cholesterol 
the study directed by dr andrea z lacroix of the group health 
cooperative of puget sound was published in thursdays new england 
journal of medicine 
the study was based on a fouryear followup of 9518 men and 
women who lived in boston new haven conn and rural iowa when 
the study began about onequarter of them were taking thiazide 
diuretics for high blood pressure

as thousands enjoyed their first big macs from 
moscows new mcdonalds dozens of others stood at tiny tables in a 
dim dingy cafeteria a few blocks away wednesday and ate the 
standard fare of meat and potatoes 
but for all its problems the popular zelyeny ogonyok a snack 
bar on pushkin street does have a few things mcdonalds doesnt 
low prices experienced workers and a solid reputation

predominant clientele of taxi drivers is reputed to be one of 
moscows best snack shops with good food and service it even has 
its own golden arches of sorts cylindrical signs outside painted 
gold and green 
but the decor and ambiance leave something to be desired 
theres no place to hang a coat or hat so diners must wear them 
theres no place to sit so they must stand the small chandeliers 
are so weak customers can barely see what theyre eating which 
may be a good thing 
a popular main dish wednesday was a large meatball served cold

the cheapest was a piece of russian black bread for 1 kopeck 
elderly women in white smocks and caps scurried around clearing

there were few smiles or greetings that are musts for mcdonalds 
employees but customers with good eyesight could make out

alexei and several workers of zelyeny ogonyok said they had 
heard reports about the new mcdonalds which has gotten a big dose

the clarionledger jackson miss on bushs budget 
president bushs budget is sure to get reworked by congress and 
one area that can be targeted is reducing the nations military 
expenditures overseas 
for example cia director william webster has told congress the 
intelligence agency concludes that the soviet threat to the united 
states and its nato allies has diminished due to the democratizing 
changes in eastern europe 
that echoed remarks by gen colin powell chairman of the us 
joint chiefs of staff after an unprecedented meeting in vienna of 
western and warsaw pact top military brass he said there is 
nothing sacrosanct about the number of american troops stationed in 
europe 
czechoslovakia and hungary already have said they want soviet 
troops off their soil this year east germany has proposed that all 
foreign troops leave both germanys by 1999 and soviet leader 
mikhail gorbachev has already said it is his goal to pull all 
soviet troops off foreign soil 
savings from further trimming the overseas military budget could 
be used in reducing the federal deficit we now have a chance to 
start turning some spears into plowshares to make america even 
stronger

los angeles times on bushs budget 
if nothing else president bushs budget should stifle the 
notion that talk is cheap it mentions by name one serious problem 
after another yet makes clear that most of them will be around 
long after washington spends the allotted 123 trillion 
the white house has doctored forecasts of economic growth and 
interest rates to make it seem as if the deficit will shrink from 
100 billion to a mere 64 billion economists generally think that 
the national debt could well grow by as much as bush promises it 
will shrink leaving the worlds most prosperous nation still 
living way beyond its means 
the president again puts politics and a campaign promise ahead 
of smart policy and rules out even minimal increases in taxes that 
could get government out of the red congress may fuss at bush for 
capricious bookkeeping but it knows as well as he that voters are 
less likely to punish politicians for higher deficits than for 
higher taxes 
even in the absence of new taxes congress and the white house 
will find ways to keep busy bushs proposal to shut down 35 
military bases each of them in the home district of some member of 
congress is bound to provide weeks or even months of argument over 
whether closing some other base would yield greater savings 
congress probably will cut the 45 billion the white house wants 
for star wars research fight to spare domestic programs bush 
would fold and quarrel over the proper level of environmental 
protection 
but these are the ragged edges of governments obligations 
compared with the challenges of the national debt the future of 
social security rising healthcare costs education cleaning up 
nuclear waste and other gathering storms

the pioneer bemidji minn on social security 
the debate over the use of excess social security funds is an 
interesting dilemma for policy makers and one that the bush 
administration is going to lose in the national public opinion 
polls 
most people werent aware until recently that the social 
security account has been showing a positive balance ever since the 
program was reengineered by congress 
the fund balance has been invested in us treasury notes 
savings bonds and other types of government investment programs 
and as a result the federal deficit has been reduced by almost 1 
billion a week over the past year thats a 50 billion reduction 
in the trade deficit 
opponents are saying that the funds should stay in the social 
security trust fund what these individuals fail to understand is 
that these funds are ultimately better being invested rather than 
laying dormant 
however we also feel that if investments are to be made there 
are far better choices than government securities private programs 
are administered for much higher returns

two house subcommittees today endorsed 
legislation supporting a plan by the major powers aimed at ending 
the fighting in cambodia with united nations peacekeepers and 
administrators 
this represents the last best chance for peaceful settlement 
of the cambodian conflict said rep stephen solarz dny 
sponsor of a resolution supporting the plan 
solarz house subcommittee on asian and pacific affairs and the 
subcommittee on human rights approved the resolution with unanimous 
voice votes and sent it to the full foreign affairs committee 
failure to implement the formula by the five permanent security 
council members to strengthen the un presence in cambodia could 
produce results almost too awful to contemplate return of the 
khmer rouge blamed for more than a million cambodian deaths 
during their 197578 rule over the southeast asian country solarz 
said 
anything less than a strong international presence could pave 
the way for a return to power of the genocidal pol pot leader of 
the khmer rouge said human rights subcommittee chairman gus 
yatron dpa 
yatron also urged that the administration and congress prepare 
to contribute to new un peacekeeping costs president bushs 1991 
budget presented to congress this week provides for full payment of 
unpaid dues to the un 
the resolution backs the cambodian peace formula developed by 
the five permanent un security council members in paris in 
midjanuary along lines earlier proposed by australia it says 
china the soviet union and vietnam can improve relations with the 
united states by cooperating in support of the plan 
the five permanent security council members are the united 
states soviet union china britain and france 
the draft declared that soviet support for the concept of a 
unsupervised interim administration for cambodia and its active 
cooperation in facilitating an agreement will constitute new 
progress in ussoviet efforts to resolve regional conflicts by 
political means 
it added that chinese support and cooperation will help to 
make possible a significant improvement in uschina relations 
which soured especially at the congressional level after 
beijings crackdown last summer against the prodemocracy movement 
with the same promise of improved relations the resolution 
invited cooperation from vietnam which last september declared an 
end to its 11year occupation of cambodia and has been seeking 
normal diplomatic relations and trade with the united states 
the soviet union has backed vietnam and the vietnameseinstalled 
cambodian government in phonm penh that is not recognized by the 
united states western countries or asean the association of 
southeast asian nations 
china long backed the communist khmer rouge blamed for more 
than 1 million cambodian deaths during their 197578 rule over 
cambodia and now threatening a comeback in a revived escalating 
civil war within cambodia

central maine morning sentinel waterville maine on drug abuse 
the probable political demise of washington mayor marion s 
barry jr carries with it more than a lesson about the consequences 
a public official faces when he or she does not live by the law 
barrys arrest on cocaine charges and his subsequent public 
confession also demonstrates the hold drugs can have over an 
otherwise intelligent and rational person 
drug addiction is nothing new of course indeed by many 
reports barrys more serious problem is alcoholism a disease that 
has brought about the downfall of countless people over the decades 
and even centuries but in us society today no drug carries a 
heavier social stigma than crack cocaine and few cities are more 
quickly linked to crack than barrys own washington 
for that halfhour high barry risked a long and illustrious 
career he knew that drug use was suspected by police political 
foes and the press yet barry chose to risk the personal tragedy we 
have all witnessed for the brief euphoria that crack brings 
that is the drugs power it is no wonder that so many people 
who have less to risk who see little hope for prosperity or 
success or fame turn to cocaine for relief

the milwaukee journal on a homeless shelter across from 
watergate 
egads that word encapsulates the reaction of many condo owners 
at the posh watergate in washington dc to a planned homeless 
shelter across the street 
the area is already riddled with opportunists who sit on 
grates and ask passing motorists for money griped one homeowner 
these are the people wed like to get rid of 
the owners have filed suit claiming the shelter will lower 
their hefty property values the apartments range in price from 
179000 to nearly 27 million 
actually such juxtaposition of luxury and hardship has much to 
recommend it 
it better enables the wellheeled to face up to the fact of 
poverty which often results from public policy they may have 
supported or even helped shape as they peer into the spartan 
quarters from their ritzy pads perhaps they will learn that 
driving away poverty pays more than driving away the poor

gun makers are shooting holes in the bush administrations ban 
on imports of semiautomatic assault rifles 
not only does the administration allow such rifles made by us 
manufacturers to continue to be sold but foreign companies are 
increasing exports of militarystyle assault pistols to the united 
states 
at least five types of semiautomatic assault pistols are being 
imported 
in a petition to the government to extend the ban to assault 
pistols handgun control inc said in fact because 
semiautomatic pistols have similar firepower but are more 
concealable than their assault rifle conterparts they present an 
even greater danger to public safety 
thats a loophole that ought to be closed

the providence ri sunday journal on eastern europe 
western politicians and journalists sometimes talk as if the 
revolutions in eastern europe had been won to put it politely 
their celebrations are premature 
there are at least three preconditions for the success of 
democracy in the soviet unions erstwhile satellites free 
elections the ouster of communists from control of the security 
apparatus and the departure of soviet troops none of these 
developments has occurred 
there is a good chance that something like free elections will 
be held but the other two factors make the durability of any 
postelection democratic governments problematical

philadelphia daily news on bush and china 
president bush calls the craven senate decision to let his 
craven china position stand a mandate 
it is no such thing it is merely proof that republicans can be 
just as cowardly as democrats when a vote on principle comes up 
as republican minority leader robert dole put it its not 
china policy its american politics 
bush happily accepts the underserved mantle of hero for invading 
a thirdrate satellite but continues to grovel at the feet of 
elderly chinese murderers 
in a nonpolitical context this would correctly be called 
cowardice

wrong said nohea lani wallace an instructor at the center for

mahalo frequently appears on trash cans in hawaii it means 
thank you to encourage people not to litter 
that wasnt nearly as funny as the mistake made on a banner 
outside the san jose public library in california the banner 
which cost 10000 and took three months to finish was supposed to 
say welcome in 27 languages it did in 24 but welcome was 
misspelled in swedish dutch and tagalog the chief native language

president bushs state of the union 
speechwriters had a hard act to follow matching nuggets once 
provided by wordsmith peggy noonan who coined a thousand points 
of light and read my lips but who now suggests her job was 
neither kind nor gentle 
noonan has been out of favor at the white house since she left 
last year to write a book about her days as a speechwriter for both 
bush and former president reagan 
she says aides to both men continually pounced on her words and 
sought to do major overhauls on her speeches that bush balked at 
reading any lines that contained the word i and that reagan 
the great communicator was at a loss for words when she asked 
what moved him in his eight years as president 
white house officials say noonan who lives in new york has not 
been asked to work on a bush speech since last years inaugural 
address because of a new policy to do all speeches in house 
aides privately say that noonan was getting a trifle too famous 
for a speechwriter who is supposed to be well mostly anonymous 
but they also concede bush hasnt sounded quite so striking since 
she stopped putting words in his mouth 
the underpinnings of the united states the state of the 
union is not bad bush told a group of newspaper publishers last 
week when asked to preview his wednesday night address 
not bad might be an honest assessment but it doesnt have 
much ring 
in bushs 1989 inaugural address he spoke of a new breeze 
blowing through the totalitarian world he promised democratic 
leaders an age of the offered hand and he summed up the 
nations budget woes in six words we have more will than 
wallet 
vintage noonan and the last speech she wrote for him 
noonan recounts her experiences as a speechwriter for bush and 
reagan in her book what i saw at the revolution a political 
life in the reagan era published last week 
bush has made no secret of his disdain for insider books written 
by former aides and the publication of noonans book hardly helped 
to heal any rift between her and the white house 
when she began writing speeches for bush in the 1988 campaign 
noonan writes he gave her a list of words with special meaning to 
him family grandkids love decency honor pride tolerance 
hope kindness loyalty freedom caring heart faith service to 
country fair fair play strength healing excellence 
from those threads she began weaving bushs speeches but she 
ran up against one major obstacle george bush hated to say i 
i became adept at pronounless sentences noonan says 
instead of i moved to texas and soon we joined the republican 
party it was moved to texas joined the republican party raised 
a family 
noonan suggests bushs modesty came from his doughty old 
mom dorothy walker bush who used to rap his knuckles for 
bragging a brag apparently being defined as any sentence with the 
first person singular as its subject 
she confesses visions of bush taking the oath on the capitol 
steps with these words do solemnly swear will preserve and 
protect 
bushs characterization of a kinder gentler nation 
contained in his acceptance speech to the republican national 
convention has become one of the presidents signature phrases 
but noonan writes it was just kinder nation in her first 
draft she later scribbled in gentler 
bushs no new taxes line also in the same widely acclaimed 
acceptance speech was suggested by jack kemp now the secretary of 
housing and urban development noonan says 
but she takes all the credit for read my lips even though 
bush aides tried to take it out because there is no history of 
presidential candidates making personalorgan references in 
acceptance speeches 
bush left it in one line he scratched out a reference to 
michael dukakis physical stature 
noonan claims credit for bushs thousand points of light 
but allows it might have been influenced by a line from a favorite 
author thomas wolfe who wrote in the web and the rock of a 
thousand points of friendly light 
noonan who also wrote reagans farewell television speech to 
the nation says she had trouble drawing out the great 
communicator in five drafting sessions she had with him in the 
last two months of his term 
when she asked him what his most difficult day was reagan 
responded oh well i dont know 
she then asked reagan if he sometimes felt like the boy in the 
bubble 
who was that noonan says he asked 
the boy who had no immune system so he had to live in a 
plastic bubble where he could see everyone and they could see him 
but he couldnt touch them she tells him 
reagans reply well no 
bushs white house now has five speechwriters mark davis mark 
lange daniel mcgroaty edward e mcnally and curt smith who make 
a point of maintaining low profiles refuse to be interviewed and 
arent even well known to other white house staffers 
mcgroaty 32 who was a speechwriter for defense secretaries 
caspar w weinberger and frank c carlucci did the initial draft 
of wednesdays state of the union address 
it was refined by chief of staff john sununu and white house

pope john paul iis tour of 
impoverished sahel nations this week bypassed this city which is 
home to the newly built and largest roman catholic basilica in the 
world 
ivorian president felix houphouetboigny donated the basilica to 
the roman catholic church and met with john paul last year to urge 
him to consecrate it during his current african trip 
the governmentcontrolled news media has waged a campaign to win 
support from roman catholics who comprise 15 percent of the west 
african nations population for the basilica the president has 
been shown attending roman catholic events and praising the pope 
but the basilica has been criticized as a waste of resources in 
a country suffering from shortages of basic medicines crowded 
classrooms and an economy reeling from depressed prices for its 
agricultural exports 
houphouetboigny defends construction of the basilica which 
officially cost about 130 million saying he built it with his own 
funds independent assessments put the cost at possibly twice that 
amount and the use of government departments in construction makes 
an accurate estimate difficult 
vatican spokesman joaquin navarro defended the popes decision 
not to consecrate the ivorian basilica 
the pope cannot consecrate every basilica in the world every 
year he gets thousands of invitations and he cannot satisfy 
everyone navarro said last month 
the basilica with airconditioned pews has seven acres of 
italian marble tiles and four times more stained glass than the 
french cathedral at chartres it is designed to hold 300000 and 
dwarfs other structures in the presidents native village which he 
has declared the national capital 
a papal visit would have been a sharp constrast to the 
desperately poor villages he visited an hours jet ride to the 
north in burkina faso and mali 
meanwhile the basilica completed in september awaits 
consecration 
the governmentpublished daily fraternite matin reported last 
week that the roman catholic episcopate will report on the basilica 
to the pope later this year the newspaper said the pope will 
include ivory coast on a trip to africa planned for later this 
year but it did not say if he would consecrate the basilica 
the episcopate has agreed to accept the basilica but diplomatic 
sources said that in addition to the question of propriety the 
church was concerned about the millions of dollars it would cost 
annually for maintenance even if houphouetboigny 84 is prepared 
to pay these costs the question was whether future governments 
would honor such a commitment

a judge today ordered the eviction of a 
72yearold woman who has been living for nearly 20 years in a 
ramshackle homestead on the proposed site of a state park 
doris gagnon was granted an automatic 20day stay and superior 
court judge judge karen sequino said it is likely the woman will be 
found eligible for a stay of up to nine months 
i am sorry our system is this way and our average citizen 
cannot get justice gagnon said after her defeat 
during a hearing tuesday gagnon said she preferred to live with 
dozens of animals at her makeshift home on state property than move 
to senior citizen housing im not a bingo player i cant sit 
around all day she said 
state attorneys had said gagnon and her neighbors in the city of 
milford would be better off if she were evicted from the site where 
she has lived without electricity running water a phone and 
adequate sanitation 
gagnon has been fighting the state ever since the mid1960s 
when efforts began to establish a park on the 200acre site along 
long island sound her cottage was demolished in 1971 but she 
refused to leave the area living out of her car for a year before 
erecting a tin shed 
for the past decade she has lived in dilapidated trailers and 
makeshift structures along with a menagerie that now includes three 
cats three dogs two geese 12 ducks and about 50 chickens 
the state moved to evict gagnon last year as a result of a 
complaint filed by the milford health department which said it 
found bags of human sewage piled up behind her living quarters 
gagnons attorney karen torre said she planned to ask the 
judge to give her client who has been battling cancer at least 
three more years on the land 
although a 5 million project to seal a landfill in the northern 
section of the proposed park and create an access road is scheduled 
to get under way next month further development of the park so 
that it can be used for recreational purposes is still two to three 
years away state officials have said 
gagnon who sported an enjoy your age button on her 
shortsleeve whiteandblue sweater told the court tuesday she 
could not leave her animals 
when the city was doing things to me they were my only 
consolation outside of my friends she said 
she denied having regularly dumped bags of sewage outside her 
trailers but gagnon also testified that she had never had the 
sewage tanks in her trailers cleaned out and a witness recalled 
her saying she dumped all the waste in a garbage bin

president carlos andres perez was 
elected by a landslide but has angered nearly everyone during his 
first year with economic reforms that provoked bloody riots and 
drove up the cost of living 
many foreign dignitaries attended his lavish inauguration feb 
2 1989 including president fidel castro of cuba prime minister 
felipe gonzalez of spain and vice president dan quayle of the 
united states 
his victory reflected the popularity gained in his first term as 
president in 197479 the approval evaporated when perez imposed 
the austerity demanded by foreign lenders in return for help with 
venezuelas debt of 33 billion 
a week of riots against price increases for food and public 
transport cost 300 lives thousands of people were injured and 
thousands of businesses set afire 
perez now faces severe criticism from just about every sector of 
venezuelan politics including leaders of his own social democratic 
party democratic action 
his hearts not in it an american businessman said 
privately ive been amazed to see him carry out these reforms 
against all the odds 
a new round of criticism began when perez said new increases 
were planned in the price of gasoline produced by stateowned oil 
conglomerate petroleos de venezuela 
venezuela is a major oil producers and its gasoline prices have 
been among the lowest in the world even after last years 
increases a gallon of regular costs the equivalent of only 13 
cents 
when reporters asked perez recently whether he would go ahead 
with new increases despite protests he responded 
my god if were up to me i would dissolve our agreements with 
the international monetary fund but we live in the western world 
and in order to live in the western world and get agreements with 
western banks we have to do certain things 
the imf world bank and other lenders agreed to provide 8 
billion to 10 billion over five years to support the economic 
reform program and help venezuela pay its foreign debt 
reforms include ending gasoline and other subsidied tariff 
reforms aimed at increasing both imports and exports making state 
enterprises more efficient and other freemarket measures 
a recent poll conducted by the newspaper el universal indicated 
55 percent of venezuelans favored a return to the old system of 
subsidized prices and economic regulation while only 28 percent 
approved of the reforms 
of those polled 32 percent said perez was doing an average job 
217 percent said his performance was poor and 18 percent found his 
conduct of the presidency to be good fifteen percent rated him 
very bad 65 percent very good rating 
the us businessman said perez is doing very well the steps 
hes taken so far show hes willing to hold out against the 
opposition even in his own party to his economic program 
nearly everyone has been effected by changes that have shrunk 
the economy by 81 percent and pushed inflation to a record 807 
percent in 1989 
poverty and unemployment have increased labor leaders claim the 
unempoloyment rate is 20 percent more than double the official 
figure 
my balance of the year is totally negative said cesar 
olarte head of the confederation of venezuelan workers perez 
promised growth without inflation and look what weve got 
inflation and recession 
his organization long an ally of governments that have employed 
onequarter of the nations 6 million workers recently decided to 
step up protests of the economic program 
olarte said the austerity plan has only brought misery and 
suffering it has to be stopped or at least implemented more 
gradually perez is being insensitive he should know as a 
politician to listen to the people instead of his advisers 
democracy could be in danger 
in contrast tomas paez planning director of the development 
ministry said critical poverty and unemployment are nothing new 
in venezuela they are not the product of the reforms but the 
other way around 
the reforms are trying to change an industrial system that was 
inefficient could not compete depended on government protection 
and only generated 5000 jobs a year 
economists say it will take two to five years for the reform 
program to start benefiting the average venezuelan

a panel of experts is recommending that the 
antiaids drug azt be prescribed more widely for people in early 
stages of infection by the virus that causes aids 
research has clearly established that azt or zidovudine 
delays the onset of aids in people infected with the human 
immunodeficiency virus or hiv the food and drug administration 
advisory committee said tuesday 
but the committee also emphasized the need to carefully study 
and document the potential risks associated with prolonged 
zidovudine therapy especially those related to the drugs 
cancercausing potential and any possible unique effects on 
womens fetuses and children 
azt is approved for use in patients who have fullblown aids 
but a governmentsponsored study has shown the drug can prolong the 
lives of people in earlier stages of the disease 
some physicians already prescribe the drug for people with early 
or no symptoms of aids 
last august officials at the national institute of allergy and 
infectious diseases announced that clinical trials showed azt 
significantly slows progression of aids in patients with early 
symptoms and no symptoms the results were so promising that of 
officials stopped the clinical trial and began offering azt to all 
patients in the study including those who had been receiving 
placebos for comparison 
the antiviral drugs advisory committee unanimously agreed the 
fda should recommend use of azt in people with levels of critical 
immune system cells called t4 cells under 500 per cubic 
millimeter 
the drug is now recommended for use in people whose t4 cells 
are below 200 disease in such patients is considered to be in an 
advanced stage and many such patients have fullblown aids 
azt made by burroughs wellcome co is the only fdaapproved 
drug that combats the aids virus directly it is being used by more 
than 40000 people in the united states 
as many as 500000 of the estimated 800000 to 13 million 
people in the united states infected with hiv the virus that 
causes aids are believed to have t4 cell counts between 200 and 
500 according to the public health service however many of these 
people do not know they are infected with hiv 
two weeks ago the fda cut in half the recommended dose of azt 
for aids patients who are on the medication for more than a month 
the agency cited studies showing the halfdose regimen was less 
likely to produce side effects but just as effective as the higher 
dose in prolonging survival and reducing the frequency of 
infections that often kill

a relief agency said it plans to increase 
food deliveries thursday to the beleaguered southern sudan town of 
juba where civilians are reported starving while war rages around 
them 
the lutheran world federations office in nairobi said it would 
add a chartered hercules c130 to the boeing 707 it already leases 
from sudan airways for the relief flights 
what it means is that we will be able to deliver food there 
daily without interruption said bob koepp who is in charge of 
the lutheran groups activities in southern sudan 
koepp said wednesday the addition of the hercules will bring to 
64 tons the amount of food being delivered daily to juba by the 
group 
koepp said the hercules would hasten the delivery of 2000 tons 
of corn donated by the italian government that has been sitting at 
nairobis airport 
the sudanese government banned relief flights into southern 
sudan on nov 3 after a ceasefire with the rebels broke down and 
jubas only source of food since then has been the flights from the 
lutheran world federation 
koepp appealed to rebel and government forces to please 
respect and allow the aircraft and its crews free and safe 
passage 
but the rebel sudan peoples liberation army which has 
sporadically bombarded juba with artillery fire was noncommittal 
this is the first time i have heard of the additional 
aircraft said lam akol a rebel spokesman in any case they 
go in at their own risk 
only the lutherans have delivered nonsudanese government food 
supplies to juba since sudans government banned relief flights 
nov 3 after an informal ceasefire with the rebels broke down 
relief workers evacuated from juba this week described a city of 
panic they said thousands of people are starving but cannot leave 
the city of 300000 because it is ringed with mines laid by 
government troops and the rebels 
the mines have weekly claimed the lives of people searching 
for firewood andor food says an american catholic priest in a 
letter to colleagues in nairobi and washington dc 
the clergyman the rev todd riebe of indianapolis is a high 
school principal in juba and has opted to stay he appealed for 
international pressure to halt the impending massacre of jubas 
people 
we are facing a human tragedy of immense proportions riebe 
wrote in the letter which was made available to the associated 
press 
the sudan peoples liberation army launched its rebellion in 
early 1983 demanding greater autonomy and economic reforms in the 
three southern provinces of bahr elghazal upper nile and 
equatoria

a coalition of church labor and policy groups 
launched a nationwide education effort wednesday to ensure that 
more than 11 million lowincome families receive a tax rebate for 
which they are eligible 
its a crime to think that this money is available and so many 
people are not taking advantage of it and they have earned it 
said james moran mayor of alexandria va 
most lowincome people know about medicaid public assistance 
food stamps school lunch and other government programs for the 
poor but significantly fewer have heard of the earned income 
credit said robert greenstein director of the center on budget 
and policy priorities an independent research group 
this is not a public assistance program its not a welfare 
program greenstein said it is an earned benefit that only 
families which work are eligible for and only families who live 
with and care for their children may receive 
the earned income tax credit was created by congress in 1974 to 
offset the impact of social security payroll taxes on the working 
poor families with at least one child living at home for half the 
year and earned or adjusted gross income of less than 19340 in 
1989 are eligible 
organizers didnt estimate how many families are eligible for 
the credit but said 11 million taxpayers received 6 billion in 
credits last year 
the groups planned to distribute 11000 information packets 
through churches civic groups and state and local government 
offices the aflcio also has produced a public service 
announcement in spanish 
the credit varies with individual households with annual income 
of between 6500 and 10240 a parent taxpayer is eligible for a 
910 credit families with income less than 6500 are eligible for 
a credit equal to 14 percent of that incoe 
the credit decreases once income exceeds 10240 and phases out 
at 19340 earned or adjusted gross income 
rural and hispanic families who make up a disproportionate 
number of lowincome wage earners and dont owe income tax will be 
a special target for the campaign 
the concern is that these families owing no federal income 
tax may believe that theres no need to file an income tax 
return greenstein said 
they may think that if they dont owe any income tax they 
cant get credit but the irs will mail them a check for the full 
amount of the credit for which they are eligible 
if they dont file the return they lose the credit greenstein 
said 
eligible workers can receive the credit in their regular 
paychecks throughout the year by filing a w5 form with their 
employers 
other groups in the coalition include the national council of la 
raza us catholic conference the national governors 
association the united way and the national restaurant association 
coalition members said they chose wednesday to begin their 
campaign because it marked the unofficial start of the 1989 income 
tax season and the last day for employers to mail w2 income 
withholding statements to workers

west german leaders on wednesday praised 
president mikhail s gorbachevs apparent acceptance of 
reunification as a signal that may instill hope in east germans 
fearful of the uncertainties of reform 
chancellor helmut kohl called the kremlin chiefs latest 
comments on german unity encouraging and foreign minister 
hansdietrich genscher said gorbachev had correctly analyzed 
the volatile situation in east germany 
east germanys official news agency adn said that by making 
clear his change of mind on the german question gorbachev once 
more confirmed for all the world his reputation as a politician of 
realism 
support for union with prosperous west germany has surged among 
east germans in recent weeks as the depths of their political and 
economic crises have become clear 
east german premier hans modrow acknowledged in a speech to 
parliament this week that the nation was on the verge of economic 
collapse and said mounting tensions forced him to move up free 
elections to march 18 
as many as 2500 east germans have been leaving each day 
convinced that they stand a better chance starting over in the west 
than trying to rebuild their nation driven to the brink of 
destruction by 40 years of communist mismanagement 
anticommunist sentiment has swelled among the population of 16 
million sparking mass demonstrations and labor strikes to protest 
the distrusted partys continued hold on the reins of power 
a lutheran pastor gave refuge to former leader erich honecker 
after he was released from prison tuesday and church officials 
reported wednesday that their humanitarian action prompted 
insulting phone calls and threats by parishioners to leave the 
church 
honecker who ruled for 18 years before being forced out of 
office in october by the peaceful prodemocracy uprising faces 
trial in march on a treason charge 
modrow a reformer who is more trusted than most of his fellow 
communists was forced by the growing hostility toward his 
stilldominant party to bring nine opposition representatives into 
his cabinet 
the prodemocracy forces joining modrow were to submit their 
proposed ministers by wednesday and three of the parties publicly 
announced the names of the representatives they put forward 
the social democrats who were hesitant to enter into a 
coalition with the political parties blamed for east germanys 
current crises nominated walter romberg who has not played a 
prominent role in the party to date the initiative for peace and 
human rights proposed gerd poppe and democracy now offered wolfgang 
ullmann poppe and ullmann are negotiators for their respective 
groups at the weekly talks that advise modrows interim government 
in bonn kohl devoted much of his address at a cabinet meeting 
to the issue of german unity and the exodus of east germans that is 
inflicting social and economic strains on both sides of the border 
government spokesman hans klein a member of the west german 
cabinet said kohl found gorbachevs views on reunification 
encouraging 
gorbachev commented during talks with modrow in moscow on 
tuesday that a single german state was likely in the future 
although he cautioned that east germans should not decide this 
important issue on the streets 
weekly prodemocracy rallies in leipzig and other major cities 
have taken on a clear proreunification atmosphere recently 
west german newspapers reported gorbachevs comments prominently 
and hailed his apparent acceptance of german reunification as 
coming to grips with reality 
gorbachev has once again shown himself to be a politician of 
realism who has correctly analyzed the developments in east germany 
and the will of the people genscher told west german radio 
klein quoted kohl as telling his cabinet that gorbachevs 
tentative approval of eventual reunification could give east 
germans hope of better days to come and halt the exodus 
we want all people in east germany to find their opportunities 
in life in their own land kohl said according to klein 
resettlement must be left as a last resort jobs and homes are in 
limited supply in west germany 
the west german constitution recognizes all ethnic germans as 
citizens and provides them with generous resettlement aid when they 
immigrate 
but the influx of more than 340000 east germans last year and 
an exit trend that threatens to drive a million more to the west 
this year has heightened social tensions in west germany 
kohl suggested gorbachev had eased the fears of east germans by 
making clear that the kremlin would not stand in the way of 
reunification

the governments main economic forecasting 
gauge rose in december at its fastest pace in eight months the 
government said wednesday but analysts suggested the economy 
remains weak athough able to avoid a recession 
the commerce department said the index of leading economic 
indicators rose 08 percent last month helping to inch the 
forecasting gauge up 04 percent for the year it was the weakest 
increase since the index actually fell 15 percent in 1984 
and since the index rose just 04 percent for the year compared 
with an increase of 39 percent for all of 1988 it suggests the 
economy could be more sluggish this year than in 1989 the index is 
designed to forecast economic activity six to nine months in the 
future 
the leading indicators were essentially flat for most of 
1989 noted kevin logan chief economist for the swiss bank corp 
in new york they basically moved sideways and thats the 
situation for the economy at the moment 
david berson chief economist for the federal national mortgage 
association had a similar assessment saying the december increase 
really overstates the economys strength over the near term the 
next 6 to 12 months 
michael boskin chairman of the presidents council of economic 
advisers also cautioned against reading too much into one months 
change although he said the administration believes the economy 
will be improving through the year 
boskin spoke to reporters after an appearance before the house 
budget committee in which he defended the administrations economic 
forecast for 1990 which projects the overall economy will grow by 
24 percent while interest rates will come down a projection 
questioned by many private economists 
in another report the department said new home sales pinched 
by severe weather declined 96 percent to a seasonally adjusted 
annual rate of 629000 units in december that put sales for the 
year at 650000 down 38 percent from 1988 in large part because 
of high mortgage interest rates it was the slowest pace since 
1984 when 639000 new homes were sold 
analysts agreed that most of the increase in the december 
leading index came from unfilled aircraft orders partly due to a 
strike at the boeing co and partly because such orders often take 
months to fill after they are made 
but many like berson also agreed with federal reserve chairman 
alan greenspan who told congress on tuesday that the economy is 
unlikely to fall into a recession 
were not going to have a recession berson said theres 
still a risk but most likely the economy will strengthen a little 
bit in the first quarter and more by the middle of the year 
others were more concerned 
i think that were very very close to a recession said 
lawrence chimerine senior economic adviser for the wefa group in 
bala cynwyd pa i mean were as close to being in a recession 
without being in one as you can be 
in addition to the backlog of manufacturers unfilled orders 
other contributors to the december increase were an increase in 
plant and equipment orders higher stock prices a rise in the 
money supply an increase in building permits and a gain in an 
index measuring consumer confidence 
a drop in the price of raw materials was the major negative 
factor in the index while such a decrease is considered good news 
for inflation prospects it is counted as a negative in the index 
because it also can reflect declining demand 
other negatives were an increase in weekly unemployment claims 
a decline in orders for consumer goods and a speedup in business 
delivery times 
the average work week was unchanged 
the various changes left the index at 1457 percent of its 1982 
base of 100 
for the year the index posted increases in seven months 
january april july august september november and december it 
declined in february march may june and october

japan in december asked wednesday for political asylum saying the 
act was his lastditch attempt to flee political persecution

penalty in china because he had joined in the prodemocracy 
demonstrations in beijing last june 
zhang who faces possible repatriation under international law 
said that before the hijacking he had failed twice to escape china 
by land due to tight security after the bloody suppression of 
prodemocracy demonstrators 
please do not send me back to china his statement asked of 
the japanese government please give me freedom or repatriate 
me only after my execution in japan

the house interior committee voted wednesday 
to settle a 14yearold dispute among the seminole indians by 
giving 73 percent of about 50 million in federal damages to the 
oklahoma tribe and 27 percent to seminoles in florida 
the distribution differs from legislation passed in november by 
the senate that calls for an approximately 7525 split but it 
represents a compromise in the house where the florida delegation 
was seeking 30 percent of the money for its branch of the tribe 
the bill now goes to the full house for a vote and if approved 
in the form passed by the committee will go to a conference 
committee to work out differences with the senate version 
originally the florida seminoles pushed for a 5050 
distribution leading to a disagreement that the indians could not 
settle among themselves 
the dispute began in 1976 when the seminoles were awarded 16 
million for florida lands taken during the 1823 relocation of most 
of the tribe to oklahoma 
the money which has been held by the treasury department 
because of the disagreement over its distribution grew to 50 
million through years of accumulated interest 
in the absence of agreement among the seminoles the government 
worked out the 7525 split based on population figures that counted 
2146 seminoles in oklahoma and 700 in florida 
the government also found the oklahoma tribe to be poorer with 
only about 380 acres of tribally owned land while the florida 
branch which includes the miccosukee tribe of florida and the 
unaffiliated seminole indians of florida has about 80000 acres

prosecutors today said they will retry 
raymond buckey on the 13 conspiracy and childmolestation charges 
on which a jury deadlocked during the marathon mcmartin preschool 
trial 
superior court judge william pounders accepted the decision to 
go forward with a new trial and urged that it begin quickly because 
the range of emotions is very high pounders set a trial date 
of march 9 
deputy district attorneys lael rubin and roger gunson ended the 
suspense that had surrounded the case since jan 18 when the jury 
in the longest and costliest criminal trial in us history 
acquitted buckey and his mother on 52 molestation charges but 
deadlocked on 13 counts against buckey 
prosecutors had the option of dismisssing the remaining counts 
but after days of meetings with district attorney ira reiner 
decided to proceed 
buckey 31 and his 63yearold mother peggy mcmartin buckey 
had been accused of molesting 11 children at their manhattan beach 
preschool during a fiveyear period 
in the two weeks since the acquittals the preschoolers 
parents the children and rgwue allies have appeared on national 
television called news conferences collected letters of support 
and enlisted politicians in support of a retrial 
this is a positive step for us said mary mae cioffi a 
mcmartin parent who has led the campaign to retry buckey im 
going to run home and tell my kids we get another chance 
the trial lasted nearly three years and cost taxpayers more than 
13 million buckey spent nearly five years in jail before he was 
released on 15 million bail last february 
the future of the case was complicated by a motion filed by 
buckeys attorney claiming pounders is biased against the defendant 
and should be removed from the case 
defense attorney danny davis said pounders had made comments 
throughout the trial indicating his belief that the defendants were 
guilty and had expressed prejudice against davis himself 
pounders denied the allegations and said he would file a 
response proving he is unbiased and able to preside at the new 
trial the judge said he knew of no other judge who would want to 
take over the controversial case

the man was arrested friday along with four others accused in 
the slayings of 10 people in guerrilla attacks over the past two 
years he reportedly was a former lover of jailed black leader 
nelson mandelas daughter 
clayton sithole was found hanging from a shower pipe tuesday at 
john vorster square johannesburgs central police station police 
said 
shortly after sitholes death was announced de klerk ordered a 
judicial inquiry a step not taken after scores of previous 
incidents in which black activists died while in police custody 
law and order minister adriaan vlok expressed condolences to 
sitholes family 
according to local newspapers sithole was a former lover of 
zindzi mandela and fathered one of her three children there was no 
immediate comment from the mandelas but associates of the family 
said they believed the report was accurate 
a family friend of the mandelas who requested anonymity said 
sithole belonged to a controversial group of young men who served 
as winnie mandelas bodyguards nine people associated with the 
group have been in custody for months awaiting trial for the death 
of a young black activist 
neither vlok nor de klerk indicated whether the decision to 
launch an investigation was related to sitholes reported 
connection to the mandela family mandela 71 is widely expected 
to be freed in the next few weeks after more than 27 years in 
prison for his role in planning the guerrilla campaign of the 
african national congress the organization is the main black group 
fighting the whiteled government 
denis worrall coleader of the antiapartheid democratic party 
welcomed de klerks swift response 
it is surprising that president de klerk would do this 
worrall said im quite sure that a judicial commission of 
inquiry would be justified 
audrey coleman a prominent human rights activist said 
sitholes family suspected the young man had been mistreated and 
would obtain its own pathologist to conduct an independent post 
mortem 
police said sithole confessed to a magistrate before his death 
implicating himself in several killings police reportedly were 
investigating whether sithole and the other suspects were anc 
guerrillas 
about 100 anc guerrillas and antiapartheid activists have died 
in police custody in the past 25 years 
according to police suicide by hanging has been the most common 
cause of these deaths but human rights groups have insisted 
interrogators mistreated many of these prisoners 
in other developments wednesday

police headquarters to present a petition condemning police actions 
in a jan 23 protest which was broken up by rubber bullets and 
water cannon

many susitna valley moose calves weakened 
by this winters heavy snow are starving to death in yards and 
driveways and some people are feeding the animals despite caution 
from wildlife biologists 
ive got a couple moose in front of my house right now and 
the mama looks ok but the baby is sure looking poorly it looks 
sick its frosted all over said resident david spain 
spain said a moose calf walked into the shop where he works as a 
mechanic and died after hanging around outside for four weeks 
snow is nearly 5 feet deep at willow in the valley 55 miles 
north of anchorage the national weather service says 
moose numbers normally decline during severe winters because 
young weak animals must struggle harder to find food and move 
through the snow 
but the susitna valley has not had a winter this bad in years 
and the moose population was especially high when this years heavy 
snow began 
the snow has also led to more moose deaths on highways police 
logs have shown up to 22 moose accidentally killed in a single 
night there is no count of how many calves have died of starvation 
were so swamped with calls that if we get somebodys name and 
get them down in our notebooks were lucky said fish and 
wildlife protection trooper sgt richard graham 
bill collins a fish and game wildlife biologist said his 
palmer office receives a dozen calls a day from residents who want 
to know what to do about hungry moose 
once the moose are fed they are extremely reluctant to leave 
that area collins said when conditions improve theyll still 
stay around 
if the feeding area is near where people live the moose can be 
dangerous collins said 
the more a wild animal becomes accustomed to human beings the 
more likely it is to bridge the gap between standing off and 
staying away or thrashing someone collins said 
he said a moose that had been fed tried to push its way into a 
womans house recently in another case last week a calf tried to 
get into a house then trampled a woman when she got out of her 
car collins said the 300pound calf threatened to attack him too 
and he had to kill it 
ive been hit and kicked down a couple of times already this 
year graham said 
if a calf cannot move graham shoots it he said because 
otherwise it will only suffer and die slowly 
forest richey said his pickup truck was attacked by a large bull 
moose that wouldnt leave his driveway in willow richey was trying 
to push it out of the way when the moose got mad 
i made the mistake of leaving enough distance that he could 
turn around and charge and he charged and he came right up over 
the hood richey said 
richey and spain both blame the fall cow moose hunting season 
for lowering the survival rate of calves collins said calves whose 
mothers were killed by cars trains or hunters are less likely to 
survive because they do not have the larger parent to break a path 
through the snow or defend them from dogs 
spain is a hunter and said his large family lives on the meat 
that moose provide in september but he said that is not why he is 
worried about the moose now 
i feel for the moose themselves right now he said 
theyre having a hell of a time and for the past 15 years they 
havent had a winter like this 
a guy just needs to get out and look at them to see how bad 
they are

the ruling sandinista national 
liberation front fired another salvo wednesday in the election 
campaign promising to loosen exit visa requirements in a move sure 
to gain sympathy among voters 
nicaragua cuba and bolivia are believed to be the only 
countries in the western hemisphere where citizens need 
sovietstyle government permission to travel abroad 
following a promise this week by president daniel ortega to free 
1044 political prisoners the exit visa announcement is just 
another electioneering maneuver by the sandinista government to 
gain votes said luis sanchez spokesman for the united national 
opposition coalition or uno 
ortega is running for another sixyear term in the feb 25 
general elections against unos violeta barrios de chamorro his 
top challenger 
in promising to free the prisoners ortega took the wind out of 
mrs chamorros sails whose campaign is badly lagging behind a 
vigorous sandinista effort 
mrs chamorro had repeatedly promised to open the jails if 
elected 
speaking to finance ministry workers interior minister tomas 
borge said the sandinistas would introduce to the 
sandinistadominated national assembly a bill that would eliminate 
the exit visa requirement for women over 18 and men over 25 
the visas which are intended in part to prevent draft dodgers 
from leaving the country will still be required for other 
nicaraguans the announcement was meant to take some of the sting 
out of the sandinistas refusal to do away with the draft 
mrs chamorro has promised to ban the draft obligatory for two 
years for all 16yearold males that is one of unos top drawing 
cards along with promises to inject new life into a moribund 
economy 
ortega however has said the draft is needed to defend 
nicaragua against what he calls yankee aggression and an 
allegedly planned us invasion that has failed to materialize in 
more than 10 years of sandinista rule 
many nicaraguan parents have sent their sons abroad to live with 
friends or relatives rather than allowing them to be drafted 
a report on borges speech published wednesday in the 
progovernment newspaper el nuevo diario did not say when the bill 
on exit visas would be introduced nor did it say when borge met 
with the workers 
it was the first time news of such a bill was public 
nicaraguas immigration department comes under the interior 
ministry 
when they ousted dictator anastasio somoza in july 1979 the 
sandinistas removed a restriction banning nicaraguans from travel 
to communist countries but they kept the exit visa requirement

a kuwait newspaper said iranian leaders believe 
westerners held by shiite moslem extremists in lebanon have no more 
political value and are willing to help secure their release 
a senior iranian envoy close to president hashemi rafsanjani 
recently met with an american personality in geneva and discussed 
the hostage issue with him the daily alqabas said in a dispatch 
tuesday from paris 
rafsanjani and close aides are convinced the value of the 
american and western hostages is decreasing by the day the paper 
said quoting west european sources it did not identify 
the hostages are no longer a pressure or bargaining card it 
quoted the sources as saying 
no independent confirmation was available but speculation has 
grown that rafsanjani leader of irans socalled pragmatists 
wanted the hostages freed as part of an effort to improve relations 
with the west 
it appears however that rafsanjanis room for maneuver has 
been curtailed by a power struggle with former interior minister 
ali akbar mohtashemi a radical with close links to the lebanese 
shiites believed to hold most of the captives 
eight americans four britons two west germans two swiss an 
italian and an irishman are missing in lebanon and believed held 
hostage 
held longest is terry a anderson chief middle east 
correspondent of the associated press who was abducted march 16 
1985 
alqabas said its sources attributed the shift in iranian policy 
to the refusal of governments to bargain for the hostages the 
changing political and security situation in lebanon and 
international developments caused by the changes in eastern europe 
the iranian leadership is apparently prepared to facilitate 
the release of american hostages provided this will lead at a later 
stage to a gradual improvement in iranianamerican relations the 
paper reported 
it said the usiranian meeting in geneva was the most 
important of several and that the previous encounters took place 
in paris and a west german city left unidentified 
none of the officials was identified but alqabas said the 
americans were diplomats or private citizens and the iranian in 
geneva was formerly in charge of the file of western hostages in 
lebanon and played a key role in the iranianfrench relations that 
led to the release of french hostages 
although it quoted the sources as saying they had no certain 
information that the two sides have reached a final formula on the 
fate of the hostages the paper added 
the sources do not exclude the possibility of the americans 
and iranians having reached a secret formula whereby the american 
and western hostages will be freed in one batch or several batches 
provided the bush administration met such a step by opening up to 
iran and starting a gradual normalization process between the two 
countries

president bush prepared to deliver a state of 
the union address tonight that administration sources said will 
call for deeper cuts in soviet and american troops in europe 
secretary of state james a baker iii said bush called soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachev to advise him of some 
announcements he would have in tonights speech the white house 
said bush and gorbachev discussed arms control 
the proposed cuts would go beyond a troopreduction plan that 
bush offered in 1989 and which is still under negotiation said the 
sources who demanded anonymity last years proposal would cut 
troops on each side t 275000 which would require a 30000person 
reduction in us combat troops and a 325000person reduction in 
soviet forces in eastern europe 
cbs news reported that bush would use the speech to unveil a 
proposal to reduce us and soviet troops in the central zone of 
europe to 195000 a drop of 80000 from the 1989 proposal 
bush told reporters the speech comes on at 9 oclock tonight 
and theres going to be a lot of surprises there maybe im not 
going to discuss in advance what i want to say i want the surprise 
factor 
there are some things that we dont discuss ahead of time 
he said 
referring to bushs call to gorbachev baker said it had to 
do with some announcements that the president will have tonight in 
his state of the union message and beyond that i am not going to 
say anything further 
similarly white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said 
the presidents state of the union will deal with arms control 
but i cannot confirm nor deny any specifics of his proposal 
arms control aside bush told republicans that his speech would 
register objections to any cutback in social security taxes and 
proclaim the nation in good health 
bush also said he would set new goals in education and sources 
said he would call for american students to be first in the world 
by the year 2000 in science and mathematics two areas where they 
have ranked near the bottom in international testing 
bush will address a joint session of congress in a nationally 
broadcast appearance at 9 pm est it will be his maiden state of 
the union address although he went before congress with a budget 
and deficitreduction package last february 
the president gave a preview of his speech to republican members 
of congress during a morning meeting at the white house 
later house minority leader bob michel rill said he was 
happy that bush said he would use the speech to voice opposition to 
a plan by sen daniel patrick moynihan dny to roll back a 
social security tax increase that took effect jan 1 
referring to moynihans proposal michel said it just means 
its a nono as far as our partys concerned weve made that 
decision earlier on to fund this program adequately into the next 
century and to do violence to that just really undermines our 
credibility 
the administration has argued that moynihans plan would lead to 
either an increase in other taxes or a reduction in social security 
benefits 
moynihan has said his proposal was prompted by concern that the 
growing social security trust fund reserves are being used to mask 
the true size of the federal deficit he says the financial 
soundness of the system would be protected under his proposal and 
there would be no risk to benefits 
at the top of bushs wish list for lawmakers are leftover bills 
dealing with clean air crime child care and cuts in capital gains 
tax rates 
white house chief of staff john sununu said chances for action 
are better this year because of the november elections 
i think all of a sudden about april or may it will dawn on 
congress that its a congressional election not a presidential 
election year and that failures to get things done will be seen as 
failures of the democrat leadership in the house the democrat 
leadership in the senate he said 
and i think at that time maybe well get them back to a 
bipartisan perspective and get some legislation passed sununu 
added 
bush also has the momentum of strong support from americans 
surveys taken after the invasion of panama showed bush with a 
jobapproval rating of 79 to 81 percent higher than former 
president reagan ever attained 
much of the suspense of bushs address was dampened by the 
unveiling of his 12 trillion budget plan which outlined new 
initiatives where he wants to spend more money and areas where he 
wants to cut 
so all the details of the programs are really on the table 
right now sununu said 
generally speaking bush requested more money for education 
space the environment and drugs while proposing cuts for medicare 
college student loans mass transit and farm subsidies 
white house officials said there were no major initiatives or 
surprises remaining for bushs speech 
obviously we dont want to overstate expectations dont want 
anyone to overexpand an agenda said sununu 
the challenge to improve students math and science skills was 
hinted at in bushs budget 
without mentioning the math and science goal the budget 
proposes 230 million a 70 percent increase in funds for states 
to improve the abilities of teachers in those two disciplines 
in addition national science foundation programs for science 
math and engineering education would receive a 100 million 
increase to 460 million under bushs proposal 
education secretary lauro f cavazos citing results of an 
international comparative study of students in more than a dozen 
industrialized nations complained in a speech that us students 
consistently ranked near the bottom in math and science 
bush has previewed his address with a series of speeches this 
year warning the democratic reforms in eastern europe will not 
produce a peace dividend of defense savings for the united 
states 
while democrats are hoping to cut pentagon spending bush said 
at one outing he would not naively cut the muscle out of our 
defense posture

president bush called soviet president mikhail 
s gorbachev today to provide him with advance word on several 
announcements he will make in his state of the union address 
secretary of state james a baker iii said 
among them administration sources told the associated press is 
a proposal for deeper cutbacks in us and soviet troops in europe 
nato and the warsaw pact are negotiating over a proposal by bush 
last year to establish ceilings of 275000 but since then soviet 
allies in eastern and central europe have called for soviet troop 
withdrawals and moscow appears receptive 
as a result said the sources who demanded anonymity bush will 
call for even deeper reductions 
baker meanwhile again discounted as just a rumor a 
television report that gorbachev would surrender his leadership of 
the soviet communist party 
we said yesterday that we thought that that was just a rumor 
and indeed it proved to be just a rumor baker said i cant 
make judgments about rumors whether they surface in the soviet 
union or over here it was a rumor 
there was no direct discussion of the report in bushs 
telephone call to gorbachev white house spokesman marlin fitzwater 
said 
it had to do with some announcements that the president will 
have tonight in his state of the union message and beyond that i 
am not going to say anything further baker said in a brief 
exchange with reporters at the state department 
gorbachev earlier today emphatically denied the report by the 
cable news network 
fitzwater said the president called him this morning to talk 
about arms control i dont know how long it was early this 
morning 
asked if they had talked about the rumors gorbachev might 
surrender his party post fitzwater said the president said 
there was no direct discussion of that 
baker who is going to moscow next week will see soviet foreign 
minister eduard a shevardnadze and possibly gorbachev on feb 
89 the talks were rescheduled a second time to avoid interfering 
with a meeting of the partys central committee 
the postponement coincided with a report by cnn that gorbachev 
had spent the past eight days at his country home considering 
whether to resign as head of the soviet communist party 
no one has said this and i certainly didnt make any such 
statement the soviet president and party general secretary said 
any such suggestions are groundless 
asked about the resignation report during a photo session at the 
start of a kremlin meeting with presidentelect fernando collor de 
mello of brazil gorbachev said i have no intention of doing 
so 
bush administration officials and intelligence sources told the 
associated press there has been speculation for weeks that 
gorbachev would yield his party post while retaining the 
presidency but they had no information he would take the step 
all i can tell you is that its a rumor and therefore 
its not something that i think that we should respond to or react 
to baker told reporters on his way to a meeting with president 
daniel arap moi of kenya were following the story as i know 
you are and well have a comment if we ever determine its 
something more than just a rumor 
baker said american diplomats in moscow know just about the 
same thing that all the rest of us know right now that theres a 
rumor out there to this effect and thats all we know 
white house chief of staff john sununu told reporters the 
administration has been trying for the last few hours to try and 
get some additional assessments but i dont have anything at all 
issues to be discussed by baker and shevardnadze include arms 
control and the war in afghanistan between the sovietbacked 
government and usarmed rebels 
initially baker was to go to moscow on feb 67 then the date 
was changed to feb 78 and on tuesday the state department 
announced the shift to feb 89 saying it was suggested by the 
us side 
it simply makes more sense to have the soviets complete their 
plenum before beginning this important ministerial said margaret 
d tutwiler the state department spokeswoman 
baker also is expected to make a brief visit to czechoslovakia 
although there has been no announcement on that 
the soviet news agency tass reported the delay of bakers visit 
in a oneparagraph story from washington but gave no reason 
cnn quoting a wellinformed and usually reliable party 
source said from moscow that the reemergence of gorbachev on 
television on tuesday did not rule out a dramatic resignation when 
the policysetting central committee meets next monday and tuesday 
before the tv appearance on tuesday gorbachev was last seen in 
public jan 20 explaining why soviet troops had been sent to the 
azerbaijan republic 
according to the unnamed source gorbachev had resisted sending 
troops into baku the capital of the republic and was suffering 
severe depression over the action cnn said

a suspected drug dealer who was beaten to death 
while in the custody of six undercover detectives used cocaine 
shortly before he died a medical examiners report said 
he had used cocaine probably within two to three hours prior 
to the time that he died dr lee hearn chief toxicologist for 
the dade medical examiners office said tuesday 
there was cocaine in leonardo mercados urine nasal passages 
blood and brain the report said 
the concentrations are not by any means exceptional hearn 
said theyre actually quite low 
but defense attorneys say that whatever the amount the cocaine 
could have been a factor in the confrontation between mercado and 
the officers 
mercado died dec 16 1988 while in the custody of six officers 
from the street narcotics unit the officers go on trial april 2 on 
federal charges of violating mercados civil rights 
witnesses told investigators that officers found mercado on the 
street pulled him inside his house and hit kicked and beat him 
the finding of cocaine in mercados system is an extremely 
significant point for the defense said richard sharpstein an 
attorney for one of the officers 
but hearn said the presence of cocaine in mercados bloodstream 
does not mean he was prone to violence 
he probably was feeling some effects from cocaine but 
probably not very intensely at that point hearn said 
different people react different ways some people become 
violent some just become happy you really cant say based solely 
on a toxicological test result

the national operation rescue organization is 
shutting down because of debt but local affiliates nationwide will 
continue their antiabortion efforts founder randall terry said 
wednesday 
terry made the announcement at a news conference a day after he 
was released from a georgia prison where he had spent nearly four 
months in custody on charges of criminal trespass and unlawful 
assembly 
he said a 50000 fine imposed by a new york court in a lawsuit 
filed by the national organization for women hurt operation 
rescues fundraising efforts and helped put the group 70000 in 
debt 
the fine is being appealed but the judgment in the new york 
case unfortunately has driven us to the brink of bankruptcy he 
said 
terry said that because of the fine the organization had been 
unable to raise money to pay salaries and carry on the operations 
of the binghamton ny headquarters which had employed 23 people 
it is unprecedented in american history for government to go 
after any group with such draconian fines he said as a result 
of the lawsuit we dont have any option but to close our doors 
however terry said the 125 local operation rescue groups 
across the country will continue their directaction efforts to 
shut down abortion clinics 
we are confident these groups will continue doing what theyre 
doing he said the movement is bigger than the office in 
binghamton and will carry on with or without us 
terry was released tuesday from a fulton county ga 
minimumsecurity prison camp after an anonymous person paid his 
500 fine and a 50 special assessment 
he said he did not know who had paid the fine im happy im 
out he said im glad i did the time and im also glad im 
out 
terry said his immediate plans are to go home and spend some 
time ministering to my wife and family 
but he said he plans to continue his antiabortion activities 
youll see me out there kicking he said im not dead once 
i get my bearings i will still be speaking traveling 
he said he stopped in washington at a conference of religious 
broadcasters on his way home because he wanted to express his 
outrage at the prison sentences that are being handed out to 
members of operation rescue around the country 
prolife activists he said are being jailed more often and 
held longer than demonstrators for other causes 
this is politics he said theres no other explanation 
terry a bornagain christian and former car salesman was 
arrested during an operation rescue demonstration outside the 
atlanta surgicenter in 1988 he was ordered to pay the fine agree 
to stay out of metropolitan atlanta for two years and abide by 
georgia law 
terry refused and was jailed oct 5 saying he was prepared to 
serve out the twoyear sentence 
operation rescue is a looseknit organization terry founded in 
1987 three years after he and his wife began standing outside a 
binghamton clinic trying to discourage women from having abortions

south korea expects to sign agreements 
for the withdrawal of 3000 more us forces in 1990 a senior 
official indicated wednesday 
such agreements would bring reductions to 5000 this year to a 
total of roughly 38000 
all of the american personnel withdrawn are expected to be 
noncombatants said the government official who discussed the 
issue on condition he not be identified 
us secretary of defense dick cheney said earlier this week 
three us air force bases in south korea would be closed and 2000 
air support personnel withdrawn in a costsaving effort 
cheneys announcement signaled the first us military cutback 
in south korea in more than 10 years 
its a readjustment we dont think the us is pulling out 
said the korean official who has highlevel government 
responsibilities with both the foreign and defense ministeries 
he said the government views the basic ussouth korea defense 
agreement as being untouched and said korean officials are 
confident further reductions will involve only support personnel 
not combatready troops 
the official said the two nations are expected to formalize an 
agreement later this year he indicated that would bring us 
forces to 1980 troop strength of roughly 38000 or 5000 less than 
todays number 
the us 2nd infantry division the only american division in 
south korea is deployed along the demilitarized zone separating 
north korea and south korea and is not expected to be affected by 
cuts he said 
the 43000 us troops stationed in south korea are under a 
mutual defense pact to deter aggression from communist north korea 
south koreans view national security as their top national priority 
and citizens have been jittery over the prospect of american 
withdrawals 
the peninsula was divided into the communist north and 
capitalist south in 1945 and the two sides fought a bloody 
threeyear war in the early 1950s that ended with an armistice but 
not a peace treaty 
cheney is to visit seoul feb 14 for negotiations with his 
korean counterparts and a discussion of ground troops is expected 
to be on the agenda us and korean officials said no decisions 
would be made on troop reductions without the agreement of both 
nations 
the last us cutbacks were in the late 1970s when several 
hundred troops were withdrawn to fulfill a campaign promise made by 
president jimmy carter

the jury that convicted a woman of 
suffocating one of two infant daughters she claimed were abducted 
three years apart by masked gunmen deliberated today whether the 
crime qualifies for the death penalty 
assistant states attorney donald weber argued that paula marie 
sims crime was especially brutal and cruel the grounds necessary 
to bring the death penalty 
but defense attorney donald groshong told jurors in the 
pecking order of evil smothering is usually considered more 
merciful than other forms of killing 
mrs sims 30 was convicted tuesday in the april 29 death of 
6weekold heather lee sims 
a finding by the jury that mrs sims is eligible for the death 
penalty would send the trial into a third phase in which jurors 
would decide whether to actually sentence her to death 
groshong today argued that ms sims maintains her innocence and 
he added we cannot say the death of this child was premeditated 
prolonged or torturous 
mrs sims claimed a gunman abducted the infant from the familys 
southern illinois home in alton in 1986 mrs sims gave a nearly 
identical account in the death of 13dayold loralei marie the 
simses were living in rural brighton at the time mrs sims has not 
been charged with killing that child 
the jury deliberated for 10 hours over two days before reaching 
the verdict mrs sims broke down as guards led her back to jail 
weber said he thought the jury was strongly influenced by 
evidence that mrs sims and her husband 37yearold robert wanted 
only male children 
she didnt like little girls and neither did robert weber 
said 
sims has not been charged in either case 
but weber said because of the verdict against mrs sims 
prosecutors are considering seeking indictments against him sims 
and groshong refused to comment 
mrs sims faces trial on charges of obstruction of justice and 
concealment of a homicide in loraleis death mrs sims has been 
jailed since july 
sims has had custody of the couples son randy who turns 2 on 
thursday the trial was moved to peoria from edwardsville because 
of intense pretrial publicity

a minister from a pivotal religious party on 
wednesday admonished israeli leaders against making comments that 
could delay soviet jewish immigration 
religious affairs minister zevulun hammer was reacting to a 
statement made by prime minister yitzhak shamir who suggested that 
israel needed to keep the occupied west bank and gaza strip to 
settle an expected wave of soviet immigrants 
speaking to reporters one day after his return from the soviet 
union hammer said he did not expect the soviet immigration wave to 
be halted because of shamirs comments 
but he said we have to act with much caution and we have to 
avoid saying anything that could cause any kind of delay in 
emigration 
soviet and us officials oppose resettlement of immigrants in 
the occupied lands saying it is an obstacle to making peace with 
arabs the soviet union broke ties with israel after the jewish 
state captured the territories from jordan and egypt during the 
1967 middle east war 
lowlevel relations were resumed in 1987 
hammer is a member of the national religious party which is 
crucial in deciding whether the political left or right could rule 
in a coalition government 
it had been in coalition with the leftleaning labor party for 
the countrys first 30 years until it sided with the rightwing 
likud bloc after likuds victory in 1977 national elections 
shimon peres the labor party leader and shamirs main political 
rival told a private meeting of the inner cabinet on wednesday 
that shamirs remark was a fatal mistake regarding immigration 
and i can hardly restrain myself from saying this in public 
israel tv reported 
hammer said anatoly adamishin a soviet deputy foreign minister 
told him shamirs remarks had created difficulties at home 
and abroad 
the soviet union issued an official protest of shamirs 
statement in response a top shamir aide said israel had no policy 
of directing immigrants to the occupied territories where 
palestinians are fighting for an independent state 
israeli officials say the immigrants are free to settle either 
in israel or in the occupied lands where 17 million palestinians 
live 
meanwhile former soviet refuseniks appealed to the israeli 
government to implement the evacuation of soviet jewry because 
of alleged growing antisemitism in the soviet union 
about 50 refuseniks who waited years to obtain exit visas from 
the soviet union protested across from shamirs office in 
jerusalem 
we need to evacuate them because they are threatened there is 
a real danger said ida nudel who waged a 16year fight for an 
exit visa before finally being allowed to come to israel in 1987 
unfortunately we know everything retrospectively we remember 
what happened in germany its the same conditions today 
israel has said it expects up to 300000 soviet jews to 
immigrate to israel in the next three years in january 4600 
soviet jews came to israel according to the government 
workers at the absorption ministry which handles the influx 
declared a 24hour strike beginning at midnight wednesday hanna 
bazana chairwoman of the workers committee said the strike was 
to demand salary increases and more workers since 350 workers 
cannot absorb 100000 immigrants expected 
the absorption ministry said it would employ temporary workers 
to handle two planeloads of immigrants due to arrive early thursday

a former opposition leader now allied 
with the governing party said wednesday he would seek better 
relations with the soviet union as a means of easing tension with 
north korea 
kim youngsam whose reunification democratic party joined 
another opposition group last week in a merger with the governing 
democratic justice party said better relations with communist 
allies of north korea would help lead to reunification 
he plans to visit the soviet union in midmarch kims comments 
reflected the policy of president roh taewoo who has sought 
better relations with north koreas allies in hopes they would 
preach moderation in pyongyang 
after years in the opposition kim became a government leader 
overnight when his party and the new democratic republican party 
agreed to the merger they ranked second and third in the 
opposition behind the leftist party for peace and prosperity led by 
kim daejung

actively push the policy of improving relations with the soviet 
union china and other socialist nations thus laying a solid 
foundation for national unifification the merger is to become 
formal in midfebruary but already is considered in effect the 
alliance is tentatively named the democratic liberal party 
because of the merger kim youngsam has become a possible 
successor to roh whose single fiveyear term expires in early 1993 
he said he proposed the merger to roh last year as a way of 
ending south koreas factionridden politics once and for all 
that contradicted widespread speculation that the rohs party 
initiated the merger 
newspapers said kim 62 probably will meet in moscow with 
president mikhail s gorbachev and other top officials interested 
in improving relations with south korea 
an aide said privately last june mr kim went to moscow as 
an opposition leader but this time he is going there as a 
potential ruler and i am sure they would consider the change in 
his status 
news reports said kim also might speak with north korean leaders 
while in moscow but the aide denied it during the june trip to 
moscow kim met with ho dam former foreign minister of north korea 
south korea has established full diplomatic relations with 
hungary poland and yugoslavia and has consular ties with the 
soviet union with hopes of raising them to the ambassadorial level 
korea was divided in 1945 at the end of world war ii the two 
nations fought a threeyear war that ended in 1953 but no peace 
treaty has been signed

mikhail s gorbachev on wednesday denied a report 
he might resign as head of the communist party while remaining 
soviet president and a leading newspaper called him too valuable 
to risk losing 
another newspaper the party daily pravda urged authorities to 
strengthen the powers of the presidency to protect gorbachev from 
efforts to oust him 
correspondents covering gorbachevs meeting with brazilian 
presidentelect fernando collor de mello asked about a western 
television report that he was considering quitting the party 
leadership 
all this is groundless gorbachev said in remarks that led 
the soviet television news wednesday night it is in someones 
interest to propagate such things 
he added that similar rumors are becoming common in the soviet 
union and it demonstrates that we are a different country a 
different society everything is discussed and discussed openly 
gorbachev has strengthened the presidency and tried to shift 
power from the ruling communist party to the elected government 
but it is far from clear whether the reforms have gone far enough 
for him to dare relinquishing the top post in the party which has 
been the source of power for all previous soviet leaders 
the pravda article based on a debate among prominent figures 
appeared to tell readers that party power still is paramount and 
that the presidency is not strong enough to be the countrys main 
leadership post 
the political turmoil comes while the soviet union is torn by 
nationalist and ethnic violence in azerbaijan drives for 
independence in several republics and an economic crisis 
it also comes just five days before what is expected to be a 
fiery meeting of the partys central committee the one body with 
the official power to remove gorbachev as party leader 
progressives hope to present an alternative party program at the 
meeting in addition it is likely to be the hardliners last 
chance to make a power play before the voters decide on their 
future in local and republiclevel elections in february and march 
gorbachev told journalists he had just returned from the south 
apparently referring to his retreat on the black sea where he was 
preparing for the central committee meeting 
cable news network reported tuesday in an account attributed to 
an unidentified party source that gorbachev had spent eight days 
sequestered outside moscow while he considered quitting 
president bush telephoned gorbachev wednesday but white house 
spokesman marlin fitzwater said there was no direct discussion 
of the rumors fitzwater said the two leaders talked about arms 
control 
secretary of state james a baker iii discounted the tv network 
report as just a rumor 
in moscow us ambassador jack matlock received an audience in 
the kremlin the tass news agency said however it said he and 
politburo member lev zaikov talked about sovietus relations 
matlock said the meeting was scheduled months earlier and the 
topics were not connected to any other events 
foreign ministry spokesman gennady i gerasimov also denied the 
reports 
in the long run power will belong completely to the soviets 
elected councils and the party will exercise its influence 
through its members in the soviets which is the usual way for 
every democracy gerasimov said 
komsomolskaya pravda the partys youth daily noted that the 
communist party is splitting into factions under such forces as 
the independence movements in the baltics the violence in 
azerbaijan and recent ousters of local party chiefs by impatient 
reformers in tyumen volgograd and chernigov 
to fix on pseudounity is a dangerous thing at least because 
responsibility for everything boomerangs to the very top said 
the article signed by managing editor alexander drozdov 
we cannot we do not have the right to risk gorbachev simply 
because he inherited such a heavy ideological and personnel 
burden he continued referring to hardline holdovers from the 
communist partys decades of dictatorship 
today only he is in a position to become the center of gravity 
and a mediator between the many political and social forces 
drozdov wrote 
drozdov also said in his frontpage article that it is high 
time for all influential participants in the political process to 
sit down at a roundtable in obvious reference to negotiations 
in poland in which communists agreed to loosen their control over 
the country the talks led to the election of the soviet blocs 
first noncommunist prime minister 
drozdov said the peoples fronts which in some soviet republics 
rival the party in public support should be included in the 
orbit of the government and political life on an equal footing with 
the ruling party 
drozdov told the associated press other editors cut from his 
article a suggestion that gorbachev divide his posts retaining the 
presidency and surrendering the party leadership he said in an 
interview he believes this issue will come to the fore soon and 
that as president he would have much more trust than as head of 
the party of this party 
drozdov declined to say who changed it but other sources said 
the decision was made inside the newspaper not from higher up 
as printed the editorial said simply in the end he is our 
president and more than anything he is our president 
in pravdas report on a discussion by four scholars historian 
yevgeny ambartsumov said gorbachev appeared unable to take decisive 
action because of the threat to his position ambartsumov said the 
countrys president has few legal guarantees of his position even 
though the congress of peoples deputies elected gorbachev last may 
to a fiveyear term 
there is no guarantee that the congress of peoples deputies 
in a left or right mood would not demand his replacement 
ambartsumov said theoretically he added the communist party 
could recall him as well because gorbachev was elected to one of 
the partys 100 guaranteed parliamentary seats 
parliament spokesman eduard kovalev said lawmakers are 
considering a law exempting the president from recall 
lawyer mikhail krutogolov referred in pravda to the communist 
party as the fourth power of the soviet union whose authority 
is greater than the judiciary the legislature or the governments 
executive branch

pope john paul ii urged young chadians on 
wednesday to fight the temptation of the city and concentrate 
instead on farming their thirsty land to help africa overcome its 
poverty 
the pontiff nearing the end of his african tour rode to the 
sarh hippodrome in the back of an open pickup truck along dusty 
streets lined with mango trees 
women dressed in brightly printed cloth bearing the likeness of 
the pope greeted him with ululations typical of the subsaharan or 
sahel region 
learn the old and the new methods work to create productive 
fields and resist the temptation to abandon the land for an 
uncertain future in the cities the pontiff told a crowd of some 
10000 who gathered in the southern agricultural city of 700000 
people 
the pope was accompanied by monsignor mathias ngarteri the only 
chadian bishop 
earlier in the day in the cottongrowing town of moundou john 
paul encouraged young chadians to join the priesthood there are 26 
chadian priests and 153 foreign priests in chad 
the pope also praised the labors of the expatriate priests and 
missionaries who established the first roman catholic foothold in 
chad 60 years ago in moundou

deeply involved in education and rural development 
in a speech welcoming the pope tuesday president hissene habre 
a moslem and former guerrilla leader made a point of thanking the 
expatriate priests and nuns working as teachers nurses and rural 
extension agents 
development aid officials say chad one of the worlds 10 
poorest nations whose fragile economy was shattered by more than a 
decade of civil strife is nevertheless capable of feeding itself 
given sufficient rainfall 
us aid officials said last years harvest of 800000 tons of 
cereal grains including mainstays sorghum and millet is about 
enough to feed the nation 
chad was the final stop on john pauls visit to the sahel he 
also visited mali cape verde guinea bissau and burkina faso 
since his first visit to the droughtplagued sahel a decade ago 
john paul has repeatedly called on wealthy nations to help the 
africans of the region overcome their poverty

day that ms sheldon had called to say she was fine and also that 
she was accompanied by reeder whose company car had been found 
abandoned 
local officials said the two were in albuquerque nm neither

at first some residents of this biblebelt city home to 
baptistrun baylor university wondered if it was all a publicity 
stunt said a clerk at the sears catalog center who would identify 
herself only as mary 
but as the waco tribuneherald published updates on the case 
that thought diminished she said 
then on tuesday the incident was featured on the nationally 
syndicated show a current affair 
i thought that was hilarious a current affair said a 
waco woman who works at the texas state technical institute who 
would identify herself only as jan but i cant understand why 
anybody outside of waco cares 
a deputy court clerk for mcclennan county said the disappearance 
has the courthouse abuzz and she expects she may be indirectly 
involved at some point 
none of those involved have come in here yet said the 
clerk who handles divorce case filings but it wouldnt surprise

the government wednesday ordered police 
and security officers nationwide to halt any destruction of files 
and other official records 
the order issued by interior minister czeslaw kiszczak was in 
response to a request for such an edict friday by solidarity 
members of parliament who feared police were destroying evidence of 
past misdeeds the state pap news agency said 
with solidarity in control of the government and slowly 
tightening its hold on lowerlevel offices there have been press 
reports about bonfires of police and communist party records in 
cities around the country 
interior ministry col kazimierz piotrowski director of the 
central police archives said tuesday that routine destruction of 
files had been carried out in recent weeks in accordance with the 
law solidaritys gazeta wyborcza and the governmentowned 
rzeczpospolita newspapers reported 
piotrowski said it is normal practice that after a certain 
period of time police materials are destroyed unless they are of 
historical interest 
a relaxation of censorship means the public will have access to 
part of the archives piotrowski said but the files of police 
informants will never be disclosed to the public for obvious 
reasons 
the sb security service is covering its tracks said one 
article in solidaritys gazeta wyborcza last week 
piotrowski denied any abuses we are in telephone contact with 
chiefs of local archives and we are doing everything we can to 
preserve valuable materials 
but he conceded that documents of the nowliquidated security 
service department that conducted surveillance on roman catholic 
priests considered a threat to the government were among those 
being destroyed if local departments consider them without 
historical value 
some documents concerning surveillance of the political 
opposition many of whose members now occupy the parliament and 
high positions in government also were destroyed he said

attorney general dick thornburgh said 
wednesday there is a crisis over delays in carrying out the death 
penalty and he urged streamlining appeals procedures for death row 
inmates 
delay in the review and execution of capital sentences in this 
country has reached crisis proportions he told a committee 
studying federal court reform the average delay from time of 
conviction and sentence to time of execution of sentence in 1988 
was six years and eight months 
thornburgh endorsed proposals of a committee headed by retired 
supreme court justice lewis f powell calling for curtailing 
appeals in capital cases the powell committee also would give 
death row inmates a broader right to be represented by a lawyer at 
taxpayer expense 
the powell committee rcommended that states enact laws to limit 
death row inmates to two rounds of appeals in state and federal 
courts one round would challenge a verdict directly the second 
round would be based on alleged violations of the condemned 
individuals rights 
the current systems permits indefinite appeals in federal courts 
the attorney general said it is urgent to address the 
particularly acute problems of dilatory defense tactics and 
repetitive litigation in capital cases 
thornburgh also said he opposes plans to limit the power of 
federal courts to deal with drug law violations and shift 
enforcement to state courts 
it is becoming increasingly clear that many local drug 
networks have national sometimes international roots that demand 
a coordinated federal response he said 
thornburgh testified before the federal courts study committee 
created by congress to come up with plans by april for dealing with 
a host of problems and recommending changes 
the committee consisting of 15 members appointed by chief 
justice william h rehnquist heard testimony in a supreme court 
conference room from numerous judges public officials and lawyers 
the panel called for comment on a 140page draft report it 
released in december it hopes to have a final report in april to 
be submitted to congress president bush and rehnquist 
wednesdays session focused in part on the committees criticism 
of new sentencing guidelines in federal criminal cases 
thornburgh among others supported the guidelines and urged the 
committee to abandon its call for giving judges more freedom to 
depart from the guidelines 
while the guidelines do restrict the range of appropriate 
sentencing more than some judges might prefer that is the whole 
purpose of having them he said 
william w wilkins jr a federal appeals court judge who headed 
the commission that devised the guidelines said the federal courts 
study committee is proposing to abandon the guidelines based on 
flimsy evidence 
congress may have underestimated the need for more resources 
to implement guidelines sentencing wilkins said the answer to 
that problem would appear to be for this committee to recommend 
more judicial resources not to call for virtual repeal of the 
law that authorized the new procedure 
the supreme court last year upheld the constitutionality of the 
guidelines 
some judges say the new system gives prosecutors too much power 
to coerce guilty pleas while stripping judges of authority to use 
discretion in sentencing

secretary of state james a baker iii 
dismissed on wednesday as a good example of a rumor reports 
that he is ready to set up mideast negotiations 
we are continuing to try to work on this problem baker 
said i have had some discussions in recent days with both 
israelis and egyptians and we are going to just continue to try 
and plug away and see if we can make progress 
according to the reports baker is about to open the 
negotiations either while he is in europe next week on his way to 
moscow or soon thereafter in washington 
thats a good example of a rumor he told reporters in a 
brief exchange 
baker has been trying to set up a threeway meeting with foreign 
ministers esmat abdelmeguid of egypt and moshe arens of israel for 
several months 
the secretary said that he had talked recently with egyptians 
and israelis but gave no indication that he has made any headway 
the threeway session would be the first step towards holding 
elections among palestinian arabs on the west bank and in gaza 
that in turn would lead to limited selfrule for the palestinians 
under a plan proposed by israeli prime minister yitzhak shamir and 
endorsed by baker 
on another subject baker reiterated us opposition to israels 
settlement of soviet jewish refugees on the west bank and in gaza 
he repeated the us position that the settlements were an 
obstacle to peace and that none of the 3 billion in annual us 
aid to israel could be used for them 
there are about 70000 jews living on the west bank and in gaza 
among an estimated 14 million to 175 million arabs 
about 1000 soviet jews arrive in israel weekly only 2 percent 
or less are settled on the west bank and in gaza

a new lobbying group representing oilseed 
producers processors and users called wednesday for legislation to 
guarantee farmers a choice in what they produce under federal crop 
programs 
the oilseed council of america said genuine planting 
flexibility would help solve a decline in the competitiveness of 
the us oilseed industry oilseeds are led by soybeans but also 
include cottonseed sunflowers and canola 
lowell wilson of primghar iowa cochairman of the council 
said current commodity programs have dramatically reduced acreage 
planted to oilseeds by requiring producers to plant commodities 
supported by target prices to protect crop program base acreages 
used to compute benefits 
wilson said there is genuine planting flexibility when federal 
programs are neutral in their effect on farmers planting decisions 
according to a study released here by the council demand for 
protein meal and oil produced when oilseeds are crushed is growing 
at the rate of 4 percent a year world trade in oilseeds and their 
products the report said has increased twice as fast as trade in 
wheat and feed grains 
despite the growth the study reported that the us share of 
global oilseed production has dropped to 24 percent from 39 percent 
six years ago and that the us share of oilseed trade has 
declined to 45 percent from 75 percent 
floyd anderson of bismarck nd president of the national 
sunflowerseed association and cochairman of the council said 
planting flexibility would let farmers take advantage of the world 
demand for oilseeds by basing planting decisions on market 
situations as well as natural factors 
the formation of the group coincides with moves in congress to 
write new farm legislation to replace the 1985 law which expires 
at the end of the 1990 crop season 
but anderson said in a statement the council does not advocate 
any specific programs and that there are a number of policy 
approaches that will give producers genuine planting 
flexibility and continue farm income protection

deposed panamanian dictator manuel noriega is 
just another inmate with a window in his cell library and 
commissary privileges and standard cafeteria food at a federal 
prison officials say 
but he cannot come in contact with other inmates and must wear 
dark green coveralls not khaki to distinguish him as a security 
risk at the metropolitan correctional center in suburban miami 
noriega facing federal drug charges was held for three weeks 
in a basement apartment in the downtown federal courthouse before 
his move sunday 
hes just another inmate as far as were concerned said 
spokesman charles davis 
noriegas cell measures 86 square feet the same as the other 
cells but most other prisoners have roommates because of crowding 
in the pretrial detention center 
his cell is lighted with fluorescent bulbs and has a bed wool 
blanket chair writing table and a partition in front of the 
commode and sink writing paper is provided 
like other inmates noriega will be allowed to submit a list of 
potential visitors for approval by prison officials 
he and other inmates considered security risks are locked in 
their cells the entire day with the exception of an hour an hour 
and a half for showers and exercise davis said 
most prisoners eat three times a day in the prison cafeteria 
but guards pick noriegas meals from the standard fare and deliver 
them to his cell he is allowed to buy items from the commissary or 
check out library books but only from afar 
noriega can shower whenever he wants but the allotted five 
hours of outdoor exercise a week will be at varying times in a 
caged 20footby20foot yard 
a guard has been posted outside noriegas cell but no 
surveillance camera is used in the cell davis said a camera has 
been installed in a nearby interview room for meetings with 
attorneys or visitors 
defense attorney steven kollin wouldnt comment on the new 
living conditions but he renewed his contention that noriega is a 
prisoner of war who should be released to a third country 
a hearing on that claim is set for feb 8 before us district 
judge william hoeveler

the house on wednesday brushed aside efforts 
to delay a bill to ease voter registration procedures as what 
lawmakers had once billed as bipartisan harmony dissolved into 
partyline bickering 
the house on a key procedural vote upheld 254166 a rule 
requiring critics to tie all of their proposed amendments to the 
legislation into a single bundle 
the house will then hold just one vote on the whole package next 
week when it turns to the legislation itself 
and so begins the great voter registration debate of 1990 
said rep lynn martin rill except that it wont be that great 
a debate 
the socalled motor voter bill would make voter registration 
automatic for any eligible american applying for a drivers 
license other provisions would allow registration by postcard and 
at various government offices 
critics spurred on the bush administration object to the rule 
giving them just one floor vote on all proposed amendments 
led by house minority leader robert h michel rill they want 
to junk restrictions on the offering of floor amendments such an 
open rule would give individual amendments a better chance of 
being adopted and also slow down house action on the bill 
on monday the minority leader swooped into town and trashed 
the entire agreement declared rep al swift dwash a chief 
sponsor of the bill 
swift blamed michel for the collapse of what he called a 
bipartisan agreement fashioned in the government operations 
committee to go forward with the bill a number of republicans had 
backed the measure 
i feel you have made a major attack on the spirit of 
bipartisanship in this congress swift said he said the the 
minority leader has hung out to dry his whip his conference 
chairman his ranking member the speaker of the house the 
majority whip and me and he says now he hopes this will not hurt 
the spirit of bipartisanship in this body 
theres an old rule that says fool me once shame on you i 
do not propose to be fooled again swift said he said the 
episode could cut into cooperation between the parties on a major 
campaign finance reform package they are attempting to fashion 
jointly 
lets look before we leap and were leaping here today said 
rep gerald bh solomon rny rep pat roberts rkan urged 
lawmakers to look under the hood of motor voter before we end up 
in a ditch 
michel was not present for most of swifts remarks but came to 
the floor to answer the complaint saying i may have to share 
some of the blame for missed communication on my side but i have 
not been kept as well informed on voter registration as i have on 
campaign reform 
im sorry the gentleman should have this feeling because 
boy there was nothing intended on my part to gut the gentleman and 
turn things on their head here michel said 
numerous republicans trouped to the microphones to complain 
about the rule saying they needed more maneuvering room to combat 
what they described as burdensome procedures that will be imposed 
on the county clerks in their districts as well as substantially 
higher election costs on their states

with a decision due on a special prosecutor 
for former secretary samuel r pierce jr a house subcommittee 
made plans wednesday to resume hearings on the hud scandal and 
issued subpoenas naming two former officials 
the panel subpoeaned personal bank records of lance wilson a 
former executive assistant to pierce it also voted to subpoena 
james hammernick former director of the office of insured 
multifamily housing develoment at the department of housing and 
urban development to appear at a hearing monday 
the house government operations subcommittee on employment and 
housing meanwhile set two hearings on the hud scandal for next 
week while it awaited word from attorney general dick thornburgh on 
whether he will ask a federal appeals court to name a special 
prosecutor to investigate pierce 
responding to a formal request by democrats on the house 
judiciary committee last fall thornburgh opened a preliminary 
inquiry into whether a special prosecutor was warranted 
the 60day period for that inquiry expires wednesday there was 
speculation thornburgh could ask the court for more time before 
deciding whether to seek the appointment of a prosecutor called an 
independent counsel under the law 
wilson and pierce both invoked their fifth amendment rights 
against selfincrimination and refused to testify before the 
subcommittee in hearings last fall as did other former top hud 
officials 
congressional investigators have been interested in hammernicks 
relationship with wilson after wilson left hud and became a private 
housing consultant and developer 
wilsons expense accounts filed with his employer paine webber 
inc showed that he reported spending more than 1000 
entertaining hammernick during one month in 1987 
hammernick and his attorney john mccahill did not return 
telephone calls seeking comment raymond banoun wilsons attorney 
could not be reached immediately for comment 
the panel also voted to subpoena bank records involving accounts 
at two new york banks held by wilson 
the panel voted 50 to issue the subpoenas 
stuart weisberg subcommittee staff director said the panel is 
continuing its investigation into allegations of fraud 
mismanagement and influencepeddling at hud during the reagan 
administration 
the panels chairman rep tom lantos dcalif said last fall 
that he was ready to end the panels inquiry which took up much of 
last year 
weisberg said the panel was awaiting thornburghs decision 
however he said the panel held open the possibility of scheduling 
more hearings and taking steps to compel testimony if thornburgh 
decides against seeking a special prosecutor to investigate pierce 
the panel could grant immunity to compel testimony from witnesses 
who refuse to testify on constitutional grounds 
weisberg said mccahill had informed the subcommittee that his 
client would invoke a house rule allowing him to prohibit cameras 
and microphones from recording his subpoenaed appearance both 
wilson and pierce invoked that rule when they invoked the fifth 
amendment

a chief architect of us trade restrictions 
against the soviet union and its allies said wednesday they should 
be lifted immediately but not repealed outright 
the rest of america is not yet prepared to consider anything 
more for the soviet union than a waiver despite the crumbling of 
the iron curtain and the massive changes taking place behind it 
former rep charles a vanik dohio told the house ways and means 
committee 
then chairman of the panels trade subcommittee vanik and the 
late sen henry jackson dwash in 1974 coauthoried the 
jacksonvanik amendment barriers imposing high tariffs on imports 
from the soviet union and its allies and denying them export 
credits to buy us goods 
vanik said repealing the law entirely as us business leaders 
have urged is unlikely because 20 percent of the public and 
congress remain opposed to any relationship with the soviet union 
on the unrealistic basis that evil empires never change 
however he disagreed with president bushs insistence that 
moscow first put into law its recently adopted free emigration 
policies before granting the waivers conditionally promised to 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev at the malta summit in 
december 
i judge the soviet union by the deed more than the statute 
vanik said of recent soviet emigration policies the process 
appears to be a wellestablished nonreversible course 
he said us slowness in normalizing trade relations with moscow 
and the newly reincarnated governments of eastern europe risks 
losing those fledgling free markets to other western powers such as 
japan and west germany 
no other nation in the world stands to lose so much if it 
continues to stand still he said 
house democrats expressed frustration that the adminsitration 
has not moved faster to lower the barriers to expanded trade with 
the soviets and other east europeans 
were worried we dont see any actual planning for this 
said rep sam gibbons dfla we dont spot the administration 
doing a lot 
the jacksonvanik law was enacted largely to stop former 
president nixons efforts to conclude a ussoviet trade agreement 
in the early 1970s and to pressure moscow to lift restrictions on 
the emigration of soviet jews and other dissidents 
since 1986 soviet emigration has climbed from just under 2000 
to approximately 195000 last year 
vanik said waiving the restrictions in his law is perhaps the 
best available official signal we have in our system to 
acknowledge what president gorbachev has done and to acknowledge 
that we like what is going on

education secretary lauro cavazos discussed 
the solar system with fourth graders at a suburban roman catholic 
school wednesday hours before the president challenged american 
students to excel in math and science 
who can name the planets in the solar system cavazos asked 
the nearly two dozen youngsters at st camillus an elementary 
school in silver spring md 
we learned a sentence to help us know them 9yearold john 
oduroe informed him it goes my very energetic mother just 
served us nine pancakes 
the boy then began to tick off the names of the planets as other 
classmates joined in mercury venus earth mars jupiter 
saturn uranus neptune and pluto showing they could be among the 
nations better students 
the visit by cavazos a former teacher who had served as 
president of texas tech university before joining the reagan 
administration underscored a message of president bush in his 
state of the union address american students must be first in the 
world by the year 2000 in science and math 
cavazos and other education officials have repeatedly that 
studies show 
just 40 percent of american 13yearold students could solve a 
twostep problem in math compared with 72 percent of the south 
korean students 
only 42 percent of 13yearold us students could successfully 
analyze experiments compared with 72 percent of the south korean 
students 
singapore ranks first in 12th grade biology while america is 
dead last among 13 countries 
fewer than 1 percent of us students take physics and 
chemistry while up to 25 percent of 18yearolds in canada and 
norway take the two subjects for two years each 
japan and korea tie for first in general science for 
10yearolds while america ranks eighth 
however officials of the national catholic educational 
association are quick to show that catholic math students score 36 
percent to 546 percent better than public school students and 
catholic school science scores are higher that public schools by 
439 percent in the third grade 636 percent in the seventh grade 
and 376 percent in the 11th grade 
the solution of american problems will not be solved by one 
educational system alone but every system working together 
cavazos told an audience that included the 278 st camillus 
students some of their parents and catholic education officials 
the selection of st camillus served a variety of purposes 
during celebration of national appreciation day for catholic 
schools besides having highachieving youngsters principal 
suzette chagnon estimates her students come from families 
originating in at least 25 countries 
the bush administration has been bombarded with suggested ways 
to improve academic achievement especially among members of 
minority groups since president bush called the nations governors 
to an education summit conference last year the ideas are to 
be distilled into national goals by late february 
american students attend school about 180 days per year while 
europeans typically attend 220 days the japanese 240 days and 
south koreans 250 days per year senate democratic leader george 
mitchell has pointed out 
scott thomson executive director of the national association of 
secondary school principals says that in germany radio and 
television programs on math and science supplement school work in 
south korea 71 percent of the 13yearold students watch science 
programs compared with only 37 percent in america 
at about that age many american students fail to keep an 
active interest in science said thomson schools need to work 
harder to make science attractive but other institutions in 
society must support this effort 
thomson added that in a 1987 survey of 3000 high school 
sophomores who were asked whether my parents think science is a 
very important subject 57 percent said no

thomas j donahue president of the trade group said the step 
which would require action by the states or cooperation by truck 
stops is part of an industry effort to identify and fire truckers 
who drink or use drugs while driving 
but donahue acknowleged at a news conference that the industry 
is trying to avoid the imposition of federal regulations mandating 
the use of expensive breathalyzers to detect alcohol consumption 
in comments filed wednesday with the department of 
transportation the association said that compelling all trucking 
companies to buy individual breathalyzers to test drivers could 
cost from 510 million to 850 million 
attaching breathalyzers to the ignition on each truck to prevent 
use of the vehicle if alcohol consumption was detected could cost 
close to 2 billion the association said 
donahue said alcohol and drug testing should be conducted during 
statemandated roadside checks 
blowing in an apparatus installed in the truck to see if you 
can drive doesnt make sense he said 
cost is a huge factor donahue said adding that alcohol and 
drug testing conducted solely by trucking companies would also 
prove to be a considerable administrative burden 
we want the roads safe thats good business good politics 
for us but we dont want it stupid 
the american people have the right to believe that the driver 
of an 80000 pound vehicle is sober donahue said adding that 
the 5 million truckers already are forbidden to drink or use drugs 
on the job or to have alcohol in their trucks 
it doesnt make sense to sell it to them he said about 
sales at truck stops its an unnecessary temptation to the 
drivers 
donahue said the association will seek the support of the 
national association of truck stop operators at its annual 
convention in las vegas on thursday 
he said he believes that alcohol and drug abuse is a relatively 
small problem in the trucking industry far less than for drivers 
as a whole but he said there was room for improvement and that the 
industry should show no tolerance for those who break the rules

distribution of this weeks edition of 
newsweek magazine has been delayed because a map depicts large 
parts of the jammukashmir region as pakistani territory a senior 
customs official said wednesday 
india and pakistan both claim jammukashmir the 43yearold 
dispute heated up again when india launched a crackdown jan 20 
against kashmiri moslems who want to secede from india 
the customs official speaking on condition of anonymity said 
the 10000 copies of newsweek that arrived at bombay airport early 
wednesday have not been impounded but he said a process often used 
to speed up clearance for weekly magazines is not being used to 
clear the newsweek issue 
normally consignments must be cleared against a bill of entry 
a procedure that can take up to two days in cases considered 
urgent the consignments are cleared faster with an understanding 
that bill of entry formalities will be completed later 
this is a facility extended in rare cases not as a matter of 
right but for convenience the customs official said 
in previous disputes over maps in foreign publications india 
has allowed the books or magazines in question to enter the country 
after stamping them with notations that the borders are neither 
correct nor authenticated 
there was no indication whether this would happen to the 
newsweek map 
newsweek is distributed in india by living media india ltd a

the major powers new blueprint for peace in 
cambodia through unsupervised disarmament and preparation for 
free elections won initial backing in congress wednesday 
two house subcommittees endorsed a resolution strongly 
supporting the proposal for interim un supervision and 
administration after chairmen of both panels described it as the 
best hope for ending cambodias bloodshed and blocking the return 
of the communist khmer rouge 
the legislation was sent with unanimous voicevote endorsements 
to the full foreign affairs committee on what congressional aides 
called a fast track aimed at getting approval of both houses of 
congress before secretary of state james bakers february meeting 
in moscow with soviet foreign minister eduard sheverdnadze 
the resolution would have congress reject major rival proposals 
that deadlocked last summers international conference on cambodia 
allowing the southeast asian country to slide into revived civil 
war 
one would have given cambodia a fourfaction interim government 
led by usbacked prince norodom sihanouk and including the khmer 
rouge blamed for more than 1 million cambodian deaths during their 
197578 rule the other would have allowed premier hun sens 
vietnaminstalled government in phonm penh to continue ruling until 
the elections 
sihanouks fourparty proposal is not an acceptable basis for 
negotiations because it would legitimize the khmer rouge and 
allow it to subvert the interim government said the resolution it 
added that letting hun sens regime to stay in power would 
legitimize an illegitimate government and undermine confidence in 
the elections 
anything less than a strong international presence could pave 
the way for a return to power of the genocidal pol pot leader of 
the khmer rouge said the human rights subcommittee chairman 
democrat gus yatron 
the resolution might produce some positive action by 
sihanouk to end his controversial alliance with the khmer rouge or 
it could maybe mean the end for him yatron said in answer to a 
reporter 
asianpacific subcommittee chairman stephen solarz was chief 
sponsor of the resolution backing the un formula framed by the 
five permanent security members meeting in paris two weeks ago 
along lines proposed by australia the five permament members are 
the united states soviet union china britain and france

an american legion post is dropping its 
sponsorship of a bagpipe band after 42 years because a band member 
was a conscientious objector to the vietnam war 
charlie mcelwain 43 a seventh day baptist requested medical 
or noncombat duties instead of military service when he was 
drafted his draft board instead asked him to work two years at 
memorial general hospital in elkins 
american legion post 29 learned last year that mcelwain was a 
conscientious objector and in august asked him to withdraw from the 
27member west virginia highlander bagpipe band 
the state and national constitutions of the american legion 
say that no person can be associated with the american legion who 
has not offered himself to the military in an unqualified state 
said post 29 band committee chairman robert magos 
if you go in there and say i wont do this and i wont do 
that and i wont fight and i wont carry a gun then you do not 
qualify under the constitution of the american legion magos said 
i believe its discrimination against my religion and my 
freedoms as an american said mcelwain who said his ancestors 
came to this country in 1745 
the band marches in parades and has played at everything from 
funerals and weddings to the apple blossom festival in virginia 
last month the post passed a set of rules the band would have 
to live by for continued support including one that all band 
members be approved by legion members 
band members refused and post 29 dropped its sponsorship 
including the bands right to hold a weekly bingo game at the 
legion hall under the legion posts state bingo license 
band pipe major tom mclaughlin said the bingo game which post 
29 has taken over raised about 15000 a year 
mcelwain said the community stands behind him in the dispute 
everybody ive talked to has supported me one fellow i work 
with was a full colonel in one of the services he said he 
supported me 100 percent mcelwain said 
magos said the legion post had to take over the bands saturday 
night bingo fundraiser in october to ensure that it was run 
according to state law 
people were getting paid to run the bingo games which is 
outside the state law magos said we repeatedly told the band 
not to do it any more to no avail and we had to take some 
action 
but mclaughlin said post officials were just looking for an 
excuse to take over the game 
we never broke the law they just wanted the money from the 
bingo game mclaughlin said 
i dont think charlies conscientious objector status has a 
thing to do with what theyre doing he said i think that was 
just a smoke screen to get at the money 
mclaughlin said inquiries have been made about other groups 
sponsoring the band but nothing has been signed were trying to 
set ourselves up just to keep ourselves going and anything beyond 
that we give that back to charity he said 
i think at the beginning my status was a way of getting at 
the money but i think they eventually decided they needed to get 
me too mcelwain said 
despite the dispute the american legion has continued to let 
the band use its hall for practice

the three largest political parties 
agreed wednesday in an apparent effort at national unity that the 
next president should have a coalition cabinet 
the agreement among the liberal conservative and patriotic 
union parties will apply to the person who is elected may 27 and 
takes office aug 7 
president virgilio barco a liberal has earned international 
praise for his war on drug traffickers but squabbling among the 
three parties has cost him support at home 
colombias constitution limits a president to one term of four 
years 
former president misael pastrana head of the conservative 
party proposed the coalition cabinet earlier this month 
former president julio cesar turbay of the liberals and diego 
montana cuellar leader of the patriotic union sent open letters 
of agreement wednesday 
nothing has been said about how many of the 13 cabinet posts 
each party would get 
in 1958 in an effort to end a civil war that had taken more 
than 200000 lives the conservatives and liberals agreed to 
alternate in the presidency for 16 years 
after the 1976 presidential election the two parties continued 
with another part of the agreement that assured both of cabinet 
representation barco ended that last year when he reorganized the 
cabinet and gave all the ministries to liberals 
the patriotic union is a marxist coalition organized five years 
ago by leftist guerrillas who accepted pardons from the government 
of president belisario betancur 
when he proposed the coalition cabinet pastrana also suggested 
a national plebiscite on constitutional reforms political leaders 
have suggested reform of colombias court system and allowing the 
president more power in emergencies like the drug war 
there also have been proposals that presidents be allowed more 
than one term 
montana cuellar said in his letter to pastrana that he supported 
a plebiscite but turbay of the liberals said he doubted agreement 
on what should be included could be reached before the may 27 
election 
in london amnesty international expressed concern wednesday 
about the increasing number of people missing in colombia 
including 42 farm workers reported kidnapped jan 14 
it said the workers were seized by 40 armed men some wearing 
military uniforms at pueblo bello in northwestern colombia the 
village is in the uraba banana plantation scene of heavy fighting 
the past few months between government forces and leftist 
guerrillas 
amnesty said the workers were tied up and loaded into two 
trucks which drove away witnesses said the assailants set fire to 
several houses and other buildings before leaving the statement 
added 
gov herran de montoya of uraba said the kidnappers apparently 
were guerrillas but colombian radio networks that sent reporters 
to the town said they appeared to be members of a rightwing death 
squad there has been no word on the fate of the kidnapped people 
death squads have killed more than 1000 people the past four 
years a government investigation determined there were more than 
100 such squads in colombia and most were run by drug traffickers

president bushs 1991 budget came under 
renewed congressional attack on wednesday with critics brandishing 
figures that called into question 37 billion of the deficit 
reduction being claimed by the administration 
the analysis done by the bipartisan congressional budget 
office said that the deficit for next year without policy 
changes would total 138 billion not the 101 billion claimed by 
the administration 
cbo director robert d reischauer said that 26 billion of the 
higher deficit estimate was accounted for by using a less 
optimistic forecast on economic growth and interest rates the 
other 11 billion was attributed to higher projections on 
government spending in such areas as the savings and loan bailout 
and health care 
the growth forecast is critical to the governments revenue 
assumptions while the interest rate forecast affects estimates of 
how much the government will have to spend to finance the 28 
trillion national debt 
by using higher growth and lower interest rate assumptions than 
the cbo and most private economists the administration was able to 
come up with a starting deficit of 101 billion next year compared 
to the cbos 138 billion figure 
that means that the administration was only required to produce 
37 billion in savings to meet the legal requirement of proposing a 
budget with a 64 billion deficit in the 1991 budget year which 
starts next october 
by using the cbos assumptions which track the consensus 
forecast of private economists the administration would have had 
to double the amount of spending cuts or tax increases needed to 
meet the grammrudman deficit target 
house budget chairman leon panetta dcalif said that he could 
not remember such a wide disparity between the administrations 
economic assumptions and the cbo 
we are facing a terrible credibility problem with the american 
people on the base of these estimates panetta said 
congress is free to adopt either the cbo estimate or the 
assumptions in the bush budget in drawing up its own spending plan 
but the administrations economic assumptions are required to be 
used in determining whether acrosstheboard spending cuts will be 
triggered if the deficit is not reduced enough 
both budget director richard darman and michael boskin chairman 
of the presidents council of economic advisers were sharply 
questioned about the economic assumptions during separate 
appearances on thursday 
boskin appearing before the house budget committee said that 
the economy was going through a sluggish period at present with 
growth slumping to an anemic rate of just 05 percent in the final 
three months of 1990 but he predicted a rebound would occur in 
coming months 
he did not rule out however the possibility that growth as 
measured by the gross national product might dip below 1 percent 
in the current januarymarch quarter 
under the grammrudman law two consecutive quarters of growth 
below 1 percent would require lawmakers to vote on suspending the 
deficit reduction targets for 1991 
boskin said congress should not suspend the deficit targets 
especially if there were signals that growth was beginning to 
rebound because it could send a signal that the governments 
deficitfighting resolve was weakening 
a suspension of grammrudman could have very unfavorable 
impacts on financial markets and cause interest rates to rise he 
said 
darman testifying before the senate budget committee was 
hammered by democrats who described the budget as unrealistic in 
its economic assumptions and in its call for 292 billion for the 
military 
this is a menu of cold war leftovers and warmedover reagan 
said sen james sasser dtenn chairman of the committee 
im not at all sure we are going to get a budget agreement 
unless the rhetoric turns down said sen pete v domenici of new 
mexico senior republican on the panel 
darman denied the budget ignores the movement toward democracy 
in eastern europe which many lawmakers view as requiring less 
military spending the reality is that this is a budget which 
proposes a 26 percent real cut in military spending in the first 
year and a 2 percent real cut every year thereafter he said 
i do not regard this as a serious budget said sen bennett 
johnston dla he asked darman when do we get down to the 
serious business of getting together with the white house and 
negotiating a compromise 
wed be prepared to start at 10 oclock tonight after the 
presidents speech darman replied referring to bushs state of 
the union address

the wisconsin assembly approved a parental 
consent bill for minors obtaining abortions wednesday a day after 
it defeated an attempt to repeal a dormant law that penalizes 
doctors who perform abortions 
antiabortion forces said the two votes were overwhelming 
victories for their national movement but prochoice leaders 
while conceding defeat predicted the actions would help them 
unseat lawmakers in the fall elections 
we will remember in november denise matyka a prochoice 
leader and past president of wisconsin national organization for 
women told a rally outside the capitol hours after the consent 
bill was approved we will show the politicians that a vote 
against reproductive choice is a vote against the will of the 
people 
the consent bill which requires girls under 18 to get the 
permission of at least one parent or a judge before having an 
abortion now advances to the senate where lawmakers warned it 
likely would be stalled in committee 
we will not move too hastily on this matter senate 
president fred risser said wednesday noting the nineweek 
legislative session ends march 23 
susan armacost legislative director of wisconsin right to life 
inc said the assembly vote to delay the repeal bill and pass the 
consent measure was obviously a bitter defeat for proabortion 
forces 
she said her group would press for senate action on the parental 
consent measure this bill is too important to be delayed it 
already has been delayed too long 
but state rep robert welch an antiabortion leader in the 
assembly said he wasnt optimistic about winning senate approval 
this session 
assembly speaker thomas a loftus criticized the consent bill 
it fails in the areas of reality compassion and common 
sense loftus told the assembly before the final vote its 
designed to get this state to the extreme side of the antiabortion 
movement 
loftus said a provision in the bill defines abortion for minors 
differently than it is defined in other statutes 
abortion is the use of any instrument medicine drug or any 
other substance or device with intent to terminate the pregnancy of 
a minor the bill said 
this bill is designed to outlaw contraceptives loftus said 
adding that the provision would include experimental drugs such as 
a french pill to induce abortion and the morningafter pill 
the assembly voted 5739 tuesday against repealing a dormant 
state law that provides criminal penalties for performing 
abortions the law was rendered unenforceable by the us supreme 
courts 1973 roe vs wade ruling that legalized abortion 
abortion opponents said they want to keep the law on the books 
in hope the roe vs wade decision will someday be overturned 
welch said the votes on the two bills were important because 
they marked the first time a state legislature acted on the 
abortion issue since the us supreme court ruled in a missouri 
case last summer that states could have greater latitude in 
regulating abortions 
this sends a clear signal nationally because it marked such a 
resounding victory welch said i think this was a shot heard 
round the world 
but state rep david clarenbach hailed the repeal vote despite 
the defeat saying a year ago the same bill would have received far 
fewer votes in favor 
the trend is running against abortion opponents said 
clarenbach the assemblys president pro tem the legislature is 
in the process of becoming prochoice

the major opposition party warned 
wednesday that romania will wind up with a new communist 
dictatorship unless elections set for may are delayed four months 
to give people time to absorb all the changes 
the reaction from the national peasants party was wary and from 
some other opponents downright hostile to tuesdays announcement by 
the revolutionary government that it planned to keep on governing 
while competing in elections 
the selfappointed national salvation front offered to share 
power and establish a separate political wing to represent it in 
romanias first free elections since world war ii 
this is illegal said liberal party organizer nicolae 
enescu if it takes part in the elections and represents the 
interests of the state it seems like a dictatorship again 
valentin gabrielescu chief spokesman for the peasants party 
said the elections should be postponed from may 20 until september 
in order to try to educate the romanian people about the 
electoral process 
after half a century of dictatorial rule these people are 
completely confused it will take time to educate them he added 
growing political anxiety has replaced the euphoria that 
followed the ouster of communist dictator nicolae ceausescu 
overthrown in a popular uprising last month and executed dec 25 
with his politically powerful wife elena 
the tensions were highlighted by pro and antigovernment 
demonstrations this week sychronized attacks on 27 peasants party 
headquarters nationwide on monday and political arguments that 
continue to draw crowds on bucharests freezing street corners 
the opposition lays much of the blame on the national salvation 
front ruling by decree since it took power in the chaos that 
followed the revolution ending ceausescus 24year rule 
enemies of the front claim its 11member ruling council has 
manipulated the electorate through its control of the news media

the may elections 
maybe in the fall well be able to win the election 
otherwise we will have a new communist government and interim 
president ion iliescu will be one of the most beloved sons of the 
country gabrielescu said derisively using the term the 
prerevolutionary press frequently bestowed on ceausescu 
the way is very difficult because we have 40 years of 
political vacuum concurred peasants party president corneliu 
coposu a 74yearold church canon lawyer who was imprisoned from 
194674 by successive communist leaders 
in a response to criticism the front disclosed tuesday it had 
split in two creating a provisional national council to run 
romania until the elections in tandem with other political parties 
and converting the front into a political organization to field 
candidates 
the front will participate in the vote senior front 
official silviu brucan said in an interview in wednesdays romania 
libera daily reiterating his organizations intention to run the 
elections 
it was the fronts reversal of its pledge not to run in 
elections and questions about whether it could fairly administer 
an election in which it was also competing that drew heavy fire 
including condemnation from potential western aid donors 
ana blandiana a leading poet and former dissident resigned 
from the front citing shattered illusions romania libera 
said she was the fourth leading front member to step down 
while the national peasants party branded as impudent the 
fronts transformation into both a political party and a 
government it also called it a gain for the opposition 
our proposal was agreed to in principle so the first point is 
a win said gabrielescu 
he said the next major battle for the opposition will be to win 
twothirds of the seats in the projected 100seat provisional 
national council 
the most important thing is simply the presence of parties in 
the council agreed sergiu cunescu president of the social 
democratic party 
he expressed optimism that splitting up of the front would ease 
political tensions 
the peasants party the social democrats and the liberals the 
three major opposition groups say most of the 30 or so opposition 
parties that have sprung up since the revolution are fakes backed 
by the front to tout its party line under other names 
with 260000 members the peasants party is the largest 
opposition organization 
the united states took aim at the national salvation front on 
tuesday 
state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler said in 
washington we are deeply troubled by what appears to be active 
intimidation of legitimate organizations which are seeking a 
legitimate independent role in romanias new political order

rep dan rostenkowski the senior tax writer 
in congress said wednesday he remains to be convinced that the 
federal tax system is in need of any major change 
rostenkowski an illinois democrat who chairs the house ways and 
means committee cited a cut in the capitalgains tax a major 
goal of president bush as a prime example of something he feels 
is not needed 
in a speech to the tax council a business group rostenkowski 
compared advocates of a lower capitalgains tax to fuzzyminded 
peace advocates who think that we could somehow wish the creation 
of a stable world that would allow us all to disarm 
both have a deep faith that belies historic experience he 
said both have a fervent belief that the wish is the father of 
the deed and unfortunately both are dead wrong 
capital gains are profits from the sale of stock and other 
investments since a lower tax rate for capital gains was repealed 
in 1986 rostenkowski noted the value of stocks on the new york 
stock exchange has risen 40 percent 
i am not claiming that our tax laws have boosted the market 
rostenkowski said to the contrary i am arguing that the market 
has a dynamic of its own that is generally independent of our tax 
laws 
the chairman also expressed his distaste for special tax breaks 
offered as incentives to encourage saving ive become convinced 
that most tax incentives simply dont work he said and 
the few that do work dont work very well 
bush is asking congress to create a new savings plan that would 
allow a couple with income of 120000 or less to avoid tax on 
interest earned on special accounts held at least seven years 
other savings plans built around tax breaks have done little to 
boost the nations low rate of personal saving rostenkowski said 
rostenkowski said he is open to suggestions for modernizing the 
tax law but i am not convinced that our tax system is 
fundamentally broken he said thus i have little sympathy with 
those who keep coming up with plans to fix it

the chairman of the metropolitan transportation 
authority announced wednesday that the mta is appealing a judges 
decision that struck down a rule against panhandling in the subways 
begging lends an air of disorder said mta chairman robert 
kiley 
us district judge leonard sand then issued a partial stay on 
an injunction that barred the mta from enforcing the rule sand put 
back into effect pending the appeal one of his earlier orders 
that allowed begging in the subway system except on subway cars 
narrow platforms and 25 feet from token booths 
kiley said he believes sand was wrong when he decided friday 
that begging in public places is free speech protected by the first 
amendment 
the ruling kiley said was incorrect unreasonable and 
insensitive of the rights of the millions of passengers who use the 
subways 
the mta set into motion the appeal process by filing a notice of 
appeal with the 2nd us circuit court of appeals a motion to stay 
the order is pending before sand who was to hear arguments later 
wednesday 
sands ruling stemmed from a classaction lawsuit brought in 
november by the legal action customs official said wednesday 
india and pakistan both claim jammukashmir the 43yearold 
dispute heated up again when india launched a crackdown jan 20 
against kashmiri moslems who want to secede from india 
the customs official speaking on condition of anonymity said 
the 10000 copies of newsweek that arrived at bombay airport early 
wednesday have not been impounded but he said a process often used 
to speed up clearance for weekly magazines is not being used to 
clear the newsweek issue 
normally consignments must be cleared against a bill of entry 
a procedure that can take up to two days in cases considered 
urgent the consignments are cleared faster with an understanding 
that bill of entry formalities will be completed later 
this is a facility extended in rare cases not as a matter of 
right but for convenience the customs official said 
in previous disputes over maps in foreign publications india 
has allowed the books or magazines in question to enter the country 
after stamping them with notations that the borders are neither 
correct nor authenticated 
there was no indication whether this would happen to the 
newsweek map 
newsweek is distributed in india by living media india ltd a 
company spokesman declined comment on the customs action

the government wednesday called for slight 
increases in average minimum gasoline mileage for pickup trucks 
vans and utility vehicles for the 1992 through 1994 model years 
the proposed standards announced by the national highway 
traffic safety administration would apply to vehicles with gross 
weight ratings of up to 8500 pounds 
currently each companys light truck fleet manufactured in the 
1990 model year must average 20 miles per gallon the required 
average for the 1991 model year is 202 mpg 
the agency proposed a 1992 model year standard between 202 and 
21 mpg a 1993 standard between 202 and 215 mpg and a 1994 
standard between 202 and 22 mpg 
the announcement opens a 30day period for public comment after 
which the agency will make a final decision on fuel economy 
standards for the three years 
we have taken a careful look at the manufacturers fuel 
economy capabilities and have analyzed their current projections 
and underlying product plans administrator jerry r curry said 
we are asking for more information on possible technological 
improvements such as in engines and transmissions 
federal law requires the agency to establish average fuel 
economy standards for light trucks each year a manufacturer that 
fails to meet the standard after taking credits into account is 
subject to civil penalties 
the agency is required to set standards at the maximum 
feasible level after considering economic practicability 
technological feasibility the need to conserve energy and the 
effect of other federal motor vehicle standards on fuel economy 
the highway safety agency also said it would stop setting 
separate standards for twowheeldrive and fourwheeldrive fleets 
because nearly all manufacturers have chosen a combined fleet 
standard

a pay raise goes into effect thursday for 
members of congress with the senate receiving a slightly higher 
boost than the house 
federal judges and senior executive branch employees also will 
be getting costofliving increases at the same rate as house 
members about 8 percent 
rankandfile house members salaries will go from 89500 a 
year to 96600 senators now paid the same as house members will 
get a raise to 98400 
the reason for the difference is that the house last year 
approved a comprehensive payandethics package that includes an 
additional 25 percent pay boost effective next year in return for 
the elimination of the widely criticized practice of lawmakers 
accepting speaking fees from interest groups 
but when the measure went to the other side of the capitol 
senators balked and wound up accepting instead a 10 percent raise 
and a cut in the limit on their speaking fees from 35800 to 
26568 
for this year house members can keep 26850 in honoraria the 
same as in 1989 
while senators are slightly ahead in the salary game for now 
the house will leap ahead on jan 1 1991 when its next raise 
carefully timed to come after novembers elections takes them to 
120700 plus a yettobedetermined costofliving increment 
many in congress believe that the discrepancy will prompt the 
senate to address the poltically painful pay issue again this year

some liberal communists indicated 
wednesday there may be a split in the party but one said his 
reformist wing would not leave until the stalinists throw us 
out 
on the second day of a party congress the reformers faced a 
large conservative majority that entrenched itself during the 35 
years todor zhivkov ruled the country before his downfall in 
november 
uncertainty also appeared in the fledgling noncommunist 
opposition an alliance called the union of democratic forces 
which seemed divided over when free elections should be held the 
communists insisted they take place no later than may but many in 
the union want more time to organize 
labor unrest continued emphasizing the urgency of economic and 
social problems most of the unprecedented strikes are for higher 
pay 
teachers walked out as the congress opened tuesday miners who 
struck last week resumed work wednesday but continued negotiations 
with the government 
doctors struck for one hour tuesday two hours wednesday and 
announced plans to quit working for three hours thursday they want 
the health minister and his deputies to resign 
state television said elevator engineers planned to strike but 
gave no details of their demands 
official media carried a report quoting agricultural workers as 
saying they would strike feb 5 unless the state paid adequate 
prices for their crops 
party chief petar mladenov and other leaders held out the 
possibility wednesday of sharing some power with the oppposition 
and called for a government of national concord 
unlike their comrades elsewhere in rapidly changing eastern 
europe bulgarias communists face a relatively weak opposition and 
have not relinquished much power since mladenov replaced zhivkov on 
nov 10 
at the congress party reformers appeared undecided on strategy 
dragomir draganov whose reformist wing is called democratic 
forum told reporters his group would stay in the party until the 
stalinists throw us out but nikolai vassilev of the alternative 
socialist association left open the possibility of a split after 
the congress 
we cannot give a positive answer vassilev said he added 
that the alternative socialists would decide what to do at a 
separate conference feb 11 
delegate petar emil mitev of the reformist group called road to 
europe said nothing fatal will happen if we the communists go 
into opposition for a while socialism will not die 
where the opposition stood on the election was equally unclear 
a statement carried by radio said petar beron a leading member 
of the union of democratic forces agreed to elections in may a 
subsequent union statement read on television by spokesman stefan 
stoyanov however said conditions were not right for elections to 
be held so soon 
in the statement read by stoyanov the union said its demand 
that the old party system be separated from the state had not been 
fulfilled 
the union which is engaged in negotiations with the communists 
and other groups said the communist party must create real 
conditions for an end to its monopoly on culture and the economy 
on possible particiaption in a provisional coalition before 
elections it said the terms and the power of such a government 
must be clarified 
party leaders moved the party congress up from 1991 after 
bulgaria was caught up in the tide of political change sweeping 
eastern europe it is scheduled to end thursday

relations between management and registered 
nurses at the va hospital in albuquerque nm have become so bad 
that outside counseling is needed according to a report released 
wednesday 
the general accounting office the investigative arm of 
congress said in its report that there had been progress in a 
number of areas that registered nurses had complained about 
shortages of nurses pay problems excessive overtime lack of 
promotions and excessive disciplinary actions 
however two years of conflict means it will be difficult to 
make the participants believe they can deal with the issues and 
each other in an effective manner the report said 
to facilitate this process we believe than an independent 
human resource specialist should be brought in to enhance the 
dialogue between the two groups it said 
hospital spokesman ron lopez said officials there had not seen 
the gao report and he could not comment on whether recommended 
changes had been implemented 
veterans secretary edward j derwinski said in a statement 
included in the report that some of the problems the nurses have 
complained about deal with the rights of management and fall 
outside unionmanagement bargaining 
among the issues derwinski said the va had no obligation to 
negotiate with the nurses over were temporary assignment to another 
unit or ward for eight hours or less and the system of classifying 
patients according to their nursing care needs 
the report was requested in october 1988 by sen pete v 
domenici dnm as a result of complaints by nurses who are 
members of carpenters union local 2208 
the hospital serves an area of new mexico and western texas that 
serves about 200000 veterans 
the gao study was done in the first six months of 1989 
administrator andrew montano has resigned since then but no 
permanent director has been appointed

new homes sales in 1989 held back in part by 
a 96 percent decline in december posted their worst record in 
five years the government said wednesday but some analysts said 
falling mortgage rates should boost sales in 1990 
the year wasnt a gangbuster by any means said richard 
peach an econmist for the mortgage bankers association but i 
wouldnt characterize it as a disaster either 
peach and others said they were confident that rates will be 
coming down in the not too distant future resulting in renewed 
sales 
the commerce department said new singlefamily homes were sold 
at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 629000 units in december 
after jumping 93 percent in november 
analysts said decembers decline was due to severe weather in 
much of the country and to a correction from novembers 
unsustainable pace 
december sales brought to 650000 units the total sold in 1989 
the worst year since 639000 homes were sold in 1984 the 1989 
total was 38 percent less than the 676000 units sold in 1988 
the construction industry was hampered through much of 1989 by 
high interest rates 
the mortgage bankers are forecasting sales in the 
670000680000 range this year predicated on further declines 
in mortgage rates peach said 
but rates were again on the rise in january david berson chief 
economist for the federal national mortgage association said the 
rates probably would hold down any january improvement 
robert villanueva director of forecasting for the national 
association of home builders had similar worries 
our concerns are not really with december sales but with 
the fact that interest rates have moved up rather smartly in 
january he said 
on a regional basis new home sales in december rose at an 
annual rate of 4 percent in the northeast to 105000 units but 
fell elsewhere sales plummeted 283 percent to 91000 units in the 
midwest and were off 91 percent to 190000 units in the west and 
62 percent to 243000 units in the south 
yet sales for the year were up 62 percent to 103000 units in 
the midwest but down 119 percent to 89000 units in the 
northeast 62 percent to 259000 units in the south and 15 
percent to 199000 units in the west 
the commerce department also reported the median price of a new 
home rose 41 percent in december to 130100 and 67 percent in 
1989 to 121000 the median means that half of the homes cost 
more half less 
on the other hand the average price of a home in december rose 
51 percent to 159800 it was up 8 percent to 147700 for the 
year 
in another housing report wednesday the national association of 
realtors said december declines in mortgage rates helped boost its 
index measuring the ability of the typical american family to buy 
an existing home 
the index measured 1082 in december meaning that a family 
earning the national median income of 33600 had 1082 percent of 
the income needed to qualify for conventional financing covering 80 
percent of a home priced at 92500 the median existing home price 
for that month the index was at 1055 in november

gen michel aouns soldiers attacked the 
lebanese forces militia wednesday to try to gain full control of 
the christian zone police reported scores of casualties and a 
nurse described a morgue packed with bodies 
police said at least 35 people were killed and 85 wounded in 
daylong tank and artillery battles that sent stray shells crashing 
in moslem west beirut and its southern slums which were not 
involved in the fighting 
reports indicated aouns 20000 troops led by the ustrained 
8th brigade had the upper hand in tank and artillery battles in 
the 310squaremile enclave where 1 million christians live 
police said the militias overland supply lines were cut but it 
has sea links between its headquarters in east beirut and the ports 
of byblos and jounieh north of the capital 
the lebanese forces however said in a latenight communique it 
had captured aouns naval base in kaslik and the sarba helicopter 
base near the port of jounieh 
meanwhile shiite moslem militias fought in southern lebanon 
continuing the latest round of their intermittent struggle for 
supremacy among the 12 million shiites lebanons largest sect 
four people were reported wounded raising the toll to 98 killed 
and 280 wounded in the battle that began dec 23 between the 
fundamentalist hezbollah which is loyal to iran and amal a 
mainstream militia backed by syria 
the fighting in the christian zone was the worst since february 
1989 when aouns troops last moved against the lebanese forces 
the main christian militia led by samir geagea more than 80 people 
were killed and 200 wounded in that fourday conflict 
aouns gunners in the hills east of beirut hammered geageas 
seafront headquarters in the karantina district with heavy 155mm 
howitzer barrages 
geageas fighters hit back with salvos of rockets from launchers 
that spat 40 missiles a minute on the shellwrecked presidential 
palace in suburban baabda where aoun has his headquarters 
police said both leaders were reported to be unharmed 
exploding shells and rockets streaked over the burning christian 
sector of the city and lighted up the night sky 
a police statement said at least 28 people were killed and 69 
wounded from fierce daylong battles with tanks and artillery in the 
christian sector and north lebanon 
this is an initial count the toll is definitely much higher 
as scores of other casualties were still bleeding in embattled 
areas that ambulances and rescuers could not reach the statement 
said 
at least seven civilians including a 6monthold baby were 
killed and 16 wounded by stray shells that exploded in west and 
south beirut the citys moslem sectors police said 
hospitals broadcast appeals over all christian radio stations 
for urgent blood donations to cope with what one nurse at the hotel 
dieu french missionary hospital the biggest in east beirut called 
a deluge of casualties 
the morgue is packed and dozens of wounded are bleeding on 
stretchers in corridors said the nurse who asked not to be 
identified 
stray shells exploded around the ports of beirut and jounieh 
forcing 18 ships to steam for open sea police said 
one of the injured was news photographer george samarejian of 
the independent annahar daily police said samarejian 45 was 
shot in the head and taken to the saint george hospital but no 
surgeon was immediately available to operate on him 
a police spokesman reported housetohouse combat in some 
residential areas of christian east beirut geagea said his 6000 
men were fighting for our survival 
we shall respond to each shell with 10 shells he said in a 
statement broadcast by christian radio stations we shall not 
allow those blinded by the lust for power to slaughter the lebanese 
forces 
both sides ignored ceasefire appeals from the vatican and 
lebanons maronite catholic patriarch nasrallah sfeir 
aouns headquarters said in a communique that his troops overran 
the lebanese forces seaside barracks at safra fanar mar roukos 
and nahr ibrahim a cluster of towns along a 10mile stretch of the 
highway north of beirut 
geageas headquarters denied aouns claim and the militias tv 
station showed footage of its fighters controlling aouns main air 
force base in halat and the generals sabra barracks and kaslik 
naval base 
whoever wins the battle could break the stalemate over an arab 
league peace plan aimed at ending a 15yearold civil war that has 
cost 150000 lebanese their lives 
aoun opposes the accord worked out in october because it does 
not guarantee withdrawal of syrian forces which he calls an 
occupation army aoun also refuses to recognize president elias 
hrawi who was elected as part of the accord 
geagea has neither accepted or rejected the peace accord but 
has recognized hrawi as president he and other rightwing 
christians oppose aouns rebellion 
aoun increasingly isolated and facing the prospect of a 
syrianbacked assault by the 22000 soldiers loyal to the hrawi 
government apparently felt he had to secure control of the 
christian sector 
fighting began when aouns troops attacked the lebanese forces 
after skirmishes tuesday

president bush preparing to deliver his first 
state of the union address telephoned soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachev on wednesday to propose deeper cuts in us and soviet 
combat troops in europe officials said 
bush was to announce the plan formally in a nationally broadcast 
appearance before a joint session of congress the proposal to 
reduce forces of each country to 195000 in the affected area was 
described by senior administration officials as a response to the 
rapidly falling deck of cards in eastern europe amid the 
collapse of hardline communist regimes 
the proposal won immediate praise from democrats including sen 
sam nunn chairman of the armed services committee who said it fit 
the changing circumstances in europe and the fiscal pressures at 
home 
the troopcutback plan was the surprising centerpiece of a 
speech in which bush also was to proclaim the nation in good 
health set lofty goals for americas schools and warn democrats 
not to cut social security taxes 
moreover bush was to prod congress again for action on capital 
gains tax cuts and legislation dealing with clean air child care 
and crime all of which are pending from last year 
the plan would force a cutback in the more than 265000 us 
troops in western europe and the 565000 soviet forces in central 
and eastern europe 
however there are an additional 40000 us troops in britain 
italy greece and turkey who would not be affected by the latest 
plan 
last may bush proposed a 275000 ceiling throughout all of 
europe on us and soviet forces and said negotiations to reach 
that goal should be wrapped up within a year 
the administration said soviet and us negotiators should 
proceed with talks to reach the 275000 level while holding 
parallel discussions on the deeper cuts 
a senior official said we see no reason there has to be an 
interference with reaching the 275000 level if there is we 
will put it on the back burner until we can get there 
before now bush has said he would not support further cuts 
until the current talks were wrapped up but a senior 
administration official said events were running ahead of the 
negotiations 
the 1989 proposal still under negotiation would require the 
united states to withdraw 30000 combat troops and force the 
soviets to reduce their troops by about 325000 
the official who briefed reporters on bushs speech on 
condition of anonymity called the collapse of the soviet empire 
a rapidly falling deck of cards 
on capitol hill house speaker thomas s foley dwash said 
that very substantial reductions are not only possible but i 
think inevitable 
bush sent lawrence eagleburger his deputy secretary of state 
and robert gates the deputy national security adviser to present 
his plan and seek approval from the leaders of england france 
germany and italy they returned tuesday evening with endorsements 
of bushs package the official said 
with that bush then called gorbachev to inform him of the 
proposal 
he was very appreciative of the presidents phone call and 
thought that this was the kind of attitude that was very conducive 
to good relations and he said of course that they would study the 
proposal the official said 
bush has repeatedly cautioned that there would be no immediate 
budgetary peace dividend of military savings from the changes 
in eastern europe the senior administration official said the 
deeper troop reductions would not affect that position since any 
cutbacks would have to be negotiated many analysts have said it 
costs about as much to maintain troops in europe as it does in the 
united states and real savings must come from a smaller military 
establishment 
the first hint of a new proposal came from secretary of state 
james a baker iii discussing bushs conversation with gorbachev 
baker said it had to do with some announcements that the 
president will have tonight in his state of the union message and 
beyond that i am not going to say anything further 
baker will see soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze 
and possibly gorbachev in moscow on feb 89 
on the domestic front bushs proposal for a capital gains tax 
cut had been criticized by democrats as merely a tax cut for the 
rich 
however john sununu bushs chief of staff said i think all 
of a sudden about april or may it will dawn on congress that its 
a congressional election not a presidential election year and 
that failures to get things done will be seen as failures of the 
democrat leadership in the house the democrat leadership in the 
senate he said 
bush gave a preview of his speech to republican senators and 
house members during a meeting at the white house 
afterward house minority leader bob michel rill said bush 
pledged to point out in his speech that he is opposed to a rollback 
in social security taxes as proposed by sen daniel moynihan 
dny 
referring to moynihans proposal michel said it just means 
its a nono as far as our partys concerned weve made that 
decision earlier on to fund this program adequately into the next 
century and to do violence to that just really undermines our 
credibility 
moynihan has said his proposal was prompted by concern that the 
growing social security trust fund reserves are being used to mask 
the true size of the federal deficit 
seeking to redeem his pledge to be the education president 
bush was setting a goal of lifting american students to first place 
internationally in math and science two subjects where they 
traditionally rate poorly 
for example one study has shown that 72 percent of south korean 
13yearolds can solve a math problem that only 40 percent of 
americans that age can solve 
there was a hint of this in bushs budget which proposes 230 
million a 70 percent increase in money for states to improve 
the abilities of teachers in those two disciplines 
in addition national science foundation programs for science 
math and engineering education would receive a 100 million 
increase to 460 million under bushs proposal

wednesday to try to restart peace talks between the government and 
rebels in the central american nation 
we feel positive and hopeful that we will be able to 
reestablish the dialogue process and that hopefully we will find 
that political solution that we are all anxious for in our 
country cristiani told reporters after meeting the un chief 
cristiani did not make clear if he sought a un role in 
mediating if agreement is reached to resume negotiations that broke 
off last november 
he said only that perez de cuellar will personally make all 
efforts possible to have the dialogue process reinitiated in order 
to look for a political solution to the salvadoran conflict 
a un spokesman said the secretarygeneral has been entrusted 
with the task of helping them clear the way for negotiations 
asked if that would involve a direct mediation role he said 
this is an internal salvadoran problem it is for the parties of 
el salvador to negotiate a settlement 
earlier wednesday protesters urging an end to us aid to el 
salvador confronted cristianis motorcade as it arrived at the 
united nations he entered the building from the underground 
parking garage instead of the main entrance 
police arrested 28 people on charges of disorderly conduct for 
blocking the street in front of the united nations a new york city 
police spokesman said 
about 200 demonstrators had gathered carrying banners and 
chanting slogans denouncing us aid to el salvador and accusing 
the cristiani government of sponsoring death squads 
el salvador received 378 million in us aid last year 
including 80 million in military aid over the past eight years 
the united states has provided more than 32 billion to el 
salvador including 1 billion in military equipment

their housekeeper and her daughter in san salvador on nov 16 
days after guerrillas of the leftist faribundo marti national 
liberation front or fmln launched an offensive in the capital

eds leads with soviet confirmation of helicopter delivery editing 
changes thruout adds byline 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the soviet embassy on wednesday confirmed that 
it has shipped four mi17 helicopters to nicaragua recently but 
said the aircraft were built for civilian use 
the embassy statement issued in response to news reports about 
the shipment did not rule out the possibility that the helicopters 
may be diverted for military use 
but hours earlier secretary of state james a baker said the 
soviets have given assurances that helicopters sent to nicaragua 
will not be outfitted for military purposes 
the soviet statement reaffirmed the soviet position that moscow 
has sent no weapons to nicaragua since early 1989 
the helicopter delivery was completed last week the shipment 
initally was to have been made in december but for undisclosed 
reasons the vessel carrying the aircraft returned to a soviet port 
and delivery was delayed by more than a month officials said 
baker said that mi17s in the past have been used by nicaragua 
for military purposes refitted and weapons put on them 
we have received some assurances from the soviets that 
that is not going to be the case with respect to the helicopters in 
question if it were the case as far as we are concerned the 
soviet union would not be keeping with the pledge that it has given 
us that it is not going to continue to supply lethal weapons to 
nicaragua 
the soviet statement took note of the news reports about the 
shipment pointing out that some had claimed the helicopter 
delivery violated a kremlin moratorium on arms shipments to the 
sandinistas 
in fact in accordance with the agreement between the 
governments of the ussr and nicaragua concluded in february 1988 
the soviet union has delivered to nicaragua four mi17 helicopters 
built for civilian use it said 
therefore the shipment of these helicopters doesnt go beyond 
the framework of usual commercial practice based on the existing 
obligations for supplies of civilian property 
on a related issue baker said he intends to discuss with soviet 
foreign minister eduard shevardnadze a recent soviet shipment of 
mig29 jet fighters to cuba 
columnists rowland evans and robert novack said in their column 
wednesday that six of these aircraft left for cuba in early january 
by sea and that 30 more will be sent at a later date

lightning change in the soviet bloc has 
prompted president bush to take a step he balked at just eight 
weeks ago proposing further cuts in the number of superpower 
troops in central europe 
events in eastern europe with the collapse of communist 
regimes pressure from the allies and a domestic clamor for the 
peace dividend persuaded bush to use his state of the union 
address to offer sharper reductions than envisioned in multilateral 
talks now underway in europe a senior administration official told 
reporters wednesday 
troops are the costliest item in the pentagon budget especially 
those stationed overseas and are expected to be a prime target of 
congressional budget cutters reviewing bushs new 1991 spending 
plan in hopes of finding money for favored domestic programs 
with his proposal bush also demonstrates anew that he is 
capable of springing the type of surprise he delights in 
superpower talks on cutting conventional armies in europe have 
quickened over the last 13 months after being stalled for 14 years 
while nato and the warsaw pact dickered over how many of what were 
stationed where 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev shifted the talks into 
high gear in december 1988 with his surprise announcement that he 
was cutting global soviet troop strength by 10 percent and 
withdrawing six tank divisions from europe 
nato leaders told gorbachev they wanted much sharper warsaw pact 
cuts in europe last may bush proposed that the americans and 
soviets set a ceiling of 275000 troops apiece 
more than 265000 us troops are in western europe and 565000 
soviet forces are in central and eastern europe there are an 
additional 35000 us troops in britain italy greece and turkey 
that would not be affected by bushs latest plan 
additionally gorbachev has agreed to a step that analysts 
consider more important in assuring that the soviets would not be 
able to launch a surprise attack he has accepted a nato proposal 
to cut the number of soviet tanks in central europe from 53000 to 
about 20000 while the western alliance reduces its tank arsenal 
from 23000 to 20000 
at their malta sumit in december bush and gorbachev said they 
hoped to sign the conventional force in europe talks known as cfe 
by the end of the year at a summit involving leaders of the 16 
nato and seven warsaw pact nations 
bushs proposal would be part of followup negotiations known 
among armscontrol specialists as cfe2 
at a news conference after the malta summit bush said he wanted 
to complete the first treaty before discussing its successor 
but since then poland hungary and czechoslovakia have 
announced troop cuts of their own and asked the kremlin to withdraw 
all its forces from their territory and the leader of east germany 
has said that all superpower troops could be out of europe by the 
year 2000 
it became apparent a senior administration official said 
that events in eastern europe with the collapse of communist 
regimes with discussions with eastern europeans suggesting the 
soviets ought to pull their troops out and so on that the cfe 
proposal we made last may at nato and is now being negotiated was 
perhaps not where we ought to be at the present time 
it appeared that in the area of arms control specifically 
conventional arms control in europe that events were running ahead 
of the negotiations said the source speaking on condition he 
not be further identified 
so the president asked for a review of what made sense and 
following discussions with his advisers and military leaders he 
came up with a proposal which would be designed to maintain us 
interests in europe said the official 
bushs new plan brought immediate applause from capitol hill 
sen sam nunn dga and chairman of the armed services committee 
called it very positive noting that last december he advocated 
a trooplevel reduction to between 200000 and 225000 
the senate will be receptive to it nunn said of the bush 
proposal 
the long feared soviet potential to launch a surprise attack has 
virtually disappeared over the last year said ted warner a 
military analyst at the rand corp 
the soviets have completed about half the troop and tank 
reductions that gorbachev announced in december 1988 according to 
warner and an administration analyst who also spoke on the 
condition he not be further identified 
moreover the collapse of hardline communist regimes means that 
the warsaw pact could by no means count on any contribution from 
its east european allies to mount an offensive against nato 
warner said 
when all is said and done they have lost a great deal of 
armored striking power he said 
as a result bush has decided that means us troops stationed 
in europe during the cold war can begin to come home

the three arab countries that 
brokered a lebanese peace plan want an emergency summit to discuss 
christian gen michel aouns refusal to recognize lebanese 
president elias hrawi an arab diplomat said wednesday 
the diplomat rafik alnatsheh of the palestine liberation 
organization spoke a day after an arab league panel of the three 
countries saudi arabia algeria and morocco circulated its 
latest report 
alnatsheh recognized as the ambassador of palestine by saudi 
arabia said by phone from riyadh that the group proposed an 
emergency arab summit to discuss aouns stand 
aoun says the peace plan reached in october does not contain a 
clear timetable for full withdrawal of the 40000 syrian troops in 
lebanon who originally entered the country in 1976 under a 
peacekeeping mandate from the 22member arab league 
hrawi a moslem elected to lead the new government formed under 
terms of the peace accord was quoted in a beirut interview as 
saying he welcomed a summit to consider the crisis 
other diplomats said the proposal was expected to pick up steam 
in coming days and that a date and venue would be decided in 
contacts by the league headquarters in tunis with arab capitals 
there were persistent reports in progovernment newspapers in 
the persian gulf arab countries that egypt was likely to host the 
summit in february or early march 
the same diplomats said a summit would also deal with egyptian 
plans for a palestinianisraeli dialogue to break the stalemated 
middle east peacemaking process 
also on the agenda is the outcry from the plo and arab states 
against resettlement of soviet and eastern european jews in the 
israeliheld west bank and gaza strip 
the arab league peace plan was endorsed by the lebanese 
parliament members at a threeweek conference in the saudi mountain 
resort of taif in october 
parliament then met in lebanon to elect a president of the 
republic rene mouawad and swiftly reconvened to elect hrawi 
after mouawad was assassinated by remotecontrolled bomb 
when the taif agreement was concluded saudi leaders pledged in 
the name of the threeman committee to remain in close touch with 
lebanese leaders until a full settlement was reached 
they affirmed that syria had insisted it was not interested in 
remaining in lebanon indefinitely they said the panel would work 
to have an arab summit conference guarantee full implementation of 
the taif accord implicitly meaning the syrian pullout

jurors on wednesday found paula marie sims 
eligible for the death penalty for the murder of her 6weekold 
daughter and now must decide whether to sentence her to death by 
lethal injection 
a redeyed mrs sims who contends a masked gunman abducted 
heather lee sims last year as well as her firstborn daughter in 
1986 displayed no reaction when the decision was announced 
the madison county circuit court jury which deliberated about 
two hours will hear further arguments before considering whether 
to impose the death penalty or a lesser sentence 
this third phase of the trial begins thursday and will center 
on any mitigating or aggravating circumstances said assistant 
madison county states attorney donald weber 
weber and defense attorney donald groshong both declined to 
comment on wednesdays decision 
weber argued wednesday that the death penalty was warranted in 
the april 29 suffocation of heather lee sims because the slaying 
was planned and the crime was cruel brutal grossly ruthless and 
devoid of mercy and compassion 
under illinois law prosecutors may seek the death penalty under 
certain circumstances including cases in which the victim is under 
12 years old and the killing is particularly brutal or in which 
there are multiple victims 
mrs sims 30 of alton contends a masked gunman abducted 
heather lee and three years earlier 13dayold loralei 
no murder charges have been filed in loraleis death but mrs 
sims faces trial in jersey county on charges of obstruction of 
justice and concealment of a homicide in connection with the death 
mrs sims continues to maintain her innocence groshong told the 
panel wednesday 
but he also argued we cannot say the death of this child was 
premeditated prolonged or torturous in the pecking order of 
evil smothering is usually considered more merciful than other 
forms of killing 
the jury tuesday found mrs sims guilty of firstdegree murder 
obstructing justice and concealing a homicide in heather lees 
death 
mrs sims and her husband robert reported heather abducted 
april 29 from their home her body was found may 3 in a trash 
barrel across the mississippi river in nearby west alton mo an 
autopsy indicated she had been suffocated and that her body was 
then frozen

frantisek pitra the last old 
guard communist left in power by the peaceful revolution resigned 
wednesday as leader of the czech republic the official news agency 
ctk reported 
the 57yearold pitra also is expected to give up his job as 
deputy premier after parliament approves his resignation from the 
czech post 
he had strong links with the orthodox communist leadership that 
ruled from 1968 when soviet tanks crushed a reform movement until 
the prodemocracy revolution last fall he lost his seat on the 
party politburo in november along with party leader milos jakes 
and others 
pitra survived as czech premier however after making his 
republics government the first in czechoslovakia since 1948 that 
was not dominated by communists that paved the way for similar 
changes at the federal level 
the czech premier automatically is deputy premier of the 
national government 
ctk did not give the reason for pitras resignation which came 
a day after the communists ended 40 years of dominance in 
parliament by giving more than 100 of their seats to prodemocracy 
groups the realignment completed an effort to include those groups 
in parliament before the free elections set for june 8 
parliament swore in 120 new deputies tuesday their troops out and so 
on that the cfe 
proposal we made last may at nato and is now being negotiated was 
perhaps not where we ought to be at the present time 
it appeared that in the area of arms control specifically 
conventional arms control in europe that events were running ahead

so the president asked for a review of what made sense and 
following discussions with his advisers and military leaders he 
came up with a proposal which would be designed to maintain us 
interests in europe said the official 
bushs new plan brought immediate applause from capitol hill 
sen sam nunn dga and chairman of the armed services committee 
called it very positive noting that last december he advocated 
a trooplevel reduction to between 200000 and 225000 
i believe that it makes the arms control proposal that we have 
on the table much more relevant to the changing circumstances in 
europe nunn said the senate will be receptive to it 
the longfeared soviet potential to launch a surprise attack has 
virtually disappeared over the last year said ted warner a 
military analyst at the rand corp 
the soviets have completed about half the troop and tank 
reductions that gorbachev announced in december 1988 according to 
warner and an administration analyst who also spoke on the 
condition he not be further identified 
moreover the collapse of hardline communist regimes means that 
the warsaw pact could by no means count on any contribution from 
its east european allies to mount an offensive against nato 
warner said 
when all is said and done they have lost a great deal of 
armored striking power he said 
as a result bush has decided that means us troops stationed 
in europe during the cold war can begin to come home

the chief of the nations prisons quit 
wednesday following the escape of 49 leftist guerrillas who spent a 
year secretly tunneling their way to freedom 
six were captured shortly after they fled tuesday but police 
continued to search for the 43 others who included several 
guerrillas who tried to kill military president augusto pinochet in 
1986 
the supreme court appointed a special investigator justice juan 
araya who said he started his work immediately 
justice minister hugo rosende said the government immediately 
accepted the resignation submitted by prison chief col horacio 
ojeda rosende did not elaborate but it appeared ojeda took 
responsibility for the jail break 
the guerrillas fled through a 100yardlong tunnel below a wide 
avenue across the street from the national investigative police 
headquarters in downtown santiago 
adm jose toribio merino commander in chief of the navy said 
on television that he believed some prison guards helped the 
escapees 
imagine they spent a full year digging a tunnel and no one 
saw anything merino said where did they put all the material 
they removed 
the government said it ordered an internal investigation of 
prison personnel 
the santiago newspaper la segunda reported that the officer in 
charge of the prison at the time of the escape was warned by some 
guards that something abnormal was happening but that he paid 
no attention 
it said the officer identified only as lt gutierrez ordered 
the guards to retrieve the cartridges from their automatic rifles 
after one guard fired a warning shot into the air 
authorities did not comment on the papers report 
police searching for the guerrillas set up roadblocks and 
increased security at airports and borders points national police 
director fernando paredes appealed to all citizens to help us 
providing whatever information they think may be useful 
police also were seen watching many embassies in santiago 
apparently in an effort to prevent the escapees from seeking asylum 
most of them were members of the manuel rodriguez patriotic 
front an urban guerrilla gang that has claimed responsibility for 
a number of armed attacks against chiles military regime 
including the attempt on pinochets life on sept 7 1986 
pinochet was unharmed when his motorcade was ambushed in the 
andes foothills near santiago but six of his bodyguards were 
killed 
pinochet took power following a 1973 coup that topped elected 
president salvador allende he is scheduled to turn over power to a 
civilian government in february

the final defendant in the mcmartin preschool 
molestation case will be retried on the 13 counts of child 
molestation and conspiracy that left jurors deadlocked prosecutors 
announced wednesday 
the decision to retry raymond buckey came after long meetings 
with district attorney ira reiner and after a loud public campaign 
by parents whose children attended the mcmartin nursery school 
the parents appeared on television called news conferences 
enlisted politicians and solicited letters supporting buckeys 
reprosecution 
this is a positive step for us said marymae cioffi a 
mcmartin parent who led the campaign to retry buckey im going 
to run home and tell my kids we get another chance 
reiner said that neither the orchestrated outcry nor by his 
stated ambition to run for california attorney general had any 
influence on his decision to seek a new trial 
this is not a political matter and it is not going to be 
treated as such he said 
reiner said he did not watch the sensational tv talk show 
appearances by parents and children he added that boxes of letters 
carried into his office this week by a delegation of parents 
contained only about 200 letters rather than the 6000 they claimed 
to have collected 
the boxes were filled with rolls of paper he said only 
the top row were letters theres a little bit of that going on 
everybody the public and the families involved is entitled 
to a resolution of this case deputy district attorney lael rubin 
told reporters she and coprosecutor roger gunson insisted the 
blitz of publicity did not influence their decision to go forward 
buckeys civil attorney scott bernstein said outside court the 
decision was outrageous and a combination of pressure and 
politics 
the prosecutors could have dismissed the 13 counts after buckey 
31 and his mother peggy mcmartin buckey 63 were acquitted jan 
18 by a jury on 52 other molestation charges 
their trial which took nearly three years was the longest and 
costliest in us history superior court judge william pounders 
said the facts involved in the remaining 13 counts mitigate in 
favor of a long second trial he said he hoped the charges could 
be scoped down to shorten the proceedings 
pounders who said he agreed with the decision to go forward 
with a new trial urged that it begin quickly because the range 
of emotions is very high there are a lot of people still 
sitting in agony we should seek an end to this as soon as 
possible 
he set a march 9 trial date but conceded that could be 
complicated by a motion filed wednesday by buckeys attorney danny 
davis charging pounders with prejudice against the defense and 
asking that he be removed from the case pounders said he would 
challenge the motion telling davis i do not feel im biased 
against you or your client 
the mcmartin case has been in the los angeles courts for six 
years and originally included seven defendants charges were 
dismissed against five defendants after an 18month preliminary 
hearing only buckey and his mother stood trial the case cost 
taxpayers over 13 million 
buckey spent nearly five years in jail before he was released on 
15 million bail last february buckey was released wednesday on 
his own recognizance pending a new trial 
jurors who spent nearly three years hearing the case said the 
prosecution failed to prove 52 of the molestation counts they said 
their votes on the deadlocked counts weighed on the side of 
acquittal some jurors said they believed children were molested 
but werent convinced it happened at the mcmartin school

long columns of ethnic albanian 
mourners buried three of their dead in malisevo on wednesday their 
sadness mixed with fury at riot police they accused of 
machinegunning unarmed townspeople 
the mourners many wearing traditional white domed caps trudged 
down muddy paths toward a small moslem cemetery overlooking the 
rolling hills of some of yugoslavias best wine country 
most of the towns 4000 inhabitants went to the burial 
dozens milled around journalists jostling each other in their 
eagerness to describe these claims of massacre 
a sovietbuilt armored personnel carrier raced through the town 
tuesday morning its turret rotating wildly its 145mm 
antiaircraft machine gun firing indiscriminately at passersby 
close behind came two police trucks policemen in the backs of 
the trucks in flak jackets and helmets fired ak47 assault rifles 
at people racing for cover 
a grocer was killed sitting in his store another man died as he 
walked toward the bus stop and a youth was wounded emerging from 
the police station ahmed berisa a city council member said 
dried blood stains marked the shooting sites 
berisa did not say how the third victim died 
at least 15 people were wounded in the two minutes of shooting 
and three were not expected to survive berisa said 
an ethnic albanian policeman pointed toward bullet holes around 
the stations entrance saying he was fortunate to be alive becuse 
he had been standing directly behind the boy who was hit 
they wanted to kill us all said merchant sadri mazreku 
pointing to the riddled metal grating on his storefront they 
even shot at the local police post because the officers there are 
ethnic albanians 
kadri krasnici the local communist party chief said a 
fullscale massacre in malisevo 12 miles west of kosovos capital 
of pristina was avoided by sheer luck because only a few people 
were on the streets at the time of the attack 
children pointed out more than 100 bullet holes on the walls of 
buildings lining the towns main street 
metal railings on a bridge over a small stream were split by the 
impact of bullets 
several people alleged that the attack against malisevo and 
similar ones on two nearby villages which resulted in no 
casualties were revenge on the part of serbian police 
they said that ethnic strains motivated the attacks aggravated 
by a clash with albanian demonstrators that injured a police 
officer 
thousands of riot police from yugoslavias largest republic of 
serbia have been deployed over the past week in kosovo to help 
control huge demonstrations by ethnic albanians demanding more 
autonomy for the region the province is administrativaly a part of 
serbia which exercises pervasive control 
serbia accuses ethnic albanians who make up 90 percent of 
kosovos 19 million people of harassing the serbian minority to 
drive them out and of wanting to join neighboring albania 
krasnici read a statement to journalists that said a riot police 
unit had executed an unprovoked armed attack on malisevo what 
happened here is without precedent in postwar yugoslavia 
malisevo and two neighboring villages were attacked by 
terrorists and criminals who cannot remain in the security forces 
of yugoslavia 
krasnici said local authorities had contacted yugoslav president 
janez drnovsek to demand an official inquiry 
the shooting was possibly caused by a desire for revenge by 
a group of serbian police who earlier clashed with rioters six 
miles east of malisevo town official ibis taci said 
an officer apparently riding in one of the two trucks was 
seriously wounded taci added 
sgt adem salja commander of the local police station said 
there was no unrest in malisevo and we had certainly not asked 
for any reinforcements on wednesday hundreds of youths with 
scarves over their faces flashed vforvictory signs on the main 
road linking the town with pristina they chanted democracy 
democracy at cars slowing down to get past stone and wood 
barricades they erected 
harriedlooking riot police clutching automatic rifles and tear 
gas grenade launchers did not interfere

parliament on wednesday liberalized 
media laws and gave citizens the right to operate newspapers and 
radio and television stations the official mti news agency said 
the changes amend a 1986 law that will be scrapped altogether 
when the justice ministry completes work on a new statute 
under the previous law only state bodies and other legal 
entities could operate newspapers and broadcast stations 
the new law says the only requirement for starting a newspaper 
is reporting the plan to authorities and requesting resigstration 
according to mti 
practicing the freedom of the press cannot lead to the 
violation of the law or incitement thereto neither can it go 
against individual rights the law says 
it also says public morals and decency should not be violated 
mti said 
the law also regulates press violations of individual rights and 
allows juries to order a newspaper to pay damages up to 8300 in 
civil cases 
however all damages will go into the public treasury not to 
the winner of the case

president corazon aquino called 
wednesday for an end to coup rumors saying they are undermining 
the governments efforts to restore stability 
i believe we should stop emphasizing these alleged plots 
mrs aquino said in a statement wednesday we will never be able 
to accomplish the task of national development if this is all we 
are going to highlight every day 
mrs aquino made the statement after unconfirmed media reports 
that the military went on full alert earlier this week to prevent 
an attack on the presidential palace 
rumors of a new coup have been sweeping the philippine capital 
since the the dec 19 coup attempt by thousands of mutinous 
troops the sixth and most serious bid by rightwing military 
officers to topple mrs aquino at least 113 people were killed and 
more than 500 wounded in the fighting 
on tuesday american officials and lawmakers said in washington 
the aquino government still faces the threat of a new coup attempt 
and is encumbered by widespread corruption 
the political situation remains unsettled and many wonder 
whether the government can recover from the blow sufficiently to 
restore popular confidence and make lasting strides toward 
stability deputy assistant secretary of defense carl w ford 
told the house foreign affairs subcommittee on asia and the pacific 
we are hopeful that the near loss of hardwon democracy will 
energize the philippine public and private sectors to work even 
more closely and effectively he said 
during the same hearing deputy assistant secretary of state 
david lambertson said he came back from manila impressed again 
with the determination and resilience of the government and its 
people 
but the danger of another coup attempt exists he said 
he said mrs aquino must regain confidence by eradicating 
corruption and improving inefficient government services to avert 
another coup attempt 
corruption remains a real problem in the philippines and its 
corrosive effects hamper government operations he said 
president aquino is fully aware of the problem and has made 
efforts to deal with it both by example and by exhorting her 
people 
also wednesday the countrys influential roman catholic 
hierachy deplored the climate of violence and warned against 
foreign interests seeking to foment unrest 
the statement by the catholic bishops conference of the 
philippines did not identify foreign interests but the 
declaration followed media speculation that conservative groups in 
the united states may be working with filipino dissidents to topple 
mrs aquino 
in a pastoral letter read over the churchrun radio veritas by 
the conference president bishop leonardo legazpi the catholic 
leadership denounced coup attempts as immoral and unjust 
the pastoral letter the first since decembers failed coup was 
issued at the end of the twoday annual meeting of the conference 
the highest policymaking church council in this predominantly 
roman catholic nation it is to be read during church services 
nationwide over the weekend

the aflcio on wednesday backed a plan by sen 
daniel patrick moynihan to return social security to a 
payasyougo basis and take its surplus off the federal budget 
this plan would reduce the tax burden on working men and 
women whose tax share has become disproportionate to that of the 
wealthy the federation of 141 million union members said in a 
statement as it is the growing social security surplus is being 
used to mask budget deficits that have been exacerbated by 
unbalanced and unwise spending and revenue policies the moynihan 
proposal has exposed this scam for all to see 
the endorsement came hours before president bush was to attack 
the plan in his state of the union address he already voiced his 
opposition to the idea which has generated heated debate since 
moynihan dny first announced it in late december 
moynihan said he was heartened by the federations support 
which came after a meeting wednesday with 20 member union leaders 
the issues are tax fairness for american workers and the 
integrity of social security he said i am not the least 
surprised and am most gratified that federation president lane 
kirkland and the aflcio insist on both 
last week moynihan introduced a bill to cut the social security 
tax from the current 62 percent to 51 percent by next year this 
would cost the social security trust fund 55 billion but would 
save a working couple up to 600 a year 
the measure would stop building up a huge trust fund surplus 
which moynihan says is wrongly being used to mask the true size of 
the federal deficit 
the aflcio differed with moynihan over how much the trust fund 
surplus should be allowed to grow before repealing the social 
security tax increase the federation believes the surplus should 
reach 125 percent to 150 percent of one years benefits while 
moynihans legislation would make the cuts when the fund reaches 
100 percent

prime minister margaret thatcher said wednesday 
she wrongly denied the existence of a dirty tricks campaign in 
northern ireland in the 1970s but blamed information she received 
from civil servants 
on tuesday armed forces minister archie hamilton confirmed that 
a covert program codenamed clockwork orange had existed to feed 
lies to journalists covering the northern ireland conflict 
in 1987 mrs thatcher rejected claims by former army press 
officer colin wallace that such a program existed 
wallace says he was dismissed from the civil service in 1975 
four years before mrs thatcher took office for threatening to 
expose the program 
mrs thatchers admission was published as the government 
promised a statement to the house of commons on thursday by defense 
secretary tom king the government has already begun a new inquiry 
into wallaces dismissal 
until tuesday allegations of disinformation and coverups in 
northern ireland were always denied 
wallace says clockwork orange began as an attempt to 
discredit the irish republican army through false stories such as 
the claim that the guerrillas had soviet rockets armed with 
unstable explosives 
he alleges that elements within mi5 the military 
counterintelligence agency later took over the program and set out 
to smear politicians and prominent protestants in northern ireland 
the ira has fought an urban guerrilla war since 1970 to end 
british rule in protestantdominated northern ireland and unite it 
with the overwhelmingly roman catholic irish republic 
in a letter to a lawmaker from her conservative party mrs 
thatcher said 
i regret to say that a reexamination of departmental papers 
has brought to light information which shows that there were a 
number of statements in my letters and in other ministerial 
statements and official correspondence which were incorrect or 
require clarification 
inquiries are being made to establish how these errors in the 
handling of departmental papers occurred 
but of course the matters with which they deal originated 
under previous administrations and present ministers can only deal 
with them on the basis of information made available to us 
former mi5 agent peter wright spoke in his book spycatcher 
of an mi5 plot to undermine harold wilsons government mrs 
thatchers denial of any such plot came in a public debate about 
government efforts to suppress wrights book 
at the time wallace was fired wilson was prime minister of a 
labor party government though wallaces allegations also involve 
the years of edward heaths conservative government of 197074 
hamilton the armed forces minister said no evidence was found 
of any plot to discredit politicians and he said the program had 
been terminated 
it has not since the mid1970s been the policy to disseminate 
disinformation in northern ireland in ways designed to denigrate 
individuals andor organizations for propaganda purposes that 
remains the case he said 
tony benn a former labor cabinet minister told commons wallace 
should testify before a parliamentary committee free from the 
threat of prosecution for discussing state secrets 
for over 20 years disinformation has been issuing from 
government disinformation now admitted for the first time ever 
by the government benn said 
a clockwork orange is the title of a novel by anthony 
burgess published in 1962 about extreme forms of mindcontrol in 
a totalitarian state a film based on the book appeared in 1971

in december and january and were taken to rehabilitation centers 
the announcement gave no indication how long they will be held 
it also said four sinhalese civilians were killed by the

force the government has employed to halt attacks by the peoples 
liberation front which has been attacking government officials and 
supporters since 1987 
in december about 8000 shotguns and rifles were steamrolled in 
the first such action 
at least 6000 people have been killed in the struggle between 
the peoples liberation front and the government the front

signed a peace accord designed to end a tamil separatist revolt 
that has claimed 11000 lives since 1983 
sinhalese control the government and the military and make up 75

a coast guard cutter sprayed a cubanoperated 
freighter with machinegun fire and shells wednesday when the ship 
refused to stop for a drug inspection but the vessel escaped into 
mexican waters officials said 
the 250foot hermann took several hits from the cutter 
chincoteague as it was chased for more than 26 hours across the 
gulf of mexico said coast guard spokesman joe gibson 
coast guardsmen saw no evidence of casualties aboard the 
freighter said jack odell a coast guard spokesman in washington 
when the panamaregistered ship reached mexican waters the 
110foot coast guard cutter held fire and asked the mexican 
government to take over and determine whether the vessel was 
carrying drugs gibson said 
we were in international waters gibson said we cannot 
pursue vessels into other countries waters 
the hermann steamed on unaccompanied toward the central mexican 
coast later two mexican navy vessels escorted the ship to the 
port of tampico and authorities began searching the vessel the 
foreign ministry said the inspection was expected to take at least 
24 hours 
the official cuban news agency prensa latina reported that the 
ship with a 12man crew was carrying 10 tons of the element 
chromium and was operated by the guamar shipping co of cuba 
gibson however said the coast guard talked to the ships 
master by radio and the captain claimed the vessel had no cargo he 
said the coast guards law enforcement division believes the ship 
carried chrome which can be either chromium or an alloy of the 
element 
an official at the cuban diplomatic mission in washington called 
the incident a provocation 
in a report monitored in mexico city prensa latina quoted 
another official as saying this deed demonstrates once more that 
the united states intends to behave as owner of the world and with 
its proverbial barbarism appears willing to obstruct normal 
commerce between cuba and mxico 
us secretary of state james a baker iii disagreed 
it was not an attack and a provocation baker told 
reporters we were engaged in a legal law enforcement activity 
state department defense department and national security 
council officials held three meetings before giving permission to 
use disabling fire against the hermann said odell 
the coast guard obtained permission from panama to fire on the 
ship gibson said he said it is protocol to request permission to 
stop a vessel from its country of registry 
the cuban embassy in mexico city charged that the hermann was 
attacked in mexican waters but that was denied by mexicos foreign 
ministry and the us government 
prensa latina said the hermanns captain diego sanchez was in 
contact with cuba throughout the incident and was told not to 
allow the coast guard to board and to fight until the end 
the occupants of the merchant ship were ready to stop them 
with machetes knives hatchets and other tools presna latina 
said 
the 335mile chase began at 430 am tuesday when the 
chincoteague spotted the hermann about 120 miles north of merida on 
mexicos yucatan peninsula said coast guard lt steve koska 
the coast guard decided to check the hermann because it fit the 
profile of a narcoticssmuggling ship he said refusing to be 
specific 
the cutter tried repeatedly to stop the freighter peacefully 
gibson said 
we got on the radio we asked them to stop we used a signal 
light we used a blue light we used a flag hoist we sprayed water 
onto the vessel and we sprayed water down into the stacks he 
said 
nothing worked so we fired warning shots over the bow 
gibson said they continued and we asked the panamanian 
government for permission to use disabling fire the panamanian 
government said do it 
the chincoteague opened fire on the hermann at 508 am 
wednesday about 45 miles east of tampico koska said the ship 
entered mexican waters at 643 am 
the bottom line is that we werent able to disable the 
vessel koska said 
including warning shots the cutter fired 130 rounds from a 20mm 
gun and 250 to 300 rounds from an m60 machine gun gibson said 
the hermann took hits in the engine compartment and the rudder 
post odell said the ship was belching black smoke and might have 
been taking on water 
the cutter lost sight of the ship but the hermanns master was 
heard on the radio asking mexican officials for permission to enter 
the tampico harbor 
the chincoteague based in mobile ala has a crew of 16 two 
m60 machine guns and one 20mm gun on the forecastle

thousands of queuehardened soviets on wednesday 
cheerfully lined up to get a taste of gamburgers 
chizburgers and filayofeesh sandwiches as mcdonalds 
opened in the land of lenin for the first time 
the worlds largest version of the landmark american fastfood 
chain rang up 30000 meals on 27 cash registers breaking the 
openingday record for mcdonalds worldwide officials said 
the soviets bundled in fur coats and hats seemed unfazed 
lining up before dawn outside the 700seat restaurant the first of 
20 planned across the soviet union the crush of customers was so 
intense the company stayed open until midnight two hours later 
than planned 
i only waited an hour and i think they served thousands before 
me said a happy middleaged woman who works at an aluminum plant 
and it was only 10 rubles for all this she said im 
taking it back for the girls at the factory to try 
big macs were priced at 375 rubles and double cheeseburgers at 
3 rubles about two hours pay for a starting mcdonalds staffer 
or the average soviet but much cheaper than other private 
restaurants that have sprung up recently 
the official exchange rate is 159 per ruble but foreign 
visitors can buy rubles for 16 cents each about what the currency 
is worth on the black market 
half the days sales were donated to the soviet childrens fund 
which provides medical care and assistance to orphans and 
disadvantaged children gary reinblatt senior vice president of 
mcdonalds canada said from toronto 
the restaurant built by the company in a joint venture with the 
city of moscow that began 14 years ago brought to 52 the number of 
countries where mcdonalds operates 
the previous openingday record for sales was in budapest 
company officials said besides its restaurants in the united 
states the leading number of mcdonalds are in canada and japan 
the officials said 
soviets got a firsthand look at such alien concepts as 
efficiency and fast friendly service normally dour citizens broke 
into grins as they caught the infectious cheerful mood from 
youthful soviet staffers hired for their ability to smile and work 
hard 
accordions played folk songs and women in traditional costumes 
danced with cartoon characters including mickey mouse and baba 
yaga a witch of russian fairy tales 
one muscovite accustomed to clerks who snarl if they say 
anything at all asked for a straw and was startled when a smiling 
young soviet woman found him one and popped it straight into his 
drink 
for most customers it was their first experience with a 
hamburger sandwiches were served in the familiar bag marked with 
the golden arches but were packed in wrappers bearing cyrillic 
letters approximating gamburger 
they tried them onehanded they picked their sandwiches apart 
to examine the contents one young woman finally squashed her 
beeg mak to fit her lips around it 
it tasted great a 14yearold boy said 
its a lot different from a stolovaya he continued with a 
smile referring to the much cheaper but rundown dirty cafeterias

state lawmakers decided tuesday not to vote 
on a measure to repeal unenforceable criminal penalties for doctors 
who perform abortions but they continued debate on a bill to 
require minors to get permission for abortions 
the assembly voted 5739 to keep the repeal bill in the 
amendment stage and not bring it to the floor for a final vote a 
move that prochoice lawmakers said effectively killed the measure 
its dead rep rebecca young a democrat said minutes 
after the vote this is the end of the bill for this session 
the bill would have repealed an outdated state law that provides 
criminal penalties including prison terms for doctors who perform 
abortions the law has been unenforceable since a 1973 us supreme 
court ruling legalized abortion nationwide 
abortionrights lawmakers said they want to remove the law from 
the books in case the high court should overturn roe vs wade 
abortion opponents said the law should be kept for the same reason 
the second bill backed by abortion opponents would require 
minors to obtain permission from at least one parent or a court 
order before having an abortion 
if the second bill is approved by the assembly it would require 
approval by the senate and gov tommy g thompson before becoming 
law 
rep david clarenbach a prochoice democrat said he had 
expected the repeal bill to be set back tuesday but predicted it 
would pass some day 
this legislature is in the process of becoming prochoice 
he said today many of you are risking your political careers by 
failing to take a prochoice stand 
assembly speaker thomas loftus also a democrat said the repeal 
measure is not dead and could be brought up again later this week 
if twothirds of the assembly voted to do so 
you have to live with these votes for the rest of your 
political life loftus had said earlier 
before deciding not to vote on the repeal bill the assembly 
rejected an amendment by democratic rep thomas seery to alter the 
measure so that doctors who performed abortions and women who 
obtained abortions after the 18th week of pregnancy could still 
face criminal penalties 
what im trying to do is find a middle ground seery said 
what im trying to do is determine when life begins 
lawmakers scrambled tuesday before the floor session began to 
introduce amendments to the second bill which would require minors 
to get permission before having an abortion 
some of the estimated 21 amendments hadnt even been drafted 
shortly before the 99member assembly began debate tuesday 
afternoon by 9 pm the assembly had acted only two of the 
amendments increasing chances that the session would go into 
wednesday 
the proposals include provisions to require teenagers to obtain 
the consent of one parent before carrying a child to full term and 
to require parents of teenage mothers to support their 
grandchildren 
democrats control the assembly 5542 but republican rep robert 
welch had said partisan affiliation would have little effect 
because there are more antiabortion democrats in the assembly than 
prochoice republicans 
welch also disagreed with loftus that the lawmakers votes on 
the two bills would make or break their careers 
i dont think theres a single person in the state assembly 
who will get defeated because of the abortion issue no matter what 
their stand is welch said

if communists had a heaven it might look 
like bologna 
orange buses glide through a huge historic district closed to 
other traffic senior citizens take governmentsubsidized vacations 
on the riviera half the citys youngsters attend lowcost daycare 
centers 
the red disneyland as the italian press calls it has long 
been considered the showcase of communism italianstyle so when 
the government recently suggested turning city services over to 
private enterprise it left many italians in shock 
the proposal coming from bologna is in some measure 
revolutionary columnist miriam mafai wrote in the national 
newspaper la repubblica 
all previous ideas are being erased from the slate not only 
for the italian communist party but for all the left 
the proposal put forth for the northern italian city is 
considered symbolic of the new directions being pursued by the 
italys national communist party the largest in the west as it 
seeks to overcome an electoral decline and the specter of communist 
failure in eastern europe 
i dont want to be reduced to a souvenir of a past era said 
bolognas 45yearold mayor renzo imbeni an energetic marxist 
with a bushy black mustache 
i want to be here when the history of tomorrow is written the 
change stems from this need 
with a population of 417000 bologna is the biggest city in the 
italian red belt a communistgoverned region that has become 
one of the countrys wealthiest areas 
after world war ii when voters turned to the party that helped 
lead the antifascist resistance bologna became italys first 
large city to elect a communist administration 
it earned national fame for its doitall governments which 
set up pharmacies in poor neighborhoods paid the rent for 
lowincome elderly citizens and offered free bus transportation 
during rush hours 
when buildings decayed in the porticolined historic district 
the government spent millions of dollars to restore them then 
moved the workingclass residents back in 
to help women work it set up a daycare system that even today 
charges the equivalent of only 65 to 150 a month for children up 
to 5 
there is a rather high level of social protection mayor 
imbeni said in an interview in the communal palace a 15thcentury 
building surrounded by bulletin boards featuring the communist 
daily newspaper lunita 
but its not written anywhere that we will be able to 
guarantee this also in the future 
he noted that the welfarestate system had deteriorated in many 
countries due to stagnant revenues an increase in the number of 
needy and a shrinking pool of young people all problems in 
bologna 
because of this the choice was made for a requalification 
and a renewal of the welfare state we have locally imbeni said 
what bologna is proposing to do is sell off its slaughterhouse 
and 21 city pharmacies and transfer such services as the cleaning 
of schools provision of student lunches and street maintenance to 
a mixed publicprivate concern it also is discussing private 
management of the hundreds of cityowned offices and apartments 
the money saved would be devoted to priority areas such as the 
increasing number of elderly and third world immigrants and the 
environment 
the plan has won praise from business executives average 
citizens and the national communist party which is italys 
secondbiggest party the main critics are rival political parties 
which charge the project is merely a maneuver to win votes in 
municipal elections this coming may 
if its real and concrete this is an interesting stunning 
new initiative an initiative that will be taken as an example by 
other city governments said gianandrea rocco di torrepadula 
head of the local industrialists association 
in comparison to other cities this one is run ok said 
marco bassi 46 who owns a newsstand in the workingclass little 
bologna neighborhood but things always go better in the private 
sector 
imbeni insists that the communists are not doing an aboutface 
people say the concept of state ownership is part of the 
communist culture he said but for the communists of bologna 
this isnt true and for the italian communists that was years 
ago 
indeed bologna and the rest of the red belt are known for 
their citizens entrepreneurial spirit illustrated by the network 
of cooperatives most linked to the communists which do 
everything from producing parmesan cheese to running restaurants 
the national communist party is hailing the bologna plan an 
example of its own new course the party has long embraced 
parliamentary democracy but has been kept out of the government for 
four decades 
in line with its new program the party has called an 
extraordinary congress for march to decide whether to become a new 
leftist umbrella group and perhaps even drop the communist name 
and hammerandsickle symbol 
while the bologna proposal was described as a revolution in 
national newspapers it will leave many city services intact 
the government refuses to privatize the daycare system and the 
vast bus network although it has abolished the free rushhour 
rides 
the lowincome elderly will still have a taxi service domestic 
helpers 32 social centers and subsidized vacations on the italian 
riviera 
the government will also continue to provide lowcost study 
vacations for teens in england and on the french riviera 
we dont want to change because theres a black spot on the 
soul of our past imbeni said we must change because we want 
to be here in the year 2000 with the name we have today or 
another i want to be here

the american dental association scoffed at a 
recent study that found highly fluoridated water caused a rare form 
of bone cancer in some rats and reaffirmed its support of the 
anticavity treatment 
it is totally inappropriate to draw any conclusions from this 
single study or to suggest that it is applicable to human beings 
said dr enid neidle director of scientific affairs for the ada 
one rat among a group of 50 developed bone cancer after 
consuming fluoridated water in a concentration of 45 parts per 
million over two years according to preliminary data from a study 
conducted by the national toxicology program 
four rats in another group developed the cancer after drinking 
fluoridated water with a concentration of 79 parts per million over 
the same period the study found 
but the chicagobased ada said tuesday the public should not 
fear sodium fluoride because humans ingest much smaller amounts of 
the chemical 
the average person drinks about eight glasses of water a day 
the ada said in a press release a person would have to drink 380 
glasses each day to obtain the same concentration of fluoride as 
that in the first group of rats and about 700 glasses a day to 
obtain the same concentration of fluoride as that in the second 
group of rats the association said 
fluoride a natural chemical that appears in some waterways has 
remained a controversial issue for many american communities since 
1945 when it was artificially introduced into the public water 
supply in grand rapids mich and newburgh ny 
people who favor fluoridation as the best way to prevent tooth 
decay say it prevents about twothirds of all cavities and is 
almost completely safe 
those who oppose the fluoridation process say the treated water 
stains teeth could harm bones and may cause certain forms of 
cancer 
public water systems in the united states last year served about 
213 million people but only 61 percent of them drink fluoridated 
water in 1989 los angeles san francisco portland ore and san 
antonio still were without fluoridated water according to the 
national institute of dental research 
many other local and state governments require fluoridation by 
law

actor gary coleman scored a victory over his 
mother wednesday when a judge ruled the 21yearold former 
diffrent strokes star was mentally capable of handling his 7 
million in holdings by himself 
the very things you claim he doesnt have hes got 
superior court judge martha goldin told an attorney for colemans 
mother who had asked that a court conservator take over the 
diminutive actors finances 
edmonia sue coleman contended her son was unable to make his own 
decisions rationally because of the effects of kidney disease and 
the influence of a close friend and adviser who lives with him in 
denver 
coleman said at a court hearing earlier this month that his 
mothers effort for conservatorship was an attempt to control my 
life 
coleman who played the precocious arnold jackson on the hit tv 
show filed a lawsuit that alleges his parents and former business 
manager mishandled his money and funneled away more than 1 million 
for themselves the lawsuit has yet to come to trial 
goldin said she relied on findings in a courtordered report 
detailing colemans condition in ruling against ordering a 
conservatorship hearing the judge sealed the report 
coleman declined to comment his attorney charles wake said 
the actor was pleased 
it was an emotional experience for him said wake 
colemans mother said she remains concerned about her son and 
continues to feel he is getting poor advice from his friend and 
former chauffeur dion mial 
gary is my son and i love him very much regardless of what 
mr wake says said mrs coleman and what i have done has been 
in garys best interest 
coleman was born with an atrophied right kidney and lost the 
other one when he was 5 he underwent transplants in 1973 and 1984 
both of which failed he took immunosuppressive drugs for his 
condition and they stunted his growth at 4 feet 8 inches

diplomats from israel and east 
germany concluded preliminary talks wednesday on establishing 
formal relations and settling the issue of moral responsibility for 
the murder of 6 million jews in the nazi holocaust 
talks were adjourned after three days but both sides said they 
would resume later 
the israeli delegation said the central issue was the question 
of east germanys accepting its share in the moral and historical 
responsibility for crimes perpetrated by germans against jews 
during the nazi regime 
west germany has acknowledged guilt of the german people and has 
paid 47 billion in indemnities to holocaust victims and their 
families 
previous stalinist governments in east germany denied any 
responsibility for the holocaust arguing that the communists 
represented the antinazi resistance and bore no blame 
east german chief delegate reinar neumann chief of the foreign 
ministrys middle east desk indicated the new reformminded 
government would review its position 
prime minister hans modrow said last week east germany was 
willing to discuss the question of reparations and sought 
relations with all nations 
the israeli statement said israel wanted ties with all countries 
regardless of ideology relations with germany however present 
israel with difficulties as could be appreciated by everyone 
familiar with 20th century history 
israel said east germany asked for the talks michael shiloh 
the foreign ministrys adviser on jewish diaspora affairs led 
israels delegation 
israel and west germany established diplomatic relations in 1965 
the jewish state and east germany have never had diplomatic 
relations 
it was not clear if either side raised the parallel issue of 
fears voiced by israeli officials over possible reunification of 
east and west germany 
a newspaper in munich reported wednesday that west german 
chancellor helmut kohl was infuriated by israeli prime minister 
yitzhak shamirs reservations the two leaders have had a sharp 
exchange of letters the paper sueddeutsche zeitung reported

much of prince william sound remains 
polluted from the nations worst oil spill and the cleanup must 
resume when the weather improves this spring gov steve cowper 
said wednesday 
about 117 miles of shore throughout the sound remain oiled from 
the exxon valdez spill including 85 heavily oiled areas according 
to a state survey released by cowper while much of the surface oil 
is gone in 224 locations oil was found up to 28 inches deep in the 
rocky beaches he said 
the evidence is that the problem will not go away by the end 
of this winter and that we are going to have to return to the 
beaches of coastal alaska to clean up this mess cowper told a 
news conference 
he also called on congress to pass pending legislation that 
would require oil tankers using us ports to have double hulls and 
double bottoms within several years 
nearly 11 million gallons of north slope crude gushed from the 
valdez after it ran aground march 24 
the state department of environmental conservation surveyed the 
shores in october and november after exxon corp halted its cleanup 
due to severe winter weather the data took some time to assemble 
state officials said and the survey was not completed until last 
week 
the news conference came as jury selection was under way in 
anchorage in the criminal trial of joseph hazelwood former captain 
of the exxon valdez cowper spokesman david ramseur said reporters 
covering the trial were invited to take part in the news conference 
by telephone 
exxon officials did not dispute the surveys findings but said 
nature has removed oil from many shores since the information was 
collected last fall 
we know that in the highenergy areas that the winter storms 
are having a dramatic effect said don carpenter exxons 
operations and logistics manager in anchorage the 32 miles in 
the sheltered areas we have more concern about but theres 
evidence that the effect of natures forces is dramatic there 
too 
but recent spot checks found continued heavy oil accumulations 
cowper said showing reporters a twominute video with scenes of 
oiled beaches shot in the past three days the scenes confirm the 
fall surveys results he said 
the reason why we are presenting this beach survey is not to 
criticize the efforts that have been made so far he said the 
point is to show the amount of work that has to be done as soon as 
the weather clears 
exxon and several government agencies will put together a spring 
cleanup plan after another survey is conducted in april exxon 
spokesman perry smith said a determination of what cleanup 
measures if any are needed will be made by may 
cowper said his administration decided to support the proposed 
requirement for doublebottomed doublehulled tankers despite the 
estimated 10 million a year it would cost the state in reduced oil 
revenues 
the industrys cost of upgrading the alaska tanker fleet is a 
transportation expense that would be deducted from the wellhead 
price of alaska oil on which the state bases its taxes and 
royalties 
we think that its worth it cowper said 
the tankers used in the alaska trade are aging and will have to 
replaced eventually anyway he said 
a coast guard study estimated the exxon valdez would have 
released about 60 percent less oil if it had a double bottom

president bush acclaiming the revolution of 
89 in eastern europe proposed a sharp new cut in us and 
soviet combat forces wednesday night and told a joint meeting of 
congress that the time is right to move forward in europe 
in his first state of the union address bush also announced 
plans to withdraw well before the end of february the last 
3000 troops from a force of 14000 sent to panama to oust gen 
manuel antonio noriega 
democrats and republicans alike assembled in joint session of 
congress to hear the president stood in ovation when bush said 
one year ago the people of panama lived in fear under the thumb 
of a dictator today democracy is restored panama is free 
hours before he delivered his address bush telephoned soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachev to advise him of his proposal to cut 
us and soviet forces in central europe to 195000 on each side 
later bush charcterized gorbachev as receptive and willing to 
consider the proposal 
the cuts would be nowhere near equal since the soviets have a 
huge advantage in european military force the united states has 
305000 troops in europe compared to 565000 soviet forces 
last may bush proposed a 275000troop ceiling and he had said 
he would not seek deeper cuts until ussoviet negotiators had 
finalized that agreement wednesday the administration said it 
wanted parallel discussions on the deeper cuts why the shift a 
senior us official said events in europe were running ahead 
of the negotiations 
the european troop offer was the surprising and popular 
centerpiece of a speech in which bush also proposed lofty goals for 
american schools and prodded lawmakers to approve his plans for a 
capital gains tax cut and bills dealing with clean air child care 
crime and drugs 
in reaction house speaker thomas s foley embraced the troop 
reduction plan but said democrats would offer a domestic agenda of 
their own 
with ambassadors from across the world in attendance bush said 
with communism crumbling our aim must be to ensure democracys 
advance we are in a period of great transition great hope yet 
great uncertainty 
bush said the events of the year just ended the revolution 
of 89 have been a chain reaction change so striking that it 
marks the beginning of a new era in the worlds affairs 
think back bush asked congress and his national broadcast 
audience to the world we knew as 1989 began in the year 
since communist governments gave way in poland east germany 
romania bulgaria and czechoslovakia in such locations bush said 
the idea called america is alive 
on his return to the white house bush was asked by reporters 
how gorbachev reacted 
i cant characterize it but i can just simply say that he was 
receptive but i dont know whether hes supportive or not i just 
told him about it and so we have to wait bush said you cant 
something as complicated as that and serious obviously they need 
to consider it so thats about all but it was a friendly and i 
think productive conversation 
in his speech bush said we recognize that the soviet 
military threat in europe is diminishing but we see little change 
in soviet strategic modernization but the time is right to 
move forward on a conventional armscontrol agreement to move us to 
more appropriate levels of military forces in europe 
his troop cutback proposal won immediate praise from congress 
sen sam nunn democratic chairman of the armed services committee 
said it fit the changing circumstances in europe and the fiscal 
pressures at home 
its time to act together bush said in a speech intended to 
help set an electionyear agenda for a democraticrun congress 
even so partisanship was clear when bush extolled his no new 
taxes budget plan republicans erupted with applause democrats 
didnt 
bush was welcomed warmly as he entered the packed chamber where 
congressional aides stood three deep around the walls and 
spectators filled even the aisle stairs in the visitors galleries 
a cheer went up as foley dwash introduced the president as 
our former colleague 
barbara bush stood in the balcony with hands clasped in front of 
her during the 2minute welcoming ovation nearby sat marilyn 
quayle and next to her evangelist billy graham in all there were 
35 interruptions for applause 
foley agreed with much of what bush said but said that on some 
points democrats disagree foley said bush cannot become the 
education president if his budget for fiscal 1991 includes 
only a 2 percent increase in spending for education 
the speaker also said democrats will fight the administration on 
child care clean air legislation capital gains and the issue of 
abortion 
in his speech the president condemned racially motivated mail 
bombings saying the nation must confront and condemn racisim 
antisemitism bigotry and hate and he said our hearts go out 
to our hostages our hostages who are ceaselessly on our minds 
and in our efforts 
and let me say that so long as we remember the american 
idea so long as we live up to the american ideal the state of 
the union will remain sound and strong he said 
confronting a sensitive issue bush brushed off a proposal by 
sen daniel moynihan dny to roll back a social security tax 
increase 
the last thing we need to do is mess around with social 
security bush said republicans rose in applause followed by 
democrats including a broadlygrinning moynihan

largescale us troop cuts in europe at the 
level president bush discussed with soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachev wednesday would deal an economic blow to west germany 
bush proposed that us and soviet troops be reduced to 195000 
officials in washington said and he was to announce the plan 
formally in his state of the union address before a joint session 
of congress wednesday night 
bushs proposal was described by the officials who spoke on 
condition of anonymity as a result of the collapse of hardline 
communist governments in eastern europe 
the plan would cover more than 265000 us troops in western 
europe and 565000 soviet forces in central and eastern europe 
about 250000 us servicemen are based in west germany alone 
there was no immediate reaction from west german officials to 
bushs plan 
foreign ministry spokesman rainer mueller said in bonn that 
details of the bush proposal were not yet available and that they 
would have to be studied by highlevel officials before any comment 
could be made on the plan 
latenight television newscasts reported briefly without 
comment that bush was expected to call for deeper troop cuts 
the colognebased german economics institute reported in a july 
study that west germany earns 5 billion a year from us military 
expenditures it warned that a troop pullout would mean economic 
collapse for regions that are heavily dependent on the american 
presence 
an extensive analysis of the us bases was undertaken because 
of the growing public tendency to see american troops as a burden 
institute director for economic and scientific affairs otto vogel 
said at the time 
there has been increasing support in recent months for troop 
cuts as a way to reduce tensions in europe and move the german 
states closer to reunification now that the communists in east 
germany no longer have a monopoly on power 
east germany is the kremlins most critical military ally and 
about 400000 soviet troops are stationed in the country 
the kremlin does not want to lose its frontline bases in east 
germany but it has indicated it could accept a neutral state 
west germany is under pressure to remain in nato and keep troops 
as part of its commitment to the western defense alliance the 
troops however are an obstacle to reunification 
last may bush proposed a 275000 ceiling on us and on soviet 
forces and said negotiations to reach that goal should be wrapped 
up within a year 
before now bush has said he would not support further cuts 
until the current talks were wrapped up but a senior 
administration official said events were running ahead of the 
negotiations 
west german foreign minister hansdietrich genscher said on 
wednesday that a reunited germany could stay loyal to nato without 
drawing the territory now comprising a crucial moscow ally into the 
western military alliance 
genscher outlined in a speech to the evangelical institute in 
tutzing near munich what he sees as a security guarantee for 
moscow and a compromise that could also assuage the united states 
the foreign minister suggested that the territory now 
constituting west germany could remain in the north atlantic treaty 
organization while the area east of the elbe river east germany 
would not contain military facilities 
us and west european allies have indicated they would accept 
reunification as long as germany stays within nato

protestant jewish and roman catholic leaders

the creation of a world at peace is one of the foundation

undermines credibility of that message said rabbi a james rudin 
interreligious affairs director of the american jewish committee 
the rev john b cobb jr a united methodist theologian of 
claremont university said a step toward ending the war was to 
bring out new overlaps among our faiths to inform public life 
and public schools 
he said american society has not faced up to the difficulty of 
transmitting values apart from schools whose ethos is formed by 
particular religious tradtions what is needed is open interaction 
from which would emerge agreements on values that all can support 
he urged rethinking of our theology so that the most 
wholehearted commitment to christ will be the strongest reason for 
the full acceptance of judaism as a companion in the service of 
god

american churches which largely lost their free 
publicservice television outlets on networks when broadcasting was 
deregulated now have a fastgrowing network of their own 
they had been virtually silenced in that powerful medium as 
national channels began selling time to moneysoliciting 
televangelists some of whose lapses tainted religion itself 
but the major faith groups protestant roman catholic eastern 
orthodox jewish and mormon have teamed up in developing a cable 
network that in its first year has more than doubled its reach 
visn standing for vision interfaith satellite network is now 
distributed on 38l cable systems across the nation some serving 
several communities and reaching 7 million households up from 3 
million at the outset 
it also has more than tripled its programming time on the air 
from five hours to 18 hours daily 
one of the things weve had going for us is the terrific cable 
network interest in the breadth of sponsoring religious groups 
says jeff weber the networks executive vice president 
the main religious denominations had virtually been left out 
in the cold by the profusion of contributionsseeking individual 
preachers buying commercial time but the new network is 
counterbalancing that scene 
our programs are for faith groups that represent the broad 
concerns and interests of the american people he added in an 
interview the way were geared up gives them an opportunity to 
use tv in ways not done before 
a wide variety of valuesoriented programs are offered dramas 
magazinestyle shows on various issues problem counseling select 
movies with discussion before an after callin talk shows 
religious news documentaries and others 
also included are cartoons and other childrens programs and 
even a couple of comedy series about bumbling and silliness within 
the religious fold 
the last thing the network wants to be is heavyhanded 
weber said theres plenty of room for laughter in heaven 
the network prohibits proselytizing for particular denominations 
or soliciting funds that has been abused in the past weber 
said were not in the business of taking money out of the local 
church 
the rev wilford v bane jr of nashville tenn a united 
methodist and the networks general manager and president said 
we want to stimulate people to get involved in their own 
communities 
however he said we can provide a perhaps larger perspective 
and put faith in a context beyond local experience tv can add 
dimensions that challenge folks 
he recited a list of renowned religious thinkers who have 
appeared on shows discussing such questions as who is god who is 
jesus what does prayer mean why evil and added 
persons of that stature talking in ones living room about 
questions of that depth certainly adds a dimension to peoples 
religious experience 
the coalition of 22 denominations owning the yearold network 
includes most major us religious bodies episcopal lutheran 
jewish presbyterian american baptist methodist roman catholic 
greek orthodox and mormon 
smaller groups such as the mennonites moravians seventhday 
adventists and salvation army also are participants 
weber 42 a presbyterian layman who previously worked in 
commercial television said we want to reach people who wouldnt 
watch the typical tv religion fare which offers prepackaged answers 
we want to help focus on the questions themselves there are a 
variety of ways of doing it dramas documentaries callin shows 
profiles of characters dealing with the kinds of questions that 
are being asked 
we want to help people in their own struggle with questions of 
faith 
but the fare also entertains particularly the dramas and music 
about half the programs are produced by participating 
denominations including some worship services but mostly different 
kinds of shows the other half obtained from other producers in 
this country and abroad 
denominations pay costs of their own productions supplying them 
free to the network which thus is able to operate on a relative 
small central budget of about 6 million annually most of it for 
satellite transmission 
about a third of this a steadily growing proportion now is 
covered by fees from cable systems the rest in subsidized funding 
from the cable industry guaranteed through the next two years and 
renewable 
by that time the network expects to be doubled again in size 
reaching more than 15 million homes and selfsupporting it is 
beginning to sell selective advertising but that source still is 
minimal weber said 
the network with a small central staff of 15 operates at 
studios in trinity church in downtown manhattan 
bane said the varied programming sparks religious concern 
sometimes in almost invisible ways and should help bring a 
resurgence of judeochristian values back into mainstream 
thinking 
added weber the timing is right the decade of the 90s is 
going to see a turning back to faith in meaningful ways

president bush wants to set up a social 
security integrity fund a budget proposal that sounds a bit like 
conscience money 
it is his alternative to a bill that would cut social security 
taxes a measure on which the administration still worries about an 
electionyear congressional runaway 
the integrity fund idea has the ring of virtue with a lobbying 
purpose it would be phasedin virtue supposedly taking full 
effect to make payments against the national debt in 1996 for bush 
budgetmakers theres an advantage in delay for the next two 
years they can continue counting the booming social security 
reserve fund growing at about 1 billion a week against their 
estimates of the federal budget deficit 
that will offset about 60 billion in deficit spending over the 
next year even though the money cant be used directly to pay for 
current budget demands the government has a way around that it 
borrows the social security money 
budget director richard g darman calls the integrity fund plan 
a responsible way to protect the future benefits of the people who 
are paying into the social security system now 
but social security is a notoriously volatile subject when it 
enters the political arena and whether rationality will prevail 
remains to be determined darman said in the budget essay he sent 
congress 
that volatility shows in the sudden rise of sen daniel patrick 
moynihans proposal to cut social security taxes choking off the 
surpluses that are being borrowed to pay for other government 
spending the new york democrat says thats the only way to end 
misuse of the trust fund reserves he said hed been trying for two 
years to get the administration to leave the trust fund alone with 
no success 
moynihan said the government should be forced to stop using 
social security reserves now before it becomes totally dependent 
on them you wait five years and they will have a 3 
billionaweek habit moynihan said 
but darman said the proposal would hurt todays taxpaying 
workers one way or another it would either force an increase in 
their nonsocial security taxes or it would force a reduction 
in their future retirement benefits he said 
moynihan said it was his side that sought to protect the 
integrity of the social security fund but our hope has been 
dashed by the repeated determination of the administration and the 
congress to use social security contributions as if they were 
general revenue he said as he introduced the tax cut bill 
the administrations countermeasure is to be called the social 
security integrity and debt reduction fund it would appear in 
budgets beginning on oct 1 1992 
that proposal starts with the premise that the budget will be 
balanced in 1993 as required by current law that is at best a 
shaky premise even though the presumably balanced budget would 
continue to count the social security surplus to offset deficit 
spending 
after all jimmy carter and then ronald reagan both took office 
promising to balance the budget within one term it went up sharply 
under carter and multiplied under reagan 
the bush budget acknowledges that without a change in the 
bookkeeping system chances are that future budgets would show 
surpluses because of social security reserves and that congress 
would be likely to spend the money on other programs 
thats the moynihan argument although he blames it on the 
administration 
his solution is to cut taxes now put social security on a 
payasyougo basis and eliminate the temptation to spend the 
money elsewhere by not collecting it in the first place 
the administration proposal would continue counting social 
security and its surplus as part of the budget and would require 
that all future budgets be balanced but the government would set 
aside appropriations equal to part and eventually all of the 
projected social security surpluses 
thats the integrity fund it would be used to make payments 
against the national debt 
for the year beginning oct 1 1992 the appropriation would be 
15 percent of the estimated social security surplus for the 
following 12 months that would go to gradually to equal the full 
annual surplus in the 1996 budget 
according to the administration that would protect the trust 
fund substantially reduce the national debt and strip away a 
temptation for additional spending 
at some point if all that happened there would have to be 
sharp cuts in other federal programs or sharp increases in other 
taxes or both 
then again by 1996 somebody else will be elected president

david suchet the new hercule poirot on pbs 
mystery first became acquainted with agatha christies 
supersleuth four years ago in the movie thirteen at dinner 
in that 1985 tv movie peter ustinov starred as poirot and 
suchet was the plodding inspector japp scotland yards man on the 
scene whos outwitted by poirot at every turn 
i was able to observe peter up close suchet said i had 
no idea at the time i was going to play poirot myself 
suchet is the third poirot in recent years albert finney also 
played him in the 1974 movie murder on the orient express 
christies books describe poirot as fat but suchet had just 
shed 35 pounds before taking on the role so he needed padding over 
most of his body to attain the detectives bulbous shape 
i wear a lot of padding and a little fake wax moustache he 
said 
nine episodes of agatha christies poirot will be telecast 
this season on mystery which is celebrating its 10th year 
the poirot series began two weeks ago and continues until march 
15 
the episodes also star hugh fraser as poirots eager assistant 
capt arthur hastings philip jackson as inspector japp and 
pauline moran as poirots secretary miss lemon the setting is 
1935 so the stories reflect the fashions atmosphere and politics 
of britains upper class in places ranging from england to the 
mediterranean 
poirot is of course noted for his little gray cells and 
his uncanny ability to unmask all the killers kidnappers 
poisoners plotters thieves and treacherous lovers who cross his 
path 
hes eccentric eating a breakfast every day of two boiled eggs 
that must be exactly the same size and compulsively tidying up any 
room he walks into 
hes very smart hes a brilliant listener said suchet 
agatha christie was very clever with arthur hastings she didnt 
make him a dimwit she gave him a sidekick who can reason with him 
as a reader would hastings goes for the obvious that allows 
poirot to take his ideas off the wall he doesnt believe what he 
sees 
its a clever device that allows poirot to do all this 
thinking and then flash his green light and arrive at the 
solution 
the eccentric little detective first appeared in the 1920 book 
the mysterious affair at styles 
agatha christie had no idea he would become so popular 
suchet said she once said had she known she would have made him 
younger he must have been 180 when he died in the last book the 
final curtain she wrote something like 40 short stories and 30 
books 
although he lives just outside of london suchet is a frequent 
visitor to this country 
im one englishman who loves america he said i did a 
truckandbus shakespeare tour i visited nearly every state 
he played the soviet contact in the falcon and the snowman 
and an israeli spy in the little drummer girl and also had 
roles in the movies harry and the hendersons and the last 
innocent man 
his english home near harrow once was occupied by horatia 
nelson the daughter of lord nelson and lady hamilton 
the roof beams are taken from ships that defeated the spanish 
armada he said it was originally a small house but its had 
some victorian and edwardian additions 
suchet grew up in london where his father was a doctor he 
studied acting at the london academy of music and arts where one 
of his classmates was john lithgow who starred in harry and the 
hendersons 
hes a former member of the royal shakespeare co and has 
appeared in numerous british television productions in one recent 
bbc production bingo he played william shakespeare after the 
bards retirement to stratford 
my career has been very fortunate suchet said i dont 
believe actors can plan a career my measure of success has nothing 
to do with money or fame it has to do with being offered enough 
scripts that you can pick and choose

new home until your condominium in the northeast is sold 
or youve discovered your dream house could be had for a song 
but only if you raise the money from the sale of your present home 
before another anxious buyer gets there 
in both situations the bottlenecked homeowner could use a quick 
cash fix to bridge the gap between the purchase of the new home and 
sale of the old 
bridge or swing loans offer consumers the shortterm 
financing usually three to six months to cover the new down 
payment and closing costs these loans have been around a number of 
years helping buyers take quick advantage of a home bargain make 
a down payment on a house under construction or simply relieve some 
of the presssure of househunting 
but experts warn theyre not for everyone particularly those 
likely to need them most these days homesellers living in regions 
where sales have been especially soft 
what you have to emphasize is that theres a buyer beware 
warning on this product said tara little a spokeswoman for the 
american bankers association a washingtonbased trade group if 
things fall through and the borrower cant find a buyer for the 
first home he still has to pay off the loan 
an alternative may be to get a longerterm standard homeequity 
loan to cover the down payment on a new home and rent the old house 
until its sold the interest on both types of loans is fully 
deductible up to 100000 however one disadvantage to home equity 
loans is they take much longer to process 
bridge loans though arent easy to obtain while there are few 
available statistics some experts estimate only about a quarter to 
a third of all banks and thrifts nationwide regularly offer them 
those that do rarely promote them in 14 years of publishing 
i doubt weve seen more than two bridge loan ads said robert 
heady who runs the north palm beach fla publication bank rate 
monitor 
further complicating matters is that most lenders negotiate 
bridge loans on a casebycase basis with terms depending largely 
on an individuals credit history 
lenders say they look for borrowers with steady income little 
creditcard debt or major loans besides a mortgage and with a home 
in a fairly stable housing market 
if its in a good market well do it in a depressed 
marketplace well back away said michael g noah director of 
consumer lending for goldome bank in buffalo ny the last thing 
we want to do is get into the real estate market 
noah said goldomes loans are secured by the equity in the 
property up for sale 
to provide a safety cushion most lenders offer bridge loans 
equal to around 75 percent to 80 percent of the value of the 
borrowers current home minus outstanding mortgages provided the 
home is under contract to a buyer some banks will lend a little 
less without a contract 
say john and mary homeowner need money in a hurry for a 
downpayment on a 300000 home the house they have is valued at 
250000 and they have 90000 left on their primary mortgage 
based on the 75 percent safety cushion they technically could 
be eligible to borrow up to 97500 or almost a third of the value 
of the new house 
many lenders will only make these loans to first mortgage 
applicants said paul havemann a vice president at butler 
njbased hsh associates which publishes mortgage market 
information 
some insist on interest payments only on a monthly basis with 
the balance to be repaid when the loan is due others ask for no 
payment until the note is due havemann said 
the interest on bridge loans is linked to the prime rate plus 
one or two percentage points some lenders charge more in addition 
to tacking on hefty loan origination fees 
a fortunate few homeowners however can get help from their 
employer 
many of the nations biggest companies provide relocating 
workers with interestfree bridge loans said charles martel 
director of client relations for phh homequity the wilton conn 
company buys the homes of employees on behalf of client companies 
employees based on the homes appraised value and resells them 
martel said hes seen about a 10 percent jump nationwide in 
companysponsored bridge loans over last year he said hes also 
seen a rise in the number of employees who opt for phh homequity to 
buy their home rather than sell it themselves 55 percent this 
year vs around 40 percent a year ago

would you really like to see zero inflation 
a lot of people would including alan greenspan chairman of the 
federal reserve board and at least one president of a federal 
reserve bank w lee hoskins of cleveland 
these are knowledgeable people with as much power as anyone to 
see that their views are accomplished already they are in pursuit 
of those goals 
also of that mind are some academic theoreticians lots of 
business people and some folks in the financial community where 
inflation or its threat is considered an enemy to securities 
many ordinary folks might like it too retirees enjoy knowing 
their pension wont be eroded savers want assurance that their 
money wont diminish in buying power workers want raises to mean 
something 
many people would like to see inflation disappear simply because 
they have come to think of it as evil sinful deceitful 
destructive a killjoy that ruins the party repeatedly it is so 
described in the media 
in all inflation is about the most popular enemy in economics 
with very few people having anything good to say about it to 
support it or defend it is likely to ruin anyones reputation for 
common sense 
yet in the past 60 years inflation generally has been 
accompanied by economic growth while its absence has almost always 
been associated with recession or depression 
true some of that growth is an illusion with rising prices 
shaving from buying power almost as much or more than is added to 
paychecks thats one of the raps against inflation it is 
deceptive 
it is also well known and documented that high or rising 
inflation is often a prelude to recession even a cause and most 
certainly a reflection of unsustainable growth rates 
using as measuring sticks the 1982 dollar and the socalled 
gross national product deflator the most broadbased inflation 
index only in 1936 did inflation average exactly zero for the year 
while that was in the midst of the great depression it was one 
of the better years within it gnp grew sharply only to fall again 
in 1938 in most years of the great depression however there was 
no inflation whatever 
in fact you might say deflation ran wild the worst of it was 
in 1932 when inflation reached minus 115 percent but it was 
also evident in every year from 1930 through 1934 and again in 
1938 and 1939 
in 1949 the inflationdeflation rate dipped below zero again 
to 04 percent and while the economy didnt shrink it also failed 
to grow since then there has always been at least 1 percent 
inflation the least being in 1961 
this record it can be argued might add up to nothing still 
it is hard to dispute the empirical evidence that the pursuit of 
zero inflation may be dangerous 
theory bolsters the contention for example proponents and 
opponents of the zeroinflation goal agree that to bring down any 
existing level of inflation means slowing economic expansion 
any slowdown of course is reflected in and demonstrated by 
statistical evidence of curtailed production sales profits wages 
and layoffs and perhaps in lower corporate stock prices and 
dividends too 
an intentionally induced slowdown implemented by restraining 
money supply and keeping interest rates high is a fragile 
undertaking at best it is probably mere guesswork as to when to 
apply or relieve pressure 
during this time the fed must rely on statistical measurements 
and some of those measurements provide evidence after the fact 
when they reveal their news it is already too late to seek zero 
therefore is to risk recession 
there is also error to contend with 
each year economist walter j williams surveys his colleagues 
at a meeting of the national association of business economists 
last year he found 72 percent of them were unhappy with the quality 
of government data 
it is worth noting he said and perhaps a little 
frightening that the greatest skepticism was directed at numbers 
generally given the most weight by financial decisionmakers 
among them are reports on the gross national product whose 
expansion or shrinkage determines whether we are in recession

after being mostly snubbed by the white house for the past 
decade us religious leaders are finding the present 
administration is more receptive consequently theyre giving it 
their views and anxieties 
theyve also received some encouragement from it 
certainly there has been more openness on the part of the bush 
administration said mary cooper acting director of the 
washington office of the national council of churches 
the latest concern stressed by religious officials in a jan 19 
meeting with secretary of state james a baker iii has been the 
harassment arrests and sometimes killing of church workers in el 
salvador 
according to the delegation baker voiced strong support for the 
work of the churches in el salvador saying it needed to go on 
unhindered and said the administration firmly rejects claims the 
churches are fronts for rebels 
that charge has been regularly made by the salvadoran army in 
forays on religious institutions 
the delegation with whom baker met at president bushs request 
gave him documents detailing 54 searches by salvadoran military 
forces of 40 different church facilities and homes of church 
workers in a onemonth period 
last november six roman catholic priests were killed and scores 
of church workers arrested most of them since deported the 
countrys lutheran bishop medardo gomez his life threatened as a 
subversive now is in exile 
baker wrote to salvadoran president alfredo cristiani on dec 11 
emphasizing us concern for the wellbeing of the religious 
community and humanitarian assistance workers 
the ninemember inferfaith delegation of protestant roman 
catholic and jewish leaders who met with baker expressed 
appreciation for that appeal but cited incidents of harassment of 
churches still occurring 
although the general situation has eased there is still a 
climate of pervasive fear and tension said the rev daniel 
weiss general secretary of american baptist churches 
weiss who has made several trips to el salvador said he found 
the salvadoran government seemed to consider the churches work 
to feed the hungry to help the uprooted to resettle refugeees 
as political acts 
both the religious leaders and baker expressed hope for settling 
the conflict through negotiations but baker defended continued 
us military aid while the religious leaders opposed it 
we said we will not back off on that matter said united 
methodist bishop melvin g talbert of san francisco what were 
pushing for is for both sides to come to the table 
episcopal presiding bishop edmond l browning who has met 
several times with bush said i think secretary baker heard our 
concerns 
religious delegations also had met earlier with administration 
officials 
three roman catholic bishops including arcbishop daniel e 
pilarczyk of cincinnati president of the national conference of 
catholic bishops met with bush aides at the white house on dec 22 
also about el salvador 
urging negotiations to end the conflict the bishops called for 
an end to the pattern of harassment threats and intimidation 
against religious workers 
an interfaith delegation met last november with state department 
officials on the same issue 
meanwhile many churches across the country have scheduled 
prayer vigils fasting and sermons about el salvador between now 
and march 24 which is the 10th anniversary of the assassination of 
salvadoran roman catholic archbishop oscar romero 
miss cooper an episcopalian said the government has been much 
more willing to listen to religious views under bushs leadership 
she said president reagan was just not interested 
she said church relations were fine with president carter a 
southern baptist and we had a good active relationship with 
president ford an episcopalian she said contacts were almost nil 
with fords predecessor richard nixon a quaker 
the very rev leonid kishkovsky presidentelect of the national 
council of churches said that in a meeting with state department 
officials plans were laid for regular meetings with religious 
leaders 
the purpose of the discussions will be to look at the baseline 
of factual information we agree on and share perspectives 
kishkovsky said recognizing that churches will have special 
insights and sometimes criticisms 
he said the meetings were expected to be monthly or every other 
month

protestant jewish and roman catholic leaders 
at an interreligious convocation urged more joint theological and 
community efforts to end what they called the cold war among 
religions 
the creation of a world at peace is one of the foundation 
stones of both judaism and christianity but their cold war 
undermines the credibility of that message said rabbi a james 
rudin interreligious affairs director of the american jewish 
committee 
the rev john b cobb jr a united methodist theologian of 
claremont university said a step toward ending the war was to 
bring out new overlaps among our faiths to inform public life 
and public schools 
he said american society has not faced up to the difficulty of 
transmitting values apart from schools whose ethos is formed by 
particular religious traditions what is needed is open interaction 
from which would emerge agreements on values that all can support 
he urged rethinking of our theology so that the most 
wholehearted commitment to christ will be the strongest reason for 
the full acceptance of judaism as a companion in the service of 
god

in the arcane drawnout process of designing 
a 487 billion spending plan for the agriculture department 
somebody got a little more creative than usual with a couple of 
programs 
in an effort to get congress to swallow what it refused to in 
the past department budgetwriters added a few sweeteners 
take the school lunch program for instance which serves meals 
to more than 24 million children each day if you want to help more 
poor children the administration says let the richer children pay 
their own way 
according to usdas own analysis of president bushs budget 
proposals sent to congress last week unless lawmakers buy the 1991 
school lunch blueprint the program will need about 34 billion 
next year up 200 million from 1990 
the money which includes usdadonated commodities is used to 
subsidize meals served by schools based on a childs family 
income a middleincome student might pay a reduced cost price 
for lunch a truly lowincome child can eat free of charge 
as it is all meals are subsidized regardless of a childs 
family income those from affluent homes pay full price for lunch 
at school cafeterias but those meals still carry a federal subsidy 
the white house budget proposal which originated in the office 
of management and budget would eliminate federal meal subsidies 
for children from affluent homes an idea that goes back many 
years each time congress has tossed it aside 
but the latest omb plan also seeks legislation to require 
children with family incomes of more than 350 percent of the 
federal poverty level or 42350 a year for a family of four to 
pay more for school meals at current rates their share of the 
subsidy is 28 cents per serving that would save 2354 million 
next year 
department officials estimate more than 48 million children 
from affluent families are eating subsidized school meals each day 
about 543 million of the savings would then be spent on more 
than 16 million middle poor kids who qualify for reduced 
prices in school cafeterias their family income would be in the 
range of 130 percent to 185 percent of the governments poverty 
level or 15730 to 22385 a year 
those would pay only 20 cents per meal instead of the current 40 
cents 
free meals would continue to be available for 10 million 
children from homes below 130 percent of the poverty standard or 
15730 a year for a family of four 
no change in the subsidy rates would be planned for 81 million 
children from homes in the 185 percent to 350 percent income 
category 22385 to 42350 a year for a fourmember family 
the net savings in the school lunch program according to usda 
budget people would be a tidy 1811 million simply by requiring 
the topbracket children to pay more for their meals 
the farmers home administration plan also has a little sweetener 
to help the medicine go down 
the fmha would be able to handle less than 34 billion in farm 
loans in 1991 under the bush plan down from 42 billion estimated 
this fiscal year according to the usda budget analysis 
a further emphasis will be put on fmha guaranteed loans instead 
of direct loans by the agency itself this has been a trend for 
some years with guarantees exceeding direct loans since 1987 
under the guarantee procedure banks or other commercial 
institutions lend money to farmers and the fmha provides a 
guarantee that the debt will be repaid however guarantees have 
not been popular with many hardpressed farmers because of higher 
interest rates charged by commercial lenders 
wherever possible new borrowers will be assisted through 
guaranteed rather than direct loans and existing borrowers will be 
graduated to private sector credit using a guarantee where 
necessary said the usda analysis this shift will allow fmha 
to provide more intense supervision to those borrowers who can only 
be reached by direct loans 
undersecretary roland r vautour who oversees the usdas small 
community and rural development programs suggested an interest 
subsidy for farmers taking out fmha guaranteed loans instead of 
direct agency financing 
the omb bought the idea and incorporated it into the bush 
budget analysts estimated the subsidy would average about 3 
percentage points meaning a loan that might cost a borrower 11 
percent could be had for 8 percent with the fmha subsidy 
in 1991 the subsidies would be used on 350 million in fmha 
farm operating loans and 50 million of farm ownership loans 
meanwhile the 1991 plan calls for cutting fmha farm operating 
direct loans to 500 million from an estimated 932 million this 
year direct farm ownership loans would drop to 38 million from 
80 million 
whether these and other usda budget maneuvers will survive the 
will of congress remains to be seen

theres a story that claude monet began his 
series paintings because the light was changing so fast on a 
grain stack he was painting that he kept asking his stepdaughter to 
run for more canvases 
its a kind of wonderful and amusing but completely fallacious 
tale said paul h tucker associate professor of art at the 
university of massachusetts at boston and guest curator of monet 
in the 90s the series paintings which opens at the museum of 
fine arts on wednesday 
monet the leading french impressionist is known to have done 
218 series paintings all but 12 during the 1890s when he was 
in his 50s 
he chose 16 subjects some for their historical or cultural 
significance among the works were 30 paintings each of grain 
stacks and the rouen cathedral 24 paintings of poplars and 18 of 
the japanese bridge over his waterlily garden at giverny 
there are 86 in the exhibition more than twice the number monet 
ever showed at one time the works have been loaned from all over 
the world including leningrad paris tokyo and boston 
this is the largest of all the series ever assembled said 
tucker 
why monet painted series is not absolutely certain he said but 
the monet specialist thinks one reason was to show the wideranging 
effects of nature 
another was to answer the challenges posed by younger artists 
especially georges seurat whose a sunday on the island of the 
grande jatte in 1886 was an enormous challenge to impressionism 
it was an assault tucker said 
monet responded to the challenges with the revolutionary idea of 
doing a series of paintings on the same subject 
he carved out a completely new niche it was very 
inventive very daring tucker said 
monet painted his subjects in different seasons at different 
times of day sometimes from different angles 
one of the wonders of the show is to be able to compare and 
contrast tucker said the style differs for almost every series 
as well in terms of color composition and the way the paint was 
applied 
the series paintings were a way for him to assert the 
continued vitality of impressionism tucker said 
the repeating images responded to the repetitiousness in 
seurats style of painting with dots while retaining an 
individualism monet believed was lacking in seurats work tucker 
said 
though the approach and style were revolutionary they were not 
monets sole concern he wants us in the end to be more attuned 
to nature as well tucker said 
not one of the series is intact in a single collection although 
statesman georges clemenceau urged the president of france to buy 
all the rouen cathedral paintings for the country 
the most important thing was to sell said tucker and some 
paintings from a series were sold before the series was exhibited 
im sure monet would have been thrilled if an individual 
collector bought them all but he wanted to have them sold he 
probably had a big mortgage too 
tucker wrote the text more a book than a catalog that 
accompanies the exhibit he began research for a book on monets 
series paintings six years ago while on a sabbatical and in 
talking with people at the museum of fine arts an exhibit of the 
paintings was suggested 
the museum which has 38 monet paintings the largest collection 
outside paris organized the exhibition 
these are paintings of extraordinary beauty which speak 
eloquently of the concerns of french culture and civilization 
peter sutton the museums curator of european paintings said of 
the series paintings 
after closing in boston april 29 the exhibit will be at the art 
institute of chicago from may 19 through aug 12 and at the royal 
academy in london from sept 7 through dec 9

he considers himself a loyal member of the 
communist party and remains an admirer of senior chinese leader 
deng xiaoping but in the waning days of last springs 
prodemocracy demonstrations gao xin and three others staged a 
hunger strike in tiananmen square for that he spent six months in 
jail here gao describes how he was treated 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
gao xin denounced by chinese authorities as a 
counterrevolutionary plotter walked out of jail after 185 days 
12 pounds thinner his job gone and his wedding plans on hold 
in releasing him the authorities didnt say gao was 
rehabilitated forgiven or even cleared they had never formally 
charged him with anything gao says the guards told him that the 
investigation into his activities was completed 
the government said recently it has freed 573 people arrested 
for taking part in the crushed spring democracy movement out of 
thousands jailed in beijing alone 
but gao and others who have been freed have found their troubles 
are not over their lives have been irrevocably changed by what 
for some was an impulse of the moment to join in the studentled 
protests 
gao perhaps the first of the protesters to speak for the record 
about their experiences in jail says he wanted to tell his story 
out of a sense of responsibility to history and to the chinese 
nation 
gaos crime was to join with three friends all young 
intellectuals in staging a hunger strike in tiananmen square in 
the movements final days gao 33 was a communist party member 
who until then stayed out of the protests keeping busy at his job 
editing beijing normal universitys official newspaper 
but when the government declared martial law on may 20 he 
along with tens of thousands of beijing residents joined the 
students 
i did it because i opposed martial law gao says the 
armys guns should be pointed outward not inward at the people 
but beijing mayor chen xitong denounced the four hunger strikers 
as agitators who sought to overthrow the government 
gao says was strolling outside his fiancees apartment on june 
14 when an unmarked car stopped four men got out and told him to 
come along he recalls 
he was taken to a small jail where prisoners were held for short 
periods before being tried or executed there he says he shared a 
90squarefoot cell with at least seven men at a time most of them 
accused of crimes such as rape murder or theft 
only twice in his sixmonth stay was he let out for exercise he 
says the cell had a small window but the heat was overwhelming 
the light was kept burning at night no books or newspapers were 
allowed 
four men could sleep on a wooden platform that filled half the 
cell the others slept on bedrolls on the floor 
relatives could not visit gaos family was not even told of his 
arrest his fiancee zhang xiaomei went from police station to 
station seeking news of his whereabouts but was told each time 
we arent clear 
only in october was gao allowed to send her a postcard with a 
list of clothing and toiletries for her to bring to him guards 
took the package in to gao 
but in other ways he says the guards treated him with courtesy 
not afforded the common criminals in his cell 
the others got only two steamed rolls at lunch and dinner but 
the guards gave me as many as i wanted because they sympathized 
with me he says i think they had consciences and a sense of 
justice 
the other prisoners were told to sit quietly but gao was 
allowed to pace back and forth he says he estimates he walked 
over 10 miles a day 
his cellmates came and went a 19yearold accused of robbing 
and killing two taxi drivers gave gao his tshirt before being led 
away to be executed

after several months gao says he was made cell monitor and 
given a makeshift pen an ink cartridge wrapped with tape so he 
could fill out a daily form evaluating his cellmates he used it to 
write poems on the inside of the tshirt 
words transcribed in prison 
i give to xiaomei 
one glance and the one with my heart 
knows who wrote it 
he also scrawled poetry on a roll of toilet paper sometimes he 
recited for the other prisoners 
they liked it even though i write bad poetry gao recalls 
they were bored before i came they would tell dirty stories 
and bully the newcomers so i gave them lectures about poetry they 
called me teacher and they cried when i left 
gao was questioned only rarely and was given no clue about his 
eventual fate the loneliness of the spirit was terrible he 
recalls 
gao was released on dec 16 but two of his fellow hunger 
strikers zhou duo and liu xiaobo remain jailed he says the 
fourth man taiwanese pop star hou dejian took refuge in the 
australian embassy and left in august with chinese guarantees he 
would not be arrested 
gao says the government should thank the four because they led 
the students in a peaceful retreat from tiananmen square when 
soldiers surrounded it before dawn on june 4 
objectively speaking we helped the government to avoid 
bloodshed he says the more people who died the harder it 
would have been for the government 
gao and hou also have helped authorities by testifying that 
there was no bloodbath inside the square despite the deaths of 
hundreds and possibly thousands in nearby streets both insist they 
made no deal with the government to say so 
on oct 1 the 40th anniversary of communist rule in china the 
jail turned on loudspeakers and broadcast the festivities taking 
place in tiananmen square gao says he listened with a heavy heart 
i remember the 35th anniversary in 1984 he says i was in 
the square it seemed the communist party was at its highest level 
of prestige every sector of society peasants workers students 
all had so much hope in the reforms that senior leader deng 
xiaoping was enacting to shake up the economy 
i wish that time could return 
he still pays his monthly party dues of 24 cents and still 
believes deng is one of the greatest figures in chinese history 
despite his orders to crush the spring movement 
it was deng who opened our eyes who opened china and let 
foreigners come in and chinese go out this cannot be wiped out 
he says as for whether the party can save china we will have to 
see right now there is no organization that can substitute for it 
i think i am a good party member the partys guiding 
principles say the party works for the interests of the vast 
majority i think what i did in tiananmen square was for the vast 
majority 
ordinary criminals freed from jail often are given their old 
jobs back to aid their rehabilitation but gao says that when he 
went back to beijing normal university the school refused to let 
him resume work 
it did not formally fire him either meaning that in chinas 
controlled job market he is not free to seek new work so he is 
taking turns living with friends hou zhang and others 
they told me to wait so im waiting he says 
meanwhile gao says he can no longer think of marrying zhang 
what can i give her

when doris kearns goodwin was writing her 
history of the fitzgeralds and the kennedys she was often only a 
few chapters ahead of the screenwriter for the miniseries the 
kennedys of massachusetts 
goodwins book the fitzgeralds and the kennedys traces the 
personal and political histories of the two families from their 
irish roots to boston to the election of john f kennedy as 
president 
the sixhour miniseries will be broadcast by abc on sunday 
monday and tuesday starring william peterson as joe kennedy 
annette otoole as rose fitzgerald kennedy pat hingle as joes 
father pj kennedy charles durning as roses father john 
honey fitz fitzgerald steven weber as john f kennedy and 
madolyn smithosborne as actress gloria swanson joe kennedys 
longtime mistress 
the authors 13yearold son michael goodwin plays joe jr 
the book was bought as a miniseries in 1982 in the early stages 
of the manuscript and screenwriter william hanley working chapter 
by chapter frequently called goodwin to see what was coming next 
doing the research was the best part said goodwin a former 
harvard professor whos now working on a book about the american 
homefront in world war ii with franklin and eleanor roosevelt as 
the focus it also has been sold as a miniseries 
it was wonderful to find things that give you the feel and 
texture of the era she said when i learn something i become 
very excited to get it out to the reader honey fitz spent a year 
at the harvard medical school and i became so fascinated with 
medicine of that period that the publisher had to tell me to cut it 
out 
the book began as a traditional biography of president kennedy 
goodwins husband richard goodwin had been a speechwriter for 
kennedy and she had been a special assistant to president johnson 
and wrote lyndon johnson and the american dream 
it took on a new dimension when she began her research one of 
the great treasures she found were 150 cartons of papers saved by 
joe and rose kennedy they were at the kennedy library but no one 
had looked at them and they had not yet been deeded to the library 
she obtained permission from sen edward m kennedy to go through 
the material 
that took a year and a half goodwin said they had saved 
every letter every report card every piece of paper even gloria 
swansons income tax statements those letters told me the internal 
dynamics of the family and enabled hanley to write their dialogue 
the papers fell into the boxes as they would fall in life you 
could see how each event related to another 
asked what set the fitzgeralds and the kennedys apart from 
millions of other irish catholics goodwin said the fitzgeralds 
and particularly joe kennedy instilled into their kids that above 
all else they were a family they presented themselves to the world 
like a clan they had traditions and loyalties and rituals the 
kids knew they had to be there for dinner every night they knew 
they went to hyannisport on a certain day 
second part of the family ethos was that they lived on the 
edge you create your own success and if the family backs you it 
doesnt matter what the world thinks 
joe kennedy despite his failings gave the family a center she 
said he drove himself and his family relentlessly to succeed 
partly because of the exclusion he had felt in boston as an irish 
catholic 
the miniseries filmed largely in boston evokes a strong 
feeling for the period it captures often through banter the 
fierce loyalties and competition within the families 
the original screenplay began in ireland and ran for 11 hours 
but it was cut to six hours and now begins when honey fitz 
already is mayor of boston like the book it ends with kennedys 
election to the presidency 
after goodwin completed the book she wasnt sure how the 
kennedys would feel since it exposes many family secrets 
there are many times in the book when you feel anger toward 
joe or rose she said i wasnt trying to judge them i heard 
the family was upset at first 
normally the kennedys dont read books about them but there 
was so much history about the fitzgeralds that no one knew that 
theybegan to read the book then i received 12 copies of the book 
from sargent shriver eunices husband he wanted them signed for 
the kids in general they seemed to like the book i think theyll 
feel the same way about the miniseries

representatives of eastern airlines preferred 
shareholders suggested the liquidation or outright sale of the 
carrier saying they had lost faith in management because it was 
cannibalizing the airline 
plainly stated eals management has lost control of the 
enterprise the shareholders committee said in papers filed 
tuesday in us bankruptcy court here 
they are simply unable to make the airline work nor are they 
able to accurately forecast its future even for a few weeks at a 
time 
the committee urged us bankruptcy judge burton r lifland to 
advance eastern only enough money to keep it operating 
the move by preferred stockholders comes after eastern last week 
filed a new reorganization plan with the court in which it proposed 
to pay preferred holders no more than 10 cents on the dollar in the 
form of new securities previously eastern had promised to repay 
its creditors in full 
the shareholders committee said it no longer supported current 
management and called for dramatic steps to salvage value for 
creditors it said options included sale of the miamibased airline 
or liquidation of its assets 
eastern has been using money from the sale of assets to keep the 
airline operating and to fund its reorganization as a much smaller 
carrier proceeds from the asset sales have been placed in special 
accounts monitored by the bankruptcy court 
the shareholders committee said eastern requested a total of 
250 million from the accounts last july september and december 
and the judge allowed the airline to withdraw 210 million 
eastern filed a fourth withdrawal request monday seeking an 
additional 50 million to fund operating losses through february 
the preferred shareholders said a 40 million advance would be 
enough to cover the next month 
the committee accused eastern of the cannibalization of the 
airline in a frenzied attempt to keep it alive 
the airline is literally living off of the proceeds of its 
asset sales funding everincreasing operating losses and putting 
its preferred stockholders and unsecured creditors further in the 
whole it said 
eastern which sought chapter 11 protection from creditors last 
march after its machinists pilots and flight attendants walked off 
the job last week submitted a revised reorganization plan that 
calls for partial payment to unsecured creditors 
eastern proposed paying preferred stockholders to whom it owes 
1175 billion no more than 10 cents on the dollar in new stock 
it called for paying unsecured creditors only 10 percent of 
their debts in cash when the airline emerges from bankruptcy 
protection and another 70 percent over the following 10 years 
without interest 
in return for accepting partial repayment easterns parent 
texas air corp would give the unsecured creditors 40 percent of 
the airlines equity 
under easterns two previous plans unsecured creditors were to 
be repaid in full with interest at the completion of chapter 11 
eastern owes the unsecured creditors primarily trade suppliers 
such as aircraft manufacturers around 11 billion 
eastern also said it expects to post a net loss of 280 million 
for the fourth quarter bringing losses for all of 1989 to an 
estimated 850 million the airline also projected a 125 million 
net loss for the first quarter of 1990 
the problem is that by any objective yardstiock the airline 
is failing the preferred shareholders said in the court papers 
the preferred committee no longer believes that eal is viable in 
its current operating mode

a house panel looking into the biggest 
bankruptcy filing in retail history got an earful about the dangers 
of leveraged buyouts and the panels chief said urged new 
restrictions to prevent potential takeover trophies from 
becoming bankruptcy debtors 
witnesses ranging from the massachusetts attorney general to the 
head of the union representing bloomingdales workers testified 
tuesday about the problems facing federated department stores inc 
and allied stores corp 
the two retailing giants have filed for bankruptcy 
reorganization because of their inability to finance debts taken on 
when campeau corp acquired the companies in the 1980s 
the groundwork for todays fiasco was laid by the reagan 
administration which took a handsoff view of antitrust 
enforcement said massachusetts attorney general james m shannon 
rep jack brooks chairman of the house judiciary committees 
economic and commercial law subcommittee echoed that complaint 
criticizing the anything goes regulators of the past decade 
brooks dtexas warned that if the white house doesnt act to 
rein in debtfinanced takeovers such as leveraged buyouts then 
congress must take the initiative by considering antitrust 
bankruptcy and tax legislation to stop the lbo frenzy 
brooks said the chapter 11 filing by the campeau subsidiaries 
may have signaled that the takeover trophies of the 1980s will 
soon become the bankruptcy debtors of the 1990s 
torontobased campeau amassed 75 billion in debt acquiring 
allied and federated largely through loans and junk bonds 
allied and federated both headquartered in cincinnati ohio 
operate such well known chains as bloomingdales jordan marsh the 
bon marche and lazarus without the burden of their buyout debt 
they would be profitable healthy businesses 
the subcommittees ranking republican rep hamilton fish jr 
of new york said congress should carefully review any tax 
advantages or incentives that encourage the use of the lbo 
mechanism 
fish said the campeau situation pointed out an important flaw 
in the corporate tax code it is cheaper for a business to borrow 
money through a leveraged buyout than it is to raise the necessary 
funds by the more traditional issuance of stock 
in a leveraged buyout a companys buyers put up its assets as 
collateral to secure financing they hope to finance the debt with 
the target companys cash flow and by selling off some operations 
interest on that debt in most cases is tax deductible making such 
deals attractive to the buyers 
since campeau took over federated an estimated 10000 jobs 
have been lost with 400 positions eliminated at bloomingdales 
alone said lenore miller president of the retail wholesale and 
department store union which represents 4000 bloomingdales 
employees 
shannon of massachusetts said campeaus problems would have been 
greater if he and other state attorneys general hadnt taken action 
on campeaus federated takeover 
he said the two main department stores in his region jordan 
marsh and filenes would have become campeau properties if the 
state officials hadnt acted campeau already had jordan marsh as 
part of the allied operation while federated owned filenes 
by law the federal trade commission was responsible for 
reviewing this proposal at the federal level but despite our 
urging the commission allowed the merger to go through without 
even giving it an extended review said shannon 
he said campeau agreed to relinquish filenes after he and 
attorneys general in maine new hampshire and new york threatened 
to oppose campeaus acquisition of federated 
shannon said the bush administration unlike its predecessor 
has shown signs that it intends to be more active in merger 
enforcement 
we have not seen or heard his testimony and we really cant 
comment said susan ticknor a spokeswoman with for ftc 
but two professors said the antitrust laws may be 
insufficient to cope with the deal mania sweeping corporate 
america 
walter adams past president of michaigan state university and 
james w brock professor of economics at ohios miami university 
suggested requiring those behind large mergers or buyouts 1 
billion or more to file a public impact statement to demonstrate 
that the deal is in the national interest

the day before chrysler corp shuts down a major 
assembly plant the companys directors will hear that more 
facilities may have to close because of slumping demand a united 
auto workers union source says 
chryslers board which includes uaw president owen bieber will 
receive a report at a meeting thursday 
the report is expected to show that despite fridays closing of 
the jefferson avenue assembly plant the nations no 3 automaker 
still has the capacity to produce more cars than it is able to 
sell said the source who spoke tuesday on the condition of 
anonymity 
the report could mean more layoffs on top of the more than 
10000 already announced by chrysler and general motors corp in 
recent weeks 
us automakers are facing pressure from a slump in new car 
sales and increasing competition from socalled transplants or 
cars made by japanese auto companies at new plants in this country 
shutting down a plant is the most serious measure an automaker 
can take to cut costs shrink newvehicle inventories and bolster 
profits 
bieber and other uaw leaders failed tuesday in an attempt to 
persuade chrysler to keep the jefferson avenue plant open and avoid 
1700 layoffs there the plant is the only one making dodge omni 
and plymouth horizon subcompacts 
chrysler officials have held out the possibility that it may 
have to shut other assembly plants this year as the entire industry 
heads into what some analysts say is a recession 
general motors corp and chrysler already have said they plan to 
indefinitely lay off about 13600 workers at 11 assembly plants by 
the end of march gm will close its lakewood plant in atlanta 
indefinitely in midmarch the other layoffs stem from production 
reductions at other plants 
ford motor co has avoided indefinite layoffs by eliminating 
overtime and temporarily shutting down a variety of its factories 
closing or cutting production at big three assembly plants 
typically mean layoffs at component and supplier plants operated by 
the automakers or other companies its difficult to estimate how 
many layoffs may occur because of the assembly plant closings but 
automakers have said it could be thousands of jobs 
most speculation about further chrysler plant closings have 
centered on its st louis no 1 plant which makes chrysler lebaron 
coupes and convertibles and dodge daytona cars 
uaw and company officials said tuesday they didnt know if the 
report would make recommendations about further plant closings 
bieber and chrysler chairman lee iacocca met for more than two 
hours tuesday company spokesman lee sechler said and discussed a 
variety of issues but focused on the jefferson avenue plant 
the automaker is closing the plant because of slumping sales of 
the cars the uaw has contested the move saying the company didnt 
market the cars properly wanting instead to cut its factory 
capacity 
they reviewed a number of alternatives to continuing 
omnihorizon production all of which had been explored and 
reviewed by the company sechler said none of the alternatives 
or plans discussed provided sufficient volume to continue 
omnihorizon production so the feb 2 decision stands 
earlier this month the uaw presented chrysler with a proposal 
that the company continue making the two cars and market them only 
in areas where omni and horizon cars have been selling well 
chrysler rejected that plan

a jury verdict that ford motor co violated 
patent rights on intermittent windshield wipers held by a former 
university professor has the potential to cost most major 
automakers millions of dollars 
robert w kearns a former professor at wayne state university 
in detroit won his patent infringement suit against ford on monday 
in federal court 
he has filed similar suits against general motors corp 
chrysler corp daimlerbenz honda toyota nissan and 21 other 
companies the ford case was the first to go to trial 
kearns claimed in his 12yearold lawsuit that his version of 
intermittent windshield wipers was unique because of a certain 
combination of parts ford denied that 
an eightmember jury sided with kearns on monday after a week of 
deliberations the jury reconvenes feb 26 to set damages 
although his suit doesnt specify damages kearns has said he is 
seeking 50 for every ford car built with intermittent wipers ford 
is believed to have sold at least a million cars a year with the 
device since 1982 
the device also is a common feature on cars made by most of the 
worlds major automakers 
us district judge avern cohn ruled earlier that kearns failed 
to prove he could have made and marketed the system on his own and 
thus can claim only a royalty on each wiper instead of fords 
profit 
if the inventor gets everything he wants the case could cost 
the automobile industry hundreds of millions of dollars and 
possibly more than 1 billion the new york times reported in 
todays editions 
cohn barred kearns and ford officials from talking about the 
case 
other automakers said they were studying the verdict closely 
but they declined to comment further 
our people need to look at the details of this ford verdict 
before we can really comment much further said honda north 
america inc spokesman kurt antonius our litigation is in the 
very early stages 
there are some differences in the technical and legal aspects 
of our case and fords said gm spokesman don postma because 
the subject is in litigation we will refrain from further comment 
chrysler spokesman lee sechler said the nations no 3 automaker 
would not comment 
kearns claimed in his lawsuit against ford that he installed a 
set of his wipers on a 1962 ford car and took it to the automaker 
kearns made numerous disclosures of confidential engineering 
test designs to ford engineers the lawsuit claimed they 
repeatedly asked him to discuss designs the lawsuit said leading 
kearns to believe ford would buy his system 
kearns a river rouge mich native and a university of detroit 
graduate who now lives in gaithersburg md filed suit against 
ford and other automakers to protect patents he obtained between 
196774

billman accused of bilking depositors out of 106 million is 
hiding out in europe but they hope a 200000 reward will help 
bring him to justice in the united states 
we intend to pursue tom billman and bring him to justice 
although we have evidence that he intends never to return to the 
united states i am confident that some day somewhere we will 
catch up with him us attorney fo maryland breckinridge willcox 
said 
the reward announced tuesday is for information leading to the 
capture and extradition of the former community savings amp loan 
chairman who has been a fugitive for nearly 1 years 
willcox said the maryland deposit insurance fund and the postal 
inspection service are offering the 200000 reward which would be 
paid when billman is brought back to maryland to stand trial 
authorities also unsealed a 20count racketeering indictment 
against billman two other community principals clayton c 
mccuistion and barbara a mckinney and crysopt corp a holding 
company that owned community savings and equity programs investment 
corp a national real estate syndicate that collapsed in 1985

ford motor co says it may have to take a 
charge of up to 500 million against 1989 earnings because it sold 
its rouge steel company for less than book value 
a filing with the securities and exchange commission tuesday 
revealed that ford is projecting north american production for the 
first quarter of 1990 to be off 25 percent from the same period in 
1989 following a 13 percent decline in the quarter just ended 
ford also said it would increase borrowings substantially 
this year because of two recent acquisitions 
the disclosures came in a filing by a wholly owned ford 
subsidiary ford motor credit co seeking sec permission to offer 
2 billion in debt securities from time to time over the next two 
years 
ford motor credit provides wholesale financing and capital loans 
to franchised ford dealers and makes loans to vehicle leasing 
companies 
as part of the secs required disclosure to potential investors 
the registration filing revealed several situations at the parent 
company 
fords dec 15 1989 sale of all the outstanding stock of 
rouge steel company to marico acquisition corp was below book 
value the amount of the charge to net income has not yet been 
determined but could range up to 500 million for the fourth 
quarter and full year 1989 
marico was merged into rouge steel and ford acquired 20 
percent in the resulting corporation but also is committed to 
indemnify rouge steel for environmental matters prior to the 
sale ford is unable at this time to determine the amount of its 
potential responsibility for such environmental matters however 
such costs could be substantial 
on jan 12 ford announced plans to sell ford aerospace but 
it is uncertain when or at what price such sale may occur 
the acquisition of associates a major consumer loan concern 
and jaguar plc the british luxury carmaker have used and will 
continue to use substantial amounts of available cash 
consequently it is anticipated that ford and its affilates will 
substantially increase borrowings in 1990 
ford estimated its north american vehicle production in the 
fourth quarter 1989 was 13 percent below the fourth quarter of 
1988 and estimated scheduled production for the first quarter of 
1990 is estimated at 25 percent below the first quarter of 1989

grab your wallets democrats in congress 
think they have received a signal from president bush on how much 
he would be willing to accept in tax increases this year 
the magic number is 217 billion the total for the hodgepodge 
of tax increases user fees and asset sales that bush included in 
his 1991 spending plan 
democrats say they believe the 217 billion represents the 
amount in higher revenues the administration would be willing to 
accept during budget negotiations this year 
both senate budget committee chairman james sasser dtenn and 
house budget committee chairman leon panetta dcalif told 
reporters they were satisfied with bushs new revenue total but 
they indicated they would radically alter the way the money was 
raised 
that revenue figure in total is something that we can accept 
unfortunately in bushs budget it is not legitimately obtained 
sasser said 
critics of the budget questioned for instance bushs claim 
that he would be able to push tax collections up by 25 billion in 
1991 through management reforms at the internal revenue service 
at the center of the tax debate will be the administrations 
renewed push to cut the tax on capital gains which critics charge 
would benefit the wealthy and a rival plan by sen daniel 
moynihan dny to trim social security payroll taxes by 62 
billion over the next two years 
treasury secretary nicholas brady on tuesday rejected the idea 
that the administration might be willing to support moynihans 
proposal or at least a scaleddown version in exchange for 
democrats dropping their opposition to the capital gains reduction 
brady termed moynihans proposal goofy and the height of 
folly because it would raise doubts in americans minds about the 
safety of the social security trust funds 
sasser said the administration was not being consistent when it 
attacked moynihans proposal as a revenueloser while pushing a 
capital gains tax cut that benefits the wealthy and loses huge 
blocks of revenue in the years ahead 
but for 1991 the administrations budget shows the capital 
gains tax cut is a revenuegainer in fact it would account for 
the single biggest jump in tax revenues in the presidents budget 
an increase of 49 billion 
the higher figure is based on a belief that investors would rush 
to sell assets such as stocks or real estate to take advantage of 
the lower tax rate but critics charge the lower rate would result 
in a loss to the treasury in later years 
in all the bush budget proposes 157 billion in new tax 
revenues which would be offset by 18 billion in proposed cuts 
including an estimated 200 million loss in the first year from 
implementation of bushs proposed family savings accounts offering 
taxpayers to put away up to 5000 annually in taxfree accounts 
in addition the president proposes raising 56 billion in new 
user fees charged for providing government services 16 billion 
in the sale of government assets and 600 million in other new 
receipts bringing the total to 217 billion 
critics charged that bush recycled a variety of proposals some 
dating back to the early reagan years that congress has repeatedly 
rejected 
one retread is a measure to assess federal social security taxes 
on state and local government employees in the handful of states 
who are not now covered by the levy a 38 billion revenue raiser 
that bush unsuccessfully sought last year 
panetta suggested that congress might consider compromising on 
the capital gains cut sought by bush if the president was willing 
to consider tax increases in other areas possibly a higher top tax 
rate for individuals or a boost in energy taxes

quaker oats co says it funds oatbran research 
to learn more about oats not to produce studies that will help 
sell its products 
i think its safe to say that if quaker had not been providing 
research funding to universities for the past 25 years the amount 
of information known about oats in general would be far less than 
it is said ron bottrell a spokesman for the chicagobased 
company 
bottrells comments tuesday came after the company disclosed it 
is funding research aimed at substantiating the health benefits of 
oat bran 
quakers researchsupported claim that oatbran can help lower 
cholesterol was challenged recently by a harvard medical study of 
the heavily marketed food product 
bottrell declined to describe two oatbran studies partially 
funded by quaker that he said have been under way for more than a 
year but he said quaker also helped fund a syracuse university 
study announced last week that supported findings that a lowfat 
diet supplemented with oat bran can help lower cholesterol in the 
bloodstream 
bottrell said he saw no conflict in quaker which controls about 
70 percent of the oatbran market financing research that 
theoretically could help sales of its products 
were not saying the new studies will be a direct refutation 
of the medical study but we think it will add to information about 
the benefits of oats and oat bran bottrell said 
the harvard study published in the jan 19 issue of the new 
england journal of medicine disputed findings that oat bran can 
help lower cholesterol when eaten daily as part of a lowfat 
lowcholesterol diet 
the syracuse study which will be published in the february 
issue of the journal of the american dietetic association agreed 
with the harvard finding that people who add oat bran to their diet 
tend to cut down on other foods thereby reducing their total fat 
intake 
but the syracuse researchers did not conclude as the harvard 
study did that oat bran alone has no special cholesterolreducing 
properties 
quaker has responded to the harvard study with newspaper ads 
citing 10 other studies conducted over the past 27 years that 
indicated oat bran has special cholesterollowering properties 
bottrell said five of those studies were partially funded by 
quaker with additional funding from health or government agencies 
we are in the oats business and we consider it our business 
anything pertaining to oats bottrell said in a telephone 
interview 
meanwhile an informal national survey of about a dozen grocery 
chains by grocery marketing magazine showed no drop in sales of 
oatbran cereals since the harvard study was published said ryan 
mathews the detroitbased editor of the magazine which is 
published in chicago 
our feeling is that the oatbran products most at risk are the 
peripheral products that have come on the market in the last couple 
of years mathews said in a telephone interview 
peripheral products he said include oatbran snack chips 
pretzels and beer which are among the hundreds of oatbran 
products introduced in the past two years 
mathews story on the survey will be published in the february 
issue of grocery marketing

the governments main economic forecasting 
gauge rose a robust 08 percent in december the commerce 
department said today in a report indicating the nations sluggish 
economy can skirt a recession in 1990 
the jump in the index of leading economic indicators followed a 
tiny 01 percent gain in november and a 03 percent decline in 
october it was the largest increase since a similar 08 percent 
advance last april 
the index composed of 11 forwardlooking statistics designed to 
forecast economic activity six to nine months into the future was 
the latest indication that the economy while weak can avoid an 
actual decline in growth 
the december report showed the index up just 04 percent for the 
year compared with an increase of 39 percent for all of 1988 it 
suggests that economic activity this year could be more sluggish 
than in 1989 
six of the statistics contributed to the december gain led by 
an increase in the backlog of manufacturers unfilled orders 
others showing strength were an increase in plant and equipment 
orders higher stock prices a rise in the money supply an 
increase in building permits and a gain in an index measuring 
consumer confidence 
the biggest drag on the index last month was a drop in the price 
of raw materials while such a decrease is considered good news for 
inflation prospects it is counted as a negative in the index 
because it also can reflect declining demand 
other negatives were an increase in weekly unemployment claims 
a decline in orders for consumer goods and a speedup in business 
delivery times 
the average work week was unchanged 
the various changes left the index at 1457 percent of its 1982 
base of 100 for the year the index posted increases in seven 
months january april july august september november and 
december it declined in february march may june and october 
in advance of the report some analysts had suggested that the 
current sluggishness is akin to flirting with a recession 
i think that were very very close said lawrence 
chimerine senior economic adviser for the wefa group in bala 
cynwyd pa i mean were as close to being in a recession 
without being in one as you can be 
nevertheless chimerine and other economists found themselves 
agreeing with federal reserve chairman alan greenspan who told 
congress on tuesday that while he wouldnt want to bet the 
ranch he thinks the economy will avoid a recession 
growth through much of 1989 was restrained by high interest 
rates resulting from the feds efforts to slow inflation by keeping 
a tight rein on credit some government officials and economists 
have recently urged a looser grip in order to spur growth 
the latest commerce report on the overall 1989 economy the 
gross national product showed growth slowing from 3 percent in the 
third quarter of 1989 to just 05 percent in the octoberdecember 
period 
and many analysts foresee continued sluggish growth in much of 
1990 although some see improvements as the year progresses 
things may be a little better than is widely perceived 
suggested economist michael niemira of the mitsubishi bank in new 
york i think that things are likely to improve from here on 
out 
greenspan said in his testimony to the joint economic committee 
the imbalances and dislocations as we see in the economy today 
probably do not suggest anything more than a temporary hesitation 
in the continuing expansion of the economy 
but chimerine was not quite so sanguine 
well probably see positive growth but just barely he said 
part of greenspans optimism is based on comparing the commerce 
departments current leading indicators with the indicators just 
before and during previous recessions 
the resulting measure suggests that the probability of a 
recession developing in the next six months increased last spring 
to almost 30 percent but according to the most recent estimates 
has declined to about 20 percent he said 
using another index compiled by economists at the national 
bureau of economic research which relies less heavily on data from 
the manufacturing sector and does not include stock prices 
greenspan said there is about a 10 percent chance of a recession 
both probabilities are much smaller than those occurring at 
the beginning of each of the four recessions since the late 
1960s he saidfor example the probability exceeded 50 percent 
shortly before each of the previous recessions using the nber 
index 
nevertheless he continued i wouldnt want to bet the ranch 
on such statistical measures and said the central bank would 
continue to watch developments closely

campbell soup co a continuing subject of 
takeover speculation says it will sell its juice bowl products 
subsidiary and close a foreign plant 
david w johnson campbells president and chief executive 
officer said tuesday the decision came after a review of the 
companys assets 
the sale was announced amid speculation that campbell famous 
for its canned soups might be sold in its entirety partly because 
its stock price has remained relatively low 
several members of the companys founding family which 
controls a substantial portion of campbell stock have said the 
company should be sold 
if campbell is to achieve the level of financial strength that 
its shareholders have a right to expect we must be certain that we 
are structured to obtain maximum returns from all our assets 
johnson said in a statement these two actions are very important 
and positive steps in that direction 
campbell acquired juice bowl in 1982 to produce the companys 
tomatobased juices and expand the companys vegetable juice line 
the camdenbased company said juice bowl based in lakeland fla 
no longer is needed 
johnson said campbell will close its frozen convenience food 
plant at sittingbourne kent england the plant employs 262 people 
and produces frozen sausage rolls production will be moved to 
another campbell plant in salford england johnson said

avon based in new york already has a major foreign presence 
its pacific region business has been growing rapidly in recent 
years and currently accounts for about 450 million of its annual

the value of takeovers involving us companies 
that make computer software or offer other computer services fell 
18 percent in 1989 according to a report wednesday from an 
investment bank that tracks the industry 
despite last years drop to 73 billion from 1988s 
extraordinary 89 billion in mergers last years figure was 49 
percent above the previous record year of 1987 that year the 
value of such deals totaled 49 billion 
the report was compiled by broadview associates of fort lee 
nj a leading investment banker in the computer services 
industry on behalf of adapso the computer services and software 
industry association based in arlington va 
this year 1989 we saw a strong shift from deals over 100 
million to middlemarket transactions in the 20 million to 100 
million range said broadview partner harvey l poppel 
the surge in middlemarket transactions has been fueled by the 
mounting reluctance of underwriters to take mediumsized firms 
public he said since such firms typically need additional 
resources to achieve critical economies of scale and scope 
acquisition has emerged as a preferred route 
another reason for the falloff in the value of deals last year 
is that the recent earnings volatility of many public computer 
software and hardware companies has scared off buyers from outside 
the industry said charles federman another broadview partner 
the report covers companies offering software products computer 
systems integration equipment and professional services processing 
and networkbased data services training and maintenance

the resignation of peter a cohen as head of 
shearson lehman hutton inc the nations secondlargest brokerage 
capped a career that personified wall streets noholdsbarred 
expansion in the 1980s as well as its recent decline 
cohen chairman and chief executive officer of shearson quit 
tuesday amid turmoil at a firm that grew from a mediumsized retail 
brokerage into one of the nations most powerful investment houses 
under his leadership 
shearson today announced a plan to raise about 250 million by 
offering stock to existing shareholders it replaces a public 
offering scrapped because of the firms slumping stock price and 
cohens resignation 
under the plan parent american express co would cut its stake 
in shearson to about 45 percent fulfilling a longtime goal of 
dropping the brokerage from its balance sheet 
after rising 75 cents tuesday shearson stock gained 50 cents to 
1175 this morning in new york stock exchange trading 
cohens departure culminated a shakeup of senior management in 
recent months brought on by the tough times facing the securities 
industry 
late last year thenshearson president jeffrey b lane left the 
firm after he was demoted as part of a series of moves instituted 
by his longtime sidekick cohen 
they put it together basically said lawrence eckenfelder 
an analyst with prudentialbache securities inc in san francisco 
much of the growth and expansion in the 80s was peter and jeff 
but shearson like other major wall stree firms has suffered 
because of a slowdown in business since the october 1987 market 
crash many analysts believe the firm expanded too far too fast and 
now is paying the price 
shearson late last year slashed 800 jobs cut broker 
commissions implemented the senior management shakeup and embarked 
on the recapitalization plan designed to raise about 865 million 
shearson last week reported 1989 profits of 110 million up 
from 96 million a year earlier but a third of the profits came 
from the sale of a money management unit investment banking 
revenue which includes merger advising and securities 
underwriting was down 27 percent 
cohen 43 had been under increasing pressure from american 
express to improve business some analysts speculated cohens 
departure stemmed from american express chairman james d robinson 
iiis desire to rein in the brokerage 
the fall was sudden for a man considered a wonderboy on wall 
street a cigarsmoking strategist described in recent books as a 
tough negotiator driven to transform shearson into a topflight 
firm 
cohen may have foreseen his own demise asked bluntly during a 
presentation to underwriters on the stock offering last week why he 
still had his job cohen reportedly said if robinson wants to 
punch my ticket he can 
in fact cohen was replaced as chief executive by howard l 
clark jr an executive vice president and chief financial officer 
at american express which owns 61 percent of shearson clark also 
was named president 
cohen will be replaced as chairman on march 1 by f warren 
hellman general partner of the new york investment banking 
boutique hellman amp friedman which bought a 75 million block of 
voting preferred stock on jan 15 
analysts have blamed shearsons recent woes on a massive 
expansion spearheaded by cohen during the mid1980s the firm 
expanded into dozens of new businesses and its payroll soared to 
47000 shearson has cut back to about 35700 employees now second 
behind merrill lynch amp co 
they built up too rapidly theyve got a tremendous excess all 
over the place said perrin long who follows the industry for 
lipper analytical services 
cohen joined one of the firms predecessors cwblhayden stone 
inc in 1971 and rose through the corporate ranks of the firm that 
became known as shearson hayden stone inc he was named chief 
executive officer in 1983 and chairman one year later 
cohen led shearsons expansion into investment banking in 1984 
with the acquisition of lehman brothers kuhn loeb he also was 
instrumental in the january 1988 acquisition of defunct brokerage 
ef hutton amp co for 962 million giving shearson a massive 
nationwide network of brokerage outlets 
but along with shearsons meteoric rise there were several 
notable embarrassments 
shearson lost the bidding war for rjr nabisco inc which was 
taken over last year for 25 billion by kohlberg kravis roberts amp 
co losing out on 200 million in fees in the process 
also shearsons reputation was sullied last year when a 
subsidiary boston co overstated its income when the firm had to 
write off about 100 million in bad investments in troubled texas 
bank mcorp and when it backed a hostile bid for pittsburghbased 
koppers co 
american express acquired shearson in 1981 for 360 million 
under the new stock offer shearson plans to sell 21 million 
shares of common stock for 12 a share directly to current 
shareholders american express would buy about 69 percent of the 
new stock and any shares not purchased 
american express would reduce its stake in shearson by offering 
shearson shares as a dividend to american express stockholders or a 
dividend in the form of 100 percent of a spinoff corporation 
formed with the shearson shares 
the old plan envisioned the sale of 20 million shares to the 
public

factors including continued rainy weather in the south american

saab automobile ab a joint venture 
with general motors corp launched this month will turn the corner 
into profitability next year and produce a new upscale passenger 
car within five years the companys president predicted wednesday 
saab formerly a moneylosing division of the aerospace and 
automotive group saabscania ab is plagued by a 13 percent 
absentee rate and a 20 percent turnover of employees which is 
more than any place ive ever seen said david herman 
thats one of our top priorities to reduce both those 
numbers it costs a lot said herman who worked for gm for 17 
years 
the new company began operations jan 1 after gm bought in on a 
5050 basis for 600 million gm and saabscania each contributed 
100 million to an operating fund 
saab reported losing 200 million in the first nine months of 
last year 
by the end of 1991 i hope we will turn the corner into the 
black but it depends on a lot of things this is a living 
business herman told a news conference 
he said the gm guaranteed the independence and profile of saab 
will remain intact and it will continue to be marketed separately 
some components will be produced jointly he said 
a new car for the luxury market has gone onto the drawing boards 
to compete with the popular west german bmw and the mercedes 300 
series herman said 
saab sold 110000 cars last year 31000 of them in the united 
states herman said the swedishmade car is still in its infancy in 
europe which will be a major target for the new company

a group of investors withdrew a 900 million bid 
for stride rite corp after officials of the shoe company turned 
down the offer 
but a spokesman for the investors refused today to rule out 
another bid for stride rite 
the investors led by walsh greenwood amp co of greenwich 
conn said they were disappointed stride rite would not consider 
the 32pershare offer 
we believe that in todays marketplace a negotiated 
transaction would have been the best way to realize the highest 
value for the companys shareholders walsh greenwood said in a 
letter to stride rite 
your response leaves us no alternative but to withdraw our 32 
per share proposal and consider all available options consistent 
with our objectives the letter said 
stephen walsh a managing partner for the firm declined to 
elaborate on the letter and he refused to say whether his 
associates might make another proposal 
we are meeting to discuss all options he said 
stride rite said its board had rejected the offer arnold hiatt 
chairman of the company said in a statement the directors 
determined a successful independent stride rite is in the best 
longterm interests of stride rites shareholders employees 
customers and the communities we serve 
stride rite the leading childrens shoemaker and retailer in 
the country received the buyout offer in december 
the company makes and sells shoe brands such as keds and sperry 
topsider and has more than 180 stores and more than 60 shoe 
sections in department stores 
we think within those brands there is a lot of opportunity 
for growth said john phelan chief financial officer for the 
company 
in particular stride rite noted an increase last year in keds 
sales which were 43 percent higher than they were in 1988 
phelan said the company may have trouble matching that growth in 
the future but he said stride rite has been able to boost keds 
sales by catering more to women and the company also views the 
largely untapped mens market as another potential opportunity

the author of the biggest us restrictions to 
trade with the soviet union and eastern europe said today that 
those restrictions should be waived immediately but not repealed 
the principles of jacksonvanik should be solidly retained 
as a backup insurance that we will not abandon world leadership on 
the issue of human rights former rep charles a vanik dohio 
told the house ways and means committee 
vanik however disagreed with the bush administrations 
insistence that moscow make law its recently adopted free 
emigration policies before the united states lifts the high tariffs 
imposed on soviet imports 
president bush promised soviet president mikhail s gorbachev at 
the malta summit in december that if the emigration policies are 
made law bush would seek a oneyear waiver of the jacksonvanik 
restrictions as part of a new ussoviet trade agreement the two 
leaders hope to sign in june 
i judge the soviet union by the deed more than the statute 
vanik said of recent soviet emigration policies the process 
appears to be a wellestablished nonreversible course 
he said us slowness in normalizing trade relations with moscow 
and the newly reincarnated governments of eastern europe risks 
losing those fledgling free markets to other western powers such as 
japan west germany and italy 
house democrats expressed frustration that the administration 
has not moved faster to lower the barriers to expanded trade with 
countries behind the crumbling iron curtain a region one 
businessman described as the biggest new market since the opening 
of the americas in the 18th and 19th centuries 
were worried we dont see any actual planning for this 
said rep sam gibbons dfla we dont spot the administration 
doing a lot 
business people have favored outright repeal of jacksonvanik 
saying they are unwilling to make the type of investments bush has 
called for to rebuild the economies of the soviet union and eastern 
europe without better assurance that policies will not be changed 
suddenly 
if you think were going to make investments on the basis of 
an 18month waiver were not said john murphy chairman of 
dresser industries in dallas 
vanik however predicted that repeal of the 1974 law that he 
cowrote with the late sen henry jackson dwash would have a 
tough time in congress because of 45 years of cold war 
conditioning to distrust the soviet union 
its a matter of political reality he said i think the 
rest of america is not yet prepared to consider anything more for 
the soviet union than a waiver 
the law was enacted largely to stop the last proposed 
ussoviet trade agreement initiated by former president nixon in 
1972 and to pressure moscow to remove restrictions that prevented 
soviet jews from emigrating to noncommunist countries 
basically it prohibits all export credits or credit guarantees 
to soviet bloc countries that restrict emigration the law also 
subjects soviet bloc exports to the united states to stiffer 
tariffs than those applied to other countries 
soviet emigration has climbed from just under 2000 in 1986 to 
approximately 195000 in 1989 american officials acknowledge the 
biggest barrier now is limits the united states and other countries 
are putting on the number of soviet immigrants they will accept 
the reasons for jacksonvanik no longer exist but people find 
a reason to keep it alive said rep thomas j downey dny 
meanwhile senate democrats on tuesday proposed a new 
halfbillion dollar aid package 200 million more than bush wants 
to foster emerging democracies in eastern europe 
the bill introduced by sen claiborne pell rri chairman of 
the senate foreign relations committee would augment 738 million 
in aid already approved for poland and hungary with 511 million 
targeted for czechoslovakia east germany romania bulgaria and 
yugoslavia 
pell said he would not be surprised if his proposal is increased 
during the legislative process in view of the profound interest 
of the united states in supporting positive developments in eastern 
europe 
bush as part of the fiscal 1991 budget he proposed monday 
asked for 300 million as a special assistance initiative for 
soviet bloc nations including poland and hungary

illegal trading was widespread on the floor of 
the chicago mercantile exchange during the more than a year that 
undercover fbi agents spent posing as commodity traders there one 
of the agents testified 
agent dietrich volk testifying tuesday at a pretrial hearing 
involving three indicted traders said illegal trading was 
systemic and pervasive at the merc 
officials at the merc and the chicago board of trade the 
worlds two largest futures exchanges have repeatedly said abuses 
are not widespread on their trading floors 
they have characterized the 48 traders and a clerk indicted 
since august on charges of defrauding customers as a few bad apples 
compared with hundreds of honest traders 
volks testimony in the us district court hearing marks the 
first time that any of the fbi agents who posed as traders at the 
merc and the board of trade has commented publicly about the sting 
operation 
the threeday hearing which is scheduled to end today was 
being held regarding motions filed on behalf of three yenfutures 
traders at the merc sam cali john baker and borbert bailin 
the three are seeking to suppress statements they made last 
january to government agents implicating themselves and others in 
illegal trading activities 
they contend the government illegally coerced the statements 
from them in some cases at their homes before they had a chance 
to talk with their lawyers

sci television inc must certify to a federal 
bankruptcy judge today that it has lined up the required support 
for a debt restructuring plan or face reorganization under court 
supervision 
judge helen s balick signed an order tuesday giving sci until 
430 pm est today to certify that it has been tendered at least 
875 percent of its 16 percent senior subordinated debentures 
under an exchange offer 
as part of its latest plan to restructure its 13 billion debt 
the company said a minimum of 875 percent of that 100 million 
bond issue must be tendered 
as of 1130 am est today sci said 778 percent of the 
debentures had been tendered it extended the exchange offer until 
430 pm est 
if sci cant meet wednesdays certification deadline the judge 
said the company would be placed under protection of chapter 11 of 
the federal bankruptcy laws while it reorganizes 
the judges ruling appeared to have the support of the company 
representatives of a majority of its bondholders and attorneys for 
three bondholders who had filed a petition in november to force sci 
into chapter 7 bankruptcy proceedings which may have resulted in 
liquidation of the company 
i dont know of any holder who favors chapter 11 rather than 
the deal said wilbur ross of rothschild inc which is a 
financial adviser to a bondholders group 
he said he was on the phone to as many bondholders as he could 
reach on tuesday encouraging them to tender their bonds and 
advising them that there is no reason to expect any lastminute 
changes to sweeten the offer 
my concern is that there may be people out there who have the 
incorrect impression that something wonderful is still capable of 
happening ross said sci has had trouble generating enough cash 
to pay the interest on its debt to bondholders and bank lenders 
following two debtfinanced transactions in the past five years 
it owns six television stations that were once part of storer 
communications acquired by the buyout specialists kohlberg kravis 
roberts amp co in a leveraged buyout in 1985 
sci television was created in 1987 when the storer television 
stations were sold for 13 billion to a company in which nashville 
entrepreneur george gillett owns 55 percent and kohlberg kravis 
owns 45 percent 
the company has been negotiating a debt restructuring with its 
bondholders and bank lenders since last fall it recently won 
agreement from representatives of a majority of bondholders for a 
plan that would give the bondholders a 39 percent equity interest 
in sci and new debt securities 
under the plan bank lenders would get a 5 percent equity stake 
while gilletts stake would fall to 41 percent and kohlbergs stake 
to 15 percent 
under the plan a certain minimum percentage of each of scis 
three issues of publiclyheld bonds have to be tendered sci has 
met the required minimum on two issues but is still short on the 
16 percent issue 
it has become a huge game of chicken said one person 
familiar with the efforts to get bondholders to tender their bonds 
who spoke on condition of anonymity 
bondholders are jockeying for position so that only the bare 
minimum of 16 percent bonds are tendered leaving holders of the 
remaining 125 percent of the issue eligible for cash interest 
payments 
but the risk under bankruptcy protection he said is that 
holders of all of the 16 percent bonds would be given stock and 
additional securities in lieu of cash interest payments

travelers know american airlines as one 
of the nations most familiar carriers few know its parent company 
also is engrossed in a telephone marketing operation that does 
everything from taking hotel reservations to answering questions 
about foreclosed sampl property for sale 
amr information services inc formed four years ago by amr 
corp is seen by the parent company as a way to tap the 
experience investment and success of its computer reservations 
system sabre the largest in the airline industry 
the subsidiarys president russell j harrison also said its 
aimed partly at cushioning the ups downs and uncertainties of 
running an airline 
an awful lot of what affects the airline industry is out of 
control of the airline business harrison said for example he 
said the sharp rise in fuel costs this winter turned a record year 
for amr into disappointment 
with their powerful computer and telecommunications and 
reservations resources its a natural opportunity or extension to 
do some incremental business said mark daugherty who follows 
amr for the dean witter reynolds inc investment firm 
the subsidiary does not yet provide much of a cushion although 
harrison said it has been profitable since 1987 and has grown about 
50 percent a year 
the idea for it was spawned from an effort to make use of the 
time when reservations agents werent selling airplane tickets 
what started as a timefiller now has its own computer system 
separate from sabre and last year brought in 100 million in 
revenues it is projected to reach 130 million this year 
amr by comparison had overall operating revenues last year of 
1048 billion 
harrison said he wanted to recreate the same type of 
freewheeling business that helped enrich one of his former 
employers electronic data systems inc billionaire h ross perot 
its ok to have fun harrison said its ok to laugh and 
celebrate 
harrison said employees are encouraged to ask what do you 
think we could do if we didnt know we couldnt 
the subsidiarys only corporate directive comes from amr 
chairman robert l crandall who has said go build me a 
business harrison said im just kind of manufacturing 
businesses 
it is comprised of eight divisions and accounts for about 4000 
of amrs 77000 employees while some of the businesses are tied to 
the airline industry such as meeting planning and travel agent 
training others are not 
the linkage between all these businesses is that they tend to 
be transactions over long distances harrison said during an 
interview at his office near the parents fort worth headquarters 
the largest division is american airlines direct marketing 
corp which answers the telephone and makes sales calls for a 
range of customers 
most of those customers are confidential harrison said because 
they want you to think youre talking to one of their 
employees when you call for hotel reservations and such in 
reality the phones are answered by 880 people in a building at 
amrs centreport office complex south of dallasfort worth 
international airport 
however the division recently landed a highprofile contract 
taking calls for the resolution trust corp the federal agency 
created to bail out the thrift industry people who called a 
tollfree number to order the list of foreclosed properties offered 
for sale got an amr telemarketing agent 
the subsidiary isnt shy about saying what kind of calls it 
doesnt take those generated by television ads we do not sell 
ginzu knives or zamfir records harrison said 
another significant component of the subsidiary is caribbean 
data services located in barbados and santo domingo where 
employees turn written information into computer data 
about half the work involves culling information from american 
airlines tickets the rest is from other companies such as 
insurance concern equicorp which uses the company to type in 
health claims information 
the paperwork is flown to the caribbean on american airlines 
jets the information typed in and then either fed directly to a 
computer or put on computer disks and sent back to the customer 
other divisions sell sabre to other airlines provide automated 
freight tracking systems operate a hotel reservations system 
similar to sabre or provide computer services for other airlines 
another division what harrison calls his rampd shop 
provides nonairline computer services and information management 
harrison realizes his subsidiary would be a likely candidate for 
the auction block should amr be acquired the parent company was a 
target last year of billionaire developer donald trump whose 75 
billion proposal collapsed in the aftermath of a stock market 
plunge in october 
i love being a part of amr harrison said but i could run 
the company outside 
we have built the platform for our business on firm solid 
ground and if we are cut lose we can continue to grow

white house budget director richard g darman 
said today the bush administration is ready to begin serious 
negotiations with congress on developing a bipartisan plan for 
reducing the deficit 
wed be pleased to start at 10 oclock tonight after the 
presidents speech darman told the senate budget committee 
referring to the state of the union address 
sen bennett johnston dla reminded darman that at this time 
a year ago the administration was encouraging such negotiations 
not just expressing a willingness to participate 
if there has been a change of heart darman replied it is 
because a couple of very important people have said they dont 
want to negotiate he did not identify them but apparently was 
referring to some congressional leaders 
darman director of the office of management and budget 
expressed frustration that after many hours of criticism from 
opponents of the administrations budget policies i have yet to 
see a detailed plan from those critics 
for the second straight day the administrations 1991 budget 
was hammered by democratic lawmakers as unrealistic too heavy on 
military spending and dependent on overly optimistic economic 
projections darman defended the budget and projections as did 
several republican members of the senate budget committee 
this is the most realistic budget that has been submitted by a 
president in five years said sen phil gramm rtexas 
you are not dealing with people who are totally out of 
bounds in trying to forecast how the economy will behave in the 
coming months darman said tuesday 
testifying before the house budget committee darman rejected 
criticism from rep leon panetta dcalif chairman of the panel 
that the new budget relies on rosy assumptions about unemployment 
inflation and economic growth 
darman said the administration compiled an amazingly accurate 
record in making its forecasts last july this represents not 
just wisdom but some luck he added 
darman noted for example the july forecast for growth in the 
gross national product last year was 29 percent exactly what 
occurred omb economists also were right on the mark on 
unemployment 52 percent and interest rates on shortterm 
treasury notes 85 percent and came close in predicting inflation 
would average 5 percent the actual figure was 48 percent 
economic forecasts are a major factor in preparation of a 
federal budget for example if the inflation rate is higher than 
forecast the deficit could be worsened considerably because many 
federal programs including social security are increased 
automatically with the inflation rate 
the 1991 budget of 123 trillion is based on an omb forecast 
that the economy will grow by 32 percent during the year although 
the consensus of several private economists is 22 percent 
similarly the administration projects interest rates on 
threemonth treasury bills at 54 percent in 1991 compared with a 
72 percent private forecast 
darman spent a considerable part of his time before the house 
panel defending the administrations decision not to support a 
reduction in social security taxes the hottest topic among members 
of congress is a bill by sen daniel patrick moynihan dny that 
would cut those taxes as a way to keep the government from using 
surplus social security tax collections to pay for other federal 
programs 
it is my personal opinion that he never intended the plan to 
be taken as seriously as the press has taken it darman said 
panetta interjected i get the impression that he is quite 
serious about the proposal 
bushs budget proposes that once the federal deficit is 
eliminated and predicts that will be in 1993 social security 
taxes that are not needed to pay benefits immediately should be 
used only to retire government debt 
darman bristled when rep james slattery dkan said social 
security is the biggest lie we have told the american people in 
maybe this generation slattery described bushs proposed remedy 
as another scam another scam 
youre saying that federal debt is no good that we are 
bankrupt the day that us treasuries securities are no 
good is a day i think none of us will ever see darman said 
our proposal is not smoke and mirrors he added it will 
really get the debt down there isnt a trace of dishonesty in 
this presentation 
several democrats on the house committee criticized the 
administrations call for 292 billion for the military at a time 
of declining eastwest tensions others lamented proposed cuts in 
various social programs 
the budget said rep james oberstar dminn reflects a view 
of america that is not shared by a lot of people in my district 
the new budget anticipates a 631 billion deficit in the 12 
months that begin oct 1 although congressional economists say the 
figure is likely to approach 100 billion the budget would rely on 
spending reductions user fees and selected tax increases but no 
general boost in income taxes to cut the deficit from the 1990 
level of about 124 billion

a rumor that soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev was resigning as 
communist party chief sent the dollar soaring tuesday in new york

dollars rise 
traders said the belief that many dealers had overreacted to the 
rumors and comments by us federal reserve chairman alan greenspan 
that inflation is still a concern in the us would force the 
dollar lower 
even though most people would probably agree the dollar is 
currently undervalued the dominant impression is that the dollar 
is on its way down a milan analyst said every time it perks 
up people take profits and bring it back down

value for the companys shareholders the letter said

per share proposal and consider all available options consistent 
with our objectives it said

changes in securities laws are being considered 
that would protect japanese companies from sneak attacks from 
corporate raiders but at the same time relax some restrictions on 
foreign investment finance ministry officials said wednesday 
the proposed legislation to be submitted to parliament when it 
reconvenes in march would go into effect by the years end they 
said 
a new 5 percent rule would require anyone whose holdings 
exceed 5 percent of a companys shares to report to the finance 
ministry stock exchanges and the company the officials said 
the new rule would make stock transactions more visible and 
prevent hostile raiders from collecting shares secretly said 
ministry spokesman tetsuo kabe 
last year american investor t boone pickens became the largest 
single shareholder in koito manufacturing co an auto parts maker 
when he obtained more than 20 percent of its shares mostly from a 
japanese stock speculator 
pickens has been trying unsuccessfully to gain representation on 
koitos board of directors 
experts said that the new legislation would make it more 
difficult for speculators to amass big holdings from a third party 
but the legislation also would ease restrictions on the tender 
offer bid a public announcement of intent to acquire at a fixed 
price any or all of a companys securities foreign investors have 
said the current rules are too strict and curb their investment in 
japan 
the ministry says there have been only three such bids in 19 
years 
such bids no longer would require 10 days advance notice to the 
ministry and investors would be allowed 60 days for bidding 
instead of the current 30 officials said 
japanese law now requires nonresidents to have agents in japan 
for such bids the new legislation would allow lawyers accountants 
and others in addition to banks and securities firms to represent 
nonresident investors 
we realized we have to eliminate restrictions such as advance 
notice because among the western countries only japan is imposing 
such requirements said another ministry official speaking on 
condition of anonymity we expect the revised law will encourage 
foreign investment in japan 
kabe said the 5 percent rules main purpose is to prevent wild 
fluctuations in share prices 
when an investor buys a large number of one companys shares it 
often causes wild price moves 
those who fail to report under the new legislation would be 
punished with fines or prison terms although details remain to be 
worked out kabe added 
at present the only reporting requirement is that companies 
issuing shares must notify the ministry of major changes in 
shareholders holding more than 10 percent of their shares he said 
critics said the revised law may not have much impact on the 
market because most stocks are permanently held by business 
partners and financial institutions including major securities and 
life insurance companies and banks 
financial institutions would be exempted from having to 
immediately notify the ministry as long as they did not intend to 
gain management rights by increasing their holdings to more than 5 
percent of a companys shares the ministry said

in another sign of hard times on wall street 
already troubled shearson lehman hutton inc is extending staff 
cuts into the ranks of highly paid investment bankers sources said 
unlike recent layoffs at merrill lynch amp co the job reductions 
at the nations no 2 brokerage are being done gradually they were 
planned and some executed before the resignation tuesday of peter 
a cohen as chairman and chief executive 
one shearson investment banker who asked not to be named said 50 
to 100 professionals or 10 percent to 20 percent of the force 
could be gone by may a shearson official who requested anonymity 
called the figure way out of line but said some reductions had 
occurred as part of ongoing business 
wall street analysts said layoffs at shearson are not surprising 
given the firms ongoing problems and a general slump in mergers 
and acquisitions and securities underwriting on wall street 
to cut 10 to 20 percent would be consistent with what other 
firms have done so that would not surprise me said lawrence 
eckenfelder a securities industry analyst with prudential bache 
securities inc in san francisco theres not enough banking 
business 
investment bankers generally are regarded as a cut above 
stockbrokers and other lowerechelon wall street employees bankers 
are among the most highly paid professionals in the industry with 
six and sevenfigure salaries and bonuses 
according to securities data co the dollar volume of mergers 
and acquitisions completed in the fourth quarter of 1989 declined 
366 percent from the same 1988 period much of the decline is 
attributed to the collapse of the market for junk bonds often used 
to finance such deals 
new issues of corporate equity were down 99 percent for the 
full year and more than 28 percent since its peak in 1986 
securities data said debt issues also have slumped 
merrill lynch earlier this month let go about 140 people in its 
investment banking division or about 10 percent including 70 
professionals spokesman fred yager said most of the layoffs were 
effective immediately 
merrill the nations largest brokerage plans about 3000 total 
layoffs this year including 2000 by the end of march 
in recent months other firms also have scaled back investment 
banking as part of an overhaul dating to the 1987 stock market 
crash that has reduced securities industry employment by about 
35000 jobs 
salomon brothers inc recently announced 100 acrosstheboard 
cuts with about 20 in investment banking drexel burnham lambert 
inc slashed 300 employees including 15 bankers and 
prudentialbache securities inc cut about 20 investment bankers 
shearson last week reported that its investment banking revenue 
for 1989 sank 27 percent to 963 million and blamed a slowdown in 
dealmaking and securities underwriting 
a lot of firms basically bloated these departments in the 
expectation that volume was going to increase eckenfelder said 
its a situation where you may have to cut more people 
percentagewise than your business is dropping 
at shearson investment bankers are being given time to find 
other jobs and allowed to remain in their offices as they are 
dropped from the payroll one source said 
there hasnt been the kind of cutting into core that merrill 
had the shearson banker said tuesday before cohens resignation 
were talking about treetrimming that probably should have been 
done anyway 
shearson entered the investment banking field in 1984 with the 
acquisition of lehman brothers kuhn loeb part of an expansion plan 
spearheaded by the departing cohen 
it is unclear how the changing of the guard at shearson will 
affect the investment banking division some analysts are 
predicting further more drastic cutbacks across the board at the 
firm which slashed 800 jobs in december lowering its payroll to 
35700

featured little significant news to move the markets 
soybean futures advanced slightly following mikhail gorbachevs 
denial of a report that he might resign as the soviet unions

the nyse and it rose to 27075 a share up 225 from its close 
tuesday on the amex 
the company which owns the washington post newspaper and

the rockefellers have sold control of the 
manhattan landmark bearing their name to a japanese firm and 
several grandchildren of campbell soup cos founder want that 
company auctioned to strangers 
you might ask how they can they sell the family businesses 
especially those with famous names as time goes on it becomes 
easy 
emotional ties to a familyowned firm hatched from scratch and 
sweat by entrepreneurial ancestors can weaken with each passing 
generation until the companys asset value outweighs its 
sentimental value and the corporation becomes an albatross to its 
owners 
for 846 million the rockefellers turned over a controlling 
interest in rockefeller group inc to mitsubishi estate co in 
relinquishing control the rockefellers parted with new yorks 
rockefeller center the most visible and tangible symbol of their 
family fortune and also surrendered exclusive rights to the 
rockefeller name 
meanwhile three grandchildren of campbell founder john t 
dorrance sr have split with other relatives and want the company 
sold the dissident dorrances while their names arent emblazoned 
on soup cans also are willing to sever their connection with a 
brand name familiar to millions worldwide 
in some ways the rockefellers and dorrances are like many other 
heirs of successful business entrpreneurs having grown away from 
the family company they want to take their inheritance and move on 
david rockefeller jr is the greatgreat grandson of john d 
rockefeller and the greatgrandson of john d jr the founder of 
rockefeller center he said recently that his generation has its 
own priorities 
i dont know how far the family as individuals would have 
wanted to go if they had been asked to pump capital funds into 
keeping up these buildings compared to supporting charitable 
causes or pursuing their own careers rockefeller said in an 
interview in the magazine manhattan inc 
frankly im not so sure that if it came down to that that 
they would have said the way we want to spend our money is to 
buff up the marble down at the center rockefeller was quoted as 
saying he refused to be interviewed for this story 
its nothing new for the descendants of a company founder to 
sell off the family business and its wellknown name the fields 
of chicago did it twice 
marshall field iii grandson of retailer marshall field sold 
the familys famous department store in 1941 and turned instead 
toward journalism building the field enterprises inc media empire 
but more than 40 years later in 1983 marshall iiis own 
grandsons marshall field v and frederick field dissolved the 
second family company after a dispute and went separate ways 
marshall field vs current holdings include field corp which 
owns funk amp wagnalls inc and other publishers frederick field is 
among the investors in the group that bid recently for bat 
industries plc the british conglomerate with properties that 
ironically include marshall field 
on the other hand the philadelphiabased department store 
company strawbridge amp clothier founded in 1868 is still 
controlled by the strawbridge and clothier clans just about all 
other big department stores across the country have long since been 
sold off by their founding families 
strawbridge amp clothier also has dealt with dissident relatives 
who wanted out in 1984 a group of strawbridges decided to sell 
their 17 percent stake the company facing a takeover bought the 
shares to retain family control 
even in some of the biggest corporations founding family 
descendants are active nearly 190 years after dupont co was 
created members of the dupont family still have ties to the 
chemical company several are board members 
in 1988 two greatgrandsons of ford motor co founder henry 
ford became the first of their generation elected to the board of 
the automaker still 40 percent owned by the ford family both men 
are also ford executives 
some families have reasserted total control over their 
businesses southland corps founding thompson family for 
example took the company private in a 1987 takeover borrowing 
money to repurchase the stock 
other families who preside over publicly held corporations want 
to be sure they maintain control over their companies so theyve 
issued different classes of stock with voting rights that puts most 
power in family hands 
such an arrangement helped the bryan family that owns media 
general inc defeat a takeover bid by investor burt sugarman in 
1988 the family held about 71 percent of the companys class b 
shares which controlled six of the nine seats on the media general 
board allowing the family to easily defeat sugarmans attempt to 
win the other seats 
but sometimes when a company is losing money a family must 
choose the bottom line over emotional ties in 1982 ew scripps 
co decided to sell united press international which had been 
losing money for years 
upi was a project of company founder ew scripps who believed 
in 1907 that american newspapers needed competing wire services 
scripps co executives and members of the scripps family decided 75 
years later the subsidiarys losses were too much to carry any 
longer 
ted scripps an ew scripps grandson who shared his ancestors 
belief in competition among the wires lobbied against a sale and 
sought a way for scripps co to keep upi but relatives told ted 
scripps the family couldnt afford it 
there are times when a company can become the pawn in a family 
feud that was the case in the field family and in the notorious 
1980s fight among members of kentuckys bingham family owners of a 
media empire 
it began when sallie bingham challenged her brother as head of 
the family business and then found herself off the board of 
directors after two years of bickering including a threat by ms 
bingham to sell her 15 percent stake her father patriarch barry 
bingham sr put an end to the fight and the family ties to the 
business selling its two newspapers television station and 
printing company 
bingham who died in 1988 was forced to break his bonds with 
newspapers his father bought in 1918 
it is not easy for me to see the courierjournal and 
louisville times pass from my family into other hands he said in 
announcing the sale in may 1986 
but he added change is an inevitable rule of life

a widely watched gauge of consumer confidence 
sank in january for the third straight month dropping to the 
lowest point since after the october 1987 stock market crash 
according to a survey released wednesday 
the conference board said its consumer confidence index tumbled 
to 1051 in january from 113 in december and 1158 in january a 
year earlier 
fabian linden executive director of the new yorkbased business 
research groups consumer research center said the size of the 
decline must be regarded as a possible though not unmistakable 
indication of economic troubles ahead 
he noted however that in the context of the surveys 
history the present level of consumer confidence does not yet 
signal a likely recession in the coming months 
the january reading was the lowest since the index registered 
1008 in november 1987 the month after world financial markets 
suffered major setbacks on oct 19 1987 the dow jones industrial 
average of 30 bluechip stocks plummeted 508 points to 173874 a 
loss of 226 percent of its value 
a monthly survey of 5000 households throughout the country 
indicated that people are less comfortable with their situations 
and less optimistic about the next six months than they were when 
polled in december the conference board said 
the latest poll showed 185 percent of all those responding 
expressed the view that business conditions were bad a slightly 
larger percentage than in december 
only about one in four respondents believed that jobs were 
plentiful a figure that has been going steadily lower in 
recent months on the employment outlook pessimists outnumbered 
optimists for the first time since late 1987 
expectations about economic conditions in the next halfyear 
have deteriorated the board said only 162 percent of the 
respondents thought that business would improve down about 2 
percentage points from december 
buying plans didnt show much change in the january survey the 
percentage of people planning to buy a car fell slightly to 69 
percent there still was strong interest in purchasing major 
appliances while the number of people planning to buy homes barely 
budged from its low level of 34 percent 
the survey is conducted for the board each month by national 
family opinion of toledo ohio

coveted the georgia gulf corp for months on wedneday announced a 
cash offer to its stockholders that values the atlantabased 
chemical company at 11 billion

which includes nls own 9 percent stake

georgia gulf has been seeking ways to avoid simmons a wealthy 
investor known for his takeover forays for awhile the company 
beckoned other potential buyers in attempt to raise its stock price 
and discourage him 
in november it abanded those efforts and said it would attempt a 
debtfinanced recapitalization that would give shareholders cash 
and new stock the company valued that deal as worth about 55 a 
share 
but nl said in its statement wednesday that it decided to pursue 
the acquisition of georgia gulf because of the belief that under 
current market conditions georgia gulfs recapitalization plan 
will not provide its shareholders with values as great as 45 per 
share 
nl said it would seek the support of georgia gulfs board of 
directors and would encourage georgia gulf management to 
participate in the acquisition transaction 
analysts have said the large stock holdings of georgia gulfs 
management could make takeover of the company difficult without 
managements cooperation

kimberlyclark corp one the nations largest 
diaper makers said wednesday it has begun a letter campaign urging 
parents in wisconsin to fight a proposed environmental tax on 
disposable diapers 
jean allen director of corporate communications at 
kimberlyclarks headquarters in irving texas said the company 
last week sent out 100000 letters to parents of young children in 
wisconsin 
the letters urge opposition to a bill pending in the wisconsin 
legislature that calls for a 1centperdiaper tax to raise money 
for recycling efforts in the state 
kimberlyclark favors wisconsin efforts to recycle ms 
allen said but to be fair we think such a tax should be levied 
on all product that go in landfills we believe it should be a 
more broadbased equitable tax 
ms allen said other states also are reviewing recycling 
legislation that could affect diapers but this is the first time 
her company which commands about a 30 percent share of the 
nations disposable diaper market has campaigned to oppose such a 
bill 
we are very concerned that people understand the ramification 
of this part of the bill once informed its then their decision on 
what action they should take she said 
but rep spencer black dmadison the assembly sponsor of the 
recycling bill said he believed kimberlyclark does not support 
any tax to help recycling despite its statement 
this is typical of the special interest effort to kill the 
recycling bill black said every special interest says were 
for recycling but then theyre against the portion of the bill 
that affects their profits 
the wisconsin diaper tax is included in an amendment to a 
recycling bill pending before the legislatures joint finance 
committee the amendment was considered a compromise on an earlier 
proposal to ban disposable diapers entirely from wisconsin 
landfills 
supporters say the tax is justified because disposable diapers 
are not considered biodegradable and do not decay easily when 
buried in landfills a legislative study estimated the tax would 
cost a family with a young child 80 to 100 a year in additional 
costs

gold futures prices tumbled wednesday amid reports that the 
united states has asked the international monetary fund to consider 
using its gold holdings to wipe out pastdue loans to some of its 
member countries 
traders feared that such a plan could lead to sales of several 
million ounces of gold on the open market 
on other commodity markets oil futures were mixed livestock 
and meat futures were lower and grains and soybeans were mixed 
gold futures settled 570 to 640 lower on new yorks 
commodity exchange with the contract for delivery in february off 
570 at 41240 a troy ounce 
silver futures followed gold ending 11 cents to 17 cents 
lower with march at 5228 a troy ounce 
the first report about the imf said the united states had 
proposed the 152nation lending agency sell 4 billion worth of 
gold to obtain cash needed to offset about 4 billion in delinquent 
loans to 15 of its poorer members 
that report prompted heavy selling of gold futures analysts 
said 
a treasury department source told the associated press that the 
actual proposal was that the imf consider mobilizing a portion 
of the imf gold holdings contributed by the delinquent members 
amounting to less than 3 percent or about 123 billion of the 
103 million ounces held by the imf 
the source who requested anonymity would not elaborate on what 
mobilizing meant 
market analysts said the united states probably was proposing to 
use gold as collateral to obtain loans from central banks to cover 
the pastdue loans 
still said metals economist fred demler of drexel burnham 
lambert inc even if you use it as collateral a default could 
end up being a gold sale 
analysts said the gold markets weakness also reflected 
wednesdays strong rally in the stock market and the prospects for 
steady rather than lower interest rates 
petroleum futures finished mixed on the new york mercantile 
exchange in quiet trading 
peter beutel assistant director of the energy group at elders 
futures inc said traders sold heating oil and gasoline contracts 
following a report late tuesday by the american petroleum institute 
that showed higherthanexpected inventories of those products last 
week 
west texas intermediate crude oil settled 11 cents to 22 cents 
higher with march at 2268 a barrel heating oil was 13 cent to 
164 cents lower with february at 5887 cents a gallon unleaded 
gasoline was 102 cents lower to 40 cent higher with february at 
6171 cents a gallon 
livestock and meat futures retreated on the chicago mercantile 
exchange with much of the selling linked to weaker spot markets and 
to positioning by cattle traders ahead of fridays semiannual 
agriculture department cattle inventory report 
the report is expected to show a continued modest growth in the 
nations cattle herd 
live cattle futures settled 30 cent to 105 cents lower with 
the contract for delivery in february at 7935 cents a pound 
feeder cattle were 20 cent to 75 cent lower with march at 8252 
cents a pound live hogs were 10 cent to 72 cent lower with 
february at 4870 cents a pound frozen pork bellies were 12 cent 
to 45 cent lower with february at 5045 cents a pound 
grain and soybean futures ended mixed on the chicago board of 
trade with soybeans up corn down and wheat nearly unchanged

a bushel corn futures were cent to 1 cents lower with march at

continue pursuing his own bid 
plans call for marshalls group to to buy about 125 percent of

mitsubishi bank ltd and the mitsubishi trust and banking corp 
aristech said it will maintain operations in their present form 
and locations and keep its headquarters in pittsburgh under the 
arrangement 
no other details of the transaction were released 
our management will be freed from the pressures of 
quartertoquarter performance and will be able to concentrate more 
fully on longterm planning expansion and growth marshall said 
aristech makes and markets polymers and related products and 
industrial chemicals it employes 1850 people in arkansas 
california florida kentucky ohio pennsylvania texas and west

xerox corp on wednesday reported 
fourthquarter earnings of 212 million rebounding from the same 
period in 1988 when it reported a 77 million loss due to a 
restructuring program 
the profit in the most recent quarter amounted to 193 per 
share compared with a loss of 80 cents a share a year earlier 
revenue for the fourth quarter totaled 47 billion up 6 
percent from 44 billion in the yearearlier quarter 
david t kearns xeroxs chairman and chief executive officer 
credited the growth in earnings to successful new products cost 
control measures and benefits from the restructuring program which 
involved a reduction in manufacturing capacity and the elimination 
of certain business lines 
assuming a reasonable economic environment we expect 
fullyear benefits of our restructuring program and continued 
customer acceptance of our new products to deliver good growth and 
improved returns in document processing kearns said 
overall corporate results however may be somewhat dampened 
by the effects of a continuation of the current industrywide 
pricing weakness in property and casualty insurance he said 
the companys insurance and financial services division reported 
a slight drop in earnings from 48 million in the fourth quarter 
of 1988 to 43 million in 1989 and from 240 million for all of 
1988 to 216 million for 1989 
the company blamed the earnings drop on soft markets for 
property and casualty insurance

per share on revenue of 176 billion in 1988 the company 
reported earnings of 388 million or 349 per share on revenue

shearson lehman hutton inc took steps wednesday 
to bolster its financial footing under tighter control of parent 
american express co following the sudden resignation of shearson 
chairman peter a cohen 
the departure of cohen a cigarchomping wall street wunderkind 
typified the faltering fortunes of the nations secondlargest 
brokerage and of the securities industry which is mired in a 
protracted slump following the booming 1980s 
nine years after acquiring shearson american express removed 
the final highlevel link to the firms past when company chairman 
james d robinson iii asked cohen to leave amid mounting acrimony 
between the two executives 
american express and shearson on wednesday jointly announced a 
plan to raise about 250 million by offering stock to existing 
shareholders it replaces a public offering scrapped because of the 
firms slumping stock price and cohens resignation tuesday 
under the new plan american express would cut its stake in 
shearson to about 45 percent from 61 percent enabling it to drop 
the brokerage from its balance sheet american express would remain 
shearsons largest stakeholder 
a sign of tighter parental control came with the appointment of 
howard l clark jr chief financial officer and executive vice 
president of american express as shearsons new president and ceo 
clarks father was american express chairman before robinson 
clark said in a telephone interview that his shortterm goal 
is to get out and see the employees and management and retail 
system i will be doing a lot of that longer term is to restore 
shearson to its prior levels of returns 
he said his appointment would not mark a radical change in the 
relationship between american express and shearson analysts had a 
different view 
basically theyre running the company directly now said 
lawrence eckenfelder an analyst with prudentialbache securities 
inc robinson always had influence but it was peter cohens 
company 
shearsons current troubles stem in part from a recession on 
wall street stemming from a decline in individual stock activity 
mergers and acquisitions and securities underwriting because of 
their size and exposure in many areas nos 1 and 2 merrill lynch amp 
co and shearson have been among the hardest hit 
but analysts lay much of the blame on overexpansion shearson 
moved from a mediumsized retail outfit to a diversified brokerage 
by acquiring investment banking firm lehman brothers kuhn loeb in 
1984 and retail brokerage ef hutton amp co in 1988 
in this drive to become a major global fullservice firm 
they like merrill expanded to the point where they started to 
realize diminishing returns eckenfelder said they found out 
you can be all things to all people but you cant always make money 
doing it 
for cohen 43 described as a tough negotiator driven to 
transform shearson into a topflight firm the fall was swift 
last week he offered a hint of his own demise and of his soured 
relationship with robinson asked bluntly during a stockoffering 
presentation why he still had his job cohen said if robinson 
wants to punch my ticket he can 
he did american express officials say the company now will 
focus on assessing what problems need to be resolved they do not 
rule out a sharp consolidation following the 80s growth 
shearson will be adapting to the demands and requirements of 
the environment said lawrence armour an american express senior 
vice president shearson is really filled with talented 
highenergy people he said i dont think longrange planning 
strategic thinking is one of the things they shine at 
securities industry analysts said clark is the antithesis of the 
brash and combative cohen an investment banker in the 1970s 
clark who turns 46 on thursday was described as a subdued and 
practical manager expected to run shearson less aggressively than 
cohen 
over the next several years you could see a swing back to the 
shearson of old where the main concern was the retail side of the 
business said perrin long of lipper analytical services 
the first order of business is the new stock offer shearson 
plans to sell 21 million shares of common stock for 12 a share to 
current shareholders american express would buy about 69 percent 
of the new stock and any shares not purchased the old plan 
envisioned the sale of 20 million shares to the public 
shearson stock reacted positively to the developments rising 75 
cents to 12 in new york stock exchange trading wednesday after a 
75cent rise on tuesday spurred largely by cohens resignation 
american express would reduce its stake in shearson by awarding 
shearson shares to american express stockholders as a special 
dividend 
as it moves forward shearson still faces the expansion problems 
left behind by cohen including the merger with hutton the 
securities industrys largest ever 
analysts and american express officials say shearson paid too 
much for hutton 962 million when retail brokering was slumping 
after the stock market crash in 1987 
in addition shearson must patch up morale among its merged 
troops particularly its 10500 stockbrokers john feloni a former 
hutton executive who wrote a book about the merger said huttons 
trademark was that of a friendly retail brokerage while shearson 
symbolized the arrogance characterizing the 80s takeover craze 
it was just a culture clash said feloni who now runs his 
own small investment firm if there were better times i think 
they might have overcome all that now theres just no room for 
error

drexel burnham lambert inc will pay 
missouri 1 million to settle charges arising from the wall street 
firms guilty plea to securities fraud charges the state said 
wednesday 
in a separate action state attorney general william webster 
asked the states supreme court to revoke the companys charter in 
missouri and order it to pay an additional 2 million fine 
secretary of state roy blunt said at a news conference that the 
felonies to which drexel pleaded guilty were as unamerican as 
rigging the world series 
missouri was the 40th jurisdiction with which drexel has 
settled the new yorkbased firm said it has paid a total of 73 
million so far in settlements 
drexel pleaded guilty last september to six felonies and paid 
650 million to settle a range of fraud allegations stemming from 
the governments lengthy investigation of insider trading on wall 
street 
drexel also agreed to dozens of administrative changes and 
unprecedented federal supervision in the april settlement of civil 
charges by the federal securities and exchange commission 
under the latest agreement drexel cannot solicit new business 
in missouri for three years without the secretary of states 
consent must hire an agent to find investors hurt by the companys 
actions and must pay 100000 above the 1 million to a national 
investor education fund 
the company can continue to deal with its existing customers in 
missouri 
of drexels payments to the state 500000 pay for toward 
investor education materials and an equal amount for grants for 
business programs at missouri colleges and universities 
blunt said persons found to have been financially hurt by 
drexels action are entitled to money from a 350 million fund 
under a settlement between the firm and the government investors 
who file a claim must prove damage 
settling with the states relieves the firm of possible 
litigation and frees state regulators from having to investigate 
the firms trading activities from 1984 to 1986 when the sec 
alleged the fraud occurred 
it also generally preserves the firms ability to underwrite 
securities and do other business in the states most states can 
revoke a companys right to do business if the firm is convicted 
or admits to committing a felony drexel abandoned the retail 
brokerage business last year

the index composed of 11 statistics designed to forecast 
economic activity six to nine months into the future was the 
latest indication that the economy while weak can avoid an actual 
decline in growth or recession 
ordinarily the report would have been taken by the bond market 
as a signal that the federal reserve would continue to push 
interest rates higher which would lower bond prices a negative 
for the credit market traders said 
the bond market ignored the strong data suggesting to some 
that interest rates might have peaked johnson said 
theodore tung senior vice president with national city corp in 
cleveland said interestrate worries which have plagued the

as interest rate concerns subside stocks are doing better

albert hakim the businessman who controlled 
the proceeds from the reagan administrations arms sales to iran 
has agreed to return an unspecified amount of money to the us 
government irancontra prosecutors said wednesday 
hakim who pleaded guilty nov 21 to supplementing oliver 
norths income faces sentencing thursday before us district 
court judge gerhard gesell 
the justice department approved an agreement this week for the 
return to the united states of certain funds by hakim the office 
of independent counsel lawrence walsh said in court papers 
the swiss government has frozen some 78 million held in 
accounts of the enterprise the network of companies hakim and 
business partner richard secord set up to handle money in the 
irancontra affair 
the court papers did not specify how much money would be 
returned 
on monday irancontra prosecutors said in a sentencing memo 
that hakim has agreed to provide them with testimony in an 
anticipated future case that pertains to a grand jury 
investigation being conducted outside washington the prosecutors 
did not elaborate but called his cooperation of significant 
value 
the question of who owns the proceeds from the irancontra 
affair has lingered since the scandal erupted in november 1986 
in the secret iran initiative the us government was paid the 
cost of the weapons it sold to the iranians but the enterprise 
charged iran exorbitant prices for the arms with the difference 
being kept in the accounts controlled by hakim 
several million dollars were diverted to the contras fighting 
the leftist government of nicaragua other money was set aside for 
profits for hakim secord and arms dealer thomas clines 
congressional investigators found some of the money also was 
supposed to be funneled to other covert us programs north has 
testified 
irancontra prosecutors said that one of hakims companies lake 
resources unlawfully converted for its own use profits of 
approximately 114 million a lawyer for the firm john hume 
denied that lake resources pleaded guilty to a charge of theft of 
government property in the diversion of iran arms sales profits to 
the contras and also faces sentencing before gesell 
walshs office has grossly miscalculated by vastly 
understating lake resources costs and expenses said hume 
as of dec 31 1986 the company had 43060 in a bank account 
that has been frozen by the swiss government 
since that time we believe bank fees and charges have 
significantly reduced that amount said hume 
hume urged gesell to levy no fine when he sentences the company 
theft of government property carries a 500000 maximum fine for 
a corporation 
the prosecution asserted that a fine can be enforced against 
those entities that have received the assets of lake resources 
through fraudulent transactions 
the fact that after such fraudulent transactions lake 
resources itself has only limited resources does not prevent 
imposition of an appropriate sentence associate independent 
counsel stuart abrams said in court papers 
hakim who admitted that he helped secord pay for a 13800 
security system at norths home could face up to one year in 
prison and a 100000 fine
