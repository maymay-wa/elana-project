president bush in his first 
presidential address to the united nations will announce a major 
initiative to cut chemical weapons arsenals by more than 50 percent 
providing the soviet union do the same administration sources said 
sunday night 
the president in between church services fishing and golf 
worked with his national security adviser brent scowcroft and 
other aides sunday at his seaside vacation home to finish the 
speech to be delivered monday 
the central focus of the speech is to be a proposal that 
secretary of state james a baker iii said would move the world 
closer to a ban on chemical weapons 
it is part of a steppedup us drive to slow or even stop the 
spread of chemical weapons around the world 
baker informed soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze of 
the presidents intention in their talks over the weekend in 
jackson hole wyo there the two sides agreed on a twostage 
ussoviet program to exchange information about their chemical 
weapons and to inspect each others plants and arsenals 
but the sources who spoke in new york on condition of 
anonymity said the superpowers were faced with the bigger problem 
of halting the spread of the weapons to other countries including 
in stabile regimes in the third world some two dozen countries are 
believed to possess chemical weapons or have the capacity to 
produce them 
first disclosure of bushs initiative came in mondays editions 
of the new york times the sources confirming the thrust of the 
newspapers account said bush also would suggest sanctions against 
countries which proceed with chemical weapons production 
the new york times said the united states was believed to have 
about 30000 tons of chemical weapons while the soviet union says 
it has 50000 tons western nations say the soviets actually may 
have more than 300000 tons 
the us proposal is intended to spur progress in negotiations 
in geneva where 40 nations are trying to reach a global agreement 
on chemical weapons 
one official traveling with the president described bushs 
proposal as a challenge to the soviet union to join the united 
states in action on chemical weapons 
another official called the plan a new initiative to move 
forward in elimination of chemical weapons to reduce stockpiles 
and generally try to give a new impetus to a total ban 
white house officials were tight lipped on what that proposal 
would contain 
the president has been concerned for a number of years about 
the horrors of chemical weapons he made a major presentation to 
the un conference in 1984 on the possibility of banning chemical 
weapons and he will have some proposals tomorrow to advance that 
issue scowcroft said sunday on the nbc show meet the press 
the united states and soviet union are the only two nations that 
admit to having chemical weapons stockpiles however us analysts 
estimate two dozen countries have the weapons or the capacity to 
produce them 
bushs speechwriters completed a draft of his un address 
saturday night following announcement of several accords and plans 
for a superpower summit as a result of two days of talks in 
wyoming between baker and soviet foreign minister eduard 
shevardnadze 
among the accords was an agreement to exchange data on chemical 
weapons by the end of the year and allow visits by inspectors of 
the other side to stockpiles and plants by june 30 in a second 
phase there would be more intensive onsite inspections of the 
submitted data 
in addition to the chemical weapons proposal scowcroft said 
the thrust of the un speech will be celebrating the march of 
democracy and freedom dealing with many of the multilateral issues 
affecting the world drugs terrorism environment 
the president is expected to include one of his favorite themes 
the moves toward political and economic reform in poland and other 
east bloc countries 
at the un where bush served as the us ambassador in 1971 
and 1972 the president will hold several bilateral meetings and 
will meet with un secretary general javier perez de cuellar 
he also will meet with brazils president jose sarney israeli 
deputy prime minister shimon peres guatemalan president vinicio 
cerezo venezuelan president carlos andres perez and bolivian 
president jaime paz zamora 
bush will host a lunch for nato allies and with his wife 
barbara also will visit the metropolitan museum of art for a 
diplomatic reception and dinner during their busy day in new york 
cramming in as much recreation as possible before heading to new 
york monday morning bush pitched horseshoes sunday along with

rockwell international corps sudden withdrawal 
from the rocky flats nuclear weapons plant wont affect 
environmental safety agreements or investigations into hazardous 
waste disposal regulators said 
the department of energy announced friday that rockwell had 
terminated its 25 billion fiveyear contract after 14 years 
egampg inc based in wellesley mass is to take over management of 
the plant monday rockwell maintained it was impossible to follow 
both its contract with doe and the waste disposal rules of the 
environmental protection agency 
any new contractor will have to live by the same agreement 
that rockwell does said jim scherer regional administrator of 
the epa a state health department official also said the same 
rules would apply 
egampg chairman john kucharski said saturday he planned to send 
representatives monday to washington and colorado to talk through 
a series of issues with energy department and rockwell officials 
at this point its rather flattering to be asked to do 
something like this but its too early to comment on what we can 
and cannot do he said 
rockwells departure culminated an increasingly bitter dispute 
between the el segundo califbased company and state and federal 
agencies over disposal of hazardous waste generated by production 
of plutonium triggers for nuclear weapons 
in june after the federal raid at the plant colorado cited 
rocky flats for 25 violations of hazardous wastes laws and gov 
roy romer threatened to close the plant unless it was opened to 
state officials for environmental monitoring tests 
that same month epa and fbi agents raided the plant looking 
for evidence of alleged illegal hazardous waste disposal a federal 
grand jury will continue its work in that case the justice 
department said 
the sierra club has filed suit against the energy department to 
stop incineration of radioactive waste at the plant 
the day before rockwell bowed out of the plant it sued the 
energy and justice departments alleging that conflicting federal 
regulations required it to violate some hazardous waste laws to 
comply with the contract

two bombs exploded in the capital 
saturday night injuring two people in a continuing wave of 
violence blamed on drug traffickers 
also saturday newspapers quoted an army general as saying two 
men confessed to killing sen luis carlos galan whose 
assassination led the government to declare war on drug kingpins 
and that the army also knows who hired the alleged assassins 
one explosion occurred in a downtown movie theater slightly 
injuring one man authorities said the other blast damaged a 
governmentowned bus terminal in the northeast portion of the city 
one man was injured 
authorities arrested several people in connection with the 
bombings officials said 
since aug 23 drug traffickers declared a total war after 
the government the crackdown and officials have blamed them for 
102 bombings and arson attacks that killed six people and injured 
129 
bogotas halfdozen newspapers said gen ramon niebles did not 
disclose who ordered the killing of galan niebles made the claim 
friday at a news conference 
galan was leading the presidential race when he was shot down at 
a bogota rally aug 18 the government responded with a crackdown 
on trafficking and drug lords retaliated with daily bombings and 
shootings 
the two men who confessed to killing galan were part of a band 
called the blackies the army general was quoted as saying two 
other men in the band are thought to have set off a 500pound bomb 
sept 2 that seriously damaged the bogota daily el espectador 
the four men were captured thursday in a house in bogota where 
the army found weapons ammunition and 220 pounds of dynamite 
packed under a car seat the general said 
twice before police have said they captured galans killers 
once five men and once 11 men both times the suspects were 
released after a few days 
the army has a reputation of forcing confessions from people who 
later recant in civilian courts colombias armed forces have the 
authority to arrest and detain people under a state of siege that 
has existed in colombia for all but a few months of the last 40 
years 
the president of colombias house of representatives norberto 
morales told a news conference friday in medellin that he was 
telephoned by pablo escobar and gonzalo rodriguez gacha kingpins 
of the infamous medellin cartel 
a tape recording of the news conference was broadcast saturday 
by bogota radio stations there was no answer at morales office in 
medellin 
the medellin cartel is believed responsible for 80 percent of 
the cocaine that is smuggled into the united states 
morales said escobar and rodriguez gacha offered to invest 
millions of dollars in colombian industry if a truce is reached he 
said he had passed the information along to president virgilio 
barco 
this would not be the first time that escobar rodriguez and 
other suspected members of the medellin cartel have tried to buy 
amnesty 
in 1984 president belisario betancur even sent former president 
alfonso lopez michelsen to panama to meet with members of the 
cartel the cartel offered to pay off colombias foreign debt then 
about 10 billion if colombia would end the war declared on drug 
traffickers after justice minister rodrigo lara bonilla was 
murdered 
the government rejected the offer but a few weeks later the 
army stopped confiscating property of suspected traffickers 
medellin mayor juan gomez martinez has been the biggest 
advocate of negotiations with drug traffickers 
a us embassy official said earlier this month that the 
traffickers specific demands have included full pardons in 
exchange for removing all of their drug operations from colombia 
perhaps to bolivia and peru 
the officials also said that traffickers offered to invest part 
of their fortunes in helping government security forces rid the 
country of leftist guerrillas 
barco has refused to conduct negotiatons with the traffickers 
forbes magazine recently ranked escobar as having between 2 
billion and 3 billion colombian media have reported that all five 
members of the medellin cartel are billionaires 
the us justice department has given priority to the capture 
and extradition of 12 colombians facing drug charges in the united 
states including escobar and rodriguez none of the 12 has been 
captured

a fundamentalist school principal was 
convicted of assault for paddling a 7yearold student until the 
child was bruised 
a jury meeting friday said that david l douglass 37 principal 
of mountain view christian school used excessive force when he 
paddled the hyperactive boy for talking in class last year 
douglass faces up to two years in prison and a 5000 fine for 
the simple assault conviction 
the trial focused on the degree of pain caused by the paddling 
under the law a teacher or parent can be convicted of assaulting a 
child if extreme pain mental distress or bodily injury was 
inflicted 
a doctor who attended the boy shortly after the spanking said 
the momentary pain of each whack against the bruised skin was 
equivalent to the pain of a lighted cigarette

beiruts airport opened for business 
sunday and a cargo ship sailed unscathed into a christian port 
raising hopes that a truce was holding after six months of fighting 
between christians and syrians 
its music to our ears said resident randa masri after a 
commercial freight plane circled overhead one of three aircraft to 
land sunday at the newly reopened beirut international airport 
beirut residents stopped in the streets and rushed to balconies 
craning their necks to look at the plane 
a security committee made up of officials from the warring 
factions and headed by lakhdar alibrahimi an assistant 
secretarygeneral of the arab league met for the second time 
sunday to discuss how to solidify the ceasefire and implement a 
peace plan 
the committee had met for the first time saturday as some of the 
most ferocious artillery battles in lebanons 14yearold civil war 
came to an end 
officials announced the lifting of seaport blockades the 
opening of the airport and the daytime opening of all crossings 
between christian east beirut and moslem west beirut only one 
crossing had been open sporadically during the latest outbreak of 
fighting 
by police count 929 people have been killed and 2741 wounded 
nearly all of them civilains since the bombardments began march 8 
between gen michel aouns mostly christian army units and syrian 
troops joined by allied lebanese moslem militias 
the airport port and crossing reopenings prompted sunni moslem 
cleric sheik mohammed rashid kabbani to say they were the first 
step on the road to resolving the lebanese crisis 
carrying a cargo of clothing the trans mediterranean airlines 
freight plane was the first aircraft to land at the airport since 
it was closed march 12 it was the longest shutdown for the 
nations only civil aviation facility since lebanons civil war 
broke out in 1975 
later a passenger plane belonging to middle east airlines 
lebanons national carrier landed on a flight from the saudi 
arabian port city of jiddah with eight passengers aboard 
they were greeted by several hundred airport and airline 
employees 
another middle east airlines jetliner landed in the afternoon 
carrying 57 passengers from larnaca cyprus said an official of 
the airline in larnaca 
ibrahimi arrived at the airport after the first two planes 
landed and met briefly with the airports general manager khaled 
saab after the meeting ibrahimi told reporters he will ask other 
arab airlines to resume flights to beirut 
police said a cargo ship cruised into beirut port in christian 
east beirut without being targeted by syrian fire they had no 
information about the ships flag or cargo 
two more ships were expected to dock soon beirut port 
authorities said 
a police spokesman said syrian troops in west beirut the 
eastern mountains and the north abstained from their daily ritual 
of shelling the christian coastline north of beirut to maintain a 
sea blockade of the christian enclave 
the front lines are quiet said the spokesman who cannot be 
named under standing regulations 
it seems that both parties are abiding by the security 
committees decisions he added 
tens of thousands of refugees who had fled the carnage jammed 
all entrances leading into the city and the christian enclave for 
the second straight day 
all but an estimated 150000 of beiruts 15 million population 
had fled the shelling to safer areas in lebanon or abroad 
many of those flooding entrances on highways leading into west 
beirut were moslem refugees returning from the awali river 25 
miles south of the capital where they had lived for months in 
squalid makeshift encampments 
ibrahimi arrived in beirut on sept 17 a day after a peace plan 
was announced by an arab league committee 
the plan called for a truce and included steps to enforce it 
such as lifting seaside blockades opening the airport and halting 
weapons shipments from other countries 
it also called for a meeting of the 99seat parliament on sept 
30 outside the country to discuss political reforms to satisfy 
moslems demands for an equal share of power with christians 
christians have dominated the government legislature army and 
judiciary since independence from france in 1943 when they were 
the majority 
but moslems are now believed to make up 55 percent of the 
population of 4 million there has been no official census since 
1932

the headlines were of summits and arms 
control but it is a desperate soviet economy that is melting a 
range of bitter edges from the cold war and driving a reduction in 
superpower nuclear arsenals 
the soviets came to this rocky mountain setting in a 
compromising mood and the united states mindful of soviet 
president mikhail gorbachevs plight was there to pocket the 
concessions 
one by one soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze 
trotted out the concessions yielding on star wars a dubious 
siberian radar facility and on sealaunched cruise missiles 
secretary of state james a baker iii was compelled to give 
nearly nothing in return yes he would consider a soviet proposal 
for inspection of us radar facilities in greenland and britain 
and he would consider drawing up lists of acceptable star wars 
space tests 
but baker looking very much like the cat that swallowed the 
canary pointed out in his soft texas drawl that really nothing 
could be done about the radar without the consent of the host 
countries denmark and britain 
and he said nothing really had changed since 1987 when the 
soviets first suggested identifying which tests were permissible 
under the 1972 antiballistic missile treaty 
the soviets on the other hand gave and gave again 
they will let negotiators in geneva try to complete a treaty to 
slash the number of longrange nuclear weapons perhaps by half 
even without a parallel agreement on spacebased defenses 
that means the soviets are surrendering to the us strategic 
defense initiative their best hope for trimming the program rests 
with congress which has cut funds amid doubts an effective defense 
can be mounted against ballistic missiles 
on krasnoyarsk the siberian radar station that the united 
states says is illegal under the 1972 ballistic missile treaty the 
soviets completely gave up the facility will be torn apart as the 
reagan administration demanded 
as for sealaunched cruise missiles which baker explained at a 
news conference were essential to us defenses the soviets again 
gave way 
shevardnadze said they did not have to be part of the treaty 
under negotiations in geneva to cut bombers missiles and 
submarines by 30to50 percent 
that means the united states may be able to retain its arsenal 
or choose to enter negotiations with the soviets to impose limits 
on the weapons 
why was shevardnadze so obliging 
an unusual conversation between shevardnadze and baker on the 
way here from washington may explain why 
the soviet foreign minister frankly acknowledged the economic 
and nationalities problems of his country were awesome 
baker heard more about the problems in the talks here so did 
robert zoellick a close aide who had a frank dinner here with 
soviet officials including radical economists who have been urging 
gorbachev to move faster on perestroika 
cutting weapons expenditures may not transform the soviet 
economy but it will help and it is driving the superpowers into 
arms control accords 
we have moved from confrontation to dialogue and now to 
cooperation baker said

at a private meeting of house democratic 
leaders last week national party chairman ronald h brown rose to 
apologize for recent speeches taking lawmakers to task for being 
too cozy with president bush 
but some democrats on capitol hill dont think the party chief 
had anything to apologize for 
as they head for a confrontation this week with bush over the 
capital gains tax rate a test that has split the party many are 
concerned that bush has lulled them into complacency and succeeded 
in blurring the ideological lines between democrats and republicans 
ive had a feeling for some years that on economic issues 
weve in a sense become one party in america said rep dan 
glickman dkan in a sense weve picked up the values of ronald 
reagan 
watching bush sail along with extraordinarily high approval 
ratings in the polls democrats also are looking bleakly ahead to 
elections in which they seem unable to define themselves 
browns chiding of congressional democrats in all candor may 
have provided a little catalyst for us to see where were going 
said glickman 
speaking of bush north dakota democrat rep byron dorgan joked 
morosely weve got him where he wants us 
but as if to illustrate the problem the party faces in crafting 
united positions not all congressional democrats agree with that 
assessment 
for any democrat to imply that weve not made our positions 
clear is just totally an astonishing statement said rep william 
gray dpa the house majority whip in a pointed comment aimed at 
brown he added i would urge fellow democrats to pay a little 
more attention 
the coming week will be a crucial highstakes test for the 
democratic leaders in congress it reminds some of 1981 the first 
year of reagans presidency when the gop exploited divisions among 
democrats to roll over capitol hill on its tax and budget 
priorities 
this time the test will come on bushs plan to reduce the 
capital gains tax rate house democrats propose instead to raise 
the income tax rate on the wealthiest americans and use part of 
the money to pay for an expansion of tax breaks on individual 
retirement accounts portraying the choice as one of the middle 
class versus the wealthy but getting democrats to line up behind 
the alternative has proven to be a hard sell 
theres a schizophrenia within the party said rep leon 
panetta dcalif one group is trying to run away from the tax 
issue and the other is trying to urge the courage to confront 
that issue its really 81 all over again this is the crucial 
week for the leadership 
browns worry is that democrats after losing five of the last 
six presidential elections are headed for failure again in 1992 
unless they begin now to draw sharp philosophical lines between 
themselves and bush that conclusion grows out of meetings with 
local party officials across the country during his first seven 
months as chairman of the democratic national committee said dnc 
spokesman mike mccurry 
the art of politics is presenting a choice to americans about 
two different views of the future mccurry said 
the republicans know how to evoke passion to push the hot 
button in the voters chest dorgan said weve forgotten how 
to do that 
but browns call for lawmakers to start preaching the 
democratic gospel annoyed top leaders in congress the partys 
power base as the majority on capitol hill democratic lawmakers 
feel caught between the need to confront bush and the necessity to 
compromise to fulfill their responsibility for helping govern the 
nation and they believe the party can gain little by pursuing 
confrontation for its own sake 
a legislature by its nature speaks with many voices so its 
difficult to have a single democratic alternative said sen bill 
bradley dnj who said lawmakers have to worry about alienating 
republicans whose votes they need the sharper the differences 
the more difficult it is to get 50 votes to pass a bill in the 
senate 
like gray many democrats argue that the party already has laid 
out a long list of issues where it is picking fights with the white 
house the list includes the war on drugs where sen robert byrd 
dwva has proposed to spend significantly more than bush wanted 
boosting bushs figure for aid to the new noncommunistdominated 
government of poland and criticism of timid presidential 
leadership in policy on arms control and eastern europe 
republicans so far purport not to be worried 
you talk about the taxandspend democrats said house gop 
whip newt gingrich of georgia whats their answer on drugs 
spend more money whats their answer on poland spend more money 
whats their answer on the tax fight raise taxes it tells you 
how far out of touch congress has gotten with the american people 
while brown may have a legitimate gripe with congress said sen 
sam nunn dga it is impossible to begin setting the stage for a 
campaign for the white house this early you dont do that and 
get the publics attention until you have a candidate and youre 
running for election he said most of the public is not tuned

whether to spin off from the rest of the country 
and form a new nation will once again be on the minds of many 
voters monday when canadas only predominately frenchspeaking 
province elects a new government 
premier robert bourassa is seeking another majority for his 
liberal party which smashed the nationalist parti quebecois four 
years ago when it won 99 of the 122 seats in the provincial 
assembly 
bourassa is touting a 4 percent annual economic growth rate the 
creation of 233000 new jobs and the social stability that has 
lasted most of his term 
but the idea of separatism for quebec thought to have been put 
to rest in a 1980 referendum in whichi 60 percent of the voters 
rebuffed it has proved surprisingly enduring 
jacques parizeau of the parti quebecois has campaigned 
vigorously on a platform based on eventual independence for the 
province and turned out consistently enthusiastic crowds 
a range of public opinion polls show however little likelihood 
that the nationalist party will end up with more than the 42 
percent of the popular vote that would increase its presence in the 
assembly or put a liberal majority at risk 
the conventional wisdom was that quebecers were no longer 
interested in independence parizeau said in an interview with 
the national news weekly macleans but when the question started 
being asked again in public opinion polls it suddenly dawned on 
people that support for sovereignty has stayed at roughly 40 
percent the same as it was in the 1980 referendum results 
the parti quebecois won 387 percent of the popular vote in the 
december 1985 provincial election 
bourassas support among quebecs englishspeaking minority 
which traditionally votes liberal may be hurt by his refusal in 
december to allow more than a token change in provincial laws 
restricting commercial signs to the french language 
i came up with a pragmatic solution taking into account 
cultural insecurity on the one side and the issue of individual 
rights on the other he told macleans just before the election 
if there is a minimum of good faith on both sides i still 
believe there is an acceptable way of facing the challenges of the 
1990s 
his compromise solution allowed bilingual signs only indoors as 
long as the frenchlanguage portion was significantly larger than 
the english 
quebec canadas largest and secondmost populous province with 
65 million people is 81 percent frenchspeaking 
supporters of language restrictions argue they are necessary to 
protect french and quebecs special culture surrounded by english 
elsewhere in north america 
a small equality party was formed to campaign against the 
language restrictions and could win a seat in montreals affluent 
westmount district a stronghold of englishspeaking quebec irate 
englishspeakers also could cut into the liberals showing simply 
by staying home 
bourassas term before the language uproar last winter was 
unusually quiet as the province settled into a period of 
prosperity leading to speculation that the parti quebecois could 
be facing its last days 
in recent weeks however there have been environmental protests 
over storage of cancercausing polychlorinated biphenyls or pcbs 
and a wave of labor unrest among some 265000 public sector workers 
including nurses hospital workers and teachers 
bourassa was the youngest premier elected in quebec when he won 
the 1970 vote at the age of 36 the parti quebecois ousted him at 
the height of separatist sentiment in 1976 and kept control of the 
provincial government until the december 1985 debacle 
parizeau won a parti quebecois internal leadership struggle last 
year and restored its hardline platform that includes eventual 
presentation of a constitution for an independent quebec 
analysts note it is unlikely to attract any voters other than 
the most ardent separatists 
bourassa an economist is counting on quebecers being more 
interested in pragmatic issues related to prosperity than to 
independence

a roman catholic archbishop who had 
opposed moving a convent from the auschwitz death camp said sunday 
that a vatican statement supporting the relocation probably means 
that a new convent will be built 
cardinal franciszek macharski of krakow who on aug 8 suspended 
plans to build the new center for the carmelite nuns made the 
announcement in a statement to the official pap news agency 
it was the first official reply by the polish church to the 
vatican statement tuesday that clearly backed moving the convent 
a decision that was resisted by macharski and polish primate 
cardinal jozef glemp 
the vatican also offered to help pay for construction of the 
prayer center at an alternative site farther from the nazi death 
camp in southern poland where millions were killed during world 
war ii 
on saturday leaders of the roman catholic carmelite order in 
rome said they support moving the convent as many jewish groups 
have demanded 
macharski said the holy sees statement opens a road 
toward resumption of work on the center of information education 
meeting and prayer in oswiecim the polish name of auschwitz 
machaeski gave no indication when work on the new center might 
actually begin and made no direct mention of the nuns church 
officials have obtained a site for the center about 3000 feet from 
the camp but have not broken ground 
glemp returning friday from a trip to britain where he met with 
jewish leaders said there was significant progress toward a 
positive settlement of the dispute a day earlier jewish leaders 
released a letter signed by glemp in which he promised the convent 
would be moved 
the presence of the nuns and christian symbols at the camp where 
an estimated 25 million were killed simply for being jews has 
angered jews worldwide and many christians 
however many poles have opposed moving the nuns arguing that 
their prayers are not harmful and they have the right to honor the 
memory of the tens of thousands of christians who also died in 
auschwitz four million people died at the death camp 
macharski in 1987 agreed to move the nuns to the new ecumenical 
prayer center by february 1989 but the deadline passed 
on aug 8 after a group of jewish americans entered the convent 
grounds and were subsequently roughed up and dragged away by 
workmen at the site macharski announced that plans for the new 
center were suspended because of the aggressive atmosphere 
the debate sharpened again aug 26 when glemp accused jews of 
provoking antisemitism in poland and speaking to poles as a 
nation elevated over all others the remarks were widely 
interpereted as antisemitic

blacks said tiles ceilings and floors had been ripped away and 
plumbing fixtures had been removed it estimated the cost of the 
damage at 40000

inappropriate for mrs mandela to live in such luxury while most 
residents of the huge township lived in tiny overcrowded homes

her husband was freed but there have been reports that mandela 
jailed since 1962 does not want to live in the house at all

build it was paid for by a group of black businessmen 
city press said mrs mandela has initiated legal action against 
the police blaming them for damaging doors and windows of the 
house during a raid two years ago the newspaper said mrs mandela 
believes the subsequent theft and vandalism was a result of the 
initial damage

leaders of the african national congress the main guerrilla group 
fighting south africas government for plotting antigovernment 
sabotage he is considered by many blacks as their paramount 
leader and his release has been widely demanded

a judges ruling in a divorce custody battle 
over frozen embryos is an aberration not likely to survive on 
appeal legal experts say 
but at least for now they say the decision may have unforeseen 
consequences for fetal research and the technology of fertilization 
outside the mothers womb 
tennessee judge w dale young ruled thursday that life begins 
at conception in awarding temporary custody of seven frozen 
embryos to a woman who is divorcing her husband 
this is just a tragic case said professor ellen wright 
clayton of vanderbilt university law school an authority on 
reproductive rights but yes ill say its an aberration no 
judge has said this before 
she added that the supreme court while showing increasing 
hostility to its 1973 ruling legalizing abortion nationwide is not 
likely to hold that life begins at conception 
i certainly think youngs ruling goes too far even for this 
supreme court clayton said the justices have never said 
embryos are children 
a deeply divided supreme court ruling in july in a missouri 
case expanded state power to regulate abortions but stopped short 
of overturning its 1973 ruling in roe vs wade 
in the tennessee case young awarded temporary custody of the 
embryos to mary sue davis who wants them implanted in her so she 
can bear a child the judge ruled against her estranged husband 
junior lewis davis who opposed implanting the embryos 
davis said he will ask the tennessee court of appeals to 
overturn youngs ruling 
young relied heavily on testimony by a french geneticist who 
said each embryo bears the full genetic blueprint of an individual 
the judge said the davises have produced human beings to be 
known as their child or children 
abortion opponents welcomed youngs ruling 
this ruling reflects what prolifers have been saying for 
years said regina smith executive director of the prolife 
council of connecticut life begins at conception and should be 
protected by the laws of our land 
but john robertson a professor at the university of texas law 
school said young reached out in an unprecedented and 
unwarranted manner to decide the dispute between the davises on 
righttolife grounds 
clayton said the judge was completely bamboozled by the 
geneticists testimony the embryos are unique genetically but 
that doesnt decide the issue she said 
young could have reached the same result by deciding the case on 
much narrower grounds the experts say for example he could have 
ruled for mrs davis on grounds she had more to lose she has said 
this might be her last chance to bear a child 
youngs ruling hailed by abortion opponents and denounced by 
abortion rights activists could mean trouble for the decadeold 
technology of invitro fertilization in which eggs are removed from 
the mothers womb for fertilization and then reimplanted 
in mrs davis case nine eggs were surgically removed and 
attempts to reimplant two of them failed the remaining seven 
fertilized eggs were placed in frozen storage 
that is the typical procedure since the odds are against 
successful pregnancy for any one reimplanted embryo 
legal experts said the tennessee ruling raises the question how 
frozen embryos are to be disposed of when the woman does become 
pregnant and the couple does not wish to have additional children 
youngs ruling could discourage couples from trying in vitro 
sterilization for fear they would be forced by law to preserve 
and implant all frozen embryos 
ironically clayton said the only solution for couples that 
have more embryos than they want could be to implant them and then 
have an abortion if the woman becomes pregnant 
legal authorities also noted that youngs ruling raises problems 
for researchers who use embryos for medical research 
kate michelman head of the national abortion rights action 
league said must all frozen embryos now be guaranteed 
implantation or will invitro fertilization be outlawed

and ordered teachers punished for union activity contending 
leftists were using the union to spread revolutionary ideas among 
students 
union leaders claim education in south korea has been used by 
dictators to cement their power and have called for educational 
reforms 
they say more than 1500 teachers have been forced out of their 
jobs since about 20000 of south koreas 300000 primary and 
secondary school teachers tried to organize a nationwide union 
early this year 
thousands of teachers have defected from the union but union

prime minister hun sen on sunday 
said a fullscale civil war can be averted if other nations stop 
arming the guerrillas once vietnam withdraws its troops from 
cambodia 
he said at a news conference that bloodshed is inevitable after 
the vietnamese forces backing his government are gone but that the 
level of fighting depends on foreign aid to the insurgents 
officials on both sides of the conflict have predicted new 
offensives by the guerrillas after this weeks withdrawal of 
vietnamese troops 
hun sen also said that his troops still control pailin a 
gemmining region near the thai border reported under intense 
attack by the khmer rouge the strongest group in the threemember 
guerrilla coalition 
defense minister tea banh acknowledged saturday that the khmer 
rouge now control some territory near pailin 
vietnam which invaded in 1978 to end a bloody reign of terror 
by the khmer rouge and installed a prohanoi government has 
pledged it will remove all its forces from the country by tuesday 
the guerrillas say it is a ploy and that vietnam is hiding soldiers 
in cambodia 
a large farewell ceremony for the vietnamese military 
reportedly the last of 26000 in cambodia is to be held monday in 
phnom penh 
after the withdrawal of vietnamese troops the war will 
continue hun sen told reporters as to the scope of the war 
we think it will depend on foreign countries 
thailand has allowed the insurgents to set up camps in its 
territory while china has armed them 
we appeal to those who supported the enemy on the basis of 
their opposition to vietnamese forces in cambodia to reassess their 
policies said hun sen the best way to prevent civil war is to 
immediately stop supplying arms 
he said he is willing to improve ties between his communist 
government and the united states through joint searches for remains 
of us servicemen missing since the vietnam war 
both vietnam and laos have participated in some searches for 
missing us servicemen together with american specialists 
hun sen said his government already has discovered some remains 
and is willing to hand them over he did not say how many bodies 
have been discovered and a senior foreign ministry official said 
he did not know the number 
it was the us that showed a lack of interest in our finds 
said hun sen they said they have no relations with the phnom 
penh government so they will not get in touch with the phnom penh 
government on this issue 
china and many western countries refuse to establish diplomatic 
ties with an administration installed by hanoi and the united 
nations recognizes the guerrilla coalition as cambodias official 
government 
however a foreign ministry official said sunday that chinese 
officials came to cambodia for the first time since 1979 earlier 
this year to discuss resuming trade ties 
hun sen confirmed that he and guerrilla leaders have agreed to 
resume peace talks some time in the future 
peace talks in paris failed in july after hun sen rejected 
guerrilla demands that the khmer rouge be included in a 
transitional government 
under pol pot the khmer rouge forced hundreds of thousands of 
cambodians to leave the cities and killed thousands in a brutal 
attempt to create a primitive agrarian society 
the phnom penh leader again refused to share power with them 
we can make some concessions but with regard to the khmer 
rouge we cannot make any concessions at all he said 
meanwhile 11 western aid agencies in cambodia called on 
governments sunday to prevent the khmer rouge returning to power 
our experience in cambodia and our contact with cambodians at 
all levels of society confirm that what cambodians most fear is a 
return to the horrors of the khmer rouge regime the groups said 
in a statement 
they criticized some countries for insisting that the communist 
khmer rouge be part of a future coalition government many western 
and noncommunist southeast asian countries who wish for vietnams 
downfall back the coalition despite the inclusion of the khmer 
rouge the two noncommunist guerrilla groups do not hide their 
distaste for the khmer rouge but say they would rather share power 
than fight them

congress moved like a hare last year to finish 
all 13 of its annual spending measures before the oct 1 start of 
the new fiscal year but this year the tortoise is winning again by 
moving the finish line 
congress must whittle down the 600 billion worth of spending 
measures before sundays start of fiscal 1990 but lawmakers will 
also be occupied this week with other issues 
the house weighs a tax bill in what will be a deeply partisan 
debate the senate finance committee continues shaping a revision 
of the medicare catastrophic care program for the elderly and the 
house health and environment subcommittee continues crafting a 
clean air bill 
the spending measures however will be a top priority 
congressional leaders have said repeatedly that one of their goals 
for the year is to finish spending work on time 
slowly and with difficulty is how senate majority leader 
george mitchell dmaine described the progress on the spending 
measures so far 
that contrasts with the drama last sept 30 when at 1159 pm a 
middleaged clerk who had just dashed the 500 feet from the house 
chamber struggled to catch his breath and walked solemnly onto the 
senate floor 
he delivered a copy of this years foreign aid spending bill 
which the senate had approved two minutes earlier the chambers 
receipt of the measure formally completed its acceptance and 
clinched the first time in a dozen years that congress had adopted 
all 13 of its annual spending measures on time 
this year it looks like replacing that clerk with a relay team 
of carl lewis ben johnson and mercury himself would do no good 
so far just one of the measures has been sent to president bush 
for his signature the one financing energy and water programs a 
perennial favorite of lawmakers because it is chock full of 
projects for their home districts 
working on spending bills is not just a question of dollars 
the measures contain issues as complex and wideranging as the 
government itself each of which pits interest groups and political 
philosophies against each other how should the ban on airline 
smoking be extended should federal financing for obscene art 
be terminated should government abortion restrictions be eased 
paramount is the fight between democrats and republicans over 
how federal antidrug efforts should be expanded both sides have 
dug their heels in believing that voters will reward the party 
that delivers them from the problem of illegal drugs and the crime 
they create 
some extra spending 1 billion or 2 billion or so is likely 
to be devoted to drug initiatives this year money that will have a 
domino effect because it will have to be shifted there from other 
programs 
republicans have blocked senate passage of spending bills since 
sept 14 while the two parties tried working out a compromise 
antidrug package with talks at an apparent impasse it is 
uncertain whether the gop will change its position 
other than the political embarrassment of failing to complete 
its spending work on time there will be no discernible 
consequences should the work be undone as the clock strikes 
midnight on saturday 
the law imposes no penalties for a missed deadline 
anticipating just such a scenario the house plans on tuesday to 
pass a measure temporarily financing government agencies until 
november

the united states and other rich industrial 
countries will experience a healthy cooling of business growth this 
year and next the international monetary fund predicted sunday 
projections point to a gradual moderation in the pace of 
expansion during 1989 and 1990 following two years of rapid 
growth the fund said in its semiannual world economic 
outlook 
for this year it sees the united states and 20 other 
noncommunist industrial countries increasing their total output by 
35 percent that is 02 percent higher than its prediction of last 
april though the fraction seems in percentage terms the 
difference amounts to tens of billions of dollars worth of 
additional goods and services for the group 
in 1990 growth is predicted to be 29 percent for the 21 
countries 
for the united states alone the worlds biggest economy the 
slowdown is seen as much greater 44 percent last year 29 
percent this year and only 21 percent in 1990 
the most growth is predicted for japan 49 percent this year 
and 47 percent in 1990 for west germany 4 percent and 3 percent 
for france 34 and 3 for italy 32 and 29 and for britain 3 and 
27 
there is no sign of recession we do not see it in the 
current projections jacob frenkel the funds research chief 
told reporters 
he called the slowdown healthy and said he was especially 
cheered by the growth of investment in new plants and equipment 
these create additional jobs and production for the future 
but the report warned that there is still a danger of inflation 
if the slowdown it foresees in demand for goods does not appear 
frenkel urged governments to take care to prevent it 
when you see inflation in the figures you have lost the 
battle he said 
frenkel said he is also worried by the imbalances in world trade 
the huge excess of imports over exports in the united states and 
the reverse situation in japan and west germany the report said 
japan and west germany should not try to expand right now but 
should be ready if necessary 
the picture it gave for indebted third world countries was much 
gloomier 
seven years after the onset of the debt crisis the prospects 
for a sustained improvement in growth remained in doubt for many 
developing countries in contrast to the more favorable outlook 
for those developing countries that have avoided debtservicing 
difficulties and for the industrial nations the report said 
it calculated that production in countries having trouble with 
their debt grew by only 2 percent last year since population in 
those countries grows as fast or faster that meant no meaningful 
increase in average income and in many an actual decline 
the report gave little attention to treasury secretary nicholas 
f bradys proposal for reducing the third worlds 13 trillion 
debt though it said the growing importance of debt reduction 
along with new lending should promote growth 
it is important to realize that debt reduction is no panacea 
and that strong adjustment measures remain the key to fundamental 
improvements in economic performance it said 
frenkel said debt reduction is justified only by improved 
policies on the part of debtor governments he emphasized the 
importance of new lending major us banks have recently been 
increasing their reserves to cushion losses from third world debt 
a move widely interpreted as indicating their unwillingness to make 
new loans 
there is no way you can forget new lending frenkel said 
it must be part of future packages

prochoice forces appear to have seized the momentum in the 
nations renewed battle over abortion but antiabortion activists 
say they expect the tide to turn as legislatures and the supreme 
court return to session this fall and winter 
so far a halfdozen states have emerged as early legislative 
battlegrounds but most lawmakers appear reluctant to open the door 
that was unlocked by the supreme court in july 
i would say its basically a standoff said lydia neumann a 
spokeswoman for the planned parenthood federation of america which 
favors access to abortion 
in the nations two governors races this fall prochoice 
candidates have used their viewpoint for its potential political 
advantage while antiabortion candidates have sought to shift 
attention away from the issue 
in new jersey republican james courter moderated his strong 
antiabortion views and is widely perceived to have been hurt 
either by his views or by his waffling democrat james florio 
strengthened his prochoice stance 
in virginia democrat douglas wilder is aggressively advertising 
his prochoice position in hopes of gaining ground on republican 
marshall coleman an antiabortion candidate who is considered the 
frontrunner 
burke balch state legislative coordinator for the national 
right to life committee insisted that a strong antiabortion 
position was not a political liability but in general he conceded 
that prochoice forces have had the upper hand in the 2 months 
since the supreme court upheld missouri abortion restrictions 
weve seen a season in which our friends on the other side 
have had the natural advantages with them he said because 
its been a debate not about the specific legislation but about 
abortion in general and with the considerable funding theyve had 
to have their say in the media theyve had their innings 
he said the balance would shift this fall when legislatures 
begin to consider specific bills and when the supreme court begins 
another round of abortion rulings 
pennsylvania and michigan are the most likely states to enact 
new abortion restrictions this fall while prospects are less 
certain in four other states where the issue is expected to come up 
before the end of the year 
florida and illinois are both expected to take up the abortion 
issue at special sessions and abortion bills are expected to be 
introduced at a special session in minnesota 
but legislative leaders in florida and minnesota doubt that 
theyll take votes on abortion during the special sessions and an 
abortion rights lobbyist in illinois describes the issue there as 
up for grabs 
i may get a few more gray hairs on that one said illinois 
state sen judy baar topinka a republican who hasnt made up her 
mind on the abortion proposals 
the wisconsin legislature is likely to approve changes in its 
abortion law but only to remove obsolete penalties that became 
null after the supreme court legalized abortion in 1973 more 
restrictive abortion bills remain stalled in committees 
many more states will take up the abortion issue in january 
when most legislatures return for their 1990 sessions an 
associated press survey of the 50 legislatures suggests that 
abortion will be a major issue in at least 23 states 
both sides agree that the most likely states to enact further 
abortion restrictions next year are missouri and louisiana balch 
said he considers the 13 states that offer publicly funded 
abortions to be the least likely to enact restrictions 
the coming abortion battles are likely to be fought along 
several fronts in many states antiabortion forces are preparing 
legislation that mimics the missouri law that was upheld by the 
supreme court on july 3 
that law banned abortions in public hospitals and stopped public 
employees from counseling women about abortions it also required 
doctors performing abortions to first test any fetus over 20 weeks 
old to determine if it could live outside the womb 
next years antiabortion drive also is likely to include bills 
to ban abortions that are performed because the parents are 
dissatisfied with the gender of the fetus and those that are 
performed in lieu of birth control 
one of the most contentious issues will be laws that require 
minors to inform their parents or get parental consent before 
having abortions 
about 30 states have parental consent laws but most are tied up 
in court and arent in force a slightly smaller number of states 
have parental notification laws almost all of which are in legal 
limbo 
parental consent or notification bills are pending in delaware 
kansas massachusetts and michigan 
the supreme court is expected to rule on parental notification 
laws in minnesota and ohio this fall it also will review an 
illinois law that extensively regulates abortion clinics 
antiabortion activists hope the court will use the opportunity to 
reassess roe vs wade the 1973 decision that allowed states to 
legalize abortion but its not clear whether it will 
in the meantime the most heat will probably be generated in 
florida pennsylvania and michigan 
in florida gov bob martinez wants antiabortion legislation 
considered during a special session in midoctober despite 
objections from legislative leaders 
antiabortion forces are hoping to gain ground in pennsylvania 
which already has relatively strict abortion restrictions 
prochoice forces launched a preemptive strike last week by 
proposing bills aimed at increasing access to abortions 
in michigan bills are pending this fall on a variety of 
abortion restrictions including measures similar to those upheld 
in missouri michigans legislature is considered antiabortion 
but gov james blanchard is prochoice and has vetoed abortion 
restrictions in the past 
elsewhere legislators will be watching the vanguard states and 
waiting for the supreme court to act and activists will be gearing 
up for the fight

greyhound lines inc says thousands of rural 
communities would lose their only source of public transportation 
if congress decides the dallasbased transit company must equip 
every bus with a wheelchair lift 
advocates for the handicapped however say greyhound is 
exaggerating the costs of compliance with the americans with 
disabilities act to shift attention away from the real issue that 
the handicapped are largely denied access to public transportation 
under the senateapproved legislation greyhound the only 
national intercity bus company would have six years from enactment 
before it would be required to make its buses accessible to the 
handicapped including those in wheelchairs 
greyhound interprets that as a mandate for a lift in every bus 
although the legislation is not that specific 
hearings are under way in the house on a version of the bill 
which could pass before the end of the year 
greyhound estimates the minimal annual costs of compliance at 
30 million to 40 million a bullet to the heart of a company 
that lost 17 million last year and expects to make 5 million to 
10 million this year says fred g currey chairman and chief 
executive officer 
at the present time approximately 32 percent of greyhound 
lines are unprofitable says currey who two years ago bought 
greyhound and trailways lines and has been in the process of 
rebuilding the two badly deteriorated companies 
utilizing the lower 30 million figure that would mean that 
51 percent of our routes would be unprofitable and that would 
trigger a massive withdrawal from small cities and towns across the 
country currey said in an interview last week 
greyhound spokesman george gravley said the company would have 
to pull out of half of the 10000 communities it serves and all 
but 500 of those towns have no other public transportation 
currey argues the lifts coupled with bathrooms accessible to 
the handicapped would remove six revenueproducing seats from each 
bus 
the lifts also would take away valuable cargo space used for 
shipping freight to thousands of rural communities he said 
freight shipments account for 10 percent of greyhounds overall 
revenues but as much as 60 percent on some routes 
add to that the costs of buying lifts that have not been widely 
used or tested maintenance and insurance and the total annual 
expense per lift reaches at least 10000 for a company with a 
fleet of approximately 4000 buses currey says 
a bill designed to reduce discrimination itself discriminates 
against our users the poor currey says this bill wont mean 
mobility it will mean lessened mobility for all americans 
including americans with disabilities and including the rural poor 
and the urban poor and the young and the old 
but ellen daly a legislative analyst with the presidents 
committee on employment of people with disabilities said that when 
transit companies are asked to accommodate the disabled there 
has always been an inflation on costs 
she also believes the lifts would be used by many more people 
than just those in wheelchairs the arthritic cardiac patients 
the blind parents carrying children in heavy braces 
according to the presidents committee 70 percent of all 
americans will at sometime in their lives be so disabled they 
cannot climb a flight of stairs 
a report by the senate subcommittee on the handicapped said 
intercity coach transportation is crucial for people with 
disabilities particularly those in rural areas 
approximately 27 percent of disabled americans live in rural 
areas compared with 23 percent of other americans the 
subcommittee said 
the report also noted that people with disabilities have 
drastically lower incomes that other americans and the lowincome 
are more likely to use lessexpensive intercity buses and trains 
than airplanes

the royal marines visited injured men in the hospital and toured 
the severely damaged royal marines school of music in deal 
southeast britain 
it will not help the ira win anything said philip who wore 
a royal marines tie it is senseless one simply wonders what 
sort of mentality can even contemplate such meaningless acts it is 
appalling

utahs public school teachers have voted 
to hold a statewide walkout monday to demonstrate to legislators 
that pleas for more education funds cannot be ignored 
legislators fueled the revolt last week by passing a tax cut 
instead of diverting money from a 94 million state surplus to 
education 
teacher representatives from the states 44 school districts 
unanimously approved the action saturday during an emergency 
meeting called by the utah education association following a 
wildcat walkout in four of the states largest districts a day 
earlier 
uea president james campbell criticized gov norm bangerter who 
outraged educators friday by telling them to take a couple of 
aspirin and go back to work 
the governor is wrong when he thinks aspirin can cure the 
problems with education in this state said campbell who passed 
out aspirin bottles at the meeting aspirin will not cure 
overcrowded classrooms aspirin will not cure lack of materials 
lower teacherperpupil ratios and lower salaries 
teachers pay in utah ranks 43rd in the nation 4500 less than 
the average national salary of 29400 the association says 
the revolt started friday in the davis school district when high 
school teachers there walked out of class by the end of the day 
the wildcat walkouts had affected four districts 
mondays planned oneday walkout will mean no classes in utahs 
800 public and vocational schools providing a holiday for some 
435000 students and a day without pay for 20000 teachers and 
school employees 
the teachers called on their counterparts at the states nine 
colleges and universities to join them and scheduled a rally monday 
in salt lake city they also asked utah residents to support them 
monday by driving with headlights on and urging bangerter to veto 
the tax cut 
they pressed for a meeting of education leaders legislators 
from both major parties and a neutral mediator to set priorities 
for education before januarys general legislative session 
james moss state superintendent of public instruction appeared 
resigned to more walkouts before the vote was taken but urged 
teachers to consider alternative measures 
bangerters chief of staff bud scruggs said teachers were 
taking the tax cut too seriously and that last weeks special 
session was intended to get it out of the way so lawmakers 
could concentrate on spending during the upcoming general session 
we are sensitive to the teachers and we are proud of the 
teachers we understand their frustration they have more of an 
ally in governor bangerter than theyre willing to realize he 
said 
campbell said he doubts lawmakers can ignore the uprising but 
he said teachers have been told before that education needs would 
be met 
come january if we dont get education resolved like we think 
it should it could get much bigger he said 
the teachers are seeking a 5 percent standard of living raise 
more money for textbooks and supplies and a commitment to education 
as the states top priority 
teachers last walked off the job in utah in 1964 for essentially 
the same reasons cited now the action lasted two days and resulted 
in more funds for library services personnel and equipment plus 
general salary increases

adventurer paul schurkes new book bering bridge is expected 
to sell well in the soviet union 
that assessment of schurkes book about the ely adventurers 
1000mile dogsledandkayak expedition from siberia to alaska last 
winter came from soviet publishing officials 
they recently told schurkes american publisher donald tubesing 
of duluth that bering bridge would sell at least 200000 
copies in its first russian printing 
in america there are 55000 books a year published so 
theres lots of competition tubesing said not so in the 
soviet union when the soviets publish something it usually sells 
pretty well 
but more than that there is tremendous interest in the bering 
bridge expedition there they have issued a commemorative postage 
stamp and have a bronze bust of paul in moscow he said 
the minnesotans expedition captured the imagination of the 
soviet people tubesing said it led to an agreement between 
america and the soviet union allowing eskimos in the region to 
travel freely between the two countries reuniting families long 
separated by political barriers 
tubesing president of pfeiferhamilton publishers said 
arrangements are being made for a russian translation of the book

two weeks after hungary opened its 
western border to east german refugees arrivals in west germany 
are nearing 20000 with no apparent end in sight 
the migration has exceeded west german expectations government 
spokesman hans klein predicted earlier this month that up to 15000 
or 20000 east germans vacationing in hungary were waiting for a 
chance to flee their homeland 
the bonn governments earlier estimate that 100000 east germans 
could emigrate or escape to west germany this year was exceeded by 
midseptember and officials now say the exodus could reach as high 
as 200000 by years end 
west german border guards said that as of noon sunday 19650 
east germans had fled through hungary to west germany since sept 
10 and that the total would no doubt exceed 20000 by monday 
morning 
another 900 east germans were occupying bonns embassies in 
prague czechoslovakia and warsaw poland demanding passage to 
west germany and austrian officials reported 819 east germans 
crossed over from hungary overnight en route to west germany 
another surge in the daily stream that shows no signs of ebbing 
sunday newspapers hinted that a solution to the embassy 
occupations may be in the works because east germany wants the 
refugee crisis cleared up by oct 7 when the hardline communist 
state celebrates its 40th anniversary 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev will visit east berlin for 
the festivities and continued strife within the warsaw pact would 
cast a shadow over the official events 
while hungary poland and the soviet union have swept away the 
vestiges of stalinism the east german state under the leadership 
of ailing 77yearold erich honecker has refused to loosen the 
communist partys grip on all aspects of life there 
gorbachev who espouses noninterference in the affairs of other 
nations has been silent over east german intransigence on reform 
and the refugee issue that has distanced hungary from its eastbloc 
allies 
the hamburgbased bild am sonntag newspaper said a facesaving 
plan had been worked out that would allow the east germans holed up 
in warsaw to leave on special travel passes for undisclosed 
locations from which they could later leave for west germany 
the weekly news magazine der spiegel in its edition released 
sunday speculated that the east germans would leave by ship from 
the polish port of gdynia and travel to stockholm and from there 
be flown to west germany 
bild am sonntag said east berlin was insisting that such a 
resolution be a onetime humanitarian action 
the newspaper did not identify its sources and bonn government 
officials declined to comment on the reported plan 
the main difficulty is according to diplomats how it can be 
guaranteed that poland will not become a continually open door as 
is the case with hungary the newspaper reported 
an attorney acting on honeckers behalf met two days ago with 
west german chancellor helmut kohls chief of staff rudolf 
seiters to discuss the developments that have forced bonn to shut 
its embassies in prague and warsaw for now 
more than 700 east germans are packing the mission in prague 
and another 200 are sheltered at the embassy in warsaw awaiting a 
diplomatic solution to their demands to emigrate 
poland has shown reluctance to emulate hungarys bold action in 
letting the east germans go west without permission of their 
government and czechoslovakia has been even slower than east 
germany to loosen travel and emigration restrictions 
the numbers occupying the embassies in prague and warsaw have 
grown by 50 to 100 per day over the past week indicating along 
with the steady flow through hungary continued interest among east 
germans in joining the westward caravan 
east germans need no special permission to travel to 
czechoslovakia and visits to poland are also much easier to 
arrange than trips to the west or permission to emigrate 
the hungarian newspaper nepszabadsag reported saturday that 951 
east germans have escaped across the czechoslovakhungarian border 
to travel on to austria and west germany

a viable suspect in the green river serial 
murder case is due to get out of jail monday but authorities say 
they need more time to investigate him and will try to keep him 
incarcerated on federal charges in another part of the state 
william jay stevens ii 38 is scheduled to leave king county 
jail after completing the remainder of a sentence for a 1979 
burglary and for his 1981 escape from a work release center 
but the green river police task force will know where to find 
the onetime law student at least until later in the week stevens 
is being transferred to spokane county jail in eastern washington 
to face federal charges of possessing a firearm while a fugitive in 
the burglary case those charges carry a potential prison term of 
up to 10 years 
no charges have been filed against stevens in the green river 
killings the nations worst known unsolved serialmurder case 
stevens has denied he is the killer and his family members have 
produced documents that they say show he was on vacation with the 
killings began 
the case is named for the stream south of seattle where the 
first five victims were found the killer is blamed for killing 40 
young women most of them linked to prostitution from 1982 to 1984 
in the seattle and portland ore areas eight missing women also 
are believed to be green river victims 
stevens was identified as a viable suspect in an affidavit 
used in july to obtain a search warrant of two spokane residences 
where he lived it was during those searches that most of the 
mounds of evidence that investigators are sifting through was found 
we are not done were still working on it king county 
capt robert evans the task force commander said thursday of the 
probe that has kept 12 investigators busy since january 
we need another 10 days or two weeks to get through what we 
are evaluating the decision would be to determine whether this 
person is a murder suspect or merely a victim of some bizarre 
circumstances 
after he gets to spokane stevens could be released on bail on 
the federal charges when a detention hearing is held probably 
later in the week but prosecutors said they would fight that 
we will vigorously argue that he be detained given his past 
history of jumping bail in king county said us attorney john 
lamp in spokane 
stevens a fourthyear gonzaga university law student was 
arrested in spokane in january after a tip following a syndicated 
television show about the green river killings when authorities 
realized he was a longtime fugitive in the burglary case they were 
able to jail him even though they didnt have the evidence to 
charge him in the green river case 
after the search warrants were issued in july authorities 
seized dozens of boxes of items police uniforms and badges 
license plates a complete undercover police car with municipal 
license plates and 1800 videotapes some of them pornographic 
from homes in spokane where stevens had lived 
investigators had theorized that the green river killer or 
killers used police equipment to gain the trust of victims 
authorities have been trying to determine stevens activities 
after his 1981 escape to 1985 when he enrolled at gonzaga law 
school and began living with his parents in spokane 
evans said stevens under one of his many assumed names even 
bought a house in portland during that time and once he said 
stevens got authorities in spokane to issue him a special license 
plate by passing himself off as the police chief of a small town 
somebody has got to wonder what hes going to do with this 
he said 
other jurisdictions also may charge stevens on crimes such as 
car theft 
craig beles attorney for stevens said the attention given 
stevens makes him especially vulnerable for lesser charges 
when you place someones life under a microscope like that 
you are likely to find something he said there is some 
concern that perhaps more minor charges are being used to hold 
an individual until a larger investigation is completed 
as investigators continued examining evidence evans said he 
continues to hope for that one detail that will put everything 
together 
the hard police work is being done and has been done he 
said its going to take a break 
it could be someone weve already looked at and there is one 
small piece of the puzzle missing evans said

guerrilla leader sam nujoma expected 
to become namibias first black leader told 70000 jubilant 
supporters on sunday that he will build a democratic government 
that encompasses all political views 
nujomas speech was his first in namibia since he went into 
exile in 1959 
the crowd also comprised one of the largest political meetings 
in this territory where under a un independence plan south 
africa gradually is relinquishing control after 74 years 
the crowd predominantly black with a handful of whites packed 
a sports stadium to hear nujoma president of the southwest africa 
peoples organization who returned from exile on sept 14 
namibians he said have a historic opportunity for our people 
to choose a government of the people by the people for the 
people at independence elections in november 
nujoma called for reconciliation in this former germany colony 
where his organization has fought a largely unsuccesful bush war 
since 1966 to end south african rule 
he promised that if his leftleaning movement gains control of a 
postindependence government it will not exclude those with 
differing views 
swapo has no intention of imposing a oneparty political 
system on the namibian people against their will he said 
repeating a previously stated reversal of party policy swapo 
does not intend to rule namibia alone but will seek the 
participation of others in formulating and implementing policy 
the speech took more than two hours to complete because it was 
translated from english into afrikaans and three local languages 
viva plan shouted nujoma saluting the peoples liberation 
army of namibia the guerrilla wing of his organization 
south africa agreed last year to implement a un independence 
plan as part of a regional accord that granted pretorias 
longstanding demand for withdrawal of 50000 cuban troops from 
angola namibias northern neighbor 
nujomas party is favored to win most votes in unsupervised 
elections nov 711 that will choose participants in an assembly 
assigned to draft a constitution but it is uncertain whether it 
will win the twothird majority needed to control the assembly 
since at least 10 parties are contesting 
about 700000 of the territorys 13 million people have 
registered to vote namibias population includes 80000 whites 
nujoma alleged the election campaign has been marred by 
intimidation against his supporters and cited the sept 12 
unsolved assassination of anton lubowksi the only ranking white 
official in the movement 
he reiterated his partys proposals to encourage foreign 
investment and create a mixed economy 
regional stability in southern africa can come only when south 
africa dismantles apartheid nujoma said but he commended recent 
pledges by new south african president fw de klerk to seek racial 
reconciliation 
nujoma 63 last addressed meetings in namibia in 1959 when he 
led a campaign protesting the forced removal of a black community 
on the outskirts of windhoek the capital 
his organizations image recently has been damaged by continuing 
reports of atrocities by its guerrilla fighters against members of 
the movement suspected of spying for south africa many freed 
detainees say they were tortured into making false confessions and 
they say hundreds of other detainees either remain in custody or 
have been killed 
nujoma made no mention of the allegations in his speech

a solidarity journalist named to run the 
state broadcast media after four decades of communist control said 
sunday he wants to usher in honest nonpartisan and 
professional programming 
andrzej drawicz 57 a former political prisoner specializing in 
soviet affairs was appointed saturday by prime minister tadeusz 
mazowiecki to chair the state radiotelevision committee 
in a telephone interview drawicz said he accepted the 
appointment with a feeling of humbleness combined with 
resignation mainly out of respect and friendship for mazowiecki 
another veteran journalist who is leading the east blocs first 
noncommunist government 
the communist party strongly defended its monopoly over state 
broadcasting as recently as this spring but ceded it in principle 
last month during talks on forming mazowieckis solidarityled 
coalition government 
drawiczs committee oversees administration of broadcasting on 
polands two national television channels and four radio channels 
there are no legal independent broadcasters in poland although 
there are plans to permit private radio stations 
the new media chief said his post does not lie in the main 
sphere of my interests and i am not interested in making a 
political career but i came to the conclusion that when one 
must one must 
it is too soon to speak about concrete plans he said 
generally speaking the television which has been an 
instrument of one partys influence on society should be changed 
into societys property the property of the population acting in 
favor of this population he said 
it should be nonpartisan although it may present different 
views through the statements of different people a whole range of 
views that is its right and even its duty to mirror societys 
situation 
but as such it should be honest nonpartisan and 
professional 
drawicz noted the poor financial situation of state television 
and radio which he said is as difficult as our general 
situation of economic crisis 
some solidarity activists have urged that as a symbol of 
polands dramatic political transformation current news announcers 
be replaced 
of course there are elements irritating society drawicz 
said of possible personnel changes we will have to think about 
how to eliminate these elements without harming those who are not 
guilty 
the radiotelevision committee is to be transferred from direct 
cabinet control to supervision by the sejm or lower house of 
parliament where the solidarityled coalition forms a majority 
although chaired by drawicz it will include members of all 
political parties including the communists 
unlike his predecessor former government spokesman jerzy urban 
drawicz does not to have cabinet rank this reflects mazowieckis 
view that his new government should have nothing like a minister of 
information shaping public opinion 
drawicz said he will begin his duties monday 
drawicz whose opposition activities date back to the committee 
for defense of workers in the mid1970s is a specialist in soviet 
affairs with no significant experience in television or radio 
along with thousands of solidarity supporters he was jailed 
after martial law was imposed in december 1981 to crush the 
independent trade union

soviet foreign minister eduard a 
shevardnadze waded into the snake river fishing for cutthroat trout 
on sunday but hell have to tell his kremlin buddies about the one 
that got away 
i have no fishing license and i caught nothing 
shevardnadze joked as he and secretary of state james a baker iii 
ended their early morning fishing expedition 
im no pro laughed shevardnadze 
asked whether he had any luck baker a veteran fly fisher 
replied if you wont tell the president ill tell you 
president bush went nearly the entire summer without catching 
any bluefish in the atlantic ocean off his summer home in 
kennebunkport maine 
baker on the other hand netted three trout in just a few 
minutes i threw them all back he said 
shevardnadze and baker who held intense negotiations from 
thursday through saturday in this rocky mountain resort were out 
fishing by 8 am 
a school of eight otters swam around a bend in the river and 
peered quizzically at the two diplomatfishermen standing about 30 
yards apart in the water as they cast first with fly rods then 
with spinners after several minutes the otters turned and swam 
under cattlemans bridge from which about 40 reporters and 
cameramen were recording the event 
before leaving the river shevardnadze was given two plaques and 
a 300 graphite flyfishing rod donated by local merchants 
ill need this in moscow laughed shevardnadze 
fielding lighthearted questions from reporters at the end of the 
expedition the foreign ministers said they had cut a deal on 
measuring fish 
we reached an agreement on that yesterday said 
shevardnadze without disclosing details 
although the river had not been stocked with trout the 
expedition had been carefully prepared beforehand said park ranger 
doyle nelson 
shevardnadze was granted a complimentary fishing license ranger 
don daughenbaugh who had acted as fishing guide to three 
presidents tried out fishing holes and flies for the big event 
said nelson 
the rangers settled on a quiet spot in the river where the 
water ran slow and a little warm 49 degrees 
trout are cold water fish nelson explained to reporters 
the rangers took the bad luck of the soviet foreign minister 
philosophically 
the worst day of fishing is better than the best day 
working said ranger don cushman

us customs agents used to seeing travelers use 
exotic methods to smuggle drugs into this country are noticing an 
increase in the dangerous practice of swallowing cocaine to avoid 
detection 
plainclothes inspectors roving the huge customs area at miami 
international airport are capturing an average of a halfdozen of 
what they called internals every week said senior customs 
inspector george dickinson 
the swallowers are taken to a hospital prison ward to pass the 
sealed pellets of cocaine with the help of laxatives 
in one recent week among those taken into custody were a 
45yearold man who arrived on a flight from bogota colombia 
after swallowing 120 packets totaling a kilo of cocaine or about 
22 pounds two men on another flight from bogota who ingested 226 
drug packets between them and two men who flew in from jamaica 
with a total of 100 packets of cocaine and hashish in their systems 
so far this year 64 people packed from top to bottom with 
pellets have been taken into custody compared with 25 for all of 
last year dickinson said the majority of drug seizures by agents 
at the airport in the past three months have been from internals 
he said 
its becoming more prevalent due to extensive outbound 
searches in colombia he said 
colombian authorities stepped up their patdowns of usbound 
travelers about six to eight months ago dickinson said prompting 
many wouldbe smugglers to stop carrying drugs on their person 
most of the defendants accused of smuggling drugs internally are 
poor illiterate colombian citizens who can expect to earn about 
2000 for successfully delivering the drugs for someone else said 
dickinson 
money is the motivation said john fernandes spokesman for 
the us drug enforcement administration 
miami authorities recovered 116 pellets from a colombian woman 
who was seven months pregnant when she swallowed nearly a kilo of 
cocaine to bring into the united states in july iveth rocha 23 
was sentenced to 40 years in prison after being convicted of drug 
trafficking 
officials arent certain how much cocaine is getting in via 
swallowers but customs agents believe they have developed a keen 
eye for spotting potential smugglers by looking for signs of 
unusual behavior or nervousness 
once people are targeted they are taken aside for an indepth 
interview and a decision is made whether to transport them to 
jackson memorial hospital to recover the drugs if they dont 
produce them at the airport 
when we started to see this 10 years ago the packets were 
handmade things that tended to dissolve or break apart said dr 
kathleen schrank director of jacksons emergency care center 
things have gotten a whole lot more sophisticated 
the cocaine is usually compressed into a hard cylinder sealed 
in plastic and wrapped in condoms or the tips of surgical gloves 
the reinforced packets have cut down on the number of deaths that 
resulted from very pure cocaine escaping into the gastrointestinal 
tract 
uncut cocaine in that potency when it escapes into the 
system is lethal said us customs spokesman cliff stallings 
those who wait for symptoms to develop before they seek medical 
attention may be too late said charles wetli dade countys deputy 
chief medical examiner 
alfredo romero 44 was visiting his brother in hialeah last 
month when he started complaining of an upset stomach and began 
vomiting the day after arriving from colombia the next day he was 
found unconscious on the living room floor and was pronounced dead 
a short while later 
an autopsy revealed nearly half a kilo of cocaine in his system 
several packets of cocaine had ruptured

when president bush addresses the general 
assembly on monday he will stand before an institution that has 
changed dramatically since his days as the us representative to 
the united nations 
gone are ritual denunciations of the west by soviet and third 
world speakers harmony and cooperation are now the watchwords in 
the general assembly and most resolutions are adopted by consensus 
the soviet union has emerged as the mover and shaker in 
international diplomacy standing in marked contrast to the bush 
administrations cautious reactive approach to world affairs 
bush aides said sunday that his first presidential address to 
the united nations will include a major chemical weapons proposal 
and a call for international cooperation on drugs terrorism and 
the environment 
secretary of state james a baker iii said the proposal would 
move the world closer to a ban on chemical weapons 
but white house officials were tightlipped on the substance of 
the proposal 
the president also is expected to discuss the moves toward 
political and economic reform in poland and other east bloc 
countries 
bushs speechwriters completed a draft of his un address 
saturday night following announcement of several accords and plans 
for a superpower summit after two days of talks between baker and 
soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze 
among the accords was an agreement to exchange data on chemical 
weapons by the end of the year and allow visits by inspectors of 
the other side to stockpiles and plants by june 30 in a second 
phase there would be more intensive onsite inspections of the 
submitted data 
officials at the us mission to the united nations say 
privately that they were not consulted about the speech except to 
scour their archives for anecdotal material from bushs tenure as 
the us ambassador in 197172 
that suggests bush will not respond to the multitude of soviet 
proposals for strengthening the united nations many offered by 
president mikhail s gorbachev in his speech to the assembly in 
december 
gorbachev called for a un peacekeeping force in afghanistan 
un leadership in banning weapons from space and in assembling 
scientists to solve environmental disasters 
he also proposed giving the world court mandatory jurisdiction 
in all human rights cases and called for a unsponsored 
conference on solving the third worlds 13trillion debt to the 
developed world 
all these ideas have withered on the vine as the united states 
withheld any reaction or counterproposal and the soviets 
characteristically failed to lobby aggressively for them 
western diplomats say privately that they expect bush will 
praise the new era of cooperation among the major powers brought 
about by gorbachevs commitment to restructuring soviet society and 
cooperating with the west whenever possible 
bush is also expected to assail the power of the drug lords 
whose power rivals that of the governments of some nations where 
they are based 
un peacekeepers from the past and present won the nobel peace 
prize last year for their work the united states advocates a 
strong un role in peacekeeping and bush is expected to remind the 
delegates of that 
un officials and even us allies in western europe note that 
washington still has tight purse strings when the united nations is 
concerned 
the entire international community is encouraging us and 
applauding what we are doing secretarygeneral javier perez de 
cuellar said this week it is easy to applaud but i would like 
them to do what is really their duty pay their contributions to 
our peacekeeping operations 
as of the end of last month the united states was over 495 
million in arrears on its dues to the regular un budget that is 
about twothirds of the 688 million in total arrears owed by all 
159 member nations the entire regular un budget is about 776 
million a year 
the united states also owes about 254 million to special 
accounts for peacekeeping which costs the world body about 700 
million yearly 
the soviet union is about 7 million in arrears to the regular 
budget and owes 211 million for peacekeeping but has been paying 
off the peacekeeping debt 
bushs administration has asked congress to pay the arrears but 
due to the federal budget deficit the united nations appears 
unlikely to receive more than the current years dues plus current 
peacekeeping costs

congress will review the navys investigation 
into the explosion aboard the uss iowa in light of reports of 
improper experiments with the ships guns senate majority leader 
george mitchell said sunday 
mitchell appearing on abctvs this week with david 
brinkley commented when whether he thought there was a cover up 
by the navy which concluded gunners mate clayton hartwig most 
probably sabotaged a 16inch gun he was loading 
im unable to make that judgment but based upon the reports 
weve seen there will undoubtedly be a congressional inquiry into 
the matter to attempt to determine if possible what did happen 
and how well done the investigation and report were mitchell 
said 
hartwig and 46 mates in the ships second turret died in the 
april 19 explosion which occurred during firing practice 
the senate armed services committee has begun sifting through 
navy documents on the investigation said committee staff director 
arnold punaro he said the committee will conduct hearings on the 
navys conduct of the investigation 
how soon those hearings will be held is unknown since the 
committee is currently involved in working out a defense bill with 
the house 
defense secretary dick cheney also appearing on the abc 
program reiterated his defense of the navy report and said 
investigators knew unauthorized experiments were being conducted 
with the guns 
i was fully briefed on the investigation before it was made 
public he said the navy was aware of those tests the fact 
that they were experimenting was revealed by the man who did the 
investigation on the iowa but theres no evidence that theres any 
link between the experiment and the explosion 
media general newspapers had reported a week earlier that the 
iowa was used as a floating laboratory for high explosive 
experiments including the combination of a reduced powder charge 
with the heaviest projectile 
the navy said it is conducting an investigation into the 
unauthorized experiments

five officeholders wellknown in cleveland are 
campaigning aggressively to succeed mayor george voinovich who led 
the city out of financial default and fought off years of jokes 
about its burning river 
the five will meet in a nonpartisan oct 3 primary with the 
top two votegetters meeting in the nov 7 general election 
voinovich took office nov 12 1979 one year after the city 
defaulted under mayor dennis kucinich a selfstyled populist at 
the time the citys image was in shambles the result of default 
under the youthful kucinich who was dubbed dennis the menace 
and then there was the 1969 fire on the oilslickened cuyahoga 
river which created the image of a dirty city the butt of jokes 
last year voinovich tried unsuccessfully to unseat us sen 
howard metzenbaum a cleveland democrat hes not running for mayor 
again in order to seek the 1990 republican nomination for governor 
in the race for his successor voinovich endorsed the lone gop 
candidate ralph j perk jr the school board president and son of 
a former mayor 
the other candidates all democrats are court clerk benny 
bonanno city council president george forbes cuyahoga county 
commissioner tim hagan and state sen michael white 
forbes 59 has served on the city council since 1963 and has 
been its president for 16 years a role that made him a likely 
favorite to make the runoff voinovich gave forbes broad powers to 
promote bipartisanship in the city government 
white 37 who has served in the state legislature for six 
years won an endorsement sunday from the plain dealer clevelands 
only daily newspaper 
the five candidates have focused on the issues of jobs 
education and drugs and how to continue the downtown development 
that has polished the image of the city of about 536000 people 
drug tests for candidates charges of ethical conflicts and talk of 
voting along racial lines also have been prominent 
political science professor b james kweder of cleveland state 
university expects one white and one black to emerge from the 
primary white and forbes are black the others are white 
blacks vote for blacks whites vote for whites they cross 
party lines to do that he said 
the census bureau estimates that 49 percent of the population is 
black 45 percent white and 6 percent hispanic and other minorities 
forbes acknowledged that he had little support in the largely 
white west side and said race was the reason no white elected 
official had endorsed him or white 
white dismissed forbes complaint of racial prejudice saying 
forbes was hoping to capitalize on racial divisions white said 
endorsements typically follow neighborhood political 
considerations and he noted that no black elected official had 
endorsed a white candidate 
forbes ran a major voter registration drive and 70 percent of 
the citys 24000 new voters live in mostly black neighborhoods 
robert e hughes chairman of the cuyahoga county board of 
elections and the county republican party predicted the turnout in 
a blackwhite runoff could surpass the record 79 percent in 1967 
when carl b stokes became the first black mayor of a major us 
city 
you have five people with enormous name recognition and they 
are waging an allout campaign hughes said 
the increasing cocaine problem has made drugs a focus of the 
campaign with hagan and bonanno accepting perks challenge to take 
urine tests all three said they proved themselves drugfree 
forbes has been criticized for his support of five narcotics 
detectives acquitted of drug trafficking charges during a 1985 
sting operation in which police recruited a dealer as an informant 
the informant said police allowed him to continue selling drugs 
in an impoverished black neighborhood a claim denied by police 
officials but blacks were angered 
forbes also came under attack when his law firm represented a 
tenant group before a public housing agency whose governing board 
includes forbes appointees federal officials have called 
clevelands public housing the most delabidated in the country 
except for chicagos 
forbes began his campaign by apologizing for mistakes which 
included comments considered by some as sexist and tossing a chair 
at a city council colleague 
he also apologized for a campaign comment that he didnt 
pimp his wife like hagan who is married to a wealthy woman 
hagan 43 is a selfdescribed liberal and longtime friend of 
the kennedy family 
bonanno 39 who has held five different elective offices perk 
44 who is a lawyer in addition to being school board president 
and white all have served on the city council with forbes

a utility storage tank damaged by 
hurricane hugo is spilling 7000 gallons of fuel oil a day into a 
harbor in the us virgin islands the coast guard said sunday 
the coast guards marine safety office in san juan said 40000 
gallons of oil have flowed into waters around christiansted 
capital of st croix since hugo slammed into the us territory on 
sept 17 
the oil is flowing from a storage tank at a virgin islands water 
and power authority plant containing 16 million gallons of no 6 
fuel oil the coast guard said in a statement 
it said the oil is leaking into earthen containment dikes and 
trenches and then into christiansted harbor some oil is being 
contained within floating booms and some is freefloating 
northerly winds have kept the oil from spreading more than about a 
quartermile from shore 
because the rate of discharge from the damaged tank has been 
steady the coast guard doesnt expect a catastrophic spill from 
the tank the statement said however the containment dikes 
and trenches could break at any time 
coast guard pollution specialists from mobile ala were 
preparing on sunday to pump oil from the dikes to barges for 
removal so that the leak can be repaired 
the coast guard hopes that all the oil can be removed within 
the next two days the statement said 
st croix was one of the eastern caribbean islands hardesthit 
by hugo along a 500mile arc from guadeloupe to puerto rico 
officials say the storm caused at least 27 deaths and billions 
of dollars in damage in the region 
much of puerto rico including the san juan metropolitan area 
remained without running water sunday about onequarter of the 
island also was without electricity 
otherwise however the island was returning to normal with 
nearly all roads cleared and most stores and gas stations open 
education secretary jose lema said public schools would reopen 
monday but he cautioned students not to drinking water from 
fountains because of the risk of contamination

his greetings without exception are polite 
and eloquent instructive of his old world upbringing but the 
courtliness quickly gives way to sarcasm if tom lantos is 
displeased by what he hears 
this is about as believable as elvis being seen in a k mart 
the california democrat retorted recently to one witness testifying 
before his subcommittee 
if hud were a bank it would be closed by the fdic was 
another memorable lantos committeeroom response 
such quips have become a lantos trademark as he leads a 
congressional investigation of reaganera scandals at the 
department of housing and urban development the review has 
transformed the him from a 61yearold congressman who was little 
known outside his california district into one of the most visible 
lawmakers on capitol hill 
lantos quickly seized on an april report that first disclosed 
some of huds problems and his success appears to have given 
lawmakers who didnt act so fast second thoughts 
senate banking committee chairman donald riegle dmich began 
a hud hearing last week with an excuse for not being more active on 
the issue saying the panel had put other things aside to deal 
with the savings and loan bailout 
that job is now done riegle said in announcing he planned 
an exhaustive investigation of his own with testimony from a long 
list of witnesses who already have been summoned by lantos 
lantos hearing room has been the scene of testimony detailing 
the millions made by republican consultants with access to hud 
officials and the millions lost by hud because of fraud and 
mismanagement the obscure panel and its chairman have shown no 
fear of controversy issuing a subpoena to force former hud 
secretary samuel pierce to testify this week 
critics say lantos has played politics at the expense of the 
rights of some of the subcommittee witnesses 
this is a lawmaker on national television doing things for the 
explicit reason of getting votes said raymond banoun who 
represents a former top pierce aide who refused to testify its 
more putting on a show than an investigation 
lantos scoffs at that saying he has run a fair and 
professional and bipartisan investigation and a leading 
democratic theorist said criticism of his performance will fall on 
deaf ears among the public 
the public is not worrying about the fine legal arguments 
said political consultant frank greer they think this guy should 
be going after them for stealing the taxpayers dollars and putting 
them in the pockets of republican consultants he has enhanced his 
image and the image of the democratic party as well 
lantos is clearly relishing the spotlight and boasts that his 
subcommittees work was the impetus for an office of management and 
budget directive that all agencies review their management 
practices 
what is happening is analogous to you suddenly seeing a 
highway patrolman in your rear view mirror and you suddenly start 
driving at the proper speed lantos said my job will be to try 
to see to it that this atmosphere is not just a fleeting moment 
lantos professes no interest in parlaying his sudden prominence 
into political gain but colleagues and political analysts say that 
at a minimum lantos has established himself as an effective and 
articulate democratic advocate for clean government 
thats not for me to evaluate was all lantos would say when 
asked whether he had profited politically from the investigation 
he doesnt need help back home where he captured more than 70 
percent of the vote in his last two reelections but lantos could 
benefit in the house when he needs support for legislation 
the way hes conducted the hearings has created a well of 
goodwill for him said greer 
that lantos has spent most of his congressional career focusing 
on foreign affairs is a product of his childhood he was born in 
budapest in 1928 and escaped during the world war ii nazi 
occupation of hungary he was first elected to congress in 1980 and 
is a cofounder of the congressional human rights caucus 
but when huds inspector general issued a report in april saying 
that an agency rent subsidy program appeared riddled with influence 
peddling lantos jumped on the issue and launched an investigation 
that now seems likely to continue into next year 
he is a former college professor and holds a phd in economics 
yet at time he has professed to being simple in asking for more 
details the tactic that has nudged several witnesses into 
compelling testimony including former interior secretary james 
watts admission that he made more than 400000 in hud consulting 
fees despite no housing background and a maryland womans 
incredible account of how she kept 5 million in hud money without 
being caught 
lantos also has brought theater to the televised hearings twice 
calling witnesses to testify even though he had been told in 
advance they would not appear then looking out in mock disbelief 
at the empty witness table 
those moments have been followed by tirades directed at the 
absent witnesses including pierce pierce had said he needed more 
time to prepare because he had trouble finding a lawyer 
that was instant fodder for another verbal salvo from lantos 
he called pierce capricious and deceitful and 
sarcastically dissected the former cabinet members excuse 
i can understand not being able to find affordable housing in 
washington said lantos but not an attorney

southern california is in the middle of a 
drought and its a crime to waste water but who checks up on 
violations by the city itself 
edwin e neumann does as he surveys his neighborhood almost 
daily looking to bust water wasters 
the city asks everyone else to conserve water yet it doesnt 
follow its own advice he said theres no excuse for things 
like this 
neumann has identified dozens of leaky fire hydrants and broken 
sprinklers on public greenbelts since launching his oneman patrol 
he has filed repeated complaints with the city about 
streetsweeper drivers who dont close hydrants after filling their 
tanks and park workers who carelessly water the sidewalks as well 
as their lawns 
neumann 69 a retired high school gardener started his 
campaign after receiving city literature promoting water 
conservation 
his first target was a fire hydrant across the street from the 
high school that had been dripping for years 
althoug hes a pain to some other city officials admire 
neumanns tenacity 
i would say hes a value to the city and id like to have more 
people like him even if other departments wouldnt said shirley

relief organizations are rushing to help thousands 
of soviet jewish emigrants reach the united states by sept 30 the 
last day for regulations that allow them to enter relatively easily 
immigrant aid organizations are working overtime to prepare 
refugee applications for examination at the us embassy in rome 
one of the main transfer points for soviet jewish refugees 
sept 30 marks the end of the us governments fiscal year and 
authorities are studying new limits on soviet immigration for the 
next fiscal year 
in recent weeks more than 400 soviet refugees have filled new 
yorkbound planes each morning at romes leonardo da vinci airport 
up from an average of 130 daily in may according to the un 
international committee for migration 
on thursday 1350 soviet jewish refugees are to leave rome for 
new york 480 on a single plane 
its total chaos said an employee of the un organization 
last thursday as she urged refugees to bring their luggage to the 
checkin counter 
most soviet jews leave their country on an israeli visa but 
once they get to rome or vienna many apply for us visas 
until october 1988 all soviet jews were granted us refugee 
status on the grounds they were the object of persecution at home 
the us government pressed moscow to allow greater jewish 
emigration 
as ussoviet relations improved and soviet president mikhail 
gorbachev put more liberal policies into effect the number of jews 
allowed to emigrate mushroomed from a few hundred a year to 33444 
in the first eight months of 1989 
the united states increased its quota on soviet refugees from 
25000 to 43500 for fiscal 1989 but at the same time it began to 
insist last year that applicants prove their fears of persecution 
were wellfounded 
because of the change the visa refusal rate in rome has been 
around 20 percent said us embassy spokesman michael hahn 
the us state department expects an overwhelming 250000 
soviets to apply for entry to the united states in 1990 but for 
the new fiscal year a proposal is being studied that would give 
refugee status only to soviet jews with relatives or other ties to 
the united states 
applicants denied refugee status would still be able to get a 
visa but they would have to find a sponsor to guarantee their 
financial security and wait longer to become permanent residents 
agencies helping soviet jews are afraid the new regulations will 
drive up the visa refusal rate they have speeded up immigration 
applications to fill the fiscal 1989 quota for soviet refugees 
which had not yet been reached last week according to hahn 
the organizations also fear cuts in funding for resettlement so 
they are trying to hasten the departure of all soviets who have 
been accepted as us refugees 
were trying to send away as many people as possible before 
the october deadline said a representative of the new yorkbased 
hebrew immigration aid society in rome who spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
everybody is concentrating on making these people leave so we 
dont even have time to do the statistics she said when asked 
about the number of departures expected in september 
peter schatzer chief of mission in rome for the international 
committee for migration said that many details can delay 
departures 
for example the refugees must undergo a medical examination 
before leaving but in august most italian doctors are on 
holidays he said 
the final decision on the new us immigration regulations for 
soviet jews is expected next month 
on thursday like most recent mornings romes airport resembled 
a moscow train station refugees waited anxiously at a meeting 
point to receive their us visas in a corner a family cried the 
poodle could not travel in the cabin 
a middleaged soviet man with a bewildered look walked through 
passport control with his wife and three children 
so now we are free he said softly

rockwell international corp which said it was 
withdrawing as operator of the rocky flats nuclear weapons plant 
actually was ousted because the government was fed up a 
federal official said 
department of energy deputy secretary w henson moore said 
rockwell officials did not know of the does intention to sever 
ties with the company until friday morning the denver post 
reported in sundays editions 
official reports friday had said rockwells departure from the 
doe plant was by mutual decision and gave no reason for the move 
this rockwell incident shows were not going to be bullied or 
buffaloed or scared moore second in command at the doe to 
energy secretary james watkins told the newspaper saturday 
were willing to do exactly what were doing were not going to 
tolerate less than the performance we want 
the federal government is investigating possible environmental 
crimes at rocky flats 15 miles northwest of denver which makes 
plutonium triggers for thermonuclear boms 
the plant was raided june 6 by more than 70 federal agents a 
special federal grand jury in denver is reviewing evidence obtained 
during the raid as part of an investigation into the alleged 
coverup of illegal hazardous and radioactive wastedisposal 
practices 
rockwells ouster stemmed in part from its threat the previous 
week to shut down rocky flats if the company was not given 
protection from prosecution for environmental violations at the 
plant moore said 
the last straw he said the step that left the doe fed 
up was when rockwell sued the government thursday seeking a 
temporary injunction to prohibit such prosecution 
rockwell spokesman dennis hurtt reached sunday by telephone at 
home in denver said the company had no immediate response to 
moores comments 
moore said watkins had contacted egampg inc of wellesley mass 
last monday to see if the 14 billion scientific engineering 
company was interested in replacing rockwell at rocky flats the 
company was named friday as the new rocky flats contractor 
egampg already operates the idaho national engineering laboratory 
which operates test reactors the nevada test site where nuclear 
weapons are tested and the mound facility at miamisburg ohio 
where detonators for nuclear warheads are made 
moore said watkins telephoned rockwell chairman donald beall on 
friday to notify him of the decision 
rockwell was hailed as a white knight when it took over rocky 
flats from thenbeleaguered dow chemical in 1975 
moore said saturday that rockwell received a 
lessthansatisfactory performance evaluation the worst 
evaluation ever given a doe contractor for its operations at 
rocky flats during the six months ending march 31 1989 the 
company got bonuses nonetheless but moore said they were about 
half of the 4 million to 5 million rockwell had expected to 
receive 
under a new doe performance evaluation system which gives more 
weight to environmental health and safety at its facilities 
rockwell would have received no bonus at all for those six months 
moore said 
rockwell officials have said they do not plan to drop the 
lawsuit against the government 
moore called the lawsuit meaningless we really never did 
pay much attention to the lawsuit now that theyre going to be out 
of the contract whats the point he asked 
representatives of egampg were to arrive monday to begin the 
management transition 
moore said rockwells fiveyear 25 billion contract to 
operate the plant was being sweetened to appease egampg concerns 
about taking over the troubled plant 
obviously egampg officials have concerns about their companys 
equity moore said 
egampg also has had environmental problems and violations at doe 
facilities it manages 
moore however said most of the problems at those facilities 
were inherited by egampg 
theyre a firstclass company with a tremendous amount of 
experience with nuclear matters moore said they know the 
business they know the problems

as the first soviet citizen enrolled in 
the ivy league natalia tsarkova wants to make the most of her time 
at harvard university by learning to think independently 
she intends to start by studying the russian revolution from a 
western perspective 
tsarkova who transferred from the university of latvia in riga 
after her freshman year arrived recently to start her sophomore 
year at harvard as an emblem of the ebbing cold war and of the 
widening freedoms permitted the soviet people 
another soviet woman is enrolled at emory college in atlanta 
and the two could become the first soviet citizens to earn degrees 
from american colleges previously the only soviets studying in 
the united states were defectors or exchange students who dont get 
degrees from the colleges they visit 
her tuition and other expenses totaling around 19000 a year 
are being paid for by a combination of financial aid from harvard 
and the campus job she will have under a workstudy program 
the enthusiastic 19yearold student said she plans to return to 
her homeland 
i didnt come because the state sent me and its not my duty 
to go back but i love the people there said tsarkova they 
are just individuals trying to have a better life and i want to 
help them out 
she can help her compatriots by going home with an outlook 
refreshed by her time in america said tsarkova who lives off 
campus in a cambridge apartment with roommates from arizona and 
texas 
you can understand things better when you are out of a 
place she said 
tsarkova whose parents are mathematics professors was 15 years 
old when perestroika and glasnost began to reform soviet culture 
and the ensuing turmoil helped her to find out what she needs from 
her harvard education 
i want to learn how to think independently said tsarkova 
now in the soviet union it is a period of confusion for the 
normal person she said there are so many beats of new 
information and there are no straight answers 
before every answer was given to us and that was a bad 
thing the worst thing ever but now people have the opportunity to 
think finally and nobodys tried to do this before 
the desire to see things from a new perspective prompted her to 
take social studies 10 which covers the russian revolution 
why did it go this way was the dictatorship inevitable was 
stalin inevitable those questions are very important to me she 
said 
tsarkova said she doesnt find writing in english difficult 
because she reads a lot of english books in fact she wants to 
write for the harvard crimson the campus newspaper 
and i think i will learn where to put the right commas she 
said 
knowing about commas will be crucial for tsarkovas ambition 
which includes a foray into what she called international 
journalism she dreams of being host of an international 
television show from the united nations 
i want this show to present objective information and 
transferred by satellite everywhere to moscow to washington 
because i think we are all citizens of the world not of any one 
nation she said 
in part because of her feelings of international kinship 
tsarkova said she hopes to meet a celebrated harvard student from 
another communist country wuer kaixi who escaped from his native 
china last spring after helping lead student protests in beijings 
tiananmen square 
i would really love to meet him especially because we have 
similar we have similar and different problems and i would 
appreciate the possibility of meeting a chinese she said

reformist politburo member imre pozsgay 
said sunday the ruling hungarian socialist workers party will no 
longer be considered a communist party the official mti news 
agency reported 
pozsgay a leading reformer who is also one of the countrys 
fourmember leadership said the change would take effect after a 
party congress next month he also said he would quit the party 
should its reform wing be defeated at the congress which begins 
oct 6 
although officially designated socialist the party took 
power in 194748 as the hungarian communist party it was renamed 
and reorganized in the wake of the 1956 popular uprising that was 
crushed by soviet tanks and troops 
mti paraphrasing pozsgays comments in an interview with 
italian television quoted him as saying that after the congress 
the socialist workers party will call itself simply a socialist 
party and will no longer be a communist party in the bolshevik 
and stalinist sense of the word 
pozsgay has been at the forefront of political change in 
hungary he was among the first officials to publicly declare that 
the 1956 events were not a counterrevolution but a popular movement 
in numerous interviews pozsgay has insisted there is no 
alternative to hungary becoming a multiparty democracy 
in our endeavors we feel related to the socialist parties of 
western europe pozsgay was quoted as saying of the party 
should the reformers not win at the congress next month which 
would imply a halt to party reforms he would not remain in an 
obsolete organization pozsgay was quoted as saying 
in its session tuesday parliament will discuss and vote on key 
legislation for hungarys transformation into a multiparty state 
the first free elections since the communist takeover will be held 
by june 1990 
draft laws before parliament include constitutional changes a 
law on the activity of political parties the establishment of a 
constitutional court an electoral law a change in the penal code 
and in criminal proceedings

the county has paid a law firm more than 
360000 in the last year to fight allegations that homeless people 
have been unfairly denied 312 a month in benefits county records 
show 
the expenditures mainly from funds that would otherwise be used 
for welfare programs do not include payments made during the past 
three months 
the action has drawn scathing criticism from attorneys 
representing the homeless in the nearly 4yearold case 
settling would cost a trivial amount compared to what theyve 
already paid said gary blasi an attorney for the legal aid 
foundation of los angeles which is involved in the case 
he estimated it would cost the county 100000 to overhaul its 
application process to one that would ensure eligible people are 
not denied benefits estimates were not available for how much the 
county might pay in additional benefits 
their top lawyers get in an hour what a general relief person 
gets in a month said julie p downey an assistant city attorney 
also involved in the case theyve got to feel some kind of 
uneasiness about taking public dollars especially with the 
reputation that lawyers have 
the private law firm retained by the county said it was hired to 
defend against the lawsuit after the county counsels office 
decided it was not equipped to do so 
there is undoubtedly a substantial cost involved in this 
litigation but i think it certainly involves issues that are 
extremely important to the citizens of the country and the citizens 
of the county said nowland c hong the lead lawyer on the case 
lawyers for the homeless have accused the county and its 
department of public social services of making the welfare 
application procedure so confusing that many poor and homeless 
people abandon efforts to claim benefits to which they are entitled 
when the first part of the lawsuit was filed in 1986 superior 
court judge john l cole was among those who criticized the process 
i dont understand some of the forms myself he said

sept 18 after a police investigation uncovered evidence of his 
involvement in training militias for drug cartels

in jail because of my work 
klein says he trained rightwing ranchers to fight leftwing 
guerrillas he says his work was legal and he left colombia legally 
israel has no extradition treaty with colombia klein said he is 
only willing to submit to questioning at colombias tel aviv

the lithuanian parliament approved a report that 
says the 1940 soviet annexation of the baltic republic occurred 
against the will of the people an activist said sunday 
activists have said they intend to use the report as the basis 
for an eventual referendum on secession from the soviet union on 
the grounds that the annexation was illegal 
the parliament voted saturday on the document that has angered 
kremlin authorities said ramone sakaloskaite of the lithuanian 
peoples front sajudis 
the report was prepared by a local commission set up to study 
the molotovribbentrop pact under which the soviet union and nazi 
germany divided poland and the baltic states between themselves 
the parliamentary commission said in august that the 
realization of the illegal germansoviet agreements of 1939 to 1941 
constitute an international crime 
in addition the report says that the lithuanian law approving 
the soviet annexation in 1940 was beyond the power of the 
parliament of that time and occurred absolutely against the will 
of the citizens of lithuania 
on tuesday president mikhail s gorbachev told communist party 
leaders that the baltic republics joined the soviet union of their 
own free will 
lithuania was the first of the three baltic republics to 
challenge formally the legitimacy of soviet rule estonia and 
lativia reportedly were considering similar moves 
all three have pressed for greater economic and political 
independence from moscow and some activists want the republics to 
secede 
meanwhile the parliaments of kirgizia and kazakhstan in central 
asia passed controversial laws making their native tongues the 
official languages of those republics tass said sunday 
the laws give certain workers several years to adapt the 
official soviet news agency said 
the parliament of nearby turkmenia decided to expand teaching of 
the turkmen language and culture while the parliament of 
tadzhikistan voted to make it a crime to violate the equality of 
languages tass said

the gallows bay crab amp 
oyster house carried an encouraging sign in its window 
open it read todays special food 
a week after hurricane hugo ravaged the island of st croix 
followed by widespread looting dazed residents slowly are getting 
their lives back in order 
relief supplies have arrived power crews have begun work on 
electrical lines and a few businesses have reopened on the 
sidewalk in front of one boardedup photo shop a merchant sold 
boxes of film from a table on saturday 
two radio stations began operating again on limited power and 
telephone service has been restored between st croix and 
neighboring st thomas which suffered less damage 
still the hurricanes is not forgotten a utility storage tank 
damaged by the hurricane is spilling 7000 gallons of fuel oil a 
day into the waters around christiansted the capital of st croix 
the coast guard said sunday 
in all 40000 gallons have flowed from a storage tank at a 
virgin islands water and power authority plant containing 16 
million gallons of no 6 fuel oil the coast guard said in a 
statement 
the coast guard said it hoped all oil would be removed from the 
tank within the next two days 
the more than 1100 us soldiers on the island have been 
directing passengers at st croix airport and patrolling streets in 
fourwheel drive vehicles but the looting they were called in to 
control stopped days ago 
there really hasnt been much looting that weve observed 
since weve arrived said navy lt cmdr steve burnett a 
spokesman for the military contingent 
the stores already had been stripped of their merchandise before 
president bush ordered the troops to fly to the us territorial 
island thursday some residents complain the federal government 
sent in guns when the 50000 islanders desperately needed food 
i dont see any need for this number of troops here said 
dorene carter a nutritionist and red cross volunteer the united 
states should be ashamed 
instead of roaming st croix with guns the troops should be 
helping rebuild the island she said 
burnett said the troops were told to help local police maintain 
order 
jan hanley president of the st croix chamber of commerce said 
the troops were welcome 
i think we need every bit of help that we can get from the 
mainland she said 
lt gov derek hodge said the relief response has been 
tremendous but officials are having problems getting supplies 
organized and distributed he said the troops will be used to help 
rebuild the roads and bridges as well as maintain order 
hodge and others on the island said initial news reports about 
the looting were overblown 
we had no rioting hodge said but the us troops still 
were needed because local police were too busy taking care of their 
own families to maintain order we had to fill that vacuum 
george bagoon oreilly a former territorial senator said 
residents panicked when they saw the damage caused by the first 
hurricane to hit the island in more than 60 years 
some of those who looted were stealing whatever they could find 
but oreilly said he and others were simply salvaging food from 
damaged stores 
it was blacks it was whites he said everybody was 
looting 
the troops arrived too late to serve any purpose oreilly said 
people just dont like it he said all we want now is 
just some electrical power 
hodge said he expects the troops will stay another week or so 
at least one member of the us military force got an early trip 
home over the weekend 
national guard member darren floyd was called to the island a 
day before the hurricane slammed into his hometown of charleston 
sc floyd got permission to leave so he could check on heavy 
damage to his home and his familys antique business 
its kind of ironic to send me here to help these people he 
said

finance ministers from the worlds richest 
nations on sunday termed as historic and dramatic the changes 
occurring in eastern europe and said the west must do its all to 
assist the reforms occurring in the communist world 
the upheaval in the soviet bloc grabbed center stage as the 
annual meetings of the 152nation international monetary fund and 
the world bank got underway the more traditional global economic 
issues such as huge trade imbalances and third world debt 
problems also were addressed 
treasury secretary nicholas brady said the events occurring in 
the soviet union and eastern europe were changing the world and 
were the most significant event perhaps since the end of world 
war ii 
brady and british chancellor of the exchequer nigel lawson told 
reporters that the meetings of the socalled group of seven the 
united states britain japan west germany france italy and 
canada had been dominated by the discussions concerning eastern 
europe 
what is happening in poland and hungary is of historic and 
momentous importance and the major nations of the west must be 
prepared to do all we can to help them change their economies just 
as they are changing their politics from communism to a democratic 
system lawson said 
both poland and hungary are members of the imf and world bank 
making them eligible for financial assistance just last week the 
soviet union said it too intended to apply for membership in the 
two international lending organizations 
in other remarks sunday before the imf policymaking interim 
committee brady said that the united states still remains opposed 
to an increase in the resources of the imf despite a plea from imf 
managing director michel camdessus that imf lending resources need 
to be doubled from 120 billion currently to 240 billion to meet 
growing needs of impoverished third world nations 
a fully persuasive case has not been made that there is a 
pressing need for additional resources at this time brady said 
but he added that the administration was still reviewing the 
proposal and would not make a final determination until the end of 
the year 
because of the us share of voting rights in the imf any 
proposal to boost imf resources would have to have the backing of 
the united states 
on the issue of third world debt brady said that the debt 
reduction initiative he unveiled last march was a significant step 
forward in dealing with a growing sense of helplessness in the 
global debt crisis but he cautioned against unreasonable 
expectations 
excessive expectations can only promote delays increase the 
risk of breakdown in negotiations and ultimately raise the economic 
costs both to the banks and debtor countries he said 
the bush administration and other governments have said there is 
a need for the two international lending organizations to redefine 
their roles to meet changing needs many see helping communist 
countries enter the global economy as a primary job for the two 
organizations in the next decade 
poland became the first government in the east bloc not led by 
the communists earlier this month and the country is currently 
negotiating with the imf for assistance 
the new polish government is trying to combat food shortages and 
soaring inflation while replacing the staterun economy with a more 
marketbased system 
the discussions at the imfworld bank meetings follow up on 
pledges of increased aid made by the g7 countries at their annual 
economic summit in paris a meeting president bush attended after 
making stops in both poland and hungary 
brady said that no country made any specific further commitments 
to assistance during the weekend discussions but the final g7 
communique did pledge strong support for the reform efforts 
including rescheduling under more favorable terms for the part of 
polands 42 billion in debt being held by the united states and 
other governments 
finance ministers dodged questions sunday about how they planned 
to back up their pledge made in the g7 communique issued late 
saturday to keep the dollar from rising brady and the other 
finance ministers promised joint action to combat a further rise in 
the dollars value saying such an event could jeopardize efforts 
to narrow the huge us trade deficit 
brady on sunday said the united states was doing its part to 
correct its trade problems by reducing the us federal budget 
deficit an action us allies have long called for as a way of 
reducing americas need for foreign financing 
he called on countries running trade surpluses such as japan 
and west germany to do more to boost domestic growth and thus 
provide a larger market for sales of exports from the united states 
and other countries 
the united states cannot solve the worlds problems alone 
brady said the surplus countries must also implement policies to 
sustain domestic growth and open their economies 
in its annual world economic outlook the imf projected sunday 
that the deficit in the broadest measure of us trade the current 
account would total 1251 billion this year only a slight 
improvement from the 1988 level but would widen sharply to 1387 
billion in 1990 
if this occurs it would be a setback to bush administration 
hopes for continued improvement in trade as a way of keeping the 
domestic economy growing

griefstricken neighbors watched sunday as a 
softdrink delivery truck and a school bus carrying federal 
investigators retraced the path of a collision that killed 20 
students 
the national transportation safety board said the tests helped 
determine the speed the bus was traveling thursday on the twolane 
road in southern texas 15 miles from the mexico border 
we feel reasonably comfortable that the speed of the bus was 
somewhere in the range of give or take 30 miles per hour said 
ntsb member lee dickinson 
the speed limit on the road the bus was traveling is 55 mph 
dickinson said tests showed the school bus and the dr pepper 
truck could see each other within a range of 150 feet as they 
approached an intersection 
the truck driver told authorities that his brakes failed and he 
went through a stop sign striking the bus and sending it tumbling 
into the pit 
there were 81 aboard the bus 20 died and 61 survived funerals 
for the last four victims were scheduled for monday the bus 
driver in stable condition and two girls in critical condition 
remained hospitalized sunday 
at the crash site sunday was one of the students who escaped 
from the submerged bus fourteenyearold edna morales who had 
cuts on her neck and face and bandages on her left arm and right 
leg came in hopes it might cure her of the nightmares she has 
experienced since the accident 
miss morales the last student to board the bus told 
investigators she got on the bus about 800 feet from the crash 
site her description of the bus acceleration helped investigators 
arrive at the estimated 30 mph speed 
for about 75 others who gathered to watch the test sundays 
reenactment was yet another occasion to remember the dead students 
from mission high school and mission junior high the tests were 
conducted about the same time as the 725 am accident 
who would think that this would happen in this little town 
said gloria rivera who watched the reenactment while on her way 
to deliver tamales to the family of one of the victims 
adrian escobedo 15 brought a video camera to make a tape of 
the tests escobedo said he was a neighbor and good friend of 
michael and david saens two brothers killed in the wreck and 
buried saturday 
i was going to show it to their mother he said 
another friend of the saens brothers 17yearold veronica 
salinas wept as she recalled michael helping another student with 
algebra the night before the wreck and david being excited about 
playing in his first junior high football game 
fridays classes were canceled as were all weekend school 
activities but the two schools were to reopen monday 
i feel that its going to be very hard for me to go in class 
with their seats empty said 16yearold magdalee salazar a 
mission high school junior who knew four of the victims 
veronica salinas 17 a mission high student who lost two close 
friends in the accident said its hard to think that one moment 
theyre with us and the next moment they are gone returning to 
class she added will be very hard very different 
in conducting the tests sunday morning investigators were among 
42 people who boarded a school bus similar to the one involved in 
the accident they also used a dr pepper tractor pulling the same 
trailer involved in the accident so that the trailers brakes could 
be tested investigators found no evidence of brake failure on the 
trailer 
a previous ntsb inspection indicated no evidence of brake system 
failure on the truck disputing truck driver ruben perezs claim to 
texas department of public safety officers that the brakes had 
failed 
acting on the advice of his attorney perez refused saturday to 
talk with ntsb officials

europes skies are the most crowded in the world 
and a single air traffic control network is needed to replace the 
current patchwork system the editor of an industry yearbook said 
monday 
david rider editor of the authoritative janes airport 
equipment also said the us deregulation of its airline 
industry has saved american passengers 100 billion in the last 11 
years 
rider said 42 air traffic control centers now use 22 different 
systems to communicate with one another in europe in a most 
inefficient and timeconsuming way 
a flight from london to athens for example requires the 
cooperation of seven countries and 50 air traffic controllers using 
telex and telephones and spending a total of 35 manhours to arrange 
the routes and timings he said in the introduction to the latest 
yearbook 
many bottlenecks in northsouth routes stem from the absence of 
a civil radar network in greece he said controllers there rely on 
radio communication with pilots meaning aircraft must stay 60 
miles apart instead of three miles as they do in british airspace 
going east to west is not much better he said an aircraft 
flying about 870 miles between frankfurt to madrid passes through 
the control of seven centers 
by contrast in the united states a flight of roughly the same 
distance chicago to boston passes through only three centers 
he said 
congestion in the air as well as on the ground is a major 
problem in europe and it is now deemed to be the worst in the 
world rider wrote 
a single european system is the obvious solution he said 
but one which seems unpalatable to many countries since if 
implemented correctly it would mean the unified control of both 
civil and military airspace throughout western europe 
in his remarks on american deregulation rider said fares have 
declined by onefifth after inflation is considered because of 
increased competition however he said increased traffic has led 
to delays 
he also said the december bombing of pan am flight 103 over 
lockerbie scotland has caused major reverberations with 
governments aviation authorities airlines and airports worldwide 
the introduction of new systems for controlling personnel and 
baggage has helped reduce risk he said 
a total of 270 people were killed in the bombing of flight 103

dr elizabeth morgan jailed 25 months ago in 
a bitter child custody dispute remains jailed until a ninemember 
appeals panel rules on the request for her freedom her attorney 
said sunday 
attorney adrian roe filed the papers with the district of 
columbia court of appeals on saturday just hours after president 
bush signed a bill designed to free her 
were hopeful the court will act promptly but we have no 
guarantees roe said adding that all the appeals judges would 
have to rule on the request 
morgan has been held in the district of columbia jail since 
august 1987 for failing to produce the girl for courtordered 
visits by her exhusband and the girls father dr eric foretich 
morgan hid the girl after alleging that foretich had sexually 
abused the girl foretich has repeatedly denied those charges and 
at one point offered a 5000 reward to anyone who could provide 
information on their daughters whereabouts 
elaine mittleman foretichs attorney told the associated press 
in a telephone interview it was unlikely that morgan would be freed 
before court opened on monday 
i would think that she wouldnt be freed until we have had 
time to file papers with the court stating our side of the 
argument ms mittleman said 
foretich and ms mittleman have stressed that the bill does not 
require ms morgan to produce the couples 7yearold daughter 
hilary 
foretich said that he wants the federal government to give him 
as much assistance in finding his daughter as it has given his wife 
in her effort to be freed from jail 
i think that someone in our government ought to assist me to 
find my daughter he said and if they would do that id be 
delighted to have elizabeth morgan released from jail but until 
theyre willing to do that i dont see where i have any choice but 
to concern myself with the violation of my rights and those of my 
daughter 
he and ms mittleman have said it was unfair that his exwife 
was getting such extraordinary preferential treatment from congress 
and the president 
presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater said saturday that bush 
signed the bill out of compassion for her plight after members 
of congress also concerned about her case passed legislation that 
enables her to be freed 
the congressional bill will be applied retroactively to morgans 
case 
the child remains hidden at an undisclosed location although 
court officials believe the girl may be with morgans parents in 
england

us vice president dan quayle and japanese prime 
minister toshiki kaifu agreed monday on a new plan for cooperation 
in space science us officials said 
the two nations will work together on a project to measure the 
effects of solar radiation on the earths magnetic field senior 
us officials said on condition of anonymity 
japan will provide a satellite and scientific instruments and 
the united states will provide equipment and launch the satellite 
in 1992 according to a joint statement issued by quayle and kaifu 
the agreement comes under quayles effort to develop a global 
partnership with japan 
quayle will suggest to kaifu and other japanese leaders that 
their two nations work together on a wide range of issues 
including space drugs third world debt and promotion of 
democracy one senior administration official said 
another senior administration official said both nations would 
benefit from space cooperation despite the potential for future 
commercial competition in the area 
the united states is committed to cooperative international 
relations in space the official said 
space is one area in which japan still lags far behind the 
united states and europe in 1989 japan will spend 11 billion on 
its space programs compared with 9 billion spent by the us 
national aeronautics and space administration in 1988 
the japanese government has however targeted the area for high 
priority development 
in june japans science and technology agency announced it 
planned to develop an unmanned space plane in the next decade and 
eventually send its own astronauts into space aboard japanesemade 
spacecraft 
it said the projects fall under a 10year space program that 
also calls for basic research on robots capable of assembling and 
repairing earthorbiting satellites and for developing a rocket 
able to launch commercial satellite payloads 
japans national aerospace laboratory already is participating 
in a 12nation space station program initiated by the united states 
that begins in 1996 
for that project japan is developing a manned space platform 
with artificial pressure and gravity to provide an environment that 
would minimize physical risks 
quayle who arrived in tokyo on thursday from south korea is in 
japan on the second leg of a tour through asia on tuesday he 
leaves for the philippines he also is to visit malaysia before

international conferences have failed to stop 
production of chemical weapons which could be made and used by 
terrorists the editor of an industry yearbook said monday 
verification is one of the main stumbling blocks to any proposed 
ban on chemical weapons because they can be made in commercial 
factories or backroom workshops terry gander said 
gander is editor of the second volume of the authoritative 
yearbook janes nbc nuclear biological and chemical protection 
equipment published monday 
on a small scale it could be possible to produce lethal 
agents in backroom workshops and it would only take a few 
smallscale uses of the resultant chemical weapons to run a 
railroad through any treaty gander said 
as yet none of the numerous terrorist groups that infest the 
modern world have turned their attention to the possible uses of 
chemical warfare but the potential for them to do so has been 
around for a very long time he said it could be stated that 
the actual event of such an attack taking place can only be a 
matter of by whom when and where 
ganders warning was written ahead of the weekend agreement by 
us secretary of state james a baker iii and soviet foreign 
minister eduard a shevardnadze to exchange data on chemical 
weapons and to inspect each others stockpiles and plants 
gander said the 40nation conference on disarmament in geneva 
has progressed toward some form of ban on chemical weapons it but 
keeps stumbling over the verification problem 
the disarmament conference has been debating a global convention 
outlawing the production stockpiling and use of chemical arms 
since 1968 
policing and supervising every peaceful commercial plant which 
could also be used to produce chemical weapons would be a vast and 
almost impossible task even using satellite surveillance gander 
said 
gander also warned that recent advances in genetic and related 
technologies mean that biological warfare is a distinct 
possibility in the very near future 
several major powers have openly renounced all possible use of 
such weapons but the danger still lurks that some nations would be 
only too happy to employ biological weapons to further their own 
ends in some future conflict he said

salvage crews sunday finished removing the 
wreckage of a usair jet from the east river so federal 
investigators can examine the parts to see if mechanical problems 
contributed to the crash 
and queens district attorney john j santuccis office has 
entered the investigation to be on the lookout for violations of 
local laws said santucci spokesman richard piperno 
a grand jury may be asked to investigate possible criminal 
wrongdoing related to last weeks crash of the boeing 737400 at 
the end of a laguardia airport runway that killed two passengers 
according to a source in the queens district attorneys office 
the source who spoke on condition of anonymity said possible 
charges included criminally negligent homicide and leaving the 
scene of an accident 
the pilots licenses of the flights captain and copilot were 
suspended because they left the accident scene the two also were 
criticized by federal officials for failing to submit immediately 
to drug and alcohol testing although they are not legally required 
to do so 
a lawyer for the captain michael w martin and copilot 
constantine kleissas said sunday that he saw no basis for a 
grand jury 
based on everything i know there is absolutely no criminal 
act committed by either pilot and no wrongdoing by either of 
them said frederick hafetz 
he declined to comment on whether his clients would cooperate 
with a grand jury should they be called to testify 
he said they have been fully cooperative with the regulatory 
authorities but added that neither would make a public statement 
in the near future 
although two people died late wednesday on flight 5050 headed 
for charlotte nc 59 other passengers and crew members were 
rescued from the east river and from the partially submerged 
wreckage 
national transportation safety board spokesman ted lopatkiewicz 
said crews had the front and tail sections of the plane out of the 
water sunday afternoon the main fuselage section was removed 
later the operation had been hampered by bad weather 
the pieces were being trucked to an american airlines hangar at 
laguardia airport where investigators were waiting to examine 
them he said 
james kolstad the ntsbs acting chairman said at a news 
conference saturday that although the copilot inadvertently pushed 
a button shutting off an automatic throttle it was not known if 
that was a factor in the planes aborted takeoff and crash 
among other factors under investigation is the planes 
unexplained veer to the left during its takeoff kolstad said 
investigators found skid marks on the runway from the planes three 
sets of wheels he said 
lopatkiewicz said the jets nose gear was recovered sunday and 
were going to be looking at those tires very carefully 
another critical question was whether the plane had reached a 
speed known as v1 the velocity based on a complicated 
calculation involving numerous variables at which the takeoff may 
no longer be safely aborted 
kleissas 29 who had flown a 737400 only once before on a 
regular passenger flight was at the controls but martin manually 
took over the throttle when kleissas pushed the button that turned 
off the automatic throttle 
martin 36 told investigators that he decided to abort the 
takeoff after manually accelerating the jet because it began 
drifting to the left and he felt and heard an unusual vibration 
he believed he had enough room to stop the plane but it instead 
skidded off the runway landing partially in the water and 
partially atop a line of pilings cracking the fuselage into three 
sections 
martin and kleissas submitted friday to urinalysis but results 
will not be available for three weeks kolstad said 
on saturday they also gave urine samples to investigators from 
the district attorneys office after they were told that a warrant 
was being prepared 
piperno said that martin didnt want anybody to see his face 
and had a blanket wrapped around his head when he met local 
investigators at jamaica hospital

secretary of state james a baker iii 
said sunday that the success of his meeting with the soviet foreign 
minister should silence congressional critics and dampen their 
appetite for unilateral arms cuts 
despite progress on talks to cut strategic conventional and 
chemical weapons baker said the soviet union was still a 
military threat 
i think it would quite naive for the united states to talk 
about unilateral reductions of its strategic arsenal baker said 
on the cbstv program face the nation 
the bush administration he said remains committed to the 
strategic defense initiative and deploying new classes of 
longrange bombers and mobile missiles 
bakers fourday session with soviet foreign minister eduard a 
shevardnadze yielded an agreement to hold a summit in the united 
states next spring or summer 
it will be the first meeting between president bush and soviet 
leader mikhail s gorbachev since bush took office although the 
two met in new york betweens bushs election and his inauguration 
baker will meet twice with shevardnadze to plan the summit a 
senior us official said sunday night as baker flew to new york to 
attend the un general assembly the first session will be in the 
soviet union in november or decemeber said the offical who spoke 
on the condition of anonymity 
he said if the two sides are unable to conclude a strategic 
weapons reduction treaty by the time bush and gorbachev meet 
certainly a summit will move it forward or should 
in the course of the bakershevardnadze talks the soviets also 
said they would withdraw a demand that the united states agree to 
curb work on star wars before conclusion of a strategic arms 
reduction treaty start 
baker told a news conference saturday the soviet decision could 
speed conclusion of start which would cut longrange strategic 
arms by 30to50 percent 
taking on domestic critics sunday baker said there was a lot 
of criticisms in advance of this ministerial meeting that i hope 
is absolutely gone now because we have made some really fundamental 
progress 
the most influential critic senator majority leader george 
mitchell tempered his remarks somewhat on another interview 
program but did not recant 
the events of the last 24 hours are certainly positive but 
i still think there are a number of steps that should be taken 
should have been taken previously the maine democrat said on 
abcs this week with david brinkley 
he specifically mentioned the democratic call for more financial 
aid to poland and expanded trade with the soviet union as areas 
needing more attention 
baker and shevardnadze went fishing sunday morning in the snake 
river in the rocky mountains before flying separately to new york 
for a united nations meeting baker caught three trout but 
shevardnadze caught nothing 
their mood appeared warm and friendly as it has been since they 
arrived in this beautiful mountain resort thursday night 
despite progress in talks across a broad range of issues and 
the signing of six accords on saturday baker said the soviet union 
remained a threat 
the military threat is not diminished if you look at it just 
in terms of military to military baker said 
he complained that while the soviet union has two classes of 
mobile missiles the ss24 and the ss25 the united states has yet 
to deploy two it has under development the railmobile mx and the 
midgetman 
we have them on the drawing board and we still dont have 
congressional approval even to move forward he said 
mitchell was asked whether the united states can afford a mobile 
missile system 
yes we can if we act prudently in other areas the senate 
leader said the important objective should not be a particular 
type of weapon or defense system but rather what enhances 
strategic stability what reduces the threat of nuclear war single 
warhead mobile missiles do that 
baker also urged congress to approve bushs full budget request 
for star wars development 
we still are every bit as committed to the strategic defense 
initiative as we were before he said of course if the 
congress says you cant move forward then we will be 
constrained from moving forward and yes they are making a heavy 
run at the budget of sdi much against the wishes of the bush 
administration 
baker also disputed claims by some critics that the 
administration does not really want a strategic arms reduction 
treaty 
we want a start agreement he insisted weve said that 
from the beginning of this administration but we dont want a bad 
one we dont want one we cant get ratified 
that was a reference to a 1979 treaty signed by us and soviet 
leaders but never ratified by the senate 
baker had said saturday he could not predict whether start would 
be ready before next years summit but did not rule out such a 
development 
in an obviously coordinated display the administrations top 
three foreign policy officials appeared on television talk shows 
national security adviser brent scowcroft questioned on nbcs 
meet the press said the particular time set for the summit 
meant there was a presumption of an agreement or major progress 
toward one by then 
who yielded most in the wyoming talks i think it is clearly 
the soviet union that has changed its position said scowcroft 
but he said there are still details to be negotiated on the 
soviets expressed willingness to sign a start treaty without us 
concessions on star wars 
all weve got is the statement of delinkage he said 
those issues are still opened but they will not have to be 
required to be resolved before a start treaty 
defense secretary dick cheney on the abc show said it would 
appear that on the one hand they the soviets are saying they 
would be prepared to go forward and complete a start agreement even 
if there was no limitation or agreement with respect to the space 
defense talks on the other hand they are still trying to tie 
it in to their interpretation of the abm treaty and so i think it 
would be fair to say weve made some progress here but we havent 
finally resolved these issues

two legislators said sunday that almost a third 
of the arabs killed by troops in the last six months of the 
palestinian uprising were children under age 16 and they demanded 
a government inquiry 
also sunday underground palestinian factions criticized an 
egyptian peace proposal but remained as divided over whether to 
accept the 10point plan 
meanwhile an israeli cabinet minister suggested that israelis 
decide in a referendum on the egyptian peace plan which has deeply 
divided the coalition government 
in a letter sent to defense minister yitzhak rabin and justice 
minister dan meridor the two legislators said 17 palestinians aged 
12 or less were shot to death and 31 youths between the ages of 12 
and 16 were killed since april 
the letter said the 48 children represented onethird of all 
palestinians killed over that period by soldiers 
on sunday troops shot and killed bassam farouk eljabri 18 
when they opened fire on stonethrowers in the gaza strip town of 
khan yunis hospital officials said an army spokesman said the 
military was investigating 
the death raised to 574 the number of palestinians killed by 
soldiers or israeli civilians during the 21month uprising against 
the israeli occupation of the west bank and gaza strip forty 
israelis also have been slain 
also sunday soldiers shot and wounded 10 palestinians in 
stonethrowing clashes in the occupied lands arab hospital 
officials said 
the legislators yossi sarid and dedi zucker of the leftwing 
citizens rights movement demanded that rabin and meridor 
investigate whether the killings are the result of new regulations 
on firing weapons 
in the last few weeks rabin liberalized the armys firing 
orders giving troops permission to shoot unarmed masked youth if 
necessary to stop them the youth are often members of underground 
forces who kill suspected collaborators or enforce strikes 
also in gaza palestinian assailants axed to death two men in 
southern rafah one as an alleged drug dealer and the other as a 
suspected collaborator with israel arab reporters said 
the army confirmed the deaths of majid mahmud el nawaji 30 and 
adel abu shaluf who arab reporters said was 38 
the deaths raised to 119 the number of palestinians killed by 
fellow arabs in connection with the uprising most have been slain 
for allegedly cooperating with israel but some were killed by 
moslem fundamentalist groups as suspected drug dealers or 
prostitutes 
the proplo unified national leadership of the uprising 
criticized the egyptian president hosni mubaraks plan in a leaflet 
distributed in the occupied territories israel television and 
radio reported 
the leaflet did not reject the proposal but it said the plan 
could not be accepted until it included provisions for direct 
participation of the palestine liberation organization in talks and 
the establishment of an independent palestinian state 
a separate leaflet signed by the marxist popular front for the 
liberation of palestine rejected the plan and called mubarak an 
agent of washington and tel aviv 
the mubarak plan advocates trading land for peace and calls for 
a preparatory meeting between israeli and palestinian delegations 
in cairo as a prelude to negotiations 
egyptian ambassador mohammed bassiouny told a meeting of israeli 
peace activists in tel aviv on sunday that the plan had plo backing 
egypt will not agree to anything the plo refuses so we always 
coordinate with the plo bassiouny said on israel radio 
interior minister arye deri said israel should hold a referendum 
to answer the question do we want peace or not 
he told army radio such a vote would be a better idea than a 
collapse of the coalition government of the likud bloc and labor 
party 
i think that people understand that war or conflict cannot 
persist forever he said 
prime minister yitzhak shamirs rightwing likud bloc has 
rejected the plan while the leftleaning labor party sees the plan 
as a way of bridging israeli and palestinian positions 
deris ultraorthodox shas party has six representatives in the 
120member parliament and helps hold the balance of power between 
the left and right

survivors of president bushs world 
war ii navy squadron plan a reunion they hope will feature their 
most famous flyboy 
bushs fellow veterans from torpedo squadron vt51 who remember 
him as a quiet 20yearold pilot said theyd like him to join 
their effort to reunite the group here next march 
just for old times sake said leo nadeau bushs gunner 
the majority of us havent seen each other in 45 years but the 
memories still linger on 
bush did his torpedo bomber training at the fort lauderdale 
naval air base for three months in 1943 and recently wrote a 
handful of words for a magazine about that experience 
i went off to fort lauderdale to learn to fly bush wrote in 
the september issue of life magazine training up and down the 
east coast dropping dummy bombs and torpedoes i had an 
ensigns stripe and an admirals confidence i was a navy pilot 
some believe the president will show up at the reunion which is 
being held in conjunction with an air show especially if they are 
here to greet him 
obviously i cant any more speak for the president than the 
man on the moon but it sounds like something hed attend said 
legare hole who flew with bush 
as a pilot you could always depend on george said jack 
guy who flew with bush for two years he butchart and a dozen 
others from the squadron were invited to the presidents 
inauguration last year 
today i think the bond between george and his crewmen and his 
fellow combat pilots is very very strong guy said in fact the 
president often sends them notes he said 
don rhodes a white house aide said bush may be drawn to the 
reunion because the comrades who flew grumman avenger bombers with 
him will be there 
he enjoyed meeting those guys at the blair house at the 
inauguration rhodes said 
but he said there just are not enough hours in the day and 
he has to say no 999 percent of the time

albert a marks jr who brought the 
miss america pageant to television fired host bert parks and 
dethroned vanessa williams over nude photos died sunday he was 76 
marks died at shore memorial hospital in somers point from 
complications after a sept 11 heart attack hospital spokesman 
bill elliott said 
marks was identified so much with the pageant that he often was 
referred to as mr miss america 
just the day before suffering the heart attack at his margate 
home he went to the atlantic city convention center to greet 
contestants and pageant staff and pose for photographs 
while members of the pageant family knew him as a friend and 
devout family man marks ran the national contest with an iron 
will he had final say on musical compositions television 
production plans sponsorship contracts and choice of judges 
lawyer leonard horn who became the pageants first fulltime 
paid director in 1987 after marks retired from the job he had held 
as a volunteer for 35 years remembered marks as a strong leader 
he had a capacity for making quick decisions and never looking 
back said horn 
an investment broker by trade marks joined the miss america 
pageant as an unpaid volunteer in 1952 marks went on to become the 
pageants director and for 25 years its chairman he brought the 
show to television in 1954 
he defended the pageant when it faced criticisms from feminists 
the national association for the advancement of colored people 
labor organizations and those who consider miss america an outdated 
symbol 
marks in the late 1960s suggested that the swimsuit contest be 
scuttled and that contestants wear sports clothes instead he said 
he dropped his proposal because of a clamor from state pageant 
committees who did not like abandoning tradition 
in january 1980 marks decided not to renew the contract of bert 
parks who had been host since 1955 the firing brought 
considerable criticism including several nights of ridicule on the 
air from talkshow host johnny carson 
in 1982 he dropped the shows famous theme there she is 
in a dispute with author bernie wayne he allowed the songs return 
in 1985 
miss williams the first black to wear the rhinestonestudded 
crown also became the first to be forced into giving it up when 
marks dismissed her in 1984 after nude photographs of her taken 
before her reign were published in a mens magazine 
amid the controversies marks senior vice president of the 
investment banking firm advest group inc and past president of 
the atlantic city chamber of commerce racked up 11 man of the 
year titles from civic organizations 
gary collins who cohosted this years show said the pageant 
owes a great debt to marks 
he was the reason that the pageant is still alive and 
flourishing collins said in a telephone interview from 
mississippi he kept the ideals of the pageant uppermost in his 
mind 
collins wife miss america 1959 mary ann mobley said marks 
weathered all the controversy that came up and the miss america 
pageant got stronger thats the mark of the man

a reformist bloc in the soviet parliament adopted 
a platform sunday that calls for allowing ownership of private 
property prices set by market conditions and television free of 
government control 
the first platform of the 345 reformminded deputies from the 
soviet parliament will be put beforethe 542member supreme soviet 
which convenes a new legislative session on monday 
the reformist bloc members of the 2250member parliament 
also have drafted a bill that they say could lead to the formation 
of noncommunist political parties 
the platform places emphasis on new laws to guarantee human 
rights it includes the freedom to publish to strike and to move 
soviets currently must carry internal passports and obtain 
permission to move into desired urban areas such as moscow and the 
government still denies external passports to many citizens 
sergei stankevich a leader of the reformist bloc called the 
interregional group said he and others have written a bill 
already approved by a subcommittee that would guarantee the right 
to form organizations he said people could use this legal 
protection to form noncommunist political parties 
stankevich warned that the proposal would face a sharp 
discussion rather than sail easily through the legislature 
elements of the bill also are included in the groups platform 
which was adopted overwhelmingly on sunday 
i dont think it will change our political conditions 
immediately or drastically he said 
the platform of the reform coalition which includes populist 
boris yeltsin and human rights activist andrei sakharov also calls 
for eliminating a provision in the soviet constitution that defines 
the communist party as the leading force in society 
the group suggests substituting a phrase defining the 
soviets elected bodies from the level of city council to 
national parliament as the only source of political power 
the supreme soviet or legislature on monday opens its second 
session since the nations first multicandidate elections were 
held last spring in the opening session deputies held the 
nations first confirmation hearings on cabinetlevel jobs and 
forced the withdrawal of a number of candidates 
however deputies are only now organizing sufficiently to offer 
their own bills to compete with those proposed by the kremlin 
president mikhail s gorbachev is to open the session with a 
speech topping the enormous agenda of 80 reform bills is a package 
aimed at easing the disastrous economic situation which has 
stripped store shelves nearly bare and left much of the nation 
relying on ration coupons for key food items 
the government plan calls for slashing the budget deficit from 
120 billion rubles 186 billion to 60 billion rubles 93 
billion and the leasing of many factories and much farmland to 
individuals and groups 
the interregional group is calling for legalization of private 
property and the introduction of market pricing gorbachevs 
advisers also have promoted letting supply and demand set prices 
but in the face of strong public objection to lifting government 
subsidies the government has promised to delay the proposal for 
several years 
the opposition group proposed that the vast industrial 
ministries which now control the supplies and decisions of most 
factories in the country should be replaced with small commissions 
of experts in the field 
the group also called for an end to the government monopoly on 
television a call reminiscent of last weeks decision of the new 
government in poland to take control of its government television 
away from the communist party 
several members of the interregional group said their platform 
included only a fraction of the critical reforms needed but 
historian yuri afansiev argued that they were adopting only their 
first working paper setting the groups general orientation he 
said it would be refined and expanded later

the debut edition of the st louis sun the 
nations newest newspaper began rolling off the presses on time 
sunday night with a front page featuring a bright sun rising over 
the gateway arch 
there was a lastminute rush to finish the final few pages but 
editors made their 9 pm deadline and the printing presses began 
about a half hour later a sun spokesman said 
editorinchief ralph ingersoll ii said the newspaper contained 
four significant exclusive stories including two copyrighted 
stories the media was barred from the newspapers printing plant 
the suns deadline more than three hours earlier than usual 
was required to print 200000 newspapers to meet the expected heavy 
demand from the curious and people looking to pick up collectors 
item 
well be able to sell every paper guaranteed said robert 
jelenic president of the st louis sun publishing co 
the newspaper industry has been closely watching the launch of 
the sun which is owned by the new jerseybased ingersoll 
publications co and is trying to buck the trend of newspapers 
merging or shutting down 
this newspaper will be successful if its relevant thats our 
no 1 priority said ingersoll who is also chairman and chief 
executive officer of ingersoll publications 
ingersoll and other sun officials plan to hawk newspapers on 
the street in front of the suns downtown offices monday morning to 
herald the newspapers debut 
the tabloid newspaper which sun officials are calling a 
laptop paper already has been wellreceived in the st louis 
area having attracted nearly twice as many subscribers as 
expected sun executives said sunday 
about 55000 copies of the newspaper were to have been delivered 
to charter subscribers early monday morning although that number 
could have been higher said sun publisher thomas tallarico 
we had to stop promising firstday delivery because we 
couldnt process the deluge of orders in time tallarico said 
people will still get vol i issue i they may just have to wait 
till tuesday 
tallarico said officials had originally hoped to have a 
circulation of 30000 by the end of its first month of publication 
the mood in the newsroom seemed remarkably subdued as editors 
and reporters 20 of whom have been borrowed from other ingersoll 
newspapers completed the finishing touches of the debut issue 
sunday 
i really do feel like were making history but we have to be 
cautious not to blow all our energy in one day said bill 
theobald assistant metro editor because we have to do this all 
over again tomorrow and again and again and again 
much of the newspaper had been preplanned and prepackaged 
leaving only sports and a few news stories until sunday evening 
said managing editor peter osullivan 
in many ways i think the pressure will be greater tomorrow 
because weve been working toward this issue for months tomorrow 
well only have one day just like its supposed to be 
osullivan said 
the new paper will compete with the st louis postdispatch 
which also publishes in the morning and will be 111 years old in 
december the postdispatch has been the only daily newspaper in 
st louis since the st louis globedemocrat folded in october 1986 
the postdispatch now has a daily circulation of about 380000 
and a sunday circulation of about 565000 said publisher nicholas

opec ministers debating whether they can pump more 
oil without dragging down prices failed to agree sunday on how to 
reach their goals a top official said 
subroto secretary general of the 13nation organization of 
petroleum exporting countries said the officials would meet 
privately before resuming a third round of formal talks monday 
evening 
we are still deliberating about the best way to achieve our 
goal he said at a press conference at the geneva hotel where 
meetings were held sunday 
the ministers are thrashing out whether they can raise their 
current production ceiling of 195 million barrels a day in the 
final quarter of the year without weakening crude prices 
led by kuwait and the united arab emirates they have been 
pumping about 22 million barrels a day well over their official 
cap 
prices have been steady in recent months but they are still 
about 1 under the cartels target of 18 a barrel 
iraqi oil minister issam alchalabi said there were two or three 
proposals on the ministers bargaining table he declined to 
elaborate 
it seems that the ceiling is the imminent problem he told 
reporters after the meeting 
he said he favored an increase in the ceiling with the extra 
amount shared proportionately among all 13 members each would get 
a certain amount added to its individual supply quota 
however chalabi suggested the ministers would defer until 
november any resolution of the sticky issue of fairly disbributing 
production shares 
kuwait and the united arab emirates want bigger slices of the 
output pie to press their demands they have been producing as 
much as double their quotas of about 1 million barrels each 
in june some ministers indicated they would try to settle the 
quota issue at this meeting but it seemed sunday that members were 
now less willing to do so 
going into the weekend meetings the ministers were divided over 
what to do in the fourth quarter of the year 
some worry that lifting their production ceiling even a little 
could cause prices to fall 
others are convinced demand is strong enough to absorb a 
substantial boost in output 
iranian oil minister gholamreza aqazadeh whose country needs 
petroleum revenue for reconstruction after its eightyear war with 
iraq said this situation is good its not very bad he 
apparently was referring to crude prices which have held fairly 
steady in recent months 
however some blame the gap between current prices and the 
target on kuwait and the united arab emirates pumping above their 
limits 
one faction argues the cheating has deprived their countries of 
additional oil revenues a rise in the ceiling to the actual daily 
production of about 22 million barrels would cut into the 
overproducers volume and let all benefit from more sales they say 
the easiest option would be to roll over their current supply 
cap of 195 million barrels a day for the rest of the year but 
that some say would be tantamount to approving the cheating 
algerias sadek boussena libyas fawzi shakshuki and others 
have expressed concern prices are not stronger they would like to 
keep the current ceiling iraqs issam abdul raheem alchalabi has 
said he would like increased production as kuwait and the united 
arab emirates reportedly do 
subroto has predicted demand for the cartels oil will reach 22 
million barrels a day in the octoberdecember period 
there is no indication how long the current meeting will last

the world bank may have been overoptimistic 
about its plan to insure private investors in the third world 
against war and violence bank president barber conable said sunday 
the world bank launched the multilateral investment guarantee 
agency or miga over a year ago but it has yet to issue its first 
policy 
all of us hoped that these activities would have translated 
into a few guarantee operations by the end of this fiscal year 
barber told a meeting called to explain its operations 
we have learned the truth of the old spanish proverb 
traveller there is no path the path is made by walking we have 
been optimistic overoptimistic perhaps and must face the fact 
that negotiations with private investors must move slowly 
approvals of bilateral arrangements by member governments require 
considerable time and effort particularly for such a new venture 
he said 53 of the banks 152 governments have become members of 
the new agency 
some governments dislike letting an outside organization decide 
when events within the country have damaged a foreign investor 
since their own courts would not have the last word in disputed 
cases 
the overseas private investment corporation which insures 
american investors has run into the same problem opic was working 
in 72 countries last year however and made a record 1353 
million on its operations one of the few us government agencies 
to turn a profit 
it has been hoped that some governments reluctant to let an 
agency from another government do the job will tolerate the new 
one because it is international 
investors who want to put about 375 million into 11 third world 
countries have asked for guarantees the new agency announced 
earlier this month they came from canada denmark west germany 
italy kuwait saudi arabia sweden switzerland britain and the 
united states 
a spokesman who insisted on anonymity said the first policy 
was due to be issued in the next few months 
new investment in third world countries dropped to 13 billion 
from 25 billion between 1982 and 1987 the last year for which 
figures are available that meant fewer new jobs less production 
smaller exports and more pressure for new grants and loans from 
richer countries 
all around the globe nations that once perceived the private 
sector as marginal threatening irrelevant or all of the above 
are giving their own entrepreneurs and partners from abroad new 
latitude and encouragement conable said 
he noted that business people dislike going where they are not 
welcome 
migas protection against noncommercial risks will often be 
the key that opens the door to foreign direct investment in 
developing countries he said

francois michelin whose company agreed friday to 
acquire the ohiobased uniroyal goodrich tire co has proven to be 
as durable the radial tire his company introduced 43 years ago 
for decades michelin has adhered to a style of management 
marked by secrecy thrift and an aversion to outside interference 
such as that by government and unions 
the company believes in technology and invests about 5 percent 
of profits in research and development in 1946 it introduced the 
radial tire and virtually transformed the industry drivers around 
the world now buy radials for their superior handling qualities and 
durablity 
the company remains committed to only two activities making 
tires and producing guidebooks and maps for drivers who ride on 
them 
you will always need a spring between your bottom and the 
road and air will always be the cheapest spring he told the 
financial times in one of his very rare interviews 
the secretive mans company assembles its own production 
machines rather than let another firm see what equipment it is 
using 
it takes our engineers 10 years to put out a new tire or 
develop a new machine michelin 63 has said but five minutes 
is enough to understand the process and thus copy it and put our 
employees out of work 
but the more than 20000 michelin employees who lost their jobs 
in the mid1980s did not have corporate espionage to blame rather 
the company was forced to scale back by a general recession in the 
tire industry 
the downturn could not have come at a worse time for michelin 
one of the few big french enterprises to keep its headquarters in 
the province where it was born 
after capturing the lions share of the european tire market 
the clermontferrandbased company decided in the 1970s to put 
america on radials it built five plants and a large test center 
in the united states from 1978 and 1982 spending more than 3 
billion it also expanded operations into canada and brazil 
the fast expansion followed by the sudden recession was further 
complicated by a rise in interest rates and the dollar michelin 
had borrowed heavily to finance the us growth 
but after several years of struggle michelin watched profits 
soar in the first six months of 1989 to the equivalent of about 
250 million up 281 percent from the first half of 1988 
on friday michelin offered to pay 690 million for uniroyal and 
assume 810 million in debt officials of the akron ohiobased 
company said 
the deal if approved will allow michelin to overtake goodyear 
as the worlds largest tire maker 
tall and slim with a piercing look francois michelin is called 
le patron or the boss by his staff while the company founded 
by his father is called simply la maison or the house 
he is known for being suspicious of luxury he dresses in worn 
suits travels in economy class and when in paris on business 
takes the subway 
trained in mathematics his interests reportedly lean toward the 
metaphysical and his politics to the conservative 
it is michelins opinion that every french government since 1936 
has conducted a socialistic policy by promoting wealth 
redistribution he has said the government has deprived people 
of the responsiblity of their own fate

desert gas prospectors in the remote 
northern oman hinterland have finally gained access to a promising 
mountain area first noticed by legendary explorer wilfred thesiger 
50 years ago oil industry sources said sunday 
they said petroleum development oman drillers next week will 
attempt to establish a well on the summit of the 1300foot jebel 
madmar near the oasis town of adam ancestral home of the al 
busaid tribe from which sultan qaboos ruler of oman is descended 
one of the largest undrilled prospects left in oman jebel 
madmar is described by muscatbased geologists as a classic 
hydrocarbontrapping anticline and a promising discovery 
thesiger the first european to penetrate the oman desert and 
live with its nomadic tribesmen wrote about jebel madmar and the 
neighbouring jebel salakh in his book arabian sands he 
described the mountains as domeshaped formations regretfully 
associated with hydrocarbons by geologists 
it took 50 years to follow up on his observation because the 
prospect was virtually inaccessible and required modern road 
construction technology said the sources who spoke on condition 
they not be named 
the cost of building the access road to the drilling location 
has not been disclosed but was equivalent to the cost of drilling 
an ordinary well they said 
until now petroleum development oman has been concentrating on 
targets beneath the desert thaet offer easier access for seismic 
crews and rigs 
a statefinanced natural gas exploration program was launched in 
oman five years ago in a bid to save fuel oil 
reserves were estimated at 7 trillion cubic meters at the 
beginning of 1988 the latest year for which figures are available 
about 15 million was being invested in gas development projects 
this year according to a government spokesman

iran exported an average of 2 million 
barrels of oil a day during recent months oil minister gholamreza 
aqazadeh has said 
the islamic republic news agency quoted him as saying that 90 
percent of the oil was sold for cash rather than bartered for 
goods a development he called unprecedented since the 1979 
revolution 
the agency monitored in cyprus quoted aqazadeh as giving the 
export figure saturday but it did not specify exactly how many 
months he was referring to 
iran has an output quota of 278 million barrels a day set by 
the organization of petroleum exporting countries 
irans oil output during the eightyear gulf war with iraq 
plunged below 1 million barrels a day at times both belligerents 
targeted each others oil industries in an effort to cut their 
economic lifelines 
the iranian oil minister also said the wardevastated abadan 
refinery on the gulf coast had been rebuilt at a cost of 40 
million and its capacity has reached 130000 barrels a day 
aqazadeh was quoted as saying imports of refined gasoline have 
stopped because domestic refineries had been rebuilt and the 
government was considering lifting gasoline rationing 
in addition to the recent ending of gasoline imports only a 
portion of the countrys needs in kerosene and gas oil were being 
imported aqazadeh said 
iran will stop importing these two items after the arak and 
bandar abbas refineries are put back into operation he was quoted 
as saying

gasoline prices rose nearly a third of a 
penny over the past two weeks as retailers found they no longer 
could absorb prices increases from wholesalers a survey found 
the overall national price of a gallon of gasoline including 
all grades of the fuel along with state and local taxes rose 031 
cents to 10943 cents a gallon for the week ended sept 22 
according to the lundberg survey 
trilby lundberg director of the biweekly price poll of about 
12000 service stations nationwide said a competitive 
endofsummer market forced retailers to hold prices down even 
though wholesalers were making increases 
now the wholesale rises have been great enough so that now 
retailers have been turning up their prices on average she 
said she forecast the trend would continue into the fall but 
its difficult to do during a time of decreased demand 
average nationwide prices per gallon at selfservice gasoline 
pumps which account for more than 80 percent of all sales were at 
9825 cents for regular unleaded 11531 for premium unleaded and 
9722 cents for regular leaded according to the survey 
at fullserve stations the average prices were 12721 for 
regular unleaded 13967 for premium unleaded and 12619 for

issue of a magazine to only one sponsor gives the sponsor a better 
chance at getting its sales message across to readers they say it 
eliminates the advertising clutter that can arise in 
multisponsored magazines 
but it is expensive to command the singlesponsor exclusivity 
and media critics say that singlesponsorship can prompt some 
readers to raise questions about editorial independence 
brian brown a time spokesman said times editors conceived the 
idea for the issue as a way to mark the 150th anniversary of the 
birth of photography 
he said after the magazine decided to proceed with the issue it 
approached kodak to see if that company wanted to be the sole 
sponsor he said kodak had no role in shaping the issues editorial 
content 
neither time nor kodak officials would disclose how much kodak 
was paying other than to stay it was a multimilliondollar package 
kodak gets 20 pages of advertising in the 80page issue which 
will feature scores of what time says are the most important news 
photos ever printed 
daniel matthaides a spokesman for rochester nybased kodak 
said his company wanted to do something to mark the anniversary 
and felt that the time issue would be popular with readers and that 
the sole sponsorship would assert kodaks leadership in the 
photography field 
the timing of the issue was also important he said because the 
last three months of the year are normally a big sales season for 
photographic products
