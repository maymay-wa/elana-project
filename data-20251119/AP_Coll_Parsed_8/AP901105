sen bob dole said monday that he and 
other key congressional leaders have been given special mobile 
telephones so the white house can keep them informed of 
developments in the persian gulf 
dole the kansas republican and senate minority leader said he 
and at least four other lawmakers have had the phones for about a 
week 
the others he said are democratic sen george mitchell of 
maine the senate majority leader house speaker thomas foley 
dwashington and house leaders reps robert michel rillinois 
and richard gephardt dmissouri 
dole said the phones have been specially adapted to prevent 
anyone from listening in 
dole mentioned the phones while making a campaign appearance for 
fellow republican dick nichols who is running for congress in 
tuesdays election he said he carries the phone with him at all 
times and said it allows him immediate consultation with bush or 
other white house officials 
the phones show bush is making a sincere effort to consult 
congress on the middle east crisis he said 
the only time he would not consult congress is if a mission or 
american lives are threatened dole said in that case 
consulting with the congressional leadership can wait 
dole said he hopes he doesnt get a phone call because that 
would mean an escalation of the crisis in the middle east

nasa expects to send space shuttle 
atlantis into orbit with a spy satellite next week 
forrest mccartney director of kennedy space center said monday 
the best guess is atlantis will lift off on its secret military 
mission around nov 16 
liftoff had been scheduled for nov 9 but was delayed because of 
undisclosed problems with the satellite which reportedly will spy 
on iraq 
the shuttle actually was supposed to have gone up on a 10day 
mission in july but was grounded all summer by hydrogen leaks 
nasa still plans to launch columbia in early december even 
though the agency likes to have at least three weeks between 
flights mccartney said 
work will be speeded up so columbias flight can be completed by 
christmas saving the agency on holiday pay and allowing it to shut 
down certain operations at kennedy space center for maintenance 
mccartney said 
but we will not cut down on the normal inspections and data 
that we look at he said 
columbia will carry the 150 million astro observatory aloft 
during its mission the shuttle like atlantis was grounded since 
the summer by hydrogen leaks both shuttles were cleared for flight 
after fueling tests last month 
mccartney meanwhile denied on monday that employee drug use is 
responsible for a series of accidents this year involving shuttle 
equipment 
a bag containing about a gram of cocaine was discovered under a 
desk in a shuttle hangar on friday nasa is investigating the 
incident 
in analyzing the accidents we have not found a common thread 
that would cause you to think drugs are to blame mccartney said 
the latest accident involved a 9foot beam that was left to 
rattle around inside atlantis last month causing minor damage in 
addition some of columbias hydrogen leaks were attributed to 
improperly installed seals 
i think you would like to be sure that all of the folks that 
are doing any work on any flight hardware are in full command of 
themselves so it does concern me mccartney said but he added 
it would be naive to think that with as many thousands of people 
that we have here no one uses drugs

along with reading writing and 
rithmetic theres a new graduation requirement for incoming 
freshmen at this citys two high schools this fall community 
service 
the supporters of the requirement in the bethlehem area school 
district say it will teach the basic american value of helping 
others opponents who are taking it to court call it involuntary 
servitude that forces ideals on students contrary to those of their 
parents 
community service is a clear national priority that has been 
voiced since president kennedys inaugural address said andrew 
faust the school boards attorney its wrapped up in what we 
think of ourselves as a nation 
thomas moralis whose son david is a student is trying to block 
the program 
i dont want my son being told what to do moralis said i 
went to school in a free america and i want the same for my 
children 
the suit which isnt expected to go to trial before the middle 
of next year contends the student service program violates the 
13th amendment to the constitution which bans involuntary 
servitude it also says the program violates the 1st and 14th 
amendments by interfering with parental rights 
beyond the involuntary servitude the parents object to the 
philosophical underpinnings said robert magee attorney for the 
moralis family and another family its forcefeeding a certain 
set of values about altruism on children 
the school board voted in april to adopt the program a concept 
that has existed for years involuntary form in some schools across 
the country and is now being pushed by legislation approved by 
congress 
i think its a contradiction of terms said michelle 
bennett a student at liberty high school you shouldnt have to 
volunteer but its a good idea to have it as an elective i like 
volunteerism because ive done it but it doesnt make much sense 
to make it a requirement because uninterested kids wont do as good 
a job 
but another student gilberto quinones jr disagreed 
itll give the kids more selfesteem and teach them values in 
the work theyre doing he said it will teach them how to act 
maturely and they can learn and see if they like the work 
the bethlehem district based its program which requires 60 
hours of community service on one in atlanta three other 
pennsylvania districts have mandatory student service programs and 
30 have voluntary programs according to dr joseph bard of the 
state education department 
other states moving ahead with student service programs some 
mandatory and some voluntary are maryland washington california 
and minnesota said john brisco director of the states pennserve 
program which encourages volunteerism and sponsors grants to 
school districts that promote community service to keep students 
from dropping out 
im excited about this it seems to work brisco said it 
helps kids understand why school is relevant to life and it helps 
some of them find an area in which they can be successful 
for too many kids school is a setting where they experience 
failure if you put them in a setting where they tutor kids or help 
old folks they become successful once youre successful in one 
phase of your life you start doing better at other things like 
math and english its a contagion of success 
nationally an early voice for bringing community service into 
the schools was ernest l boyer president of the carnegie 
foundation for the advancement of teaching the foundation 
recommended in its 1983 report high school that service in the 
community or school be required by every student 
young people should be given opportunities to reach behond 
themselves and feel more responsibly engaged boyer testified in 
march 1989 before the senate labor and human resources committee 
they should participate in the communities of which they are a 
part 
before its recess congress passed a 287 million national 
service bill to promote voluntary community service both for 
youths and their elders 
the call to service should come early and it should be a 
vital part of education for citizenship in every school system in 
the nation said sen edward m kennedy dmass a sponsor of 
the senate bill 
the bethlehem school board has issued a list of 95 local 
agencies where students can fulfill the requirement including aids 
outreach the ymca the special olympics the girl scouts the 
easter seal society meals on wheels the local public television 
station and a host of museums hospitals and nursing homes 
also on the list is the school district itself which wants 
volunteers to read to kindergarten children 
the program applies only to the 900 members of the entering 
freshman classes at the citys two high schools liberty and 
freedom they have until june 1995 to fulfill the requirement of 60 
hours or about 15 minutes a week on weekends or during the 
evenings 
school officials insist theyll be flexible in deciding what 
constitutes community service and say they might approve something 
like a studentorganized carwash with the proceeds donated to a 
charity 
guidance counselors will oversee the program and studenss will 
be required to submit onepage reports on their service how they 
made a contribution and what they gained from the experience 
theyll receive half a credit toward their diplomas 
the idea is to inculcate the value that there is something 
good about doing something of value for someone and not receiving 
pay for it faust said 
karen ritter vice president of citizens against mandatory 
service in bethlehem said her group believes in voluntary but 
not mandatory service 
the whole thing is the mandatory issue she said everyone 
who is involved in cams is a volunteer in one organization or 
another my daughter worked with me in a soup kitchen 
bethlehem has a tradition of community service mrs ritter 
said hundreds of kids are already doing this service theyre 
doing it willingly because they want to do it but once you mandate 
something its no longer volunteering 
supporters of mandatory service argue that an optional program 
would be like preaching to the choir in church 
schools require a lot of things that they think are 
important brisco said they require english math when an 
individual district mandates service it says this is something 
that we really value

milk prices paid to dairy farmers are going 
down and the trend is sending some tremors through the industry 
strong milk prices since late last year generated substantial 
pressure for dairy expansion but an agriculture department report 
says this momentum will collide with the effects of dramatically 
lower milk prices in the coming months 
total 1990 milk production is projected to be almost 148 billion 
pounds up more than 2 percent from last year it also would exceed 
the previous record output of 1451 billion pounds in 1988 
despite the uncertainties agency economists think 1991 milk 
production will rise again perhaps by 1 percent to 2 percent to 
another record 
last week the usda reported the october allmilk price average 
at 1360 per 100 pounds down from 1420 in september and 1480 
in october 1989 
the report by the departments economic research service said 
that despite the downturn overall milk prices in the 
octoberdecember quarter still will be relatively favorable in 
relation to feed costs 
milk cow numbers in 1990 probably will average about the same as 
last years 101 million head the report said 
most dairy farmers probably will enter 1991 on a fairly sound 
financial footing it said 
the ratio of debt to assets has declined since the financial 
crunch of the mid1980s and economists said that will help some 
producers consider expanding their herds 
on the other hand producers generally have been conservative 
about taking on new debt in recent years the report said 
although 1990 milk prices have been high they have also been 
unpredictable and the support price was much below market prices 
expansion plans may well be tempered with considerable caution 
the 1990 farm bill sent to president bush late last month 
freezes the governments basic milk price support at the current 
level of 1010 per 100 pounds but it also provides an assessment 
on producers if government purchases of surplus milk exceed 7 
billion pounds 
according to the report the decline in milk prices will put 
pressure on profit margins as feed costs remain fairly constant 
if milk prices fall as much as currently expected returns 
over concentrate feed costs will fall about a fourth from 1990s 
nearrecord to the lowest level since 1978 the report said 
the report added this would be the largest proportional drop 
in returns over concentrate costs during the postworld war ii 
years 
 
washington ap an agriculture department survey shows that 
most shippers of farm commodities would like more competition in 
setting ocean liner cargo rates 
martin f buzz fitzpatrick jr head of the departments 
office of transportation said most shippers want unrestricted 
ability to negotiate freight contracts with individual carriers 
the shipping act of 1984 reguaates ocean carriers and grants 
them antitrust immunity to allow the carriers to form 
conferences or cartels to set cargo rates and apportion 
markets 
our surveys showed that many shippers would like the 
conference system eliminated fitzpatrick said if conferences 
are not eliminated most shippers advocate increased competition 
within the conference structure through mandatory independent 
action on tariff rates and service contracts 
a joint congressional and executive commission is preparing to 
review the impact of the 1984 law on maritime shipping to see if it 
should be retained changed or eliminated he said 
the cost and quality of ocean liner service have a direct impact 
on the competitiveness of us farm commodities fitzpatrick said 
about 12 billion to 14 billion worth of products are shipped 
overseas on liner vessels each year with a freight bill of 2 
billion to 25 billion 
cooperating in the survey were the united fresh fruit and 
vegetable association national forest products association 
national potato council southeastern peanut association and 
washington state university 
copies of the survey report are available from office of 
transportation usda po box 96575 washington dc 20090 or 
phone 202 2455334 
 
washington ap honey production in the top 10 countries is 
forecast to climb 3 percent this year to an estimated 750500 
metric tons according to an agriculture department report 
the soviet union leads the list with a 1990 estimate of 270000 
tons up from 249000 last year 
china is second at 180000 tons down from 189000 in 1989 the 
report showed the united states with 82000 tons compared with 
an output last year of 76793 tons is third

an americanled offensive to drive iraq out of 
kuwait probably would begin with nighttime air strikes inside iraq 
to sever saddam husseins links to his huge occupying army 
military planners and private analysts say 
such a campaign launched with the allied forces now arrayed 
against iraq would seek to exploit iraqs weaknesses in air power 
and its apparent vulnerability in kuwait to a seaborne assault and 
to naval bombardment from the persian gulf 
president bush has said repeatedly in recent days that he is 
growing impatient with saddams continuing occupation of kuwait 
though he has not decided to resort to military force he has 
stressed however that force remains an active option and that he 
will not permit the iraqi army to stay indefinitely in kuwait 
us military officials wont discuss specific war plans and 
they stress that bush for now at least has not changed their 
mission it remains the defense of saudi arabia and enforcement of 
united nations economic sanctions against iraq 
our training patterns have not changed in any manner to 
suggest preparations for an offensive campaign an army official 
said friday he spoke on condition of anonymity 
military officials recent comments make it clear they are not 
enthusiastic about taking the offensive against iraq any time soon 
they would prefer to wait until more american and allied ground 
forces are in place in saudi arabia and more effort is made to find 
a peaceful solution 
a major reason for the reluctance is iraqs apparent success in 
fortifying its defensive positions in kuwait where at least 
200000 iraqi troops are dug in they are supported by an estimated 
150000 elite republican guard troops along key resupply lines 
between kuwaits northeastern border and the iraqi city of basra 
iraqs defensive position in kuwait is described by military 
officials as elaborate it includes multiple layers of infantry and 
barriers such as mine fields earthen mounds and antitank ditches 
behind these are mechanized units that can quickly reinforce the 
frontline infantry and cover its flanks and behind these are 
mobile ready reserve units capable of counterattacking or 
blocking a move by saudibased ground forces to go around kuwait 
iraq also has an estimated 50000 troops along its southern 
border west of kuwait the pentagon disclosed friday that 
significant iraqi forces also are deployed on the border with 
turkey but that no buildup has been detected on the syrian border 
if bush ordered an attack any time soon us commanders in the 
field would have a wide array of firepower on which to draw in 
combination with a variety of air ground and naval forces deployed 
by britain france and about 20 other nations 
about 240000 us forces are now in the persian gulf area and 
allied forces total more than 100000 the pentagon said it plans 
to send as many as 100000 more troops but it would be several 
weeks before they get there and get ready 
joshua epstein a defense analyst at the brookings institution 
a washington think tank said there is little doubt that american 
forces now in saudi arabia could win a fight for kuwait the only 
doubt is whether the cost would be acceptable 
you can do an offensive and you can win but it wont be 
cheap epstein said adding that estimates of probable american 
deaths range beyond 10000 
in the opening phase of a usled attack the us air forces 
radarevading f117 stealth fighter bombers would play a key role 
carrying out simultaneous attacks on important military targets 
inside iraq these targets probably would include command and 
communications centers that are vital to iraqs ability to respond 
quickly and to coordinate a counteroffensive 
in combination with air attacks us marines would be expected 
to attempt a seaborne assault on kuwait city a contingent of about 
11000 marines afloat in the gulf are specially trained in 
amphibious landings forced entry and urban warfare they currently 
are taking part in an amphibious landing exercise on a beach in 
oman 
about another 33000 marines are defending coastal routes in 
northeastern saudi arabia 
jack merritt a retired army general and now president of the 
private association of the us army said a key to routing the 
iraqis from kuwait would be cutting them off from resupplies and 
from the iraqi leadership in baghdad 
psychology is on our side in this he said adding that 
the moment they feel they really have been cut off the iraqi 
troops in kuwait lose their resolve 
in an actual invasion the marine amphibious assault force would 
reach the beaches at kuwait city by landing craft small boat or 
helicopter under the cover of an aerial assault from harrier jump 
jet fighters and a naval barrage among the us warships in the 
gulf is the uss wisconsin armed with 16guns and tomahawk cruise 
missiles 
perhaps the costliest phase of a usled attack on kuwait would 
be the armys effort to oust the iraqis from their hardened 
positions the pentagon estimates that iraq has about 3500 tanks 
2200 infantry fighting vehicles and armored personnel carriers and 
2200 artillery pieces in kuwait and southern iraq 
the united states has about 800 tanks in saudi arabia

tuesdays elections will affect the next 
congress beyond the marginal changes in the balance of power 
between the two parties 
within the small world of the capitol the nationwide balloting 
will be seen as a referendum on the democratic and republican 
congressional leaders 
whether he deserves it or not house speaker thomas s foley 
dwash will find his stature enhanced if the democrats as 
expected take some seats away from the republicans 
in the senate where the democrats now hold a 5545 majority and 
little change is anticipated the results will boost either 
democratic leader george mitchell of maine or republican leader bob 
dole of kansas even if the lineup shifts by only a seat 
the electoral glow or pall will in subtle ways color how the 
democraticcontrolled congress deals with president bush over the 
next two years less subtly the changes could make it easier or 
harder for congress to override the presidents vetoes 
foley mitchell and dole will adjust adapt and survive the 
changes theres no evidence that the outcome will shake them from 
their perches 
thats not so in the ranks of the house republicans 
the house gop is facing its 18th straight election without 
winning a majority theres not a single house republican remaining 
from when they last won the majority in 1952 
last year their bitterness was turned toward democratic speaker 
jim wright of texas who was forced out of office following an 
ethics investigation this year theyre shooting at each other 
rep don sundquist rtenn is running to unseat rep guy 
vander jagt rmich as chairman of the national republican 
congressional committee vander jagt has held the job since 1975 
and sundquist is counting on fellow republicans to see another loss 
of seats as a sign that vander jagt should go 
but is vander jagt is the real target not likely 
ambitious gop members are setting up for 1992 when many expect 
house minority leader bob michel rill to retire after 12 years 
as leader with the nationwide redistricting republicans will 
stand their best chance in a decade for a big gain in seats 
that makes the nrcc a potentially great place to be even if 
vander jagt has never managed to take advantage of it the chairman 
of the committee gets to know all the potential new members in a 
very intimate and positive way he hands them money for their 
campaigns 
mitchell is a former democratic senate campaign chairman dole a 
former republican national chairman and michel a former nrcc 
chairman 
its an excellent springboard you become the spear carrier 
and you also then get the spears and they appreciate you for it 
said former rep tony coelho of california who vaulted from 
democratic campaign chairman to house majority whip 
so what is sundquists ultimate goal who is his ultimate 
target he wont say but he doesnt have to 
sundquists quest was unveiled last week not by sundquist who 
intended to keep it quiet until after the election not by vander 
jagt but by the staff of house minority whip newt gingrich 
gingrich would be michels natural successor but he was elected 
as the no 2 republican last year at least partly because of his 
longterm plans for wresting control of the house from the 
democrats a bad election result would be bad for gingrich unless 
he can blame it on someone else 
the gingrichvander jagt strategy seed a public spectacle and 
then accuse sundquist of hurting gop election chances right before 
the elections let sundquist take some of the blame for losses that 
many republicans pin on gingrich because he torpedoed president 
bushs budget 
anything that distracts is doing a disservice to republican 
chances this fall said vander jagt who went so far as to 
compare sundquist with saddam hussein 
regardless of who eventually gets the blame the republican 
strife will make the democrats look good in comparison just as 
happened in the justended battle over the budget whether they 
deserve it or not

the 1990 elections are a dream come true for 
political handicappers there are 34 senate races 36 governors 
contests and 435 us house contests on tuesdays ballot 
here is the outlook for the closest races according to a 
statebystate survey by the associated press 
alabama gov guy hunt the first republican elected governor 
in the state this century is bidding for a second term and 
narrowly leads democrat paul hubbert 
alaska as a republican walter hickel was alaskas second 
governor now hes back running as an independent and leading 
republican arliss sturgulewski and democrat tony knowles 
democratic incumbent steve cowper is not running 
arizona former phoenix mayor terry goddard a democrat leads 
gop developer fife symington but polls have him below the 50 
percent he needs to avoid a runoff incumbent rose mofford a 
democrat is retiring 
california the big race of 1990 is a megabuck contest for 
governor between republican sen pete wilson and former san 
francisco mayor dianne feinstein a lot of polling with not much 
agreement but the latest surveys give a hairline edge to wilson 
the result might have to await a count of absentee ballots days 
after the polls close 
connecticut republican lowell weicker lost his senate seat in 
1988 now hes running for governor as an independent and leading 
republican john rowland and democrat bruce morrison 
florida another highstakes contest for governor republican 
bob martinez was at the top of the democrats list of vulnerable 
incumbents democrats got another boost when former sen lawton 
chiles decided to challenge martinez late polls said chiles was 
leading but its close 
hawaii this usually democratic state gives the republicans 
their best shot at picking up a senate seat rep pat saiki is 
running a strong race against sen daniel akaka who was appointed 
to succeed the late sen spark matsunaga polls indicate the race 
is a tossup 
idaho republican sen james mcclure is retiring and rep larry 
craig is favored to defeat democrat ron twilegar in the senate 
race 
illinois republican jim edgar and democrat neil hartigan are 
running neck and neck to succeed gop gov jim thompson in the 
senate race democrat paul simon holds a wide lead over republican 
challenger lynn martin republicans had high hopes for this one 
but simon proved stronger than they thought 
iowa republican gov terry branstad is holding off democratic 
challenger don avenson who had strong support from abortion rights 
groups iowans dont tend to reelect democratic senators but sen 
tom harkin has a strong chance to break that tradition gop rep 
tom tauke is within reach of an upset but has been unable to catch 
harkin in preelection surveys 
kansas gop gov mike hayden looked like a sure loser to 
democrat joan finney a month ago but her hard line against 
abortion appears to have hurt her and hayden had a narrow lead in 
the latest poll 
kentucky sen mitch mcconnell has led in all preelection 
polls over democrat harvey sloane but this is a strongly 
democratic state and sloane is given a chance for an upset 
maine former democratic gov joseph brennan wants his old job 
back and is challenging his republican successor john mckernan 
brennan held an early lead but the race now is a tossup 
massachusetts home of the voter rebellion outsider democrat

the race to succeed gov michael dukakis sen john kerry fighting 
to avoid being swept away by the rage that toppled incumbents in 
the september primary has opened a 20point lead over republican

primary 
michigan gov james blanchard is shaking off a challenge from 
republican john engler a new poll said engler was leading by 14 
points 
minnesota lake wobegon gone berserk democratic gov rudy 
perpich is viewed as potentially vulnerable to republican arne 
carlson who got onto the ballot only five days before election 
day carlson had lost the gop gubernatorial nomination to jon 
grunseth who was forced out of the race a week ago after 
allegations he swam nude with two teenage girls and cheated on two

in the surprising vulnerability of incumbent gop sen rudy 
boschwitz whos in a dead heat with democrat paul wellstone a new 
poll said boschwitz was pulling away 
nebraska gop gov kay orr once trailed democrat ben nelson but 
is now even up in the senate race democratic incumbent james exon 
appears to be pulling away from former rep hal daub 
new mexico former gov bruce king a democrat is leading 
republican frank bond but not by much 
north carolina one of the most watched races in the country is 
the senate battle between helms and his democratic challenger 
harvey gantt the black former mayor of charlotte gantt has been 
ahead in the polls but the contest has taken a nasty turn in the 
closing days 
ohio one of the best republican hopes for a gubernatorial

celeste the race has tightened in the past two weeks 
oklahoma democrat david walters leads republican bill price in 
the race to succeed gop gov henry bellmon 
oregon tight races for governor and senate democrat barbara

texas races dont get much nastier than this contest for 
governor between republican clayton williams and democrat ann 
richards williams once was far ahead but the race suddenly closed 
to a dead heat a week ago now richards is trying to exploit the 
disclosure that millionaire williams paid no income taxes in 1986

landslide winner in his bid to get his old job back but democrat 
peter welch has moved within striking distance

political action committees financed by labor 
unions teachers and other interests are pouring huge chunks of 
money into legislative races in about a dozen states that are 
battlegrounds for congressional redistricting 
we are under siege like i have never seen said pennsylvania 
senate president robert jubelirer he and other republicans are 
trying to fend off a democratic offensive to take over the states 
upper chamber 
the stakes are high in pennsylvania because state democrats 
should they pick up three seats and wrest the senate from gop 
control could have absolute control in redrawing the states 
congressional districts next year democratic gov robert casey is 
likely to roll to reelection and the pennsylvania house is 
expected to stay democratic 
similar shootouts are occurring in other states that stand to 
win or lose when 19 us house seats change hands in 1991 because 
of population shifts detected by the 1990 census 
eight states are expected to gain house seats and 13 to lose 
seats in addition political boundaries within every state will be 
redrawn regardless of whether the states win or lose seats 
the national republican and democratic parties have invested 
heavily in the states affected the most by redistricting and each 
side is getting reinforcements from its allies with labor backing 
the democrats and business and conservative interests aiding the 
gop 
state legislative races and gubernatorial contests are crucial 
because those elected officials will control the highly political 
process of redrawing boundary lines for congressional and state 
legislative districts 
therefore tuesdays elections will determine whether democrats 
or republicans get to draw the districts or whether the two parties 
split the responsibility by slicing up districts in either liberal 
or conservative precincts politicians can help the election 
chances of either a republican or democrat 
legisatures draw up the lines governors are power brokers in 
the process too because a governor of one party affiliation a 
republican for instance could veto a plan drawn up by a 
democratic legislature 
most of the 19 house seats expected to shift will move from the 
democratictilting northeast and midwest to the more conservative 
south and west 
california texas and florida the big prizes on everyones 
list because they stand to gain as many as 14 congressional seats 
next year have attracted huge contributions from out of state 
democrats in illinois michigan pennsylvania and ohio which 
each stand to lose two congressional seats are luring hefty 
contributions as well 
reapportionment has been on everybodys mind for a very long 
time in the labor movement said janice lachance of the american 
federation of government employees 
tom heoffler of the national republican congressional committee 
said it is crucial for the gop to hold its ground to keep the 
democrats from taking total control in many states 
were looking at a situation here where its vital for us to 
hang on to what we have just to be in a divided or split 
position he said 
tim dickson executive director of the democratic national 
committees redistricting arm noted that efforts are just as 
important in states that stand to lose house seats 
its like musical chairs the musics going to stop when this 
legislative session ends and somebodys not going to have a 
seat dickson said 
democratic priorities in addition to capturing the pennsylvania 
senate include trying to reverse narrow gop majorities in the 
senates of michigan indiana ohio and new york 
republicans are trying to oust democrats to gain control in the 
senates of florida and illinois 
florida is an especially important redistricting battleground 
because it also has a close governors race in california and 
texas the gubernatorial races are attracting the most attention 
because both have legislatures handily controlled by democrats 
other legislative showdown states although not necessarily key 
in the congressional redistricting changes are arizona where 
republicans hold a fourseat majority in the senate colorado 
where democrats hope to make a stab at the gops 13seat house 
margin idaho where the gop holds a fourseat edge in the senate 
washington where republicans have a oneseat advantage in the 
senate and oregon where democrats have just four house seats over 
the republicans 
in state legislatures that share redistricting powers with 
governors democrats had a big edge going into the election they 
control both chambers in 29 states while republicans hold a lock 
on the statehouse in only four 
overall there are more than 6100 legislative seats at stake 
nationwide on tuesday

anxiety over the persian gulf anger over new 
taxes and antipathy toward incumbents stirred up a crosswind that 
has democrats and republicans nervous about tuesdays house 
elections 
while democrats are certain to maintain their lopsided majority 
several candidates for reelection are in trouble because of the 
savings and loan debacle and party officials have stopped talking 
of substantial gains 
republicans once hoped to cash in on president bushs high 
popularity ratings now with his poll standings in decline they 
seem more resigned to mounting a rearguard action to limit losses 
experts say there is little chance the republicans will lose large 
numbers of seats 
for all the volatility on the political landscape no one 
expects a major power shakeup in the house where the lineup going 
into this weeks elections showed 258 democrats 175 republicans 
and two vacancies 
people are infuriated at congressmen but they love 
theirs said james david barber a duke university political 
scientist 
former cincinnati mayor kenneth blackwell has a chance of 
becoming the first black republican in the house since 1935 
although hes in a tight race with democratic mayor charles luken 
and in another contest of note socialist bernie sanders running 
as an independent is in a tight race with republican rep peter 
smith in vermont 
house majority leader richard gephardt of missouri predicted 
sunday the democrats would pick up six or seven house seats 
ed rollins chairman of the house republican campaign committee 
said that if gop voters shake off apathy and turn out at the polls 
our losses will probably be held to a single digit if 
republicans are still turned off and dont vote the numbers 
will get higher 
the house elections will for the most part hinge on 29 contests 
where there is no incumbent seeking reelection eleven of those 
seats were held by democrats 18 by republicans 
democrats hope to pick up an open seat in arkansas where rep 
tommy robinson who switched to the republican party while in the 
house waged an unsuccessful campaign for governor this year 
theyre also hoping to pick up seats in rhode island hawaii iowa 
and idaho in districts vacated by republicans seeking higher 
office 
unless theres a military action in the middle east the 
republicans are going to be hurt because of the economy and 
taxes said gop consultant tom edmonds the end result of this 
for republicans is going to be poor 
said democratic consultant frank greer i dont think theres 
going to be big shifts even though voter sentiments are strong out 
there the real fruits of this budget debate for democrats might 
not be felt until 1992 
in the last full week of the campaign democrats charged that 
bush used political appearances to launch daily broadsides against 
iraqs saddam hussein in an attempt to divert attention from 
popular unrest over the tax hikes but the president denied that 
saying ill repeat it today ill repeat it tomorrow and ill 
repeat it the next day 
against the backdrop of new tougher talk on the persian gulf 
more problems in the thrift industry and public backlash over the 
slowing economy and heavier taxation about 20 incumbents will be 
particularly vulnerable on election day 
democrat frank annunzio of illinois and republicans denny smith 
of oregon and charles pashayan of california are in trouble because 
they have been linked to the savings and loan failures annunzio is 
chairman of the house administration committee 
the reelection campaign of rep arlan stangeland of minnesota 
has been threatened by disclosures that the incumbent charged 
hundreds of longdistance calls to a woman friend on his house 
credit card the woman was the office manager of a lobbying firm 
several of the vulnerable incumbents are freshmen including 
rep ben jones dga peter hoagland dneb jolene unsoeld 
dwash george sangmeister dill bill sarpalius dtexas greg 
laughlin dtexas craig james rfla ron machtley rri and 
smith in vermont 
two incumbents in maryland and virginia are in some trouble 
rep roy dyson dmd has run into controversy about his 
conscientious objector status during the vietnam war dyson sits on 
the house armed services committee and talks tough on military 
issues in virginia republican stan parris said he supported 
bushs veto of a civil rights bill because it is worse to 
discriminate against majorities than against racial minorities

senate incumbents toying with the idea of a 
future presidential bid will be expected to turn in a strongpperformance 
tuesday or spend the next two years wondering about 
the consequences 
any reelection of a presidential hopeful under 60 percent is 
a dangerous sign said larry sabato a political science 
professor at the university of virginia 
the 34 senate races featured on tuesdays ballot include several 
senators just struggling to stay in office those considered most 
vulnerable are republicans jesse helms in north carolina mark 
hatfield in oregon and rudy boschwitz in minnesota and democrat 
daniel akaka in hawaii 
but wouldbe future presidents need to do much better than just 
survive 
they must produce a solid performance in a climate of 
antigovernment attitudes and typical voter apathy in an offyear 
election 
no democrat has announced a 92 run for the white house but 
those most often mentioned are sens sam nunn of georgia albert 
gore jr of tennessee and new jerseys bill bradley republicans 
thought to harbor presidential ambitions include sen phil gramm of 
texas 
all face little or no opposition in their reelection bids on 
tuesday 
bradley is expected to defeat republican christine todd whitman 
easily but he may not do so with 60 percent of the vote he may 
feel some of the anger the states electorate feels toward 
democratic gov james florio 
the backlash against florio for raising taxes after his election 
last year has prompted cries for impeachment in some quarters and 
general anger in others 
a poll released over the weekend showed bradley favored by 55 
percent of likely voters and whitman supported by 27 percent with 
12 percent undecided 
nunn will have no difficulty in topping 60 percent hes 
unopposed in his bid for a fourth term in 1984 the georgia 
senator manhandled his general election opponent jon michael 
hicks 80 percent to 20 percent 
gore who ran unsuccessfully for the democratic nomination in 
1988 faces three challengers in his attempt to return to the 
senate for a second term but neither republican william hawkins 
nor two independent candidates has generated much interest 
gore is expected to win handily but high percentages are key 
candidates in the democratic party have to have vast appeal in 
the south said james thurber director of the center for 
congressional and presidential studies at american university 
in the south a higher percentage shows youre a winner he 
said 
the lone exception to the 60 percent rule essential for 
southern incumbents is texas a finish in the upper 50 percent 
range is perfectly acceptable sabato said because the states 
electorate can be tough on its candidates 
in 1988 texas democratic sen lloyd bentsen finished with 59 
percent of the vote to 40 percent for his opponent beau boulter 
gramm whos expected to win easily in his reelection bid 
captured 59 percent of the vote in 1984 
aside from concerns about strong showings in offyear elections 
candidates sometimes have to contend with political ghosts 
sen joseph biden ddel was forced out of the presidential 
race in 1988 when charges of plagiarism surfaced he has seen those 
accusations resurrected in this years election but is heavily 
favored to win a fourth term over republican m jane brady 
because no candidate has declared presidential intentions for 
1992 the attention also is focused on gubernatorial incumbents at 
least one analyst contends that those races not the senate 
contests are the ones to watch 
the senate election is not going to determine electoral 
prowess its a nonstarter said tom mann of the brookings 
institution a private research group 
although mann says the contest in new york for governor is a 
nonrace he suggests keeping a close eye on how democrat mario 
cuomo wins and then handles the states economic problems 
cuomo was considered a presidential contender in 1988 and his 
name has been mentioned for 92 
mann also will be keeping an eye on arkansas where democratic 
gov bill clinton is strongly favored for reelection

youngsters in arizona dont have to wait until 
theyre 18 to vote they can go to the polls in kindergarten 
the kids voting program designed to improve the way 
americans vote believes in starting young 
its thrilling because it lets kids vote on things adults 
do says 9yearold stephanie schwartz who adds that shell 
probably vote for the rest of her life 
alyssa martin 16 said participating in the program has made 
her more aware of political issues 
now i read the newspaper about the candidates and i want to 
know more she said 
kids voting began in 1988 as a pilot program taking in parts of 
six school districts 30000 children voted 
two years later the program has grown to include about 200 
school districts around the state more than 600000 youngsters are 
eligible to vote 
voting booths for children in grades kindergarten through 12 
will be set up at 1797 of the states nearly 2000 precincts for 
tuesdays general election 
pupils vote with a special ballot in booths alongside the 
regular voting booths at adult polling places the results which 
will be tabulated by a private computer company are expected to be 
available on wednesday 
marilyn hawker kids voting president and executive director 
said voter turnout in the 65 precincts in which children voted two 
years ago was 3 percent higher than state and county election 
turnouts she expects the program to increase voter turnout 
throughout the state this year by 5 percent 
laurie delaney a social studies teacher in mesa said some of 
her students said their parents registered to vote for the first 
time after the students became involved in kids voting 
the ballot issues that the youngsters will vote on include 
statewide offices propositions and legislative races plus some 
studentrelated issues not on the adult ballots such as linking 
driving privileges with regular school attendance 
in another effort to deal with civic illiteracy millions of 
junior and senior high school students and their parents voted in a 
nationwide mock election last thursday they cast ballots on 
individual state races as well as on general issues involving drugs 
and defense 
the idea for arizonas kids voting program came during a 1987 
fishing trip to costa rica where the voter turnout reaches over 90 
percent 
bob evans chairman of the kids voting board of directors and 
several others made a forced airplane landing in a village in the 
small central american country they met a taxi driver who told 
them of a childhood of voting alongside his parents in simulated 
elections 
evans hopes the idea will overcome voter apathy 
according to federal statistics 50 percent of eligible citizens 
dont vote in presidential elections and 70 percent dont vote in 
local elections arizona ranked 36th in the nation in voter turnout 
in 1988 
voter apathy is the worst disease that we have within our own 
particular democracy and it has been a creeping disease over the 
last 75 years evans said were hardly a government by the 
people any more because there are so few people participating 
the program already has affected the governors race between 
democrat terry goddard and republican fife symington both of whom 
participated in a televised kids voting program 
goddard later issued a statement to clarify his position after 
learning he appeared to be losing ground among the youthful voters 
over his comments on yearround school one of the studentrelated 
issues on which kids voting participants will cast ballots 
goddard said during the broadcast that the united states might 
have to adopt an intensive program such as that used in japanese 
schools in his later statement he said he didnt advocate keeping 
students in school yearround but would like to see the facilities 
have greater use 
the kids voting program is expected to cost about 600000 with 
95 percent of the funding coming from private corporations 
primarily arizona public service co ms hawker said

illinois law calls for mandatory retirement of 
judges after they turn 75 but 76yearold william s white has 
other ideas 
i refuse to be mandatorily retired says the appellate judge 
in cook county i view it as a violation of federal laws against 
discrimination on account of age 
white wrote to the secretary of states office to inform them of 
his intentions and the state board of elections certified him to 
run for reelection 
im having my credentials reviewed by the public white 
said theyre the people who hired me and they are the people 
who should decide if im too old 
meanwhile john p tully a democratic circuit judge and lester 
a bonaguro a republican circuit judge are listed on the ballot 
for a seat that might not be open 
because the question of whites retirement couldnt be settled 
in time officials decided all the candidates would be on the 
ballot and the issue would be settled later 
if 60 percent of voters say white should be retained the courts 
will have to decide whether he or the winner of the 
tullybonaguro race will get the seat board of elections

democratic gubernatorial nominee theo 
mitchell says party leaders tucked their tails and ran from his 
underdog campaign to defeat republican gov carroll campbell 
i was criticized because i didnt ask permission to get into 
it from the socalled leaders of the democratic party to lick 
their boots so i could run mitchell said 
the state senator bidding to become the nations second elected 
black governor said he told party leaders he was going to run 
since no one else had the guts 
mitchell told the charlotte nc observer in an interview 
published sunday that some democrats have tried to sabotage his 
campaign 
carol khare a democratic national committee member from south 
carolina says mitchell spurned offers of help from politically 
experienced party members after he won the nomination 
party leaders who thought theo didnt have much chance to win 
still wanted him to do well both as the partys nominee and as a 
representative of blacks khare said the democratic leadership 
wanted to help more than they were allowed to help 
mitchell denies that he refused to ask for help or heed advice 
democratic activists say mitchell has failed even to mobilize 
his prime constituency and ensure a large black turnout 
he doesnt have an organization that can turn out people 
said oscar butler dean of students at south carolina state college 
and a longtime democratic activist

in years past kremlinologists seeking clues to 
soviet politics scrutinized the lineup of leaders atop lenins 
mausoleum during the revolution day parade through red square 
during this wednesdays celebration of the communist holiday 
those wanting to know the political currents will look instead to 
the counterdemonstrations in moscows streets 
for the first time in the 73year history of the day marking the 
revolution that brought bolsheviks to power in russia alternative 
demonstrations have been officially sanctioned in the capital 
about 5000 people marched in an unofficial protest on 
revolution day last year this years alternative demonstration has 
the blessing of the moscow city council where radicals won seats 
last spring 
sundays editions of moskovskaya pravda the capitals communist 
party newspaper stated joyfully today we may firmly declare 
that the celebration of the anniversary will go on as usual 
the celebration will go on but it wont be a usual 
revolution day 
while the communist party puts on its grand show praising the 
1917 uprising and president mikhail s gorbachevs policies of 
perestroika protesters elsewhere in the city will be denouncing 
the coup engineered by vladimir lenin and mourning those killed 
during seven decades of repression 
demonstrators chose a symbolic route for their march starting 
at the communist partys central committee headquarters at the old 
square past a monument to stalins victims and ending at the 
house where the late human rights activist andrei sakharov lived 
our main slogan is from a totalitarian regime to democracy 
and humanism and we want to display this slogan to the whole 
world said lev shemayev of the moscow voters association which 
has organized anticommunist rallies this year 
in outlining the plans at a news conference last week he 
emphasized that one target of the protest would be gorbachev 
it is clear that everything stems from the walls of the old 
square where the president has his study he said referring to 
gorbachevs office as chief of the communist party 
another group of protesters led by radical deputies of the 
national and russian parliaments plan to march through red square 
carrying signs demanding the resignation of gorbachev defense 
minister dmitri yazov and others 
this march is scheduled to occur long after communist party 
supporters and military hardware have paraded over the cobblestones 
of red square gorbachev and the rest of the soviet leadership will 
have left their reviewing stand atop the mausoleum 
radical leaders such as moscow mayor gavriil popov and leningrad 
mayor anatoly sobchak initially urged that no festivities be held 
saying the communist system has been so destructive there is 
nothing to celebrate many of the 15 republics including the 
baltics voted to ban traditional parades 
gorbachev however ordered the parades to go on in major 
cities and the national parliament echoed his sentiments 
moskovskaya pravda has been printing letters from party members 
war veterans and others in support of celebrating the glorious 
date 
a group of moscow war veterans criticized those who would cancel 
the festivities saying the attempts to deprive the soviet people 
of their national holiday are blasphemous 
newspapers have reported on efforts to swell the ranks of the 
procommunist party parade with soviet army officers ordering 
soldiers to march in street clothes and militaryaffiliated 
schools compelling students to fall in step 
with the official parade still on some radicals felt that to do 
nothing would be a political mistake because it will play into 
the hands of the party and give the impression that all soviet 
people support the communists shemayev said 
not all the radicals agree 
popov said last week i am not going to march in any 
demonstrations although i will attend the official state 
ceremonies related to nov 7 
the national parliament had urged that alternative 
demonstrations not be held but opposition groups decided to defy 
the lawmakers and the city council approved 
lev ponomarov a radical deputy to the russian republics 
parliament sounded defensive friday in announcing protest plans 
it is not us who initiates these demonstrations we are 
forced to participate because we want to express a different 
viewpoint he said 
shemayev stressed that the national reconciliation of 
communists and noncommunists was another principal theme of the 
day 
we must emphasize the main philosophy that we are all now 
within the confines of the barbed wire of the soviet union he 
said and we are all countrymen whether we like or loathe each 
other

king abdelaziz won his desert realm 
by the sword but his heirs have favored diplomacy over violence 
for decades now they are resigning themselves to the possibility 
of war with iraq 
if theres no peace id rather have war than have saddam 
hussein threatening myself and my children said a saudi sheik 
who lived through riyadhs transformation from backwater to 
glittering metropolis 
recounting the ragstoriches story of his generation the 
middleaged sheikbusinessman said nobody wants war but 
everyone is becoming resigned to it 
few signs of impending war are evident in this city of 
superhighways but posters telling what do in an air raid can be 
found at traffic intersections among the modern buildings myriad 
princely palaces and shiny mosques 
stay at home they urge use minimum lighting place yourself in 
a corner or go underground if you have a basement listen carefully 
to radio or television be calm and behave wisely 
abdelaziz bin abdelrahman al saud after years of exile in 
kuwait stormed out of the desert in 1902 with a few handpicked 
companions and took the fort at riyadh in a daring dawn raid 
within two decades he controlled most of the arabian peninsula 
his victory was so complete that war on their own soil is 
something only very old saudis can remember and only dimly 
out at diriyah oasis where the ultraconservative islamic sect 
known as the wahabis joined forces with abdelazizs ancestors to 
plan an earlier conquest of arabia in the 18th century cats slink 
across empty streets as the sun sets over the desert 
behind a dense palm grove are the bigwalled compounds where 
some of the wives of senior princes live alturaif citadel a 
mudbrick fort that guarded the entrance to the oasis is being 
restored as a historic monument 
modernday saudis live in the sprawl of riyadh the capital 
which is laid out in a grid pattern across the flat desert they 
seldom visit the citadel a relic of the warrior past 
a jordanian businessman who like the saudi sheik spoke on 
condition of anonymity told of noticing fear in many saudis 
immediately after iraq invaded kuwait on aug 2 
over the past 20 years the people have been living in 
luxury he said all of a sudden they were in a war mood 
theyre very afraid of saddam they have seen the kuwaitis 
coming here sleeping in schools five to a room theyre worried 
it could happen to them 
in the early days of the crisis they packed their houses with 
food water and so on the jordanian said but now they are more 
relaxed and theres no such mood 
whatever the peoples private fears their ruler insists that 
through diplomacy or war saddam be driven out of kuwait 
king fahd bin abdelaziz the current successor of abdelaziz 
is one of his more than 30 sons fahd also is known as custodian of 
the two holy shrines mecca and medina 
in public statements fahd has demanded unconditional withdrawal 
from kuwait and ruled out any compromise that would leave parts of 
the tiny emirate under iraq control 
saudi arabia which has been reluctant to thrust itself onto the 
arab or international scene is assuming a greater role now and 
seems less willing to compromise with its neighbors 
when king hussein of jordan refused wholehearted backing of 
antiiraqi measures the kingdom criticized him severely and for a 
time closed the border to commercial traffic 
when yemen gave partial support to saddam the saudis expelled 
hundreds of thousands of yemeni workers many of whom had been in 
the kingdom 30 years or more 
a western diplomat said the new policy was no more mr nice 
guy no more throwing of money at problems until they go away 
among the saudi middle class he said there is a growing 
debate about is it worth going to war also if you go after 
saddam does he have to be personally eliminated or could he just 
be defanged 
the sheikbusinessman said if there is a war the impact will 
last many years the americans the british will stay for a while 
then theyll leave but the iraqis will be there forever 
he said there was only one good solution we wake up tomorrow 
and saddam hussein has had a heart attack and been toppled by 
someone less dangerous

jesse the body ventura was in an 
ugly mood 
politics is dirtier than pro wrestling he fumed and he 
ought to know 
the candidate for mayor of this minneapolis suburb is a retired 
pro wrestler 
what ticked him off one week before the election was a political 
body slam or maybe it was a headlock from a state lawmaker 
rep linda scheid wrote a letter to the community newspaper 
publicizing excerpts from venturas interview with penthouse 
magazine last year and accusing the candidate of insulting women 
and of being a bad role model 
the lean and chiseled 6foot4 candidate was outraged 
politics is dirtier than anything ventura said i mean 
including wheeling and dealing in hollywood theyre even more 
honest than politics is 
retired from the ring since 1986 ventura 39 is trying to 
unseat 18year mayor jim krautkremer in this bedroom community of 
50000 
ventura who wore a goatee earrings and feather boas during his 
wrestling days but now dresses more sedately and is cleanshaven and 
graying about the temples had feared character attacks during the 
campaign but he said the worse he had been called publicly before 
scheids letter was a bitpart actor 
he appeared in two films with arnold schwarzenegger 
predator and the running man appeared in other films and 
did a neveraired abc pilot tag team he also is color 
commentator for footballs tampa bay buccaneers 
in the interview in penthouses march 1989 issue ventura said 
i just want to be the actor who when a scenes done heads back 
to his airconditioned trailer picks up a penthouse looks at the 
pictures and maybe even reads the articles 
on why he chose the villainous role of the body as a 
wrestler i identify with that role perfectly because i am 
eccentric and i am a maniac 
scheid recommended in her letter that ventura pick up some 
sensitivity handbooks 
sorry jesse ventura but our city doesnt need a mayor who 
flaunts an image of macho indifference to half of our population 
she wrote 
ventura got involved in politics when the city proposed real 
estate development in a marsh near his house he and his neighbors

an increase in the number of convicts paroled 
last year reflects efforts by the criminal justice system to make 
room for a similar rise in individuals sent to prison authorities 
say 
the number of parolees increased 121 percent to 457797 
coupled with a 56 percent rise in defendants on probation to a 
total of 252 million according to a fresh study from the justice 
department 
authorities were unanimous in saying states have used parole to 
reduce overcrowding particularly when courts have set caps on the 
number of inmates that can be housed in particular prisons 
georgia led the nation with a 542 percent increase in paroles 
in 1989 
the states parole board releases nonviolent offenders to avoid 
prison overcrowding and lawsuits spokesman mike fleming said 
the rise in paroles is simply a reflection of the boards 
attempt to maintain the level of the prison population in the state 
of georgia fleming said were trying to keep it at capacity 
or less so that we dont get into federal lawsuits or federal 
control 
in oregon paroles climbed 529 percent last year followed by 
increases of 371 percent in kansas 37 percent in oklahoma and 
288 percent in michigan 
the justice department found that threequarters of the 41 
million adults under the authority of correctional parole or 
probation officials last year were living in the community rather 
than behind bars 
with more prison admissions state officials have to find a way 
to release inmates to make more space for newly convicted inmates 
the 13 percent growth in the nations prison population last 
year tracks the 121 percent increase in parolees said lawrence a 
greenfeld who supervised the study for the justice departments 
bureau of justice statistics 
its been that way for quite some time greenfeld said 
all of these components of corrections are growing more or less 
at similar rates 
prison and jail populations since 1980 have increased 114 
percent while the number of those on parole went up 107 percent 
he said the number of individuals placed on probation increased 
126 percent he said 
according to criminologist norval morris the latest parole 
figures are descriptive of a system in chaos 
wide use of mandatory sentences for drug offenses and other 
crimes has strained prisons and forced parole boards to release 
more inmates the university of chicago scholar said 
when you put a cap on facilities and fill them up with 
streetlevel drug dealers and users youve got to do something 
he said 
overcrowding doesnt produce more severity it just produces 
more random severity and random leniency said morris he 
recently coauthored a book between prison and probation that 
urges alternatives to incarceration 
texas had the largest number of parolees last year 91294 
followed by 57508 in california pennsylvania ranked third with 
47702 new york had 36685 
rhode island had a 245 percent jump in the number of 
probationers followed by increases of 167 percent in oregon and a 
163 percent increase in florida

the opening of the berlin wall did far more than 
allow east germans to dance across broken concrete into the 
dazzling world outside it let the outside world come in 
less than a year later two nations were wiped off the map and 
replaced with one 
breaching the barrier was a desperate act by a dying regime 
trying to placate a people massed in revolt 
although the opening of the wall nov 9 1989 took the 
unromantic form of lifting travel restrictions everyone recognized 
it as the end of the cold wars most famous symbol it was the 
dominant image in a breathtaking year of revolution in the soviet 
bloc 
what no one predicted was the resulting maelstrom of forces that 
led to german unity an inexorable process that forced the 
superpowers to recognize a new world order and reach new levels of 
cooperation 
today the nation that built the berlin wall is a territory 
transformed no longer a communist state no longer a closed 
society no longer a nation 
it is a region whose destiny lies completely in the hands of 
people who live in what used to be another country 
uniting with mighty west germany has given the east germans an 
experienced hand to lead them and a mattress stuffed with money to 
rest on 
but it also has forced the old nation to make eastern europes 
fastest most turbulent most radical transition to a freemarket 
democracy after four decades of sleepy unchanging communism 
poland czechoslovakia bulgaria romania and hungary are 
proceeding much more gently by comparison dipping a toe into the 
cold waters of capitalism as they peer through the dust and smoke 
of their revolutions 
so swiftly has east germany become distinct from its neighbors 
that it is inaccurate and unfair to even compare them said 
heinrich vogel an analyst at the federal institute for eastern 
economic and international studies in cologne 
he said eastern germany is in a distinctly privileged 
situation sharing a language legal system government currency 
and borders with a rich and stable region 
east germany also has thrown its fate to the west however 
while the other former soviet satellites still have autonomy and 
some control of their destiny on the longer less certain road to 
prosperity 
what eastern germany has in common with the other former 
communist states are profound similarities in public mood 
they are all sharing exaggerated expectations to a large 
extent vogel said they have all inherited the structural 
handicaps the mental decay the system of mistrusting each other 
and society 
in eastern germany westerners have seized control swiftly from 
the man in charge of selling its factories to the governor of its 
largest state to clever squatters who have claimed its vacant 
tenements 
leading eastern politicians have western campaign managers and 
aides the east german womens swimming team which dominated the 
world for years has a west german coach 
children who have been drilled their entire classroom lives in 
the correctness of communism are using western textbooks 
the food in the old nations stores the cars on its streets 
the money in its banks and the flag flown atop its public buildings 
all have changed in th single year from revolution to 
reunifiction 
political extremism overt racism crime and drug abuse have 
crept through the wall or simmered up from the darkest corners of a 
longsuppressed national psyche 
embracing the west has ruined the homegrown economy and its 
overstaffed inefficient enterprises which once were the strongest 
of the soviet bloc but now are literally being killed by the 
competition 
since march about onefourth of the 8 million workers in 
eastern germany have lost their jobs or are working fewer hours at 
lower governmentsubsidized wages 
a recent report by the five leading german economic institutes 
said nearly 4 million could be in the same situation next year and 
that the pace of recovery was much slower than expected 
except for some perky areas of the service industry virtually 
no sector of the eastern economy can survive without western help 
said economist heine flassbeck of berlin one of the reports 
authors 
chancellor helmut kohls government facing national elections 
dec 2 has dismissed the report as too pessimistic 
hans peter stihl president of the german chamber of commerce 
said a new survey showed half of all western german businesses will 
have invested in the east by the end of 1991 
if there is disagreement over the timetable for eastern 
germanys elevation to western standards there is little doubt 
about its inevitability 
on a single day soon after the germanys were joined oct 3 
three unrelated announcements illustrated why east germany was more 
fortunate than its old warsaw pact allies 
mercedesbenz said it would begin building cars at a struggling 
east german truck plant near berlin saving or creating 6000 jobs 
the government increased pensions to help 27 million retired 
people pay higher prices and rents 
another department announced plans to spend 10 billion marks 
65 billion on fixing up 300000 homes 
romania poland and the other former communist states could use 
a day like that but many of citizens have decided not to wait for 
it 
thousands of eastern europeans have poured into eastern germany 
in hopes it will be the new gateway to the west creating a german 
immigration crisis 
soviet soldiers who once died by the millions fighting the 
nazis and now must leave the nation they conquered are deserting 
in hundreds and asking to stay 
even jews subjected to hideous crimes under hitler are 
arriving from the soviet union in search of better lives 
all this in a country millions of people could not wait to leave 
last year where pentup desperation brought down the hardline 
communist leader erich honecker 
the uprising forced his successor egon krenz to bow even more 
to the masses and do the unbelievable change history in a single 
autumn day by opening the berlin wall

this is jesse helms country a mostly 
white bluecollar town population 23000 
in 1984 salisbury and other small communities helped carry the 
republican senator to a narrow victory over the states popular 
former governor james hunt in an expensive and brutal campaign 
this year helms is counting on salisbury again as he takes on 
harvey gantt the former mayor of charlotte and the nations first 
black democratic senate nominee this century 
statewide polls released over the weekend disagree on which 
candidate is leading but all say the race is so close that the 
undecided vote will determine the victor 
eva ogrady of salisbury said shes concerned about gantts 
bigcity connections but shes also prochoice and opposes helms 
stand against abortion 
im totally prochoice and that may sway me she said i 
change my mind everyday 
this has been another nasty election with helms attacking his 
opponents liberal record and gantt charging the republican with 
playing on racial fears 
democrats on sunday accused republicans of racism during the 
campaign and a federal judge scheduled an electioneve hearing on 
whether the gops voter mailings are intimidating voters 
salisbury in central north carolina is 79 percent white and 20 
percent black textiles are the primary industry 
i dont really like the way either one of thems running their 
campaign all the mudslinging said donald camp 43 of spencer 
a town outside of salisbury camp said hell vote for gantt because 
he has never liked helms 
race is definitely not an issue among salisbury voters ogrady 
said if anything gantts appearance gives him an advantage she 
said 
hes more charismatic charming upscale yuppie she said 
but jim beck 54 of salisbury said race is a factor because 
gantt has made it one 
hes definitely for the racism he said accusing gantt of 
supporting blacks over whites he said he would vote for helms for 
one reason his 18 years in office hes got experience and 
experience is the main thing beck said 
camp beck and ogrady are white 
two students at livingstone college a predominantly black 
school in salisbury said they believed most voters are concerned 
with issues such as education and the environment rather than race 
i dont think race has too much to do with it but i think 
its an influence said janet ferguson 23 
her friend angie ballard 23 described helms as a flop on 
education but she said she believed some voters would refuse to 
listen to gantt because hes black the racial thing seems to be 
coming back in 1990 ms ballard said 
patricia smith who is 36 and black said of the democrats 
chances i think its possible he might win a lot of things hes 
for other people are for

with polls showing the governors race tightening 
democrat john silber is slugging as hard as ever republican 
william weld thinks his opponent is in danger of knocking himself 
out 
in a string of local and national tv appearances the 
hardbitten silber denounced one reporter corrected another 
demanded an apology from cbs and said weld would cry if he were 
subjected to similar media scrutiny 
on the cbs sunday talk show face the nation silber told 
reporter leslie stahl she had misrepresented his attitudes about 
jews blacks and working women 
the voters out there know perfectly well im totally in 
control and i just nailed you for three distortions on which 
somebody ought to nail you he said 
a stunned stahl replied wow several times observing 
youre angry you sound angry 
when it came welds turn to appear stahl asked are you going 
to attack me 
the former federal prosecutor reserved his criticism for silber 
suggesting as he often has the boston university president is too 
unstable to govern 
just because someone may demonstrate a lot of ill humor that 
doesnt prove theyre going to have the ability to go and change 
the system weld said 
a poll released sunday by the boston globe and wbztv gave 
silber 44 percent to 41 percent for weld well within the margin of 
error of plus or minus three points independent len umina had 3 
percent and 12 percent were undecided 
silber has led throughout in this predominantly democratic 
state in a poll released last tuesday silber had 46 percent and 
weld 37 percent that poll had a fourpoint margin of error 
polls show weld gaining support with liberal democrats for his 
views on abortion the environment and day care 
silber speaking on a local tv station said later sunday that 
cbs owed him an apology for implying he believes jews are racist 
and for saying he offended women with statements about how the 
feminist movement has led to child abuse 
if anything were left of the libel laws and the laws of 
slander i would retire on the assets of cbs he said silber 
also said if you beat up on bill weld a little while the way i 
have been beat up on i think hell cry 
a cbs spokeswoman catherine upin responded we stand by the 
accuracy of our broadcast stahl had questioned silber on 
comments he made several years ago that he felt unwelcome at a 
synagogue because his mother was not jewish 
as the campaign draws to an end silber has stepped up his 
attacks on weld characterizing him as an orangeheaded wasp 
and a backstabbing sob 
weld countered over the weekend the voters are considering 
whether they want to be yelled at for four years i dont think 
they do

abul abbas the mastermind of the 1985 
achille lauro ship hijacking says libya has expelled 145 members 
of his radical plo faction and closed down four training camps 
abul abbas said in an interview on sunday that the move was a 
surprise to him and his wing of the palestine liberation front 
which is widely considered to be a major terrorist organization 
he said the ejection was unjustified and urged libyas leader 
col moammar gadhafi to reopen the camps and the groups offices 
the government in tripoli has not given an explanation for its 
action he said reports began to surface about a week ago that 
libya had expelled the palestinians 
arab diplomats in baghdad said the united states had asked king 
hassan of morroco and egyptian president hosni mubarak to press 
gadhafi to eject the group gadhafi is believed to want libyas 
removal from the us state departments list of countries 
supporting terrorism 
plo chief yasser arafat has also been pressed to dissociate 
himself from abul abbas who has one seat on the executive 
committee of the palestine liberation organization pressure to 
remove abul abbas increased after his group raided an israeli beach 
in may an action that led the united states to break off its 
dialogue with the plo 
after the raid on the israeli beach abul abbas apologized to 
arafat saying the plo chief did not about the raid in advance he 
also said that civilianswere not targets in that raid counter to 
israeli claims 
abul abbas dismissed reports the plo leadership had asked libya 
to kick out his group 
we rule out any possibility that the plo leadership has asked 
for this but some palestinian circles who oppose our militant line 
might have done so he said 
he said that most of the group had moved to lebanon and others 
to places that he delined to name 
abul abbas whose real name is mohammed abbas leads one of two 
wings of the palestine front which split from ahmed jibrils 
popular front for the liberation of palestinegeneral command in 
1977 
based in baghdad since leaving lebanon in 1982 abul abbas is 
believed to have several hundred guerrilla fighters in his 
organization in iraq lebanon and until now libya 
the other wing of the palestine front based in damascus was 
led by talaat yacoub who died two years ago 
abul abbas said two of the camps were places where plo fighters 
were trained for naval combat one was a small town east of 
tripoli and the other was west of tripoli he said he did not 
provide the others locations 
the palestinian leader said his group would continue its armed 
struggle against israel but insisted that the group will not 
attack any targets outside of the jewish state 
abul abbas said that he had no plans to attack americans or 
other westerners despite the persian gulf crisis but he said his 
group would fight alongside iraq if it is attacked by the usled 
multinational forces that have massed in the region in response to 
iraqs seizure of kuwait 
in panarab battles we will carry out our duties alongside our 
brothers in iraq he said 
the achille lauro a mediterranean cruise ship was hijacked 
oct 7 1985 and held by terrorists for two days a 69yearold 
wheelchairbound jewishamerican passenger leon klinghoffer was 
killed during the hijacking and his body dumped into the sea 
a genoa court in 1986 convicted abbas in absentia of 
masterminding the hijacking abbas maintained had merely played a 
role in negotiating the release of the ship in exchange for freedom 
for the hijackers

the governing partys victory in a parliamentary 
byelection helped boost the japanese yen against the dollar and 
push up stock prices in tokyo today traders said 
the dollar closed at 12735 yen down 175 yen from fridays 
close of 12910 yen it opened at 12720 yen and ranged between 
12675 yen and 12755 yen in spot trading that totaled 1356 
billion 
the dollar now has plunged 335 yen in the last two trading 
days but still is above its recent low closing of 12440 hit on 
oct 18 after a 13day slide that totaled 1355 yen 
the governing liberal democratic party won a parliamentary 
byelection sunday despite widespread criticism of its proposal to 
send troops to the middle east for noncombat duties 
in addition dealers said pessimism about the us economy grew 
after figures announced friday showed us unemployment still high 
and leading economic indicators declining 
this fanned fears that us interest rates might be lowered 
further said masato hayashi a dealer with the bank of tokyo 
lower interest rates tend to make a currency less attractive to 
foreign investors 
the dollars decline was softened however by profitingtaking 
on the rising yen said takeo suzuki of yasuda trust and banking 
on the tokyo stock exchange the 225issue nikkei stock average 
closed at 2438533 points up 19034 or 079 percent from 
fridays close 
the stronger yen and a sense of political stability after 
sundays election encouraged investors said keiji arai a dealer 
at sanyo securities 
but share prices are not shooting up because market players 
are cautiously waiting at the sidelines for the outcomes of two 
other upcoming local elections and tuesdays us midterm 
elections he added 
yutaka yoshino a dealer at nikko securities described the 
days trading as directionless and sluggish with volume on the 
first section a slim 220 million shares 
the nikkei index fell for four consecutive trading days last 
week the biggest dip 89894 points came on thursday

japanese government bonds rose to 8505 points from fridays 
8490point finish their yield fell to 7690 percent from 7725

prime minister vp singhs party broke 
apart today leaving the government in disarray in a country 
already seriously shaken by hindumoslem violence that has claimed 
more than 330 lives 
hindu fundamentalists vowed today to dismantle 3000 islamic 
shrines across india they have been thwarted at least temporarily 
in their campaign to replace a mosque in the remote northern town 
of ayodhya with a temple 
the capital meanwhile was brought to a near standstill by a 
strike called by the rightwing hindu party that provoked the 
political and religious crisis 
singh won the endorsement of more than half his janata dal 
partys members in parliament but a large dissident faction 
deserted him today and named its own choice for prime minister 
the dissidents elected chandra shekhar a longtime singh 
antagonist to lead them and said they would request that president 
ramaswamy venkataraman ask their new leader to form a government 
whatever happens singh is likely to lose since he faces a vote 
of confidence in parliament on wednesday 
the defection from singhs governing coalition last month of the 
hindu fundamentalist bharatiya janata party inspired by the arrest 
of its leader for instigating unrest in the ayodhya dispute 
triggered the political crisis 
in the capital today bharatiya janata activists blocked traffic 
by deflating the tires of trucks and buses that ignored their 
strike call 
many shops were closed in some areas private cars and 
threewheel motorscooter taxis were halted 
police were deployed on major streets most parents kept their 
children home from school fearing trouble 
bharatiya janata was protesting the killings by police of at 
least 22 hindu fundamentalists who were shot last week trying to 
replace the ayodhya mosque with a temple 
nationwide more than 300 othe people have been burned 
stabbed shot or hacked to death in hindumoslem riots or when 
police opened fire to disperse rampaging mobs 
the position of the beleaguered singh worsened today with the 
resignation of a sixth minister in his 38member cabinet 
minister of state for communications janeshwar mishra submitted 
his resignation shortly before singhs showdown with his janata dal 
party united news of india said the string of desertions began 
nearly two weeks ago 
the daily lurch toward disintegration leaves the entire 
government in question if the janata dal ousts singh its still 
questionable whether a new party leader can forge the coalition 
support necessary to stay in power india could then be headed for 
new elections four years ahead of schedule 
ayodhya itself the flashpoint for the sectarian dispute was 
calm this morning a day after hindu leaders suspended their 
campaign to seize the mosque after claiming to have reached an 
accord with authorities 
but the stage was set for new confrontations between the hindu 
majority and the moslem minority when a hindu fundamentalist leader 
vowed to dismantle 3000 mosques nationwide and replace them with 
hindu temples 
ashok singhal general secretary of the world hindu council 
told reporters in ayodhya that his group would beef up its militant 
youth wing and expand efforts 
earlier we wanted three but now seeing the government 
operation on hindus we have decided that we will dismantle 3000 
mosques singhal said 
the mosques are those that singhal and others feel are on hindu 
holy sites the hindus want a temple at ayodhya to honor ram the 
warriorgod who is one of the most popular hindu deities 
the bharatiya janata party which had tacitly supported singhs 
government since he took office as prime minister dec 2 1989 had 
fervently supported the templebuilding project its leader lal 
krishna advani was arrested oct 24 while leading a caravan of 
supporters across india to ayodhya 
the party promptly withdrew its support leaving singh and his 
janata dal party teetering 
today janata dals dissident spokesman harmohan dhawan told 
reporters that 82 of the the partys 178 members in parliament 
unanimously chose chandra shekhar 
but foreign minister inder kumar gujral a singh supporter said 
113 legislators met separately at parliament and voted unanimously 
to support singh the figures could not immediately be reconciled 
janata dal was created to unseat former prime minister rajiv 
gandhi and his congress party which had virtually monopolized 
political power in india since the country won independence from 
britain in 1947 
the party was united by little more than antigandhi sentiments 
and the crisis in ayodhya was all it took for exdeputy prime 
minister devi lal a top singh foe in the party and others to make 
their move 
hindus make up 82 percent of indias 880 million people but in 
close elections the moslem minority of 12 percent is crucial

by the time the cheering stopped at carnegie 
hall one fact seemed indisputable a lot of people are going to be 
learning how to pronounce the name hvorostovsky 
thats dmitri hvorostovksy khvuhrahstofskee occupation 
baritone place of birth siberia age 28 
in his carnegie debut program of italian songs and arias sunday 
night hvorostovsky deepened the impression he has created in other 
concerts and on records here is a highly gifted young singer who 
combines a naturally beautiful voice with unusual artistic 
sensitivity and involvement 
he devoted the first half of the program to art songs by early 
italian composers including pergolesi and stradella hvorostovsky 
was equal to their demands whether the mood was light and playful 
angry or more typically melancholy 
but these songs served mainly as a warmup for the second half of 
the program which featured several mainstays of the italian 
operatic repertory here hvorostovsky thrilled his audience with 
all the vocal power one could ask for and a range that carried up 
to the a above middle c 
there was some donizetti riccardos fiery aria from bellinis 
i puritani and finally two verdi showpieces millers aria 
from luisa miller and rodrigos dying o carlo ascolta from 
don carlo 
in this last number hvorostovskys purity of tone was 
astonishing as was his ability to sustain a long smooth line 
without apparently having to stop for breath like other human 
beings 
having roused the crowd to a fervor he outdid himself in a 
couple of encores the prologue scene from leoncavallos i 
pagliacci brought to mind the great leonard warren who made the 
part one of his specialties an aria from tchaikovskys queen of 
spades was heartrending in its beauty 
the excellent piano accompanist was mikhail arkadiev its no 
criticism of him to say one longed to hear the singer accompanied 
in the operatic selections by full orchestra 
hvorostovsky will be making his debut at several major opera 
houses around the world in the coming year la scala san 
francisco covent garden no plans have been announced yet to bring 
him to the metropolitan opera but the folks over at lincoln center 
can ill afford to let this talent elude them for long

necessity wasnt the mother of gary dimmicks 
invention a thief was 
after someone stole a new suede coat out from under him at a 
bar a cold walk home inspired dimmick to find a way to keep 
jackets purses and other hardtolock objects from being stolen 
what dimmick came up with was the lockman designed to fasten 
objects securely to coat hooks or bar stools 
dimmick has invested more than 200000 of his own money on the 
device he said hell have to sell 100000 of the devices on store 
shelves for a month to break even 
im over dreaming of being a millionaire he said after 
seven years of work but it was a fun fantasy 
the lockman which is 6 inches long and weighs 4 ounces uses 
an aluminum cylinder containing a chain to wrap around a hook or 
post the chain can be looped and pulled tight and then attached to 
whatever needs to be secured 
its not fort knox but its not supposed to be said 
dimmick 37 its supposed to prevent casual theft theft of 
opportunity

leaders of the governing and opposition parties 
both claimed an edge today in a hardfought parliamentary election 
seen as a referendum on the governments fading bid to send troops 
to the persian gulf 
the clearest signal though seemed to come from the huge 
majority of voters who elected to stay home 
the governing liberal democrats breathed a little easier after 
the slim victory of yoshihisa oshima a 50yearold dentist over 
socialist party member michiko goto in the aichi prefectural 
byelection on sunday 
the party however backed away from calling oshimas 45 percent 
to 43 percent plurality an endorsement of its troop deployment 
bill which faces likely defeat in parliament 
the opposition parties were less shy they said the upper house 
election was a clear repudiation of the troop deployment proposal 
because goto and the communist party candidate yukiko seko 
together tallied 55 percent of the vote or 1003815 votes to 
oshimas 833371 
furthermore the oppositions strong showing came in what is 
normally a governing party stronghold and the home district of 
prime minister toshiki kaifu the bills sponsor 
this was proof that a great number of citizens oppose the 
selfdefense forces deployment bill said kanju sato the 
socialist partys election committee chairman we will fight 
harder to prevent the bill from being passed 
kaifu whose already weak prime ministership would have been 
jeopardized by an election loss issued an unusual statement 
declaring im so glad that we won as a result of the efforts by 
the candidate and the entire party 
the prime minister twice visited aichi southwest of tokyo and 
his partys secretary general ichiro ozawa went three times 
more than 100 liberal democrat members of parliament were sent 
in to back the partys candidate the japan times reported 
nonetheless sundays voter turnout was just 387 percent of the 
48 million eligible voters one of the lowest figures ever in the 
postwar period in aichi 
japanese voters are most interested in bread and butter and 
the bill has little to do with that said hideo sato 
international politics professor at tsukuba university 
byelections last year when a consumption tax was the focus 
drew more than 60 percent of eligible voters 
a special session of parliament called to debate kaifus 
united nations peace cooperation bill is scheduled to end 
saturday ozawa however said it could be extended 
the public does not sufficiently understand if the government 
makes a greater effort i think we can gain support said chief 
cabinent secretary misoji sakamoto 
the opposition and some members of kaifus own party say the 
proposal would violate japans postworld war ii constitution 
which bans the use of force to settle international disputes 
kaifu has said the troops would be limited to noncombat roles 
he has been under pressure from the united states and other nations 
that want japan to provide more than money for the persian gulf 
forces

fog brings fear for some residents of this 
central florida mining town where state officials have measured 
nine releases of dangerous ammonia or sulfur oxides from nearby 
chemical plants since 1987 
weve got a bad situation here and people dont realize it 
said wilbert lancaster a 27year phosphate industry veteran whose 
son was briefly overcome by ammonia fumes at mulberry high school 
what is it going to take to get them to do something about it is 
somebody going to have to die 
more than two weeks after the last dense fog passed over 
mulberry fire chief mitch carmack still had blisters in his mouth 
caused he said when he tried to take samples of the chemical 
while wearing standard firefighting clothes the fumes he said 
ate holes in his shirt 
the incident drew so many complaints to the city fire department 
that dispatchers stopped logging calls firefighters used 
loudspeakers for about two hours to warn hundreds of residents to 
stay indoors no one required medical treatment 
twenty people were hospitalized briefly from exposure to three 
earlier toxic clouds which can be created when phosphate is 
converted from raw ore to fertilizer 
the department of environmental regulation or the fire 
department has traced all but the latest cloud on oct 21 to two 
of the three area chemical plants 
der blames a royster co chemical and fertilizer plant for an 
aug 31 release and one in september 1989 when 17 high school 
students and the schools rotc supervisor were hit by a bluish 
cloud of sulfur oxide 
the supervisor james gandy said he and the students coughed 
violently and had teary eyes and trouble breathing 
der has negotiated several improvements at the royster plant 
said viet ta a der enforcement engineer the agency also is 
considering installing an additional air monitoring device near 
town 
the companys problem is that its monitors showed nothing 
unusual during either of those releases said royster manager gary 
dahms 
were not denying it he said but we dont see how it 
could have happened 
royster has reimbursed all of those involved for their medical 
expenses and is starting a training program for employees on 
minimizing releases he said 
the company also has accepted responsibility for failing two 
emissions tests and making two improper releases since 1986 and has 
paid fines totaling 40640 in settlements with der 
even though were legal if were making a smell were not 
going to get by dahms said weve got to be more careful 
the release of an ammonia cloud in february that hit a bus 
driver and three passengers was blamed on the nowclosed new 
imperial phosphates plant 
der since has denied the plant permission to resume processing 
citing a lack of proper monitoring and alarm systems

mayor david dinkins office disputed a report 
that federal prosecutors have evidence indicating he used a 
backdated letter to prove he did not evade taxes on a stock 
transfer 
spokesman albert scardino called the story in sundays new york 
newsday shameful and dishonest journalism based on unfounded 
allegations and the mayors attorney charles stillman insisted 
the letter is legitimate 
the letter became an issue during the mayoral campaign last year 
when republican rudolph giuliani questioned whether dinkins had 
paid appropriate federal gift taxes on the transfer of stock in a 
cable tv company to his son 
in 1986 dinkins said he transferred 588 shares of the stock to 
david dinkins jr at no cost after giulianis accusation dinkins 
said he had sold the stock to his son for 58000 and thus wasnt 
subject to gift tax 
he released copies of a handwritten unnotarized dear dad 
letter from his son dated oct 30 1985 as proof of the sale 
the fact that dinkins had once valued the stock at 1 million 
and that he failed to pay taxes for four years 20 years ago added 
to the controversy 
a federal investigation of the stock transfer ended in july with 
no criminal charges but a city probe continues 
newsday citing an unidentified source close to the federal 
grand jury that investigated the matter reported sunday that an 
imprint of a phone number on the letter suggests it was written in 
1988 or 1989 investigators though could not prove it 
conclusively the source said 
the number is that of a mediarelated company that the younger 
dinkins would have had little reason to contact in 1985 when he 
worked as a producer for cbs sports the newspaper said dinkins 
son is now an independent tv producer and would have had reason to 
dial the number in 1988 or 1989 it said 
us attorney andrew maloney in a confidential report 
summarizing his findings for a special city investigator in july 
said he found substantial evidence the letter was not written 
when dated newsday said 
maloney refused to comment on the grand jury proceedings 
the mayors son who lives in las vegas did not respond to 
newsdays requests for an interview

moldavias parliament ordered all 
militias to disband within 24 hours after its president urged 
lawmakers to reconsider laws that have encouraged ethnic unrest in 
the independenceminded republic 
the speech sunday by president mircha snegur marked the first 
time the ethnic moldavian leadership had accepted blame for 
separatist movements in the turkishchristian gagauz region in the 
south and the predominantly russian and ukrainian dniester area in 
the east lawmakers said 
on saturday snegur and representatives of the separatist groups 
met with president mikhail s gorbachev in moscow and agreed to a 
moratorium on the acts that helped precipitate the crisis 
details of the moratorium have not been worked out lawmakers 
said it probably would mean the gagauz and dniester regions would 
suspend their declarations of autonomy and planned elections 
in return the republics government would soften a language law 
that made moldavian the national language and required people in 
dozens of jobs ranging from doctors to hairdressers to pass tests 
in moldavian by 1995 
the language law stirred resentment among russian speakers and 
the gagauz who speak a turkic language and are descendants of 
christians who fled to moldavia from persecution in bulgaria in the 
19th century 
both the gagauz and dniester separatists claim discrimination by 
moldavians who themselves want independence from the soviet union 
moldavia a republic on 43 million people on the romanian 
border asked for help from soviet interior ministry troops after 
an aug 18 autonomy declaration by the gagauz who number about 
150000 
after the presidents speech sunday moldavias parliament 
passed a resolution ordering all militias moldavians russians 
ukrainians and gagauz to disband within 24 hours some units have 
reportedly armed themselves 
in neighboring romania on sunday thousands of demonstrators 
demanded reunification with their ethnic kin in moldavia 
about 2000 romanians marched to the soviet embassy in 
bucharest shouting we want bessarabia back bessarabia is 
another name for moldavia 
about 4000 romanians in the transylvanian city of sibiu some 
160 miles north of bucharest voiced similar demands 
soviet soldiers moved into moldavia 50 years ago under the pact 
by which stalin and hitler divided eastern europe into spheres of 
influence before the two dictators became world war ii adversaries 
we are not giving up our national rebirth our language 
alphabet symbols and so on snegur told lawmakers simply we 
must go back and look for where maybe we have gone too fast for 
our fellow citizens 
snegurs speech set off heated debate 
if we want to be taken seriously as a legislature we cannot 
reconsider laws which we have already passed said legislator ion 
vatamanu 
nicolae kostin a leader of moldavian peoples front said he 
feared the unrest could be used as a pretext by dark forces of 
conservtives in moscow to crush moldavias autonomy 
more than 1000 students marched to the republics parliament on 
saturday to support the moldavian government after a clash in 
dubossary in the eastern dniester region left at least three 
people dead and nine wounded 
the clash began after russians and ukrainians seized government 
buildings in dubossary and blocked nearby roads and a bridge over 
the dniester river 
they are already martyrs said vladimir solonar a member of 
a group of russians opposed to moldavias autonomy drive speaking 
by telephone from tiraspol in the dniester region 
he said black flags hung in the streets of tiraspol a city of 
just under 200000 people and solemn music played on the radio a 
funeral rally was planned for tuesday 
about 200000 ethnic russians and ukrainians live in the region 
which separatists on sept 2 declared the dniester republic 
i appeal again to parents and wives to restrain all hotheaded 
behavior we must be calm and soberly keep in mind what is 
happening and what could happen if we make one more misstep he 
said without elaborating 
lawmakers said they feared the introduction of soviet troops 
prime minister nikolai ryzhkov warned on soviet tv saturday night 
that moscow would take tough measures if moldavias leaders failed 
to restore order he did not specify what measures 
ion hadyrka moldavias first vice president said gorbachev and 
ryzhkov urged that moldavias leadership be altered to reflect the 
percentages of ethnic groups hadyrka also told the legislature it 
should consider giving citizens seven to 10 years to learn 
moldavian which is spoken by twothirds of the republics people

harry weinberg a reclusive millionaire who made 
a fortune in baltimore and hawaii has died at age 82 leaving a 
900 million charitable trust one of the biggest in the country 
weinberg died sunday at the queens medical center after an 
eightyear battle with bone cancer 
he earned millions in real estate municipal transit companies 
and other ventures in a familiar american success story 
last month forbes magazine estimated weinbergs worth at 950 
million ranking him 70th on its list of the 400 richest americans 
his family immigrated to baltimore in 1912 from what was the 
austrohungarian empire weinberg quit school at 12 worked in his 
fathers auto shop sold newspapers on the side and eventually 
parlayed a series of remarkably successful business deals into 
enormous wealth 
he began acquiring land during the depression buying 47 
properties in downtown baltimore alone 
a millionaire by the end of world war ii weinberg began buying 
moneylosing private transit companies in baltimore scranton pa 
dallas new york and honolulu he later sold them at enormous 
profit 
after visiting honolulu in the early 1950s he recognized that 
jet travel would make hawaiis tropical islands accessible to 
middleclass tourists 
he acquired oahu and maui properties that form the bulk of the 
estate and are now worth hundreds of millions of dollars in one of 
the nations hottest real estate markets 
weinberg moved from baltimore to honolulu in 1968 but had 
already set up a baltimorebased foundation for the poor that bears 
his name and that of his wife who died in 1989 
the harry and jeanette weinberg foundation which will receive 
most of his estate will be among the nations 12 largest worth 
at least 900 million and obligated to spend as much as 45 million 
a year said shale d stiller attorney for the foundation 
it really is an unbelievable task said stiller its an 
incredible amount of money to give away 
weinberg left nothing to his son morton said stiller 
by all accounts harry weinberg was a man with little interest 
in anything but business although he accumulated enormous wealth 
he never bothered with the trappings his offices were drab his 
car was 10 or 15 years old his clothes came off the rack and he 
hated publicity 
he didnt play golf he didnt play tennis said morton 
weinberg who lives near los angeles his business was his life 
he didnt waste his time doing other things 
criticized as a callous landlord who neglected his properties 
weinberg revealed a softer side after learning he had cancer he 
announced he would give all his money away and developed a special 
concern for the elderly 
on his final 1989 pilgrimage to israel a nation whose birth he 
witnessed in 1948 he asked to visit several of tel avivs nursing 
homes 
it was a humid summer day weinberg surprised the nursing homes 
did not have air conditioning wrote a check for 1 million to pay 
to cool every nursing home in israel 
before his death he stipulated that the foundation give at 
least 25 percent of its yearly donations to predominately jewish 
charities 
besides his son weinberg is survived by three brothers one 
sister and four grandchildren

military curfews confined 150000 palestinians 
to their homes in the occupied gaza strip today following two days 
of rioting in which at least 185 palestinians were wounded by army 
gunfire 
an additional 350 gaza residents were treated for lesser 
injuries from rubber bullets beatings and teargas inhalation 
according to the un relief and works agency which oversees 
palestinian aid programs 
the weekend clashes came as israel rejected a call by un 
secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar for international 
protection of the 17 million palestinians in the occupied west 
bank and gaza strip 
perez de cuellar suggested a meeting of representatives from the 
164 countries that signed the fourth geneva convention of 1949 
which sets out rules for the treatment of civilians in wartime 
israel is disappointed at the onesided approach exhibited in 
the report israels foreign ministry said in a statement the 
recommendations in the report are directed only toward israel and 
do not see fit to call for a cessation of violence on the 
palestinian side 
israel earlier rejected resolutions passed unanimously by the 
un security council for a un probe into the oct 8 rioting on 
jerusalems temple mount in which 20 palestinians were killed 
the army spokesmans office said eight areas in gaza were under 
curfew today including the village of beit hanoun where clashes 
began saturday and spread throughout gaza 
reporters and photographers without military escort were barred 
from the seaside strip where more than 700000 palestinians live 
associated press photographer max nash who went into the strip 
with the army said palestinians persisted in stoning army jeeps 
and journalists cars in gaza city despite increased military 
patrols 
five palestinians were shot and wounded in clashes with soldiers 
today in rafah on the egyptian border according to arab hospital 
officials 
the weekend confrontations were caused by word that a man from 
beit hanoun died in military custody the army said the man hanged 
himself but palestinians questioned whether he was beaten while 
being interrogated 
an ap survey of gaza hospitals showed 185 palestinians treated 
for gunshot wounds saturday and sunday 
officials with the un relief and works agency also counted at 
least 150 palestinians treated at un clinics for injuries from 
rubbercoated metal pellets 70 for beatings and 130 for teargas 
inhalation 
an army spokesman said military figures indicated 174 
palestinians were wounded over the weekend the spokesman who 
cannot be identified by name under briefing rules said most 
suffered light wounds 
today the army demolished two more homes in gazas bureij 
refugee camp raising the total in the past six weeks to 10 the 
army said the two houses were home to 20 people arab reports 
said 
the houses along with 30 shops were ordered destroyed after an 
israeli soldier was stoned to death and his body burned when he 
accidentally drove his car into the camp on sept 20 
the soldier apparently realized his mistake in entering the 
camp and injured two youngsters when he hit a cart trying to speed 
out of el bureij 
at least one resident in each of the houses is suspected of 
involvement in the soldiers death 
the army has destroyed more than 330 palestinian houses during 
the nearly 35month uprising against occupation of the west bank 
and gaza strip 
at least 771 palestinians have been killed by israeli soldiers 
or civilians since the uprising began in december 1987 an 
additional 294 palestinians have been killed by fellow arabs most 
on suspicion of collaboration with israeli authorities fiftyone 
israelis have died in the violence

fighting reportedly broke out in rwanda 
again after the government said it had driven back rebel forces 
that invaded from uganda 
meanwhile a french cabinet minister was scheduled to embark 
tuesday on a mission to revive a peace initiative in rwanda 
french officials said cooperation minister jacques pelletier 
would confer with several african heads of state including 
rwandas president juvenal habyarimana and president yoweri 
museveni of uganda 
france has deployed 300 paratroopers in rwanda to protect french 
civilians and diplomats and the airport in the event an evacuation 
was ordered several hundred french nationals already have left the 
central african country 
staterun rwanda radio said government troops blocked a rebel 
advance sunday after the insurgents penetrated three miles into 
rwanda from the gatuna and kaniga border posts 
ugandas official new vision newspaper said the rebels captured 
the border posts after heavy fighting saturday in which 35 
government soldiers were killed and eight others were captured 
new vision also reported that the rebels had attacked in several 
other areas in the last five days including the southeastern town 
of rusumu on rwandas border with tanzania and burundi 
the government on thursday said it had retaken five towns in the 
countrys northeast and driven the rebels back into uganda but 
rebel officer lodviko twahirwa told the newspaper other insurgents 
had hidden deep inside rwanda 
the rebels many of whom deserted ugandas army to join the 
invasion when it began last month accuse rwandas government of 
corruption and say they want to replace it with a democracy in 
which all ethnic groups could participate 
the rebel forces are drawn mainly from the hundreds of thousands 
of tutsis who fled rwanda in the late 1950s and early 1960s at 
that time the majority hutu gained control in a bloody power 
struggle in which more than 10000 tutsi were killed about 250000 
rwandan refugees live in uganda

no one could crow better than mary martin 
sure there were other peter pans sandy duncan for example 
and even gymnast cathy rigby who opens in a revival of the musical 
on broadway next month 
but martins cockadoodle was special it started in the back 
of her throat built slowly almost impishly and then roared out 
at the audience 
martin would crow anywhere tony award shows banquets high 
school auditoriums television talk shows the middle of a busy 
manhattan street even newspaper interviews just ask and she 
obliged 
thats why audiences liked her she was downtoearth texas 
friendly martin would dazzle them with her sweet pure singing 
voice and make them laugh with her tomboyish charm and sense of 
fun 
there are more wonderful photographic memories of martin than 
any other broadway star conjure up the following martin sitting 
on a trunk innocently singing my heart belongs to daddy in 
leave it to me or draped over a chair in one touch of 
venus doing a sexy witty rendition of thats him or washing 
her hair on stage in south pacific or flying high in peter 
pan or holding a guitar and singing to all those little children 
in the sound of music the memories dont stop 
and she never seemed to grow old her television taping of 
peter pan the one preserved forever on videotape was done in 
1960 when she was 47 youd never know it the woman seemed 
eternally youthful 
theater critics loved martin as much as theatergoers did they 
would fall over their adjectives trying to find new ways to write 
valentines to her 
harold clurman reviewing south pacific burbled when mary 
martin tells us with radiant good nature im in love im in 
love im in love with a wonderful guy one doesnt murmur who 
cares but congratulations congratulations congratulations to 
you both 
even if the critics didnt like the show she was in most of 
their notices were unabashed love letters wrote walter kerr in the 
new york herald tribune after martin opened in jennie a 
somber unhappy musical imagine having mary martin play an 
entire show with the corners of her mouth down its like using the 
moon not to make love by miss martin forever but not as 
jennie 
martin was a broadway star one of the few performers whose name 
meant something special in the theater she never much liked her 
movies or making them too impersonal 
no time to think its shoot boom if you dont get it right 
the first time do it again she said of her hollywood days 
ironically it was television that cemented her theater career 
making her even bigger box office on broadway besides peter 
pan she starred in a series of classy television specials 
among them a 1953 50th anniversary salute to the ford motor co 
that costarred ethel merman a 90minute program with noel coward 
called together with music and a television version of annie 
get your gun costarring john raitt these programs brought her 
an enormous audience that would turn into her staunchest theater 
supporters 
i hope as i go out im crowing martin once said when 
that time comes im ready for it 
she may have been ready but we werent thank goodness for the 
rca original cast recording of peter pan and the invaluable 
videotape just released on cassette last september those sounds 
and images wont fade

a shinto shrine in southern japan was damaged by a 
fire early today and police believe the attack was part of a 
terrorist campaign by leftist radicals who hope to disrupt next 
weeks coronation 
officials on the island of okinawa said no one was in the shrine 
at the time of the fire which was quickly extinguished there were 
no injuries 
the attack came four days after two explosions rocked a police 
dormitory in tokyo killing one policeman and injuring six other 
people 
if radicals were involved police say the shrine blaze would be 
the 62nd guerrilla incident this year and the 10th since oct 1 
compared with only 27 incidents in all of 1989 
shinto japans indigenous religion is closely associated with 
the monarchy and leftists view the emperor as a symbol of japans 
militarist past 
many critics contend that the nov 12 governmentsponsored 
coronation ceremony which has strong religious underpinnings is a 
violation of the constitutional separation of church and state 
the attacks by radicals have heightened fears that police 
efforts to guard the coronation may not be enough to keep radicals 
from causing trouble a possibility officials grudgingly 
acknowledge 
police in tokyo are mounting their largest security operation 
ever with 26000 officers more than half the tokyo metropolitan 
police department already deployed on coronationrelated 
assignments 
at least another 6000 reinforcements will be brought in from 
other police forces over the next week bringing the total to 
32000 by coronation day 
if they were to attempt an attack on the palace we could stop 
them a highranking police official recently told reporters 
but when they disguise themselves as regular citizens they are 
very hard to uncover 
police today raided several buildings used by japans two 
largest radical groups the 5000member chukakuha or middle core 
faction and the kakurokyo or revolutionary workers association 
no arrests were reported 
about 70 officers many clad in full riot gear forced their way 
into the kakurokyos tokyo headquarters a radical who was in the 
building said the raid lasted about two hours 
news reports said police believe a faction within the kakurokyo 
which has about 800 members is responsible for thursdays 
dormitory blasts 
police would make no official comment on those reports they 
said todays raid was part of an investigation into a separate 
incident last month

thousands of combat troops from the reserves 
will be called up to join us forces in the persian gulf the new 
york times said today 
more than 34000 reservists have already been mobilized to 
perform support roles 
the reservists who could be in the gulf early next year will 
be among as many as 100000 additional troops the pentagon says it 
will send to the region in coming weeks the newspaper said citing 
unidentified pentagon officials 
the decision will be a major test of the use of activeduty 
soldiers alongside parttime combat forces 
the pentagon had earlier opposed calling up combat reservists on 
grounds the time needed to train them would cut into the 180day 
limit they can now serve 
congress in its waning hours last week opened the way for a 
wider callup when it doubled the limit on activeduty service for 
combat reservists to 360 days 
the reservists serving in the gulf include doctors cargo plane 
pilots and water purification specialists 
army officials said combat reservists will train at fort irwin 
calif where they will practice desert warfare techniques

illustrating the ill will against incumbents 
nationwide voters in colorado and california appear ready to limit 
how long politicians can hold office 
the mood is real simple folks are really ticked or fed up 
with how legislative bodies are conducting themselves said los 
angeles county supervisor pete schabarum a chief proponent of one 
of two termlimiting ballot measures in california recent polls 
predict approval for both 
elsewhere voters in kansas city mo decide on election day 
whether to limit city council members to two fouryear terms if 
approved nine of 13 members would be forced out in april recent 
polls indicate voters favor the measure 3to1 
oklahoma voters recently approved a firstinthenation 
constitutional amendment limiting state lawmakers to 12 years in 
office the amendment takes effect jan 1 
a measure that proposed a state ethics commission to regulate 
lobbyists was ruled off missouris ballot by the state supreme 
court on oct 22 
the rush by disgruntled voters this election day to limit terms 
is unprecedented said karl kurtz director of state services for 
national conference of state legislatures 
colorados proposed amendment would impose eightyear limits on 
the governor lieutenant governor secretary of state treasurer 
attorney general and state legislators 
it would also hold each us senator and representative from 
colorado to 12 years in office although some question the 
constitutionality of stateimposed limits on federal office the 
us constitution imposes no limits on how long lawmakers may 
serve 
a survey conducted nov 3 for the denver post and kcnctv showed 
65 percent of those polled favored the proposal 26 percent were 
opposed and 9 percent were undecided 
in california a survey oct 2127 found 69 percent of those 
polled favored proposition 140 the stricter of two similar 
measures in the state 
that proposition would limit members of the assembly to six 
years or three terms state senators and other politicians holding 
statewide office would be held to a total of two terms or eight 
years the measure would also cut the legislatures staff by about 
40 percent and eliminate legislators retirement benefits 
proposition 131 would limit members of the senate and assembly 
to 12 consecutive years or three terms in the senate and six in 
the assembly other statewide offices would be held to eight 
consecutive years or two terms 
however proposition 131 would allow a legislator to serve 12 
years sit out a term and return for another dozen years 
proposition 131 is backed by consumer advocate ralph nader and 
the citizen lobby common cause 
most california legislators bitterly oppose both measures 
if both are approved the one with the most votes will prevail 
according to a california supreme court ruling last week on a 
similar matter 
the trend toward limiting terms illustrates voters frustration 
with inaction on the budget increasing taxes dwindling government 
services and dishonest politicans said jim monaghan a denver 
political consultant 
one of the most disturbing things in politics is that it is 
one of a few professions where people arent expected to tell the 
truth and get away with it he said 
herrick roth a former colorado state senator said the argument 
for reform is simple incumbency in state legislative and 
executive offices is wrapped in its own security blanket and for 
the congress it is ditto in spades 
however steve bieringer director of the aflcios region xi 
based in denver said prolonged incumbency is not a problem in 
colorado 
the states congressional delegation has spent an average of 
eight years in office he said 
one senator is retiring and a representative resigned his seat 
to seek the senate post so the average will fall to five years 
after the election hardly long enough that such a drastic 
measure is required bieringer said

miners staged a twohour warning strike at 
virtually all polands deep coal mines today to demand pay 
increases and protest the effects of economic reform on the crucial 
industry 
the strike called by the solidarity miners union affected some 
70 hard coal mines only four of the countrys mines were not 
involved but workers at those expressed sympathy for the job 
action the official pap news agency said 
the protest was called after months of negotiations between the 
solidarityled government and the miners unions produced no 
agreement on pay raises industry ministry spokesman jan golab 
said 
the council of ministers led by prime minister tadeusz 
mazowiecki was to discuss the protest in the stateowned mining 
industry today golab said 
but he said the demand for pay twice the national average 
cannot be met for economic reasons by the impoverished 
government treasury workers nationwide earn an average 126 
monthly but miners earn 179 golab said 
the miners say their economic situation is worsening and that 
they were promised higher salaries during the 1989 negotiations 
between the thencommunist authorities and solidarityled 
opposition 
the growing unrest in the traditionally volatile industry comes 
three weeks before polands first popular presidential election 
mazowiecki faces solidarity chairman lech walesa in a contest 
focused on the governments economic reforms 
coal is a crucial export for poland and the main domestic energy 
source the mines mostly in the silesia region of southwestern 
poland were heavily subsidized by the government under the 
socialized system and miners received many fringe benefits 
including shops for goods in short supply 
postcommunist poland is stripping away subsidies forcing state 
industries to become selfsufficient as the country switches to a 
marketdriven capitalist economy 
but the mining industry is so economically unsound because of 
inefficiency decades of artificially low governmentset prices 
for coal and other factors that high levels of support from the 
national treasury continue to be required

leaders of christian churches 
opposed to apartheid and those that long supported segregation met 
today in an effort to reach consensus on ending discrimination and 
building a new south africa 
for the first time there is the distinct possibility that the 
christian churches can speak with one voice on apartheid and the 
countrys future the rev frank chikane cochairman of the 
conference told the sunday times 
he said christian churches represent 78 percent of the 
population 
the national conference of churches billed as the largest such 
gathering ever in south africa has attracted about 300 delegates 
from 90 churches to rustenburg 60 miles northwest of johannesburg 
virtually all the countrys leading christian clergymen were to 
attend the conference which began today including anglican 
archbishop desmond tutu winner of the nobel peace prize in 1984 
for his antiapartheid activism 
the delegates will seek to reach agreement by the end of the 
conference friday on what churches should do to help south africa 
make a peaceful transition from apartheid to a nondiscriminatory 
democracy 
many of the churches represented belong to the south african 
council of churches often at the forefront of the antiapartheid 
movement chikane is general secretary of the council 
the white branch of the dutch reformed church which argued for 
decades apartheid was supported by the bible also was present it 
is the main church of the dutchdescended afrikaners who dominate 
the government 
the dutch reformed church now says that apartheid is wrong and 
has no biblical foundation but virtually all dutch reformed 
churches remain segregated the church says it wants to merge with 
its black and mixedrace sister churches but no action is expected 
for several years 
the black and mixedrace branches have staunchly opposed 
apartheid 
two relatively small white churches that still support apartheid 
declined to attend the conference they were the reformed church 
and the afrikaans protestant church which broke from the dutch 
reformed church in 1988 to protest moves away from apartheid 
south africa is predominantly christian with large numbers of 
catholics anglicans methodists zionists and pentecostalists 
there are also many jews and moslems in south africa 
last christmas president fw de klerk called on the countrys 
churches to develop a joint position on the role they envisioned 
playing in the countrys future 
de klerk has promised to dismantle the apartheid system and 
negotiate a new constitution that would allow the countrys 5 
million whites and 30 million blacks to share power

the government faced angry protests today over 
its decision to grant sweeping powers to israeli immigration chief 
ariel sharon who must provide housing for at least 1 million 
soviets in the next two years 
the government meanwhile said the pace of immigration was 
increasing with 75000 soviets expected in the next two months 
about 120000 soviets have arrived so far this year 
prime minister yitzhak shamirs rightwing cabinet voted sunday 
to give sharon a free hand in earmarking state lands as 
construction sites and awarding jobs to contractors 
the centerleft labor party and six other opposition factions 
responded by announcing motions of no confidence in the cabinet to 
be submitted today in parliament said sarah yitzhaki the 
parliamentary spokeswoman 
much of the anger results from sharons reputation as a maverick 
who ignores the rules to get things done as defense minister in 
1982 he failed to inform the cabinet of his plans for an invasion 
deep into lebanon involving israel in its most divisive war 
now he heads a special ministerial committee with responsibility 
for housing the wave of soviet immigration which is expected to 
total 1 million new arrivals before the end of 1992 
today sharon defended the cabinet decision which came by an 
114 vote he said he needed the new powers to speed up 
construction 
we are in a true emergency and we need to shorten the 
bureaucratic process he said on israel radio 
he also accused his opponents of being unpatriotic those who 
act out of narrow partisan motives at a time when the israeli 
people have to deal with a great mission do exactly the opposite 
of what we have to do said sharon 
but some government officials and opposition leaders said the 
cabinet decision could lead to widespread corruption 
among the opponents were justice minister dan meridor a shamir 
confidant and attorney general yosef harish 
some government lawyers argued sharons widespread powers could 
hold up building because contractors who felt wronged would appeal 
to the courts opposition leaders said they feared the decision 
would enrich contractors with likud ties 
with our own hands we are opening the door to corruption 
shimon shetreet a labor legislator said on israel radio even 
in a time of emergency let us not develop a feeling that 
everything is permissible 
the government was expected to survive todays confidence vote 
but its fate could depended on the ultraorthodox agudat israel 
party which has five members in the 120seat parliament 
the party has been negotiating for several months to join the 
government but also told labor leader shimon peres earlier this 
week it would consider voting to topple the likudled government

the supreme court today refused to hear the 
appeal of a texas woman who says she lost parental rights over her 
young daughter because the free legal help she got was inadequate 
the justices over one dissenting vote turned down a request to 
use the case to decide whether poor people may challenge the 
competency of their courtappointed lawyers when states seek to 
take away their children 
justice harry a blackmun voted to hear arguments in the case 
but four votes are needed to grant such review 
in a series of decisions the high court has ruled that poor 
criminal defendants facing serious charges have a constitutional 
right to free and effective legal help 
and in a key 1984 ruling the court said a defendants 
conviction may be overturned if he or she can prove a 
courtappointed lawyers deficiency calls into question the 
results reliability 
the justices in 1981 said poor people facing termination of 
parental rights may have a dueprocess right to free legal help 
but the court never has said that such help must meet any specific 
standard of effectiveness 
nicolosa barnes was stripped of parental rights to her daughter 
christina in 1987 by the dallas county child welfare unit of the 
texas department of human resources 
court records indicate that christina then 5 years old was 
suffering from malnutrition 
doctors said the child was frail and listless and had bleeding 
sores in her mouth one doctor said it appeared the child had been 
starved for two weeks 
mrs barnes husband harold also was stripped of parental 
rights to christina he did not appeal the barneses also have 
three sons according to court documents 
in the appeal acted on today mrs barnes said her 
courtappointed lawyer called no witnesses in the parentalrights 
termination hearing made no prehearing investigation and failed to 
object to harmful and inadmissible evidence 
when an indigent is entitled to appointment of counsel when 
the permanent deprivation of ones child is at stake that counsel 
must be competent or the judgment should be set aside the appeal 
contended 
the texas supreme court rejected mrs barnes appeal last march 
the case is barnes vs dallas county child welfare unit

the supreme court today let stand a ruling 
that barred employee benefit plans from discriminating against 
workers who are disabled later in their careers 
the court without comment rejected arguments by ohio officials 
that younger workers forced to retire because of disabilities are 
entitled to greater benefits 
the dispute between the ohio public employees retirement system 
and retired speech pathologist june betts led to a ruling by the 
justices last year in favor of the state officials 
the high court in 1989 said a state law permitting reduced 
benefits for ms betts did not violate a federal law banning age 
bias in employment unless she can prove intentional 
discrimination in some nonfringe benefit aspect of the 
employment relation 
the ruling appeared to say workers charging age bias must prove 
that reduced fringe benefits were aimed for example at 
discouraging older workers from applying for jobs or were intended 
to force them to quit 
but the 1989 decision was not the end of ms betts case 
the high court sent it back to the 6th us circuit court of 
appeals to determine whether she was forced to retire and 
therefore may not be penalized with reduced benefits 
the appeals court ruled her retirement was involuntary 
ms betts was a speech pathologist for the hamilton county 
mental retardation department when her ability to work 
deteriorated because of health problems she was given a choice by 
the state in 1985 of taking unpaid medical leave or retirement with 
a standard pension 
she was barred from receiving more generous disability 
retirement benefits because she was 61 a provision of the state 
pension plan allows disability benefits only for those who worked 
for the state for at least five years and were under 60 when forced 
to quit 
ms betts pension was 15850 a month under the standard plan 
compared to 355 a month she would have received in disability 
retirement benefits 
the 6th circuit court reexamining the case after the 1989 high 
court ruling said ms betts was the victim of illegal age 
discrimination 
she was denied the choice of disability benefits which would 
have been available to her had she been one year younger the 
appeals court said employers may not force older workers 
involuntarily into less desirable retirement programs on the basis 
of age such coercive conduct constitutes involuntary retirement 
the case is public employees retirement system of ohio vs 
betts 90451

col james rowe near his office at the joint us military 
assistance group in suburban quezon city he said as the brigades 
intelligence chief bernardo was deeply involved in the

sensitive documents and had a pistol but did not resist arrest

in singapore benedicto 73 was a classmate of marcos and among 
the late rulers closest associates

settlement will be called as a witness in 33 civil suits against 
the marcos family

the supreme court today refused to let puerto 
rico prosecute some cable tv systems for carrying the playboy 
channel rebuffing arguments that a lower court ruling unduly 
hampered states antiobscenity efforts 
the justices without comment let stand rulings that such 
prosecutions are preempted by federal law 
in another obscenity case today the court upheld an illinois 
law that lets authorities seize the property of businesses 
convicted at least twice of obscenity violations 
the court rejected the argument of sequoia books inc that the 
law operates as a prior restraint on free expression 
at issue in the puerto rico case was the effect of the cable 
communications policy act of 1984 which imposes mandatory access 
obligations on cable operators whose systems have at least 36 
active channels 
the law says such operators must make available on a 
firstcome firstserved basis a certain number of channels for 
commercial use by programmers not affiliated with the cable system 
once an unaffiliated programmer obtains access the cable 
operator is prohibited from exercising any editorial control over 
the programming transmitted on that channel 
but the federal law also states that cable operators cannot be 
held accountable for any libel obscenity or false advertising 
carried on a channel it surrendered under the mandatory access 
provisions 
in the spring of 1987 a prosecutor in puerto ricos department 
of justice notified cable operators that criminal obscenity charges 
would be filed against all systems transmitting the playboy 
channel 
within a few months all cable systems but one teleponce inc 
had dropped the playboy channel which features socalled adult 
entertainment 
playboy enterprises inc which through a wholly owned 
subsidiary distributed the playboy channel and the puerto rico 
cable television association a trade group then sued the island 
commonwealths department of justice 
the suit invoking a federal civil rights law accused puerto 
rico officials of unlawfully interfering with freespeech rights 
us district judge jaime pieras jr barred authorities from 
taking any action against any cable operator carrying the playboy 
channel under the federal cable acts mandatory access provisions 
the judge said local obscenity prosecutions of such cable 
operators were precluded by the federal law 
the bostonbased 1st us circuit court of appeals upheld that 
ruling last june 
in the appeal acted on today puerto rico secretary of justice 
hector rivera cruz argued that the federal civil rights law invoked 
against his department should not be used to preempt obscenity law 
enforcement 
he criticized the appeals courts omission of any reference to 
the federal laws attempt to preserve to the states the 
traditional police power in the enforcement of laws concerning any 
matter that is obscene or otherwise unprotected by the 
constitution 
lawyers for playboy enterprises urged the justices to reject the 
appeal 
they said the lower court rulings halted a concerted 
censorship campaign designed to intimidate cable systems and 
that the civil rights law invoked in the lawsuit imposes no 
limitation on the enforcement authority of puerto rico beyond that 
imposed by the cable act itself 
the case is cruz vs playboy enterprises 90491

yearend exams to protest school conditions in the black townships 
opperman said the 19 deaths had occurred since thursday but he

the supreme court today let stand a ruling 
allowing prosecutors to punish businesses convicted of dealing in 
obscenity by seizing their property 
the court without comment rejected an adult bookstores 
challenge to an illinois antipornography law 
the justices recently boosted efforts to crack down on 
obscenity 
the court last year ruled in a case from indiana that states may 
use antiracketeering laws in the drive against adult bookstores 
and other businesses that sell or display sexually explicit 
material 
but the court said in that ruling that prosecutors may not use 
such tough crimefighting measures to shut down the businesses 
before trials are held to determine whether any of the material 
sold is obscene 
last month the court left intact the forced closing by federal 
officials of three adult bookstores and nine video rental shops in 
virginia a lower court ruled that seizing their property after 
they were convicted of racketeering and selling obscene material 
did not violate the bookstore owners freespeech rights 
in the case acted on today the 7th us circuit court of 
appeals upheld an illinois law challenged by sequoia books inc 
owner of the denmark ii bookstore in kendall county 
sequoia books was convicted of selling obscene materials 12 
times between january 1985 and september 1987 
an illinois law that took effect jan 1 1989 lets authorities 
seize property derived from or used to commit obscenity 
offenses any business convicted at least twice of obscenity 
violations is subject to forfeiting its property 
the 7th circuit court said the law may not be applied 
retroactively but said sequoias property may be seized for any 
obscenity violation from 1989 onward 
the bookstores owners said the law operates as a prior 
restraint on free expression 
fearing an obscenity conviction that could be economically 
devastating the owners said they are forced to engage in 
selfcensorship and stop selling adultoriented material that may 
not be obscene 
the 7th circuit court rejected the argument noting that the 
illinois law is less sweeping than the seizure provisions of the 
federal antiracketeering law that has survived similar challenges 
a previous attempt by illinois officials to use a public 
nuisance law to shut down the denmark ii bookstore was declared 
unconstitutional by the illinois supreme court 
the state court said officials may not use public nuisance laws 
to shut down establishments that sell nonobscene works merely 
because some obscene material was sold there 
sexually explicit material often characterized as pornography 
is not necessarily obscene obscenity a legal term must be 
determined in a judicial proceeding 
sexually explicit material judged obscene enjoys no freespeech 
protection if the material is not found to be obscene it is 
protected by constitutional freespeech guarantees 
the case is sequoia books vs ingemunson 90454

tuesdays general election in wyoming 
could be canceled if a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of 
the ballot is successful the states top election official said 
wouldnt that be interesting if there was no election on 
tuesday asked secretary of state kathy karpan who is running 
for reelection we might have a problem 
karpan initially planned to fly to sweetwater county to attend a 
court hearing on the lawsuit today but decided instead to remain 
in cheyenne and try to arrange a telephone conference call with the 
judge 
the lawsuit was filed friday by elaine watkins chairwoman of 
the sweetwater county democratic party she claims new electronic 
ballots are unconstitutional because the names of republican 
candidates appear above democratic candidates 
the old ballots had the republicans alongside the democrats 
what happens if the judge rules the ballot invalid karpan 
wondered i hope we can still go forward with an election 
she said today that if she got to talk to the judge she would 
argue that its too late to challenge the ballot format the code 
calls for any challenges to be made in the three days following 
publication of the ballot which occurred two weeks ago she said 
twentytwo of wyomings 23 counties have similar new ballots 
with the republican candidates listed atop the democratic 
candidates crook county still uses paper ballots that list the 
candidates horizontally 
karpan said she is confident the new ballots are constitutional 
she argued that wyoming law allows county clerks to modify the 
format of the ballot from horizontal to vertical in this case 
to adjust to new technology 
in addition she explained that republicans are listed first 
because under state law the party of the us house 
representative that won the majority of votes in that county in the 
previous general election comes first 
republican dick cheney beat democrat bryan sharratt in every 
county in the state in 1988 
the lawsuit asked the court for a declaratory judgment ruling 
the ballot and a section of the state election code 
unconstitutional 
the lawsuit also sought preliminary and permanent injunctions 
ordering the sweetwater county clerk to refrain from using the 
ballot format tuesday 
state democratic party chairman chuck graves said the party is 
not trying to interfere with the election or set it aside but will 
push the issue if it appears a candidate has been harmed by the 
contested ballot

buddy holly and broadway dont mix 
at least not in buddy a comicstrip cannibalization of the 
life of the rock n roll legend which opened sunday at the 
shubert theater 
there are basically two different shows on stage at the shubert 
one a dumb dramatic biography with dialogue that would put 
archie and jughead to shame and the other an elaborate musical 
concert that makes some attempt to show why holly was so important 
to pop music in the late 1950s 
but the man behind such classics as peggy sue thatll be 
the day and others deserves a better showcase for his material 
than a glorified soundandlight show gussied up with elaborate 
posters and billboards featuring advertisements from 30 years ago 
perhaps the producers were afraid to let the songs stand by 
themselves although hollys life is not the stuff of great 
conflict writer alan janes is hard pressed to come up with 
anything beyond a straightforward recitation of the mans short 
musical career which lasted only 18 months 
buddy chronicles hollys rise from reluctant country and 
western singer in lubbock texas to rock n roll star to his 
death at age 22 he never wanted to sing just country a fact lost 
on myopic record producers in nashville only when holly and his 
band the crickets hook up with manager norman petty does their 
career take off 
it would be nice if the show did too but act 2 opens with a 
tedious episode about how holly meets his future wife maria elena 
in a recording company office 
the acting is primitive broad loud and embarrassing the 
jokes are sledgehammered home with the confidence that they are 
funny theyre not 
if the performers cant act at least most of them can sing 
that leads to the evenings one flicker of creativity the 
recreation of hollys last concert the one he did with the big 
bopper and ritchie valens the night they were killed in a light 
plane crash 
the hornrimmed paul hipp dressed for much of the evening in 
blue jeans white socks and black penny loafers sings well as 
holly he even sounds a little like the man and there are 
acceptable impersonations of the big bopper by david mucci and 
ritchie valens by philip anthony 
the songs do have a nostalgic appeal pop anthems that harken 
back to a simpler time when american bandstand not mtv ruled 
the airwaves 
to its credit the music for buddy is performed live and is 
not canned theres no lipsynching and that sense of live music 
can get the audience going at one of the final preview 
performances a crowd of aging and outofshape baby boomers worked 
themselves into handclapping exhaustion during the final concert 
sequence it would be wise for the shubert to have its house 
physician in the theater during all performances 
what other critics said 
frank rich the new york times its too bad that the 
beginning of buddy is not nearly so happy as the ending not 
content to give its customers the 1950s equivalent to beatlemania 
that they came for the creators of buddy pad the evening with a 
superficial extremely talky biographical drama that makes the 
puffy 1940s hollywood biographies of tin pan alley composers look 
like citizen kane 
howard kissel the daily news if buddy the buddy holly 
story were an audioanimatronics exhibit at disney world you 
could praise it for being uncannily lifelike but considering that 
it appears to be written and performed by humans im afraid its 
not lifelike enough the depressing thing is that the audience 
responds as if they were watching an actual concert rather than an 
imitation real fake it seems like an event and the crowd is so 
hungry to be associated with one they go along with it 
clive barnes new york post the premise is flimsy but oh 
boy the premises are jumpin buddy is little more than a 
rock concert set to broadway but what a rock concert i like 
it

the supreme court today agreed to use a 
california murder case to set new guidelines for federal court 
appeals by convicted defendants who say their rights were violated 
the justices said they will hear an appeal by state officials in 
the case of owen duane nunnemaker sentenced to life in prison for 
murdering his estranged wife in 1975 
the court is expected to announce a ruling by july 
nunnemaker shot his wife alice in her home in sebastopol he 
testified that he did not recall the shooting and did not intend to 
kill her 
at his trial nunnemakers lawyer objected to statements made by 
a state psychiatrist but did not claim the psychiatrist violated 
the defendants rights by questioning him without warning him of 
his right to remain silent and to have an attorney present 
some 10 years later nunnemaker began a new round of state court 
appeals arguing the psychiatrist violated his rights 
the appeals were unsuccessful culminating with the california 
supreme court denying him a hearing without comment 
nunnemaker then turned to the federal courts for help a federal 
judge ruled that the defendant was barred now from arguing the 
psychiatrist violated his rights because no such claim was made at 
his trial 
but the 9th us circuit court of appeals reversed the judges 
ruling in may and ordered the judge to conduct further hearings 
the appeals court said the state supreme courts failure to 
explain why it denied nunnemakers appeal opens the way for further 
federal court review such federal court appeals are called habeas 
corpus petitions postconviction challenges by defendants who say 
their rights were violated 
relying on a us supreme court ruling last year the 9th 
circuit court said where a state supreme court does not plainly 
state in its summary denial of an original habeas petition that its 
ruling rests on a state procedural bar federal review is not 
precluded 
the us supreme court in 1989 revived a chicago murderers 
challenge to his conviction the justices in that case said the 
defendant had lost a state court appeal on ambiguous grounds 
because the state court did not say clearly that it was relying on 
procedural grounds to foreclose any new federal court appeal 
the california attorney generals office said the 9th circuit 
court ruling will permit cynical manipulation of the 
postconviction remedies provided by the state and federal 
systems the state lawyers said hundreds of cases each year in 
california will be affected 
the case acted on today is ylst vs nunnemaker 9068

americans should eat less fat and cholesterol 
and more vegetables fruits and grains according to new federal 
dietary guidelines issued today 
the guidelines differ little from the last set issued in 1985 
although the new ones offer more information including recommended 
limits on the amount of fat in a healthy diet 
health and human services secretary louis sullivan acknowledged 
that the guidelines were no earthshattering thing but he said 
their specificity would make them easier for americans to 
understand and follow 
the guidelines can make all the difference between good health 
and illness between long life and premature death he said 
americans who ignore them do so at their own peril said 
sullivan who released the guidelines with agriculture secretary 
clayton yeutter 
both secretaries rejected criticism from a consumer group that 
the new guidelines are weaker than the 1985 set 
the guidelines which apply to people 2 years and older make 
seven different points 
eat a variety of foods 
maintain healthy weight 
choose a diet low in fat saturated fat and cholesterol 
choose a diet with plenty of vegetables fruits and grain 
products 
use sugars only in moderation 
use salt and sodium only in moderation 
if you drink alcoholic beverages do so in moderation 
the guidelines suggest that depending on body size and activity 
level a healthy diet consists of 35 servings daily of vegetables 
24 servings of fruit 611 servings from the food group that 
includes breads cereals rice and pasta 23 servings of milk 
yogurt and cheese and 23 servings of meats poultry fish dry 
beans and peas eggs and nuts 
the amount of food in a serving depends on the food for 
example for vegetables one cup of raw leafy greens or a half cup 
of other kinds constitute a serving other oneserving amounts 
include one slice of bread half a bun bagle or english muffin 
one ounce of readytoeat cereal a half cup of cooked cereal rice 
or pasta one medium apple orange or banana one cup of milk and 
15 ounces of cheese 
they also recommend that total fat provide 30 percent or less of 
calories daily and that saturated fat which is mainly from animal 
products and tropical oils be limited to less than 10 percent of 
total calories 
the guidelines define moderation in drinking alcoholic 
beverages for women one drink per day and for men no more than 
two drinks a day one drink means 12 ounces of regular beer five 
ounces of wine or 15 ounces of distilled spirits 80 proof 
according to the federal document 
in several places they make special recommendations for 
pregnant women saying they may need additional nutrients and 
should not drink alcoholic beverages 
john r cady president of the national food processors 
association said the new guidelines recognize that there are no 
bad foods but rather bad diets 
cady said his group would use the guidelines as a basis for a 
national food label education program to help consumers when new 
food labels are introduced cadys group which represents the 
makers of most of the nations processed and packaged food 
products is leading that effort 
but the center for science in the public interest a nonprofit 
consumer advocacy group contended that the new guidelines are 
weaker than the 1985 ones also they do not heed the advice of the 
national academy of sciences and the surgeon general the center 
said 
this document is clearly designed not to offend the meat egg 
and dairy industries said jayne hurley associate nutritionist 
at the center 
it represents the least common denominator of nutrition 
advice she said this is a bandaid and the american diet 
needs surgery 
she criticized the guidelines for advising people to use salt 
and sugar in moderation the 1985 dietary suggestions said 
people should avoid too much salt or sugar 
she also noted that the national academy of sciences advises 
that an ideal diet should contain no more than 7 percent or 8 
percent of calories from saturated fat compared with 10 percent in 
the new guidelines 
she criticized the guidelines for recommending no specific 
limits on cholesterol or sodium the national academy of sciences 
recommends no more than 200250 milligrams of cholesterol and 1800 
milligrams of sodium per day she said

the supreme court ruled today that someone 
suing more than one defendant generally does not have to include 
all of them in the same lawsuit 
in a unanimous unsigned opinion the court revived a suit by a 
mississippi man stemming from his back surgery in 1986 
the patient billy j temple had a plate and screw device 
implanted in his lower spine the screws broke off inside his back 
the operation was performed by dr s henry larocca at st 
charles general hospital in new orleans the device was made by 
synthes ltd 
temple sued the manufacturer in federal court in louisiana he 
filed a separate negligence and malpractice suit against the doctor 
and hospital in louisiana state court 
a federal judge threw out the suit against synthes and the 
decision was upheld by the 5th us circuit court of appeals the 
federal courts said temple should have sued all three defendants 
together 
the supeme court today reversed those rulings 
the high court said it has long been the rule that it is not 
necessary for all joint tortfeasors defendants in personal injury 
cases to be named as defendants in a single lawsuit 
the court rejected arguments by synthes that a 1966 revised 
court rule changed that principle 
the justices said that while they encourage judicial economy 
and efficiency by suing all defendants together there is no 
evidence larocca and the hospital are indispensable to the case 
against synthes 
temples hometown was not available in court papers here 
the case is temple vs synthes 90295

a homosexual soldier today won a supreme court 
battle to reenlist in the army despite the militarys ban on 
homosexuals 
the justices without comment let stand a federal appeals court 
decision requiring the army to allow perry watkins of seattle to 
reenlist watkins is a 16year veteran with an excellent service 
record 
todays action does not affect in any sweeping way the 
militarys ban on homosexuals the case nevertheless has been 
closely watched by gay rights advocates 
the appeals court ruling in watkins case did not address the 
validity of the ban but noted that the army repeatedly had 
reenlisted watkins while knowing he is gay 
sgt watkins has greatly benefited the army and therefore the 
country by his military service an 11judge panel of the 9th 
us circuit court of appeals said last year in addition 
watkins homosexuality clearly has not hurt the army in any way 
equity cries out and demands that the army be estopped prohibited 
from refusing to reenlist watkins on the basis of his 
homosexuality 
in other action the court 
agreed to use a california murder case to set new guidelilnes 
for federal court appeals by convicted defendants who say their 
rights were violated 
the justices said they will hear an appeal by state officials in 
the case of owen duane nunnemaker sentenced to life in prison for 
murdering his estranged wife in 1975 
let stand a ruling that lets prosecutors punish businesses 
convicted of dealing in obscenity by seizing their property 
the court without comment rejected an adult bookstores 
challenge to an illinois antipornography law 
refused to let some puerto rico cable tv systems be prosecuted 
for carrying the playboy channel rebuffing arguments that states 
antiobscenity efforts may be hampered unduly 
the justices without comment let stand rulings that such 
prosecutions are preempted by federal law 
left intact a ruling by ohios highest court in a nationally 
publicized childcustody case that said the public has no right to 
attend juvenile court proceedings 
the justices without comment rejected a columbus ohio 
newspapers arguments that the constitution requires most juvenile 
court hearings to be public 
let stand a ruling that barred employee benefit plans from 
discriminating against workers who are disabled later in their 
careers 
the court without comment rejected arguments by ohio officials 
that younger workers forced to retire because of disabilities are 
entitled to greater benefits 
the appeals court vote in the homosexual soldier case was 74 
in the appeal rejected today bush administration lawyers had 
argued that the federal government never should be barred from 
applying a valid regulation such as the armys ban on homosexuals 
watkins was drafted during the vietnam war in 1967 he was 19 
in filling out a preinduction medical form he marked yes 
in answering a question that asked whether he had homosexual 
tendencies he was inducted anyway and subsequently was allowed to 
reenlist three times 
after two tours of duty in korea watkins was stationed at fort 
lewis near tacoma 
from 1967 through 1980 he was the subject of three army 
investigations each one was sparked by watkins telling some 
superior about his homosexuality but after each investigation he 
was allowed to reenlist 
in 1981 the army adopted a new regulation requiring the 
discharge of all homosexuals 
a review board in 1982 voted to discharge watkins but before 
the discharge orders were issued a federal judge barred the army 
from taking such action 
seven years of court maneuvering and conflicting rulings 
followed before the 11judge panels ruling last year but watkins 
was forced to accept an honorable discharge in 1984 after a 
threejudge appeals court panel voted against him 
his lawsuit against the army sought reinstatement with back pay 
he would be eligible for a full army pension with four more years 
of service 
the 1989 ruling in favor of watkins did not say he was entitled 
to back pay and implied the army could try to discharge him for 
any future homosexual acts 
but the ruling said the army may not attempt to discharge 
watkins for any alleged homosexual acts that were the subject of 
past discharge proceedings or for any past or future statements by 
watkins acknowledging his homosexuality 
the case is us vs watkins 891806

the supreme court today agreed to consider 
reinstating an agebias lawsuit against the internal revenue 
service by an employee working in austin texas 
the justices said they will review rulings that charles stevens 
iii waited too long to sue the irs 
at issue is an interpretation of the federal age discrimination 
in employment act of 1967 adea depending on how the high court 
rules in a decision expected by july suing under the act could 
become a bit easier or a bit more difficult 
stevens was employed at the irs austin service center for 19 
months before being promoted for a probationary period to a 
betterpaying job in 1986 but in the spring of 1987 during the 
probationary period he was returned to his old job 
stevens 63 said age discrimination was the reason 
the merits of his allegation however have never been ruled on 
a federal judge and then the 5th us circuit court of appeals 
ruled that stevens suit was barred because he had waited too long 
before filing it 
under the adea federal employees who believe they have been 
discriminated against because of their age have two avenues of 
relief they may sue in federal court as long as they give notice 
of their intent to sue within 180 days of the allegedly unlawful 
action or they may file a complaint within 30 days with the 
employing agency and appeal any adverse ruling to the equal 
employment opportunity commission 
stevens waited beyond 30 days before filing a complaint with the 
irs and the complaint was dismissed as untimely 
stevens gave notice of his intent to file his federal lawsuit 
176 days from the date of the alleged discrimination within the 
legal deadline 
but the lower courts ruled that stevens failure to comply with 
the complaintfiling deadline also required the dismissal of his 
separate lawsuit 
the case is stevens vs department of treasury 891821

charles stuarts lawyer does not have to testify 
to a grand jury about a conversation he had with his client the day 
before stuart leaped to his death from a bridge the state supreme 
court ruled today 
the court in a 41 ruling said john t dawleys attorneyclient 
privilege was not undone with his clients suicide on jan 4 that 
threw a final twist in the deeply mysterious plot to kill stuarts 
wife carol 
the mouth of the attorney shall be forever sealed the court 
wrote 
the privilege of insisting that the attorney keep confidential 
the clients disclosures made to the attorney in his or her 
professional capacity belongs only to the client and therefore can 
be waived only by the client the court said in a decision 
written by justice francis p oconnor 
the suffolk county district attorneys office had wanted dawley 
to testify before a grand jury gathering evidence in the death of 
carol stuart a tax attorney who was shot and killed oct 23 1989 
dawley met with stuart for about two hours on jan 3 and 
investigators contend that the 30yearold fur store manager 
admitted to his lawyer that he killed his wife 
the next day stuart jumped to his death off the tobin bridge 
into boston harbor 
officials at the district attorneys office were in conference 
this morning and could not immediately be reached for comment 
dawley declined to comment on the courts ruling until he 
received a copy 
id like to read it before i comment on that he said 
a grand jury has met periodically since attempting to piece 
together details of the crime no charges have been filed 
suffolk county assistant district attorney thomas mundy argued 
that the grand jury would be deprived of potentially relevant 
information if dawley did not testify 
paul leary first assistant district attorney said the grand 
jury which has made little progress in recent weeks has been 
waiting for the decision on dawley 
but attorneys representing the stuart family argued that the 
court would be setting a dangerous precedent by tampering with the 
attorneyclient privilege 
charles stuart originally told police he and his pregnant wife 
were attacked by a lone black gunman in their car after they left 
a birthing class the couples baby delivered prematurely after 
the shooting died 17 days later 
stuart shot in the stomach called police on his cellular phone 
and when he lost consciousness emergenc operators located him by 
listening for police car sirens heard over the phone 
the case intensified racial friction in boston after police 
stormed homes in a black neighborhood in search of mrs stuarts 
killer 
but stuart became the prime suspect after his brother matthew 
implicated him in the crime matthew stuart told authorities that 
under his brothers instructions he drove to the crime scene and 
retrieved several personal belongings of carol stuart plus a gun 
believed to be the murder weapon 
dorothy stuart stuarts mother and the executor of his estate 
has told the grand jury she couldnt waive her son attorneyclient 
privilege and she would not have done so if the law had allowed 
her 
the state had argued that stuart having died no longer can 
be harmed by the disclosure of his communications to his attorney 
and that the privilege should be overridden because of societys 
interest in finding who killed carol stuart and her son 
but the court disagreed with that contention saying that the 
clients and the publics interests are best served by a rule of 
confidentiality that applies both before and after the death of the 
client 
in his dissent justice joseph r nolan said that despite the 
courts ruling attorneyclient privilege is not absolute and the 
possibility that charles stuart did not kill his wife meant the 
killer could still be on the loose 
under the courts analysis there is no safety valve no 
mechanism by which the attorneyclient privilege may ever be 
overridden by the court in the interests of justice nolan wrote 
i would argue the court to adopt this very narrow interests of 
justice exception 
leo v boyle president of the massachusetts bar association 
said the attorney client privilege is of ancient origin and is 
at the heart of the delivery of justice once you bend the law for 
a single case no matter how tragic the legal framework of our 
society starts to crumble the court did the unpopular thing but 
undoubtedly the right thing

allyson schwartz kicked off her state senate 
campaign with a 15mile bike ride and has spent endless hours doing 
whats expected of legislative candidates knocking on doors 
staking out supermarkets and greeting commuters at train stops 
shes also spent more than 500000 just to keep pace with her 
opponent republican sen joe rocks 
theres a lot at stake in this race schwartz says 
the nations political map will be redrawn next year to reflect 
population shifts of the last decade 
most of the work will be done in state legislatures and the 
finished product will go a long way in determining which party will 
make gains in 1992 house races and whether republicans have any 
hope of climbing out of the minority beforethe close of the 
century 
the schwartzrocks contest is just one of more than 6100 
legislative races to be decided across the country tuesday in the 
highstakes battle for redistricting leverage about 50 of those 
races in a dozen states will make the difference deciding which 
party controls legislative chambers that are held by slim 
majorities 
national political party organizations have paid close attention 
to oftignored state races this year offering candidates lots of 
advice and more important money 
control of redistricting is control of your future said tim 
dickson director of the democratic partys major redistricting 
arm project 500 
in pennsylvania democrats control the state house and 
democratic gov robert casey appears headed for reelection 
republicans need to keep their majority in the state senate for 
leverage in redistricting which likely will cost pennsylvania two 
seats in congress 
if democrats pick up three state senate seats the party would 
have a coveted redistricting monopoly and could squeeze out two 
republicans 
pennsylvania democrats think their chances may rest on the 
schwartzrocks contest 
im in the toughest fight in pennsylvania rocks says 
there are similar struggles in several other major redistricting 
battlegrounds 
democrats are trying to steal control of the state senates in 
new york ohio michigan arizona and indiana the lower houses in 
arizona and indiana also are within reach for democrats 
republicans are defending their control of those chambers and 
trying to erase slim democratic majorities in the florida and 
illinois senates and the lower chambers in pennsylvania and oregon 
gubernatorial races in several states including the three 
biggest redistricting prizes florida texas and california also 
will have a huge role in determining who draws the allimportant 
new district lines 
democrats have a decided edge entering tuesdays vote 
they already control 69 of the nations 99 legislative chambers 
including total control in florida texas and california three 
states that are likely to gobble up 14 of the 19 shifting seats 
were looking at a situation here where its vital for us to 
hang on to what we have just to be in a divided or split 
position said tom hoeffler of the national republican 
congressional committee 
such high stakes translates into hefty spending the 
rocksschwartz matchup is one of a handful of state legislative 
races that will cost 1 million or more 
the extra money has allowed candidates in targeted races to hire 
bigname consultants for flashy mailers and radio ads polling and 
to build phone banks to get out the vote 
most but not all of the candidates welcome the attention 
i regret all of this in a way said jerry denbo an 
insurance salesman in french lick ind who may be the democrats 
best hope for erasing the gops razorthin majority in the indiana 
house 
id really rather it be decided by the people in these 
counties he said 
south bend lawyer joe donnelly seemed surprised when told the 
people at democratic party headquarters in washington figured their 
chances of capturing the indiana senate might come down to his 
effort to oust an incumbent republican 
i didnt realize that donnelly said i better win 
its not just in states that are losing or gaining congressional 
seats that legislative races are getting extra attention 
all congressional districts have to be redrawn even if a 
states delegation is unchanged in most states the legislature is 
charged with redrawing its own districts as well 
because of that even getting enough seats to be a viable 
minority or to prevail in veto battles is important 
in the 75member utah house democrats are scrambling just to 
remain a onethird minority figuring if they can keep their 27 
seats theyll be able to scream loudly enough to have some input 
when the state districts are redrawn 
the republicans have promised to reapportion us out of 
existence said democratic state rep frank pignanelli the 
minority whip 
they accomplished it in 1980 and if they do it again this 
really will be a oneparty state

a young woman who claims to have 21 
personalities may herself be on trial this week as much as the man 
accused of raping her 
the trial which has raised new questions about sexual consent 
and mental illness began today with jury selection in state court 
where the prosecution is expected to call to the stand six of the 
personalities documented by psychiatrists 
mark a peterson 29 of oshkosh is charged with seconddegree 
sexual assault which carries up to 10 years in prison prosecutors 
claim he had sex with one of the womans personalities after 
learning she was mentally ill 
under wisconsin law a person with a mental illness or 
deficiency so severe that he cannot understand the consequences of 
his behavior is incapable of consenting to sex it will be up to 
the jury to decide whether the woman in the case is ill to that 
degree 
i have to prove that it multiple personality disorder is 
real and shes got it district attorney joe paulus said in a 
case like this there are always going to be skeptics 
the defense is expected to argue that the alleged victim a 
27yearold single woman from oshkosh is not mentally ill and that 
even if she is peterson did not know it 
judge robert hawley said the jury will be sequestered during the 
trial a jury was expected to be seated and opening arguments to 
begin later today 
defense attorney edward salzsieder said he would try to convince 
the jury the woman was putting on a big show he said the 
nature of the case requires the woman to go on trial as much as the 
defendant 
the woman took the stand during a riveting preliminary hearing 
in august blinking her eyes and pausing each time she was asked to 
switch personalities 
the judge required her to take an oath each time each time she 
was introduced to the lawyers in the case 
revealing the alternate personalities to the jury is my 
vehicle to show the victims credibility the prosecutor said 
they are going to get to see her the way she is she is a person 
of several personalities 
paulus said he would probably ask the woman to reveal six 
personalities 
defendants have claimed multiple personality disorder in 
mounting an insanity defense but legal experts said they were not 
aware of any case in which such a disorder in a victim formed the 
crux of a case 
paulus said the case is really all about protecting the rights 
of mentally ill people regardless of what type of mental illness 
they have 
inam haque a psychiatrist at winnebago mental health institute 
in oshkosh has testified he treated the woman for four years and 
diagnosed her in february as suffering from multiple personality 
disorder 
the disorder is triggered by emotional or physical trauma during 
childhood victims create separate personalities to avoid 
confronting reality it affects about 7000 people in the united 
states psychiatrists said 
peterson has said the woman agreed to have sex with him in a car 
june 11 after he picked her up for a date 
she testified that she told peterson she had many personalities 
and that he took advantage of one of them jennifer a funloving 
20yearold 
during the preliminary hearing the woman summoned three 
identities herself jennifer and franny a 32yearold motherly 
type who reported the alleged rape to friends 
the woman who earned an associate degree in law enforcement 
from an iowa college has other personalities called animal shadow 
and emily according to testimony one of her male identities is a 
bodybuilder named brian 
she told the court that when an alternate ego takes over her 
primary personality goes into a dark place a place of 
nothingness time is not passing there

whenever the military option is debated as 
a solution to the persian gulf crisis eyes turn to turkeys 
military force of 800000 men the secondlargest standing army in 
the western alliance 
under the scenario of a second front turkish soldiers 
supported by us aircraft could push from the north into iraq 
while the allied war machine in saudi arabia attacked from the 
south 
but president turgut ozal speaking to reporters last week said 
any such scenario is a figment of the imagination 
secretary of state james a baker iii who visits turkey this 
week is said to be trying to pin down allies about their 
willingness to fight saddam hussein if it comes to that 
such talk makes many turks nervous 
turkeys armed forces are large in numbers but short on 
firepower some equipment dates from the korean war 
in the past decade turkey has tried to modernize its army but 
its leaders say it has not gotten enough support from its nato 
allies equipment being moved from the european theater as part of 
western arms reduction agreements with the soviets will be made 
available to turkey eventually 
but any war in the gulf is likely to be over by then 
moreover turkey is unprepared for a posssible chemical weapons 
attack from iraq it lacks shelters gas antidotes and gas masks 
and a good civil defense organization 
saddam has used chemical weapons in the past against iran 
during the 198088 war and against the rebellious kurds 
turkey itself has had to contend with a longrunning kurdish 
rebellion and its army spent years doing battle with guerrillas in 
the rugged mountains 
turkey has not a single soldier to send or a bullet to waste 
in the deserts of arabia wrote hasan pulur one of the nations 
most popular columnists in the newspaper milliyet 
despite such misgivings turkey has come down firmly on the side 
of the antiiraq coalition since the start of the crisis soon 
after iraq took over kuwait on aug 2 turkey closed down twin 
pipelines carrying iraqi crude oil effectively cutting off more 
than half of iraqs oil exports 
turkey has also blocked iraqs land access to the west banning 
all bilateral and transit trade after the united nations 
authorized an air embargo on iraq turkey began forcing iraqbound 
aircraft to land and be searched 
as a result of all this turkeys relations with its southern 
neighbor are seriously damaged diplomats and analysts say turkey 
will now have a hostile neighbor to contend with as long as saddam 
stays in power 
even though they want saddam out turks hope they wont have to 
go to war to accomplish that in several public opinion polls 
conducted after the outbreak of the gulf crisis threefourths of 
the respondents opposed turkeys involvement in any military 
action 
the turks also are being careful to stress that they have no 
territorial designs on iraq although they lost some land when 
borders in the region were redrawn after world war i the turks 
had been allied with the losing germans 
iraq cited historical claims on kuwait as among the reasons for 
its attack 
in turkey these days one commonly expressed fear is that the 
western countries that need turkeys help now will forget about it 
later 
once the crisis is over we will be immediately forgotten it 
will be business as usual for the western powers that sold all the 
chemical weapons equipment to iraq said one government official 
speaking on condition of anonymity 
according to world bank estimates turkey is the hardest hit by 
the international economic sanctions against iraq with its losses 
expected to total about 7 billion a year 
that includes lost revenue from the pipeline bilateral trade 
construction business unpaid iraqi debts and tourist revenues 
other nations have said they will help make up the losses so 
far japan has pledged 200 million kuwait 300 million germany 
74 million and france 30 million 
but saudi arabia has not responded yet to requests for cheaper 
oil or favorable loans and there is no word yet from the united 
states on ozals request to lift restrictions on turkeys 
competitive export goods such as textiles and iron and steel 
higher oil prices pushed up turkish consumer prices by 87 
percent in september and 68 percent in october 
the government already has authorization from parliament to send 
turkish troops abroad and allow deployment of foreign troops here 
but most officials believe application of the measure will be 
limited perhaps only permitting us aircraft to use the incirlik 
nato base in southern turkey as a staging area 
although ozals executive powers are limited under turkeys 
parliamentary system he confers on the phone every week with 
president bush and other world leaders 
ozal has repeatedly stressed that this moslem country with 
secular laws is a bridge between east and west he hopes the risks 
he is taking now will pay off later perhaps leading to turkish 
membership in the european community

a deer broke through a banks window and 
smashed three others monday apparently mistaking its reflection 
for a rival authorities said 
it took police and game wardens about an hour to get the 
bleeding buck out of the mellon bank branch 
what happened was he broke one window trying to get in and 
three others trying to get out police chief jack lively said 
a road crew used shovels to break the rest of the glass lined 
up and drove the buck through the window and into a nearby forest 
the damage was mostly blood stains and glass in the lobby bank 
spokeswoman norma buhrman said 
game wardens and police suspect the buck thought his reflection 
in the banks window was a rival deer are in their mating season

agriculture officials expect to declare 
victory this week in the 16month 52 million campaign to 
eradicate the cropdestroying mediterranean fruit fly from southern 
california 
but the continued arrival of illegal fruit and vegetables 
usually carried in travelers luggage virtually ensures future 
infestations officials said sunday 
there is some perverse streak in human nature they seem to 
believe its fun to outsmart authorities and bring in just one mango 
or just one pineappple from hawaii said gera curry spokeswoman 
for the state department of food and agriculture all it takes is 
one person 
quarantines could be lifted by thursday or friday in areas of 
southern california curry said no flies were found in traps last 
month but officials want to be certain the flies really are gone 
before declaring victory she said 
the quarantines were imposed on movement of fruit from infested 
areas the big worry was that the flies could spread to 
agricultural areas and wreck californias 18 billionayear farm 
industry 
slightly smaller than a common housefly the medfly lays its 
eggs in fruit and vegetables causing them to rot 
florida declared victory over the medfly in august four months 
after finding a single fly near miami international airport the 
state spent less than 16 million for eight sprayings over a 
20squaremile area to eliminate the threat as quickly as possible 
our immediate reaction upon discovery of the medfly and our 
allout effort provides a vivid contrast between floridas 
eradication program and whats happening in california said 
florida agriculture commissioner doyle conner 
the fly has plagued california farmers since the early 1980s 
from 1980 to 1982 state and federal officials spent 100 million to 
battle the pest and farmers lost 100 million in damaged crops 
the latest infestation caused a public outcry when the state 
repeatedly sent helicopters to spray the pesticide malathion in a 
500squaremile area encompassing dozens of communities citizens 
filed 300 damage claims and numerous lawsuits 
emotions continue to run high and opponents of aerial spraying 
disputed the states claim of victory 
theyre saying victory because it will calm us down but its 
a political facade said pat reichenberger a former monterey 
park mayor who opposed spraying over his community i dont think 
its over by any means theyll be back 
roy cunningham chairman of the state medfly science advisory 
panel said if the fly returns enhanced detection measures should 
prevent infestations from reaching the same scale in 1980 and 
1989 the state waited too long to begin eradication he said

they dine on canned tuna fish and fresh dates 
shinny up the palm trees on the compound compete in tennis and 
fight boredom 
they spend part of every day trying to keep in touch with a 
secret network of fellow americans in hiding in kuwait and with 
their bosses back home at night they shiver when the temperature 
drops and worry about not having any blankets as the winter chill 
sets in 
there are eight us diplomats holding out inside the american 
embassy compound in kuwait they are joined by 19 private citizens 
who sought refuge in the embassy president bush says iraqi 
president saddam hussein is trying to starve them out 
most other western countries that tried to keep their embassies 
open after iraq ordered them closed have given up and pulled their 
people out two british diplomats the ambassador and a consul are 
still in their separate embassy about a mile away 
the grounds are surrounded by iraqi troops and no one is 
permitted to enter or leave 
but the four men and four women picked by the state department 
to stay behind have kept the embassy operating despite growing 
personal discomfort 
the department has provided few details of life inside the 
kuwait embassy but several officials agreed to discuss the 
situation there on condition they not be identified and with 
tidbits from the public record provided a glimpse of life within 
the walls of the isolated us outpost at the center of the gulf 
crisis 
in the three weeks between the iraqi invasion of kuwait and the 
aug 24 deadline for shutting down all diplomatic facilities in the 
capital of the overrun emirate the seaside compounds occupants 
stocked up on nonperishable food and bottled water laying in 
substantial quantities against the time when supplies would be cut 
off 
at the time more than 100 americans occupied the ambassadors 
residence chancery threestory administration building and a 
cluster of prefabricated buildings that were shipped in after a 
truck bomb destroyed half the administration building in a 1983 
terrorist attack many of those who sought refuge in the compound 
brought possessions and food with them and left much of it behind 
when they got out just before the embassy was sealed off 
officials refuse to say just what remains because they want to 
keep the iraqis guessing how long the americans can hold out bush 
said thursday they have enough right now 
shortly after the aug 24 deadline set by the iraqis 
electricity and water to the compound were cut off the loss of air 
conditioning made the blistering heat almost unbearable and some 
people chose to sleep outdoors to avoid the stifling rooms in the 
ambassadors residence or offices that had been converted to 
sleeping quarters in the administration building 
there werent enough generators or fuel to keep the freezers 
running so the frozen food mostly turkey was eaten first there 
was plenty at first but it spoilednone too soon for some 
compound inmates tired of the steady turkey diet theyve since 
resorted to canned tuna supplemented by rice and fresh dates that 
grow on the compound 
with the water cut off they couldnt use toilets so they dug a 
trench at one side of the compound and use it as a latrine 
there were no showers but they continued to use the swimming 
pool as long as possible sources say it is stagnant now and the 
water unsuitable for most uses 
last week however secretary of state james a baker iii 
disclosed the embassy occupants had dug a well and struck water 
good enough for washing they even washed their cars just to show 
off for the guards and to water the vegetable garden theyve 
planted behind the ambassadors house they have yet to harvest any 
vegetables but are reported hopeful they will have a crop before 
the desert temperatures drop into the 30s in midwinter 
theyre very elated about their new well said margie 
howell wife of us ambassador nathaniel howell who was packing 
to come home when the invasion blocked his departure mrs howell 
who had left a short time before told the nbc today show last week 
she goes to the state department every day and speaks to her 
husband over a special satellite telephone link that keeps 
communications open between the embassy and washington 
the principal assignment of those who remain behind is to keep 
in contact with the 600 or so americans who are still in hiding in 
kuwait to avoid being rounded up and added to the ranks of the 
human shield saddam hussein has assembled to protect strategic 
installations from attack 
the loal phones still work but the state department says the 
iraqis tap the embassy phone lines to try to catch americans in 
hiding to keep conversation to a minimum and prevent the iraqis 
from tracing calls to peoples hideouts sources said the 
diplomats use voice of america radio broadcasts to signal citizens 
to call when there is news about evacuation flights medicine or 
emergencies and the embassy tries to maintain a team of 
wardens beyond the walls who serve as intermediaries between 
the diplomats and those in hiding 
when theyre not working the phones mrs howell said those 
inside the compound work out on exercise equipment left behind by 
the marine guards read and play cards 
actually this is our third war she told nbc we were in 
egypt in 67 and then we were in beirut in 75 when that war 
started

sunrise comes to the persian gulf as you strap 
youself into your f15 fighter jet and roar away from the deck of a 
carrier welcome to the gulf war in a video game simulation 
microprose software inc of hunt valley md is giving wouldbe 
fighter jocks a chance to test their mettle with the closest thing 
to combat simulators highly sophisticated video games 
one of the games f15 strike eagle has been especially 
popular it contains a war scenario in which jets blow up enemy oil 
and military sites while outrunning tank and missile fire 
sales of f15 strike eagle gunship airborne ranger and other 
games are up 30 percent since the crisis began aug 2 when iraq 
invaded kuwait said microprose spokeswoman kathy gilmore 
we think its because of the middle east crisis we think 
people know whats happening over there and our games realistically 
simulate a situation she said 
even soldiers in saudi arabia may soon be at the controls of 
strike eagle one of the game units is being flown out tuesday for 
servicemen to kill time and imaginary enemies in the absence of 
outright hostilities 
gilmore declined to give exact sales figures but said 500000 
computer pilots are now enjoying the f15 simulation on home 
machines in addition to thousands playing the game at 
coinoperated video arcades 
microprose engineer david bellamy who demonstrated the game 
last week for a rapt audience at new yorks noisy broadway arcade 
said its so real you start to feel like a real fighter jock 
he put 50 cents in the console throttled up his jet and took 
off on a mission on which he shot down an enemy plane and blew up 
oil tanks and two enemy speedboats accompanied by stereo sound 
effects 
players gaping around the video console gave f15 a thumbsup 
its real fun said 16yearold jesus malena 
microprose is preparing a more sophisticated gulf war game for 
personal computers the scenario is being built into a game 
tentatively entitled gunship 2000 awaiting a spring release at an 
expected retail price of 5969 
gunship 2000s chief designer jim day said its gulf scenario 
will feature army helicopters that go out to destroy military and 
oil installations while rescuing guests detained at the sites 
playes select types and numbers of helicopters and weaponry and 
bone up on maps and intelligence before their missions no two 
missions are ever played the same way 
day said his researchers combed large amounts of publicly 
available military data for precise details on weapons and tactics 
including the sounds they make 
we are certainly not promoting war or anything but an 
individual using the game as a simulation can relate to it he 
explained 
ted markley microprose vice president of product development 
underscored the point that no one wants a real war 
in fact he said if we could send our product to saddam 
hussein and say let you play this and well play yours then 
lets send our troops home

a 36 million battle over four 
california ballot issues that could shape the course of the 
environmental movement may have bought little more than voter 
confusion 
tuesdays vote on proposition 128 called big green by its 
champions is billed as a pivotal test for the national 
environmental movement it features an ecologists dream list of 
restrictions on offshore drilling pesticide use and other 
pollutants 
but a poll released friday found big green has lost its big 
lead and is now trailing fortythree percent surveyed in a 
california poll opposed it 41 percent were in favor and 16 percent 
were undecided 
analysts say many californians are confused by big green and 
the three other conflicting environmental initiatives affecting 
logging and pesticides 
various industries have spent 10 million condemning it as an 
economic disaster theyve also disparagingly dubbed it the 
hayden initiative after supporter tom hayden a state 
assemblyman who still evokes strong emotions as a symbol of 60s 
antivietnam war activism 
big business and environmentalists have spent a combined 36 
million campaigning for and against the four issues industry has 
outspent environmentalists 21 
foes and supporters each citing expert studies have made 
wildly differing claims about the multibilliondollar impact of the 
initiatives that would control emissions pesticides offshore 
oildrilling and logging 
california poll director mervin field said confusion may prompt 
the electorate to vote no on all four issues as a way of 
maintaining the status quo 
its a horrible mess said a alan post a former analyst 
for the legislature if you try to read the voter pamphlet its 
very difficult if you try to read the propositions themselves 
its worse 
the environmental cause faces other ballot tests tuesday 
a washington state initiative would require local governments 
to adopt land use plans to conform to state growth and 
environmental goals 
an oregon measure would impose tight new recycling standards 
and a second would shut down the states only nuclear power plant 
two south dakota initiatives would curb gold and silver mining 
and regulate large garbage dumps 
missouris proposed natural streams act would protect ozark 
waterways 
a proposed 19 billion environmental bond in new york state 
would be used to acquire land for preservation help close 
landfills and promote recycling 
among the other california measures proposition 130 dubbed 
forests forever would restrict clearcutting of forests and 
authorize bonds for purchase of oldgrowth redwoods the issue held 
a narrowing lead in the latest opinion polls 
two industrybacked rivals to forests forever and big 
green would impose far less stringent restrictions on pesticides 
and logging 
forests forever opponents principally timber and 
woodprocessing firms have spent nearly 10 million mostly on 
television ads warning that the measure would increase fire danger 
by altering logging practices 
millionaire investment counselor harold arbit has given 51 
million to the campaign for the measure setting a state record for 
an individual contribution overall backers have raised about 65 
million 
my banker keeps saying are you sure you want to do this are 
you sure its worth it and i keep asking myself what material 
possession would i rather have versus knowing that ive helped 
save a unique natural heritage arbit said 
big green supporters who raised 45 million say it would 
preserve ancient redwood forests slow global warming by gradually 
curbing auto and other emissions ban oil development in state 
waters and bar pesticides suspected of causing cancer it also 
would create an elective post of environmental czar 
proponents including hollywood stars jane fonda chevy chase 
and sylvester stallone argue that the sweeping measure includes a 
patchwork of legislation rejected by lawmakers under pressure from 
special interests they say it would save californians several 
billion dollars in energy and health costs each year 
but foes including major oil companies based outside the state 
insist it would cost californians billions each year because 
controls would increase gasoline electricity and food prices 
critics add that if it passes it would also fall short of 
goals and become snarled in legal battles

a pessimistic electorate heard the final frenzied appeals 
monday of a midterm campaign in which the governorships of 
california texas and florida are the key to partisan hopes for 
victory 
republican gov bob martinez of florida forecast a 
comefrombehind victory over former sen lawton chiles who held a 
narrow lead in the polls 
i think when the votes are all counted tomorrow that we will 
have been successful and be the first republican governor 
reelected in the state of florida said martinez as he left for 
a day of getoutthevote rallies 
president bush campaigned in texas for embattled gop 
gubernatorial nominee clayton williams whose oncesolid lead over 
democrat ann richards melted in the heat of a long and nasty 
campaign 
i urge all texans to get out there and vote and do not 
take democracy for granted you have a chance to make a 
difference said the president as he campaigned to boost 
republican turnout 
neither party is anticipating major changes in congress 
although several senior legislators are battling for survival 
including republican sens jesse helms of north carolina mark 
hatfield of oregon and rudy boschwitz of minnesota 
the mood of the electorate was variously described as 
pessimistic unhappy angry and turned off what reaction that 
might bring on election day was the major unknown would voters 
throw out incumbents or just stay home 
frank newport editorinchief of the gallup poll said 
americans are deeply concerned about the economy and 
dissatisfaction is at its highest level in eight years 
this is a very democratic mood out there said pollster 
louis harris theres no sign of the late republican surge some 
have talked about 
in illinois democrat neil hartigan celebrated a poll that said 
he was 14 points ahead of republican jim edgar in the race for 
governor another poll showed edgar 2 points ahead 
people feel very strongly that it is time for a change said 
hartigan he and edgar are battling to succeed republican gov jim 
thompson who is retiring after 14 years in office 
at a news conference in north carolina helms denied he has made 
race an issue in his campaign against democratic challenger harvey 
gantt 
i was born white and he was born black and there was nothing 
either one of us could do about it said the senator we have 
not made an issue of race but he has gone around the state 
pleading for the bloc vote he has a right to do that but that has 
injected race into it 
while democrats were optimistic about their chances in the 
florida governors race republicans saw things going their way in 
california where the governorship was the years biggest electoral 
prize 
republican pete wilson and democrat dianne feinstein were 
closing out their campaigns by heading in opposite directions 
wilson flying south and feinstein heading north for a long day of 
campaign rallies 
former president reagan was joining wilson at stops in orange 
county and san diego 
in texas richards spent the final weekend of the campaign 
hammering at williams for his failure to pay income taxes in 1986 
a year in which the oil millionaire says he was fighting for my 
life 
it was a bad year for school teachers said richards but 
they paid their taxes it was a bad year for all people who 
work for a living but they paid their income tax 
bush picked a name at random from the houston telephone book 
sunday and appealed to mary johnson to support williams and the 
republican ticket on tuesday the woman told the president she 
would vote later she told reporters she was a democrat who would 
cast her ballot for richards 
no senate race was getting more attention than the pitched 
battle in north carolina between helms and gantt the race was too 
close to call with everyone wary of opinion surveys in a 
polarizing contest between helms the symbol of hardline 
conservatism and gantt the former mayor of charlotte 
two other senior republicans were battling unexpectedly tough 
challenges 
in minnesota boschwitz appeared to have widened his lead over 
democrat paul wellstone but the chaotic political situation in a 
state where the gop nominee for governor resigned from the ticket 
after allegations of sexual impropriety left analysts wary of 
jumping to any conclusions 
hatfield also appeared to be recovering from a scare from 
democratic businessman harry lonsdale but the race remained too 
close to call 
the best republican hope for a pickup was in traditionally 
democratic hawaii where rep pat saiki was challenging appointed 
democratic sen daniel akaka 
all told 36 states will elect governors on tuesday and voters 
will fill 34 senate seats and the entire us house sen j 
bennett johnston of louisiana won reelection last month when he 
received more than 50 percent of the vote in an open primary 
contest against former ku klux klansman david duke 
democrats control the senate by a margin of 55 to 45 and the 
house 258 to 175 of the nations governors 29 are democrats and 
21 are republicans 
pollsters predict people who go to the polls this year are 
likely to be in a gloomy and downright ugly mood 
a nationwide new york timescbs survey depicted an electorate 
pessimistic about the economy and unhappy with its government the 
survey of 1445 adults reported that nearly four in 10 people 
surveyed expect things to get worse in the country only three in 
10 expect them to improve 
twothirds of those responding believe the economy is in bad 
shape and 77 percent believe government is run by special interests 
looking out for themselves 
ronald h brown chairman of the democratic party predicted 
election day gains across the board adding to the partys majority 
of the nations governors and increasing its margins of control 
over the senate and house 
white house staff chief john sununu said he was ready to declare 
victory if the republicans avoided the losses in congress generally 
absorbed by the presidents party in his first midterm election 
what we have set as a goal is to be significantly better than 
the average result in an offyear election said sununu and if 
we do that it will be a success that average is generally about 
two dozen house seats 
but success in the 1990 election is more likely to be judged by 
which party strengthens its role in redrawing political lines to 
conform to the 1990 census 
governors play a crucial role in that battle particularly in 
california florida and texas which will pick up 14 new house 
seats in the 1992 elections all three states now have republican 
governors and democratic legislatures 
in california feinstein campaigned sunday at church in a black 
neighborhood in san francisco and said wilsons vote to sustain 
bushs veto broke the back of the 1990 civil rights bill 
the gop senator told supporters in bakersfield that feinstein 
ads portraying him as supporting the rich were part of a campaign 
that depends upon dividing california dividing the cities against 
the rural areas the rich against the poor and the black against 
the white

nasa expects to launch atlantis with 
a spy satellite around nov 16 a week later than planned because 
of cargo problems officials said monday 
the air force has not yet announced a date for the shuttles 
secret military mission but forrest mccartney director of kennedy 
space center said the best guess is that atlantis will be 
launched at the end of next week 
air force officials last week delayed the nov 9 launch saying 
more time was needed to resolve anomalies discovered during cargo 
testing they refused to elaborate 
the satellite inside atlantis reportedly will spy on iraqi 
forces 
nasa still plans to launch columbia in early december despite 
atlantis delay mccartney said although the space agency likes to 
have at least three weeks between flights it will expedite work in 
this case so columbias long astronomy mission can be completed by 
christmas he said 
were going to cut that time as short as we can he said 
referring to the period between missions but we will not cut 
down on the normal inspections and data that we look at 
the national aeronautics and space administration would prefer 
not to fly any shuttles around christmas so it can shut down 
certain operations at kennedy space center to perform maintenance 
mccar president bush stumping for gop candidates 
in the final hours before tuesdays elections told voters today to 
ignore analysts telling us everything thats wrong with the 
united states and go vote to make a difference 
i urge all texans to get out there and vote and do not 
take democracy for granted bush said as traveled his home state 
bush wrapped up the campaign season trying to energize campaign 
workers in texas and spur voters to the polls for an election 
looming with uncertainty for the republican party 
you have a chance to make a difference he said as he 
campaigned in east texas with gubernatorial candidate clayton 
williams and sen phil gramm 
the cynics these washington pundits that we see on these 
tiring shows all the time i see all these great 
insidethebeltway experts telling us everything thats wrong 
with the united states 
tomorrow you can go to the polls and say whats right about 
it bush said to cheers at a tyler junior college flagwaving 
rally 
meanwhile presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater said that the 
president would sign later today the 492billion fiveyear deficit 
reduction package passed by congress in the final days of its 
session 
the measure which includes over 140 billion in new taxes has 
created political problems for bush as he campaigns for republican 
candidates after abandoning his no new taxes pledges 
fitzwater said that the president would also sign 13 spending 
bills to finance the government throughout the fiscal year that 
began last oct 1 fitzwater said that the 14 pieces of legislation 
were being flown to texas on a commercial airliner and that the 
president would sign them later tonight in houston 
bush campaigned with williams today in tyler a hotlycontested 
north texas community of conservative democrats voters in the 
agricultureand timberdependent area supported bush in the 1988 
presidential election but bot democrat ann richards and williams 
are hoping to win the area on tuesday 
from tyler bush was heading to richards home town of waco to 
try and pull support for williams in the central texas 
conservative baptist stronghold 
bush continued to keep his message upbeat after saying monday 
that people should ignore all these gloomy assessments about 
the national mood and just go vote 
on sunday williams went to church and a campaign phone bank 
with bush then defended his failure to pay income taxes in 1986 
i was fighting for my life in 1986 i didnt pay any tax 
because i didnt have any income due to the economic downturn in 
texas from plunging oil prices at that time he told reporters 
bush and williams made voterturnout calls to registered 
republicans on a list at a local gop phone bank 
the president accepted a reporters dare to call a name picked 
at random from the phone book it turned out to be democratic voter 
mary johnson 
while reporters watched hearing his end of the conversation but 
not hers bush told her he hoped she would vote for the gop ticket 
will ya he asked in apparent delight at her response 
but the woman later said in a telephone interview that she would 
vote for richards not williams because im not a republican 
i just told him i was going to vote she said i didnt 
tell him who i was going to vote for 
the president also sought by telephone sunday to boost 
republican efforts in other states 
bush gave telephone pep talks to rallies held by senate hopeful 
hal daub in nebraska congressional candidates genevieve atwood in 
utah and wayne gilcrest in maryland and gubernatorial contenders 
arlis sturgulewski in alaska and kay orr in nebraska 
bush urged his listeners to get out and vote on tuesday he 
told the alaskans i get sick and tired of all these gloomy 
assessments that i hear on television and read about in the 
papers 
we have a lot to be grateful for in our country and one of 
the things is individuals can make a difference 
he bemoaned this cynical reporting we hear about how 
everybody is gloomy and down in the dumps i dont believe it 
alaskans have never been that way 
the presidents campaign focus has been upbeat in the face of 
uncertainties that could spell trouble on election day including 
a grim economic picture skyrocketing gas prices tied to the 
persian gulf crisis the promised higher taxes from the new budget 
package and the uncertainty over whether war will break out in the 
gulf region 
bush kept his remarks short and enthusiastic sunday staying 
clear of controversial issues like his support of the taxraising 
budget package 
while accusing democrats of trying to tax working people and 
ruining his toughoncrime legislation he has curtailed the harsh 
rhetoric he unleashed last week 
his chief of staff john sununu meanwhile disputed suggestions 
that bushs heightened focus on the gulf last week was a political 
tactic to get the focus off the budget and economic issues 
the most important item on his agenda right now is the 
situation in the gulf he was talking about that he held an open 
news conference and 97 percent of the questions from the press was 
on the situation in the middle east sununu said on nbctvs 
meet the press

the us secretary of state met today with the exiled emir of 
kuwait and there were indications that iraq was moving to further 
pressure the united states and britain by allowing hostages to call 
home 
also today the uss midway entered the persian gulf the second 
us aircraft carrier to do so in four weeks like the uss 
independence which left the gulf last month after a few days the 
midways presence was apparently intended as a show of force 
the british foreign office said today at least 30 british 
hostages held in iraq called their families in britain during the 
weekend the foreign office condemned the calls as another cruel 
and calculating iraqi ploy 
in washington state department deputy spokesman richard boucher 
said at least 21 families in the united states receivedtelephone 
calls from relatives being detained in iraq 
consistent with other reports we have received many detainees 
said they were losing weight that the food was poor and that with 
the approach of winter they were frequently cold boucher said 
he added we think if he saddam hussein is genuinely 
concerned about allowing husbands and fathers to talk to their 
wives and children he should simply release all the hostages and 
let them come home 
boucher said some hostages expressed concern that the medication 
they were using was running out and that mail being sent by 
relatives was not being forwarded by iraqi authorities 
hundreds of foreigners have been held in iraq and kuwait since 
saddams troops overran the emirate on aug 2 saddam has offered 
to let relatives visit during the christmas holidays an offer 
reiterated in weekend phone calls by some hostages 
other hostages told their families not to give in 
he said the telephone call was being recorded but he didnt 
give two mokkeys and to let the government know that the hostages 
want no negotiations with the terrorists and they are 100 percent 
behind them one briton said of his hostage son british 
officials did not identify the father and son by name 
in brockton mass however a 44yearold woman whose twin 
brother is a hostage said shell go to baghdad for christmas 
despite the opposition of the us government 
if this helps johns morale so be it mary trundy said of 
her twin john stevenson 
she said her twin called their brothers in florida during the 
weekend 
i think it is a very positive sign that they are letting 
hostages call home she said were all planning to spend the 
holidays with john 
meanwhile a british lawmaker said families of the hostages 
should stop complaining 
i am sick and tired of the mewling and puking of the relatives 
of hostages in the gulf and of some of the hostages themselves 
said sir john stokes during the last war we never heard sobs of 
widows cannot these people keep a stiff upper lip and think of the 
country as a whole 
former west german chancellor willy brandt was headed for 
baghdad today on a controversial mission to win the release of 
german hostages and yasuhiro nakasone the former japanese prime 
minister sought the release of japanese hostages in a meeting with 
saddam on sunday 
belgiums foreign minister complained that efforts by individual 
nations to win their citizens freedom are eroding unity against 
iraq saddam is creating this royal court of all sorts of western 
pilgrims who visit him to obtain the release of hostages the 
minister mark eyskens said in brussels 
italy called a meeting of european community foreign ministers 
in rome tonight to consider the continuing breaks with the ec 
policy opposing negotiations with iraq over freeing the hostages 
in the saudi resort town of taif today secretary of state james 
a baker iii met with kuwaits exiled emir 
after the meeting baker said this crisis is entering a new 
phase and while we are still seeking a peaceful political and 
diplomatic solution we have to put ourselves in a position where 
we would be able to exercise any options that might be available 
baker said he had not discussed a military timetable with the 
emir he said the entire international community was seeking a 
peaceful solution to iraqs occupation of kuwait adding i dont 
think that we can or should we rule out resort to force if that 
should be necessary 
sheik jaber alahmed alsabah said he would like to see his 
country liberated today and before tomorrow 
what i would like to see is the liberation of kuwait as soon 
as possible he told reporters 
baker was received warmly in the saudi arabian desert on sunday 
but some soldiers expressed frustration 
im ready to go home one sergeant told reporters im 
tired of eating this dirt im tired of drinking hot water 
the secretary of state told the troops he understood that this 
is a long way from home but added i think that americans are 
home wherever our principles are and thats really what this 
crisis is all about 
reports have suggested baker is trying to fix a date for an 
attack on iraq or determine which allies could be counted on to 
join an offensive if the unordered embargo on trade with iraq 
fails to force saddam out of kuwait

the supreme court turned away arguments monday 
that the public has a constitutional right to attend juvenile court 
proceedings 
the court without comment rejected a columbus ohio 
newspapers contention in a nationally publicized childcustody 
case that most juvenile court hearings should be open 
lawyers for the columbus dispatch argued that past rulings 
establishing a public right to attend criminal trials even over a 
defendants objections should apply to juvenile court proceedings 
as well 
the ohio supreme court previously rejected that argument noting 
that juvenile hearings are usually private and their records 
confidential 
the dispute grew out of a surrogate mother contract in which 
richard and beverly reams hired a woman to have a child for them 
the woman who was artificially inseminated with sperm from an 
unrelated donor gave birth in early 1985 to tessa reams the 
reamses took custody of tessa when she was a day old 
the couple filed for divorce two years later and both sought 
custody of tessa the custody issue was not resolved as part of 
their divorceand in 1987 mrs reams then known as beverly 
seymour sued her exhusband seeking permanent custody of tessa 
the childs courtappointed guardian sought to exclude the 
public and news media from all hearings on tessas future the 
guardian also sought a gag order under which ms seymour would 
be barred from discussing the case with news reporters 
the presiding juvenile court judge ordered the custody hearings 
closed to the public and issued the gag order against ms seymour 
a state appeals court blocked enforcement of both orders ruling 
that they unduly interfered with what it called a constitutional 
right of public access to juvenile courts 
but on appeal the ohio supreme court last june said the appeals 
court was wrong 
after the state supreme courts ruling the custody hearing over 
tessa was conducted in secret last august custody was awarded to 
richard reams 
when reams went to his exwifes home in ashville ohio a week 
later to pick up tessa he was fatally shot ms seymour has been 
charged with his murder 
the custody issue continued after reams was killed both the 
woman who bore tessa norma lee stotski and ms seymours sister 
christine clay sought custody 
county officials awarded custody by the presiding judge last 
month placed tessa in the home of annabelle reams richard reams 
mother the county said tessa recognized her as her grandmother 
even though there were no biological ties 
after reams was shot the columbus dispatch was given the record 
of the august custody hearing 
but lawyers for the newspaper said the legal dispute is not moot 
because it could arise in another case

a london high court judge on monday rejected an 
iraqi government challenge seeking to overturn the seizure of eight 
steel tubes allegedly destined for a supergun 
judge michael nolan refused to consider the iraqi ministry of 
industries contention that the customs and excise seizure in april 
was unlawful the judge also refused the iraqi governments 
application for return of the tubes 
the court refused an adjournment request by lawyer bernard 
cunningham who represented the iraqi ministry 
cunningham said his instructions from baghdad were to seek an 
adjournment until the situation in the middle east was clearer 
and communications restored to normal 
a previous adjournment had already been granted because of the 
aug 2 invasion of kuwait by iraq 
nolan said the appropriate way for the iraqi ministry to 
challenge the seizure was to contest customs and excise proceedings 
to validate the seizure which are scheduled to begin within the 
next few weeks 
iraq and the manufacturer sheffield forgemasters have insisted 
the tubes were for a petrochemical plant and not a longrange 
weapon

wouldbe beauty queens may not swim with 
captive dolphins except possibly at four designated aquariums the 
national oceanic and atmospheric administration said monday 
noaa said the marinelife oceanarium in gulfport miss was 
issued a written warning because it allowed several contestants 
from the miss teen usa contest to swim with its dolphins on july 
2 
william w fox jr assistant administrator of noaas national 
marine fisheries service said in a statement that similar 
violations could bring fines or loss of permits allowing the 
display of captive animals 
marinelifes curator moby solangi issued a statement saying 
the fisheries service wasted taxpayers money by investigating the 
miss teen usa affair 
it is clear they are responding to emotionalism of animal 
rights extremists he said adding that he did not believe 
marinelife had violated any regulations 
miss teen usa contestants joined the dolphins for the filming 
of a segment that was to be shown during the pageants broadcast 
after the investigation was announced pageant officials dropped 
the dolphin segment 
ronnie salters a leader of citizens for marine mammal 
protection called the warning a fair decision 
we didnt really expect them to give any fine or anything like 
that he said 
programs in which tourists are invited to swim with dolphins 
have been criticized as possibly harmful to both the dolphins and 
the people 
only four facilities in the united states not including 
marinelife have permits allowing swimwiththedolphin programs 
even at those four aquariums provisions were tightened in a 
ruling this summer to protect the dolphins and to warn the public 
of the risks of injury the noaa announcement said

a federal judge today declined to set bail for 
joseph doherty the irish revoltionary who has been jailed in new 
york for more than seven years 
us district judge miriam g cedarbaum ruled that doherty would 
likely flee if his release were approved 
the evidence is overwhelming that petitioner if released 
would pose such a substantial risk of flight that no condition of 
bail could reasonably assure his surrender for deportation 
cedarbaum said in a 23page decision 
doherty 35 faces alife sentence in the united kingdom for the 
murder of a british officer killed in a gunfight between british 
troops and dohertys fourman ira unit 
he escaped from a prison in northern ireland in 1981 and came to 
the united states a year later he was arrested in new york in 1983 
and has been imprisoned in a manhattan jail since then 
doherty has never been charged with a crime in the united 
states hes been held without bail the entire time 
a call to his attorneys was not immediately returned today 
dohertys request for bail was made in the form of a writ of 
habeus corpus which claimed his constitutional right to due 
process was violated by his lengthy imprisonment 
he had sought release on bail while continuing efforts to fight 
deportation and gain political asylum in the united states 
while conceding that the length of his detention was extremely 
troubling the judge rejected the argument that dohertys 
constitutional rights were violated 
she noted that many of the constitutional protections given 
people accused of crimes did not apply to aliens in deportation 
proceedings 
she also ruled that the us government was not responsible for 
delaying his deportation proceedings to the contrary his own 
strategic maneuvers have caused significant delays cedarbaum 
said 
she said dohertys continued detention continues to serve the 
valid regulatory purpose of keeping him available for 
deportation 
cedarbaums ruling followed a hearing held over several days in 
september and october during which doherty testified that he was 
no longer a member of the ira 
he had promised the judge that he would abide by any conditions 
of bail and would willingly return to the united kingdom if he lost 
his bid for asylum 
the us government which opposed dohertys release called as 
a witness an expert on terrorism who testified that ira membership 
was a cradle to grave proposition 
the almost exclusively roman catholic ira is fighting to push 
the british out of protestantdominated northern ireland join it 
with the republic of ireland and set up an allireland socialist 
state

black students demanding a 
boycott of final exams to protest school conditions clashed with 
pupils who wanted to take the tests leaving up to 19 people dead 
police said monday 
ten more blacks were killed in other township violence 
including eight apparently caught in a feud between competing taxi 
companies police reported 
the student violence in bekkersdal outside johannesburg began 
thursday and lasted through the weekend it was unclear if all 19 
deaths were the result of student clashes but police capt eugene 
opperman said he believed most were 
according to police students opposed to the yearend exams had 
been trying to prevent other students from taking the standardized 
tests which determine whether students may proceed onto the next 
grade or gain admission to universities 
last year less than half of the black students passed the 
tests compared with a pass rate of more than 90 percent for white 
students 
the whiteled government spends five times as much to educate a 
white pupil as a black pupil in south africa and antiapartheid 
activists have complained for years about problems in the black 
schools 
opperman said not all the people involved in the bekkersdal 
clashes were students he said one body was found monday but it 
was unclear when the person died he also did not know when the 
other 18 deaths occurred 
police used tear gas monday to disperse stonethrowers opperman 
said there were reports of arson and one youth was seriously 
wounded in a stabbing police capt henriette bester said 
also monday police said eight people died when men in vans 
randomly stabbed and shot people sunday in the township of 
kutloanong 140 miles southwest of johannesburg 
they were believed to have been victims of a feud between taxi 
companies that began fighting each other last week in kutloanong 
before sundays attacks three people had died in the taxi war 
there are an estimated 100000 privately owned taxivans 
operating in black areas nationwide and violent disputes over 
routes and passengers occur regularly 
also the daily police unrest report said one man died in the 
township of alexandra outside johannesburg another man was 
stabbed to death in mganga baboyi a township in the eastern 
province of natal the unrest report added it did not say when 
those deaths occurred

to fight it and on their view of a future south africa

eighteen european nations on monday agreed to keep 
carbon dioxide emissions in their nations at 1990 levels to curb 
the threat of global warming they also pledged to urge other 
countries to follow suit 
but the draft of a ministerial declaration that will conclude a 
10day un conference on global warming indicated that 
washingtons slower approach to controlling emissions is likely to 
prevail in the final document wednesday 
the united states has argued that in view of the great cost of 
limiting greenhouse gas emissions more research is needed before 
drastic measures are taken 
the target of limiting carbon dioxide emissions to 1990 levels 
by the year 2000 was set at a joint meeting of the environment 
ministers of the 12nation european community and sixnation 
european free trade association 
a joint statement invited all industralized nations to take 
similar action 
scientists have identified carbon dioxide as the main 
contributor to the socalled greenhouse effect induced by 
heattrapping gases other greenhouse gases are methane nitrous 
oxide and chlorofluorocarbons 
industrialized nations contribute threequarters of all manmade 
greenhouse gases 
carlo ripa de meana the ec environment commissioner said the 
accord strengthened the european position at the conference 
attended by about 700 scientists from about 100 nations 
ministers from more than 80 countries including several heads 
of government are expected at the twoday windup of the un 
conference the session will set the stage for formal negotiations 
in washington next february on an international treaty on global 
warming 
europeans are leading in this battle ripa de meana said 
the question of how to persuade the united states and the soviet 
union will be a central task of this conference 
but environmental groups attending the conference said the 
europeans already had backed away from earlier proposals 
jeremy leggett of greenpeace britain said he thought some 
governments would strip the final document of any targets he said 
the united states the soviet union and saudi arabia were the 
principal opponents to swift action 
the 30point draft declaration circulated monday avoids setting 
targets and makes no firm commitments toward reducing the 
greenhouse effect scientists at the conference have said immediate 
action is needed 
the draft declaration said that over the past decade a clear 
scientific consensus has emerged on global warming expected to 
occur in the next century 
in a paper approved unanimously on saturday scientists agreed 
that by the year 2005 many industrialized nations would be able to 
cut their output of carbon dioxide by at least 20 percent 
a preliminary ec text had initially proposed that the 
ministerial declaration to be issued at the close of the 
conference on wednesday should set targets for industrialized 
countries to stabilize emissions 
the latest draft welcomes the european accord on carbon 
dioxide stabilization but omits any reference to targets for other 
countries 
other developed countries are urged to establish targets 
andor feasible national programs or strategies which will have 
significant effects on limiting emissions 
this waffle lets the united states off the hook said 
steward boyle of the climate action network another environmental 
group it means 18 months of doing nothing needless to say the 
united states is delighted 
the international treaty on global warming will be signed in 
mid1992 at a conference in rio de janeiro

government hospitals turned away 
patients monday as 10000 doctors went on strike to protest the 
government health policy 
only critical cases were being treated during the 24hour 
strike said mostafa jll mohiuddin of the bangladesh medical 
association but an indefinite strike may be called if the 
government ignores the protest he said 
the doctors want government supporters to quit the eightmember 
committee set up by president hussain muhammad ershad to forumalte 
health policy 
the committee was appointed after a twomonth strike that 
doctors called earlier this year when the government tried to ban 
private practice 
in a separate antigovernment action about 3000 people 
demonstrated outside the radio and television centers against what 
they called government propaganda on the staterun media 
the protests were part of an ongoing campaign to pressure ershad 
to resign and to hold free elections 
one demonstration by 1500 protesters at the radio center was 
led by sheik hasina head of the awami league and one of two main 
opposition politicians 
the other opposition figure khaleda zia of the bangladesh 
nationalist party led about 1000 people in a demonstration at a 
television center on the outskirts of dhaka about 500 people 
joined separate protests 
ershad seized power in a bloodless military coup in 1982 the 
opposition says three elections since then were rigged to keep him 
in office 
the opposition campaign began in earnest in november 1987 and 
flares up periodically the campaign was renewed in midoctober 
when eight people were killed by police during demonstrations 
there are no private radio or television stations in bangladesh

the reverend jesse jackson urged iraqs 
ambassador monday to persuade his government to provide food 
electricity and water to the us embassy in kuwait 
jackson who visited iraq in august shortly after the country 
invaded kuwait said the iraqis could improve the diplomatic 
climate by resupplying the american embassy in kuwait 
it would cost you little and gain a great deal if you were to 
allow basic supplies and amenities such as water and electricity to 
the people in those restricted quarters jackson said in a letter 
he sent to iraqi president saddam hussein earlier this month 
jackson reiterated his request in a 20minute meeting with iraqi 
ambassador mohamed almashat during which he also asked the iraqis 
to arrange an airlift so that american hostages in iraq and kuwait 
could be home by christmas 
almashat told reporters after the meeting that he had relayed 
jacksons message to baghdad he also repeated iraqs pledge that 
it will release all foreign hostages if the un security council 
or two of five nations france the soviet union china germany 
and japan guarantee there will be no attack on iraq 
to bolster his plea jackson said his group the national 
rainbow coalition would circulate a petition seeking to have iraq 
send supplies to the embassy 
eight diplomats and 19 other americans are trapped at the 
embassy in kuwait where conditions are said to be deteriorating 
rapidly 
the lights are off all refrigerators are off water is 
off and supplies are quickly running out jackson said the 
americans are digging trenches to use as latrines he said 
jackson echoed the us position that iraq withdraw from kuwait 
and restore that countrys sovereign leaders 
but he said it was his impression that the iraqis might be 
inclined to seek a diplomatic solution if both sides could tone 
down their rhetoric 
maximum rhetoric begets maximum rhetoric jackson said 
referring to the tough line recently taken by president bush and 
his secretary of state james a baker iii

former contra rebels staging a hunger 
strike in a managua church have joined others protesting that the 
government has reneged on promises of aid to the demobilized 
antisandinista guerrillas 
about 200 former contras blocked the rama road the only 
overland route into southeastern nicaragua for the sixth day 
cutting off a chunk of the region from the rest of the country 
the church occupation which began sunday was the latest action 
by the former rebels to pressure president violeta chamorros 
government into coming through with programs designed to help the 
fighters rejoin civilian life 
other recent contra actions included looting government 
warehouses in the atlantic coast town of puerto cabezas a shootout 
with police in northern waslala and taking over the sandinista 
front headquarters in northern quilali 
in the same way that they the government pressured us to 
disarm were pressuring them to give us answers to our problems 
said former rebel william castellon one of seven men occupying the 
santo domingo church 
castellon said he was political adviser to the disbanded 
democratic revolutionary alliance which fought on nicaraguas 
southern front and was directed by dissident nicaraguans based in 
costa rica 
hunger strikers allowed some reporters into the church 
lt consuelo solorzano a spokeswoman at the interior ministry 
said police had not tried to dislodge the dissidents because church 
officials have not requested help 
but police patrolled the neighborhood on the outskirts of 
managua 
the former guerrillas say the government has failed to hand over 
promised land food medicines and building materials 
about 20000 contras finished disarming in june after mrs 
chamorro and her 14party coalition defeated the sandinistas in 
feb 25 elections they were promised aid in exchange for turning 
in their weapons 
violence still is a risk to democracy in nicaragua cardinal 
miguel obando y bravo the archbishop of managua said in his 
sermon sunday at his santo domingo church just before the contras 
occupied it 
obando said the government must make an effort to speed up 
fulfillment of its promises 
after the mass ended seven men walked into the church and 
declared themselves on a hunger strike 
carlos hurtado assassin of peasants in yolaina read a 
handwritten poster that hunger strikers tacked to the closed 
church doors 
hurtado is minister of the interior the department that 
controls police 
one person died and 14 were wounded in the southcentral village 
of yolaina last week when police and soldiers still controlled by 
the sandinistas opened fire during a protest march 
castellon said the former rebels also wanted mrs chamorros 
government to disband the sandinista police and army 
the contras resent having had to demobilize while the sandinista 
police and sandinista peoples army remain the official law 
enforcement and military forces in nicaragua 
that resentment is compounded because mrs chamorros prous 
government allows both forces to retain the name of the leftist 
sandinista front the contras enemy during nine years of guerrilla 
war 
two weeks ago the interior ministry responding to contra 
pressure ordered that authority in rio blanco in northcentral 
nicaragua be turned over to the rural police a government force 
made up of demobilized contras 
the contra blockade of the rama road which is also the only 
overland route into the atlantic coast town of bluefields began 
wednesday protestors there are demanding land and the withdrawal 
of sandinista police from the region

in the worlds largest oilproducing region he named no specific 
nations 
asked if he thought war was imminent hussein responded if 
its going to happen it will be very imminent but i dont wish 
it 
if we look at the situation on the ground there exists the 
possibility of an incident happening either by accident or on 
purpose hussein said 
jordan would suffer enormously in a war and already is affected 
by the un embargo against iraq his countrys largest trading 
partner hussein said the embargo was imposed after iraqi troops 
occupied kuwait on aug 2 
hussein described his talks with mitterrand as positive and 
underscored what he called common efforts by france and jordan 
to find a peaceful solution to the middle easts problems 
hussein urged an arab solution to the crisis something 
mitterrand has said offers little chance of success presidential

dietary guidelines published by the federal 
government monday look a lot like the old ones eat more 
vegetables less fat sugar and salt but there should be a 
greater effect this time 
the guidelines will cause changes in school lunches eaten by 
millions of young americans and in meals for mothers in government 
feeding programs 
the recommendations said health secretary louis sullivan are 
also more specific than guidelines issued in 1980 and 1985 
the new ones include more positive advice oriented to the 
total diet with clear wording and specific numbers he said 
for example the 27page booklet of guidelines being distributed 
by the government says americans should get 30 percent or less of 
their calories from fat with only 10 percent of that from animal 
fat and tropical oils 
other guidelines 
eat two or three servings daily of meat poultry fish dry 
beans or eggs but no more than 6 ounces a day 
trim fat from meat remove the skin from poultry and have 
cooked dry beans and peas instead of meat occasionally 
have two or three servings of milk and dairy products daily a 
serving is one cup of milk or yogurt or about 1 ounces of cheese 
have three or more servings of vegetables daily eating 
darkgreen leafy and deepyellow vegetables dry beans and peas 
often also eat starchy vegetables such as potatoes and corn 
eat two or more servings of fruit such as one medium apple an 
orange or a banana daily 
use sugar and salt in moderation 
if you drink alcoholic beverages do so in moderation 
the guidelines define moderation in drinking alcoholic beverages 
as one drink per day for women and no more than two drinks a day 
for men one drink means 12 ounces of regular beer five ounces of 
wine or 15 ounces of distilled spirits 80 proof 
agriculture secretary clayton yeutter said the new guidelines 
would influence the national school lunch program run by usda and 
the women infant and children program which provides food 
vouchers for food and nutritional information to poor pregnant 
women nursing mothers and their babies 
we reach a large segment of the public with our food 
programs said yeutter who released the guidelines at a press 
conference with sullivan 
as children begin to eat with the family usually at about 2 
years of age they should be encouraged to choose diets that are 
lower in fat and saturated fat and that provide the calories and 
nutrients they need for normal growth says the pamphlet 
whats revolutionary in the new recommendations says the 
american school food service association is that the government is 
applying the guidelines to children for the first time 
anne gennings president of the school food service association 
said schools across the country already offer a variety of food 
choices lower in fat sugar and sodium the report reinforces that 
effort she said 
but ellen haas executive director of public voice for food and 
health policy said the government could do more 
whats important now is not focusing on the guidelines 
themselves but concrete action plans for translating the 
guidelines she said advocating laws or regulations requiring 
schools to cut meals to no more than 30 percent fat for example 
the center for science in the public interest also was critical 
saying the guidelines were weak and devoid of the urgency that 
the situation deserves 
the governments mealymouthed advice can hardly be expected 
to spur the major overhaul in eating habits that most americans 
should make said jane hurley the nonprofit groups associate 
nutritionist 
food industry organizations however were supportive 
the salt institute is pleased that the revised dietary 
guidelines now encourage americans to use salt or sodium in 
moderation said the trade group which opposed the words 
avoid salt in the 1985 guidelines 
the american meat institute said the guidelines were a prudent 
road map to healthy delicious and varied diets that provide 
ample room for all foods from all food groups to be included in 
americans diets 
todays lean trimmed beef fits well into the kinds of diets 
being recommended said the national cattlemens association

former west german chancellor willy brandt 
arrived in this capital monday night on a personal mission to win 
the release of hundreds of iraqiheld hostages 
the british government has criticized the effort and brandt has 
been unable to stir up much support outside germany for the trip 
the german government says it backs the journey even though the 
12nation european economic community last week stated there should 
be no negotiations with baghdad on hostages

going to baghdad as a representative of chancellor helmut kohls

negotiate with him

about 250 people bearing flowers and letters from relatives of the 
estimated 400 german hostages

visit iraq on missions to win freedom for hostages known as 
guests in iraq and try to find a peaceful solution to the 
threemonthold persian gulf crisis 
at the same time however he said i hope i can help people 
held captive there and not just our own germans the newspaper

the supreme court on monday refused to allow 
the prosecution of some puerto rico cable tv systems that carry the 
playboy channel rejecting arguments that states antiobscenity 
efforts may be hampered unduly 
the justices without comment left intact rulings that such 
prosecutions are preempted by federal law 
in a separate case the court let stand a ruling that lets 
prosecutors punish businesses convicted of dealing in obscenity by 
seizing their property 
the court again without comment rejected an adult bookstores 
challenge to an illinois antipornography law 
at issue in the cable tv case was the effect of the cable 
communications policy act of 1984 which imposes mandatory access 
obligations on cable operators whose systems have at least 36 
active channels 
the law says such operators must make available on a 
firstcome firstserved basis a certain number of channels for 
commercial use by programmers not affiliated with the cable system 
once an unaffiliated programmer obtains access the cable 
operator is prohibited from exercising any editorial control over 
the programming transmitted on that channel 
but the federal law also states that cable operators cannot be 
held accountable for any libel obscenity or false advertising 
carried on a channel it surrendered under the mandatory access 
provisions 
in the spring of 1987 a prosecutor in puerto ricos department 
of justice notified cable operators that criminal obscenity charges 
would be filed against all systems transmitting the playboy 
channel 
within a few months all cable systems but one teleponce inc 
had dropped the playboy channel which features socalled adult 
entertainment 
playboy enterprises inc which through a wholly owned 
subsidiary distributed the playboy channel and the puerto rico 
cable television association a trade group then sued the island 
commonwealths department of justice 
the suit invoking a federal civil rights law accused puerto 
rico officials of unlawfully interfering with freespeech rights 
us district judge jaime pieras jr barred authorities from 
taking any action against any cable operator carrying the playboy 
channel under the federal cable acts mandatory access provisions 
the judge said local obscenity prosecutions of such cable 
operators were precluded by the federal law 
the bostonbased 1st us circuit court of appeals upheld that 
ruling last june 
in the case acted on today the chicagobased 7th us circuit 
court of appeals upheld an illinois law challenged by sequoia books 
inc owner of the denmark ii bookstore in kendall county 
sequoia books was convicted of selling obscene materials 12 
times between january 1985 and september 1987 
an illinois law that took effect jan 1 1989 lets authorities 
seize property derived from or used to commit obscenity 
offenses any business convicted at least twice of obscenity 
violations is subject to forfeiting its property 
the appeals court said the law may not be applied retroactively 
but said sequoias property may be seized for any obscenity 
violation from 1989 onward 
the bookstores owners said the law operates as a prior 
restraint on free expression 
the 7th circuit court rejected the argument noting that the 
illinois law is less sweeping than the seizure provisions of a 
federal antiracketeering law that has survived similar challenges 
sexually explicit material often characterized as pornography 
is not necessarily obscene obscenity a legal term must be 
determined in a judicial proceeding 
sexually explicit material judged obscene enjoys no freespeech 
protection if the material is not found to be obscene it is 
protected by constitutional freespeech guarantees

the council of europe marking the 40th anniversary 
of its human rights charter declared monday that it wants the 
united states and the soviet union to join in some of its 
functions 
the council is the oldest postwar body promoting european 
cooperation on tuesday it is to admit hungary as its first member 
from the former communist bloc 
the 23nation council issued a statement at the end of a meeting 
monday saying it wanted to help coordinate human rights issues for 
the csce or conference on security and cooperation in europe that 
organization is a loosely defined body of 34 nations that has been 
a forum for talks between cold war enemies 
for this purpose it the council of europe should adjust its 
structures and working methods to enable all the states 
participating in the csce which are not council members including 
canada the ussr and the usa to take part in some of its 
intergovernmental and parliamentary activities in the human rights 
field on an equal footing the declaration said 
earlier monday italian foreign minister gianni de michelis 
opened the meeting by calling for the councils assembly to develop 
into a parliament bringing together the former communist bloc and 
the west including the united states 
a us official said washington wanted to work with the council 
of europe in aiding emerging eastern european democracies 
but the official richard schifter assistant secretary of 
state for human rights said the united states was unlikely to 
become a member of the council of europe 
joining the council of europe would mean that final judgments 
of us courts can be reviewed and set aside he said such a 
situation would require amending the constitution he added 
rather than deal with this aspect of it theres many things 
we can do together he said after mondays meeting 
the session brought together council ministers and observers 
from eastern europe the united states canada the soviet union 
and other states 
they discussed what role the council would have in the postcold 
war era 
the council of europe is hoping to emerge as a political 
counterpart to organizations like nato which has stressed military 
cooperation and the european community which has focused on 
economic cooperation 
in his speech de michelis suggested that the councils assembly 
become the parliament for the csce countries 
only by maintaining the bigger picture involving the north 
american democracy will it be possible to face the question of 
historic dimensions of the relations between europe and the soviet 
union he said 
however the united states has raised objections to the plan 
washington has traditionally been wary of the csce because of its 
unwieldly size and the fact that the us voice carries only as 
much weight as that of the other csce participants 
the council of europes secretarygeneral catherine lalumiere 
said many speakers monday suggested using the councils european 
human rights convention as the basis for humanrights accords 
regulating the postcold war order 
it is essential to start building the europe of the future on 
a sound basis she said 
the convention is the bestknown of the 130 treaties signed by 
council of europe members 
it is unique in allowing individuals to sue their governments in 
an international court whose decisions are binding 
lalumiere said other conclusions reached monday included the 
need to reduce the backlog of such humanrights cases there was 
also a need to give fresh impulse to the european social charter 
which focuses on social and economic rights she said 
the council of europe includes austria belgium britain 
cyprus denmark finland france germany greece iceland 
ireland italy liechtenstein luxembourg malta netherlands 
norway portugal san marino spain sweden switzerland and 
turkey

incumbent sen jesse helms said monday he 
had been forced into running a negative senate campaign and 
democratic challenger harvey gantt said he had stuck to the high 
road 
it has been a spirited debate albeit a vicious one helms 
told reporters on the final day of campaiging before the election 
he repeated his charges that gantt has lied about his record 
i regret his tone helms said we had hoped we could run a 
positive campaign but from the beginning they came in with 
slashing commercials 
helms speeches and ads in the last week accused gantt the 
black former mayor of charlotte of supporting racial quotas in 
jobs other ads accused gantt of running a secret campaign 
aimed at getting blacks to the polls 
but helms who is seeking a fourth term denied that his 
campaign had injected race into the contest 
race is not an issue in this campaign helms said i was 
born white and he was born black and there is nothing either one of 
us could do about it 
we have not made an issue of race but he has gone around the 
state pleading for the bloc vote he has right to do that but he 
has injected race into the campaign 
in newark nj a federal judge ruled monday that the 
republican national committee was not involved in efforts aimed at 
intimidating black and elderly voters in the helmsgantt race 
democrats had accused the national gop of indirectly aiding a 
ballot security program for helms the democrats complaint 
said that violated a 1982 consent decree on voter intimidation that

field publications has settled charges that it 
mailed books to its subscribers that they had not asked for or 
agreed to receive and then billed them for payment the federal 
trade commission said monday 
field the publisher of weekly reader books and other book 
plans said it has acted to correct shortcomings of which the ftc 
had complained 
field spokeswoman pat sears said the company offers its book 
club members two or three opportunities a year to purchase 
quality materials and the ftc felt that we needed to do a 
better job of explaining how these programs work 
we agreed with them in september of 1989 we put into place a 
number of changes including some not requested by the ftc to 
assure that our customers would be properly served ms sears 
said from the companys office in middletown conn 
the ftc said the publishing company will pay civil penalties of 
175000 and will be prohibited in the future from the practices 
complained of under a consent decree filed in federal court 
a complaint acompanying the decree said field mailed additional 
books to subscribers who had consented to receive the companys 
regular subscription books it said the customers had not requested 
the shipment of the additional books or given express consent to 
having them mailed 
field then sent the customers invoices and dunned them for 
payment for the books the complaint said

striking daily news columnist juan gonzalez 
doesnt object to being called a revolutionary long after he began 
to agitate on behalf of fellow puerto ricans as a youth 
when theres injustice you have to fight it he said i 
still consider myself a revolutionary if you mean someone who gets 
at the root of a problem in society and tries to correct it 
gonzalez a strike organizer for the newspaper guild was once a 
leader of the militant youth group young lords his past draws 
respect and a certain amount of amusement from his colleagues at 
the newspaper 
in the daily news library his photo file still says puerto 
rican revolutionary 
thats crossed out now it says daily news columnist 
said fellow striker robert gearty 
gonzalez file may or may not be changed again depending on the 
outcome of the strike by nine of 10 unions at the newspaper that 
has thrust him into the role of a strike leader 
one minute he is talking through a megaphone at a rally in 
front of the news building the next he is meeting with jesse 
jackson before a rally 
gonzalez colleagues on the picket line react energetically when 
he puts his hand on their shoulders to discuss how to produce the 
next union newsletter or strategy on the picket line 
gonzalez is cochairman of his unions strike organizing 
committee 
isnt juan amazing gearty said i saw him the other day 
i said juan where do i go to sign up for the young lords 
the young lords battled with authorities to push the cause of 
puerto rican independence and fair treatment of puerto ricans in 
the united states 
during the groups heyday from 1969 to 1974 gonzalez served as 
its minister of education and health and at one point as minister 
of defense 
they blocked major avenues in east harlem with garbage to 
protest poor trash collection they collected eggs bacon and bread 
from merchants and cooked breakfast for schoolchildren they staged 
sitins at a hospital and a church the latter leading to the 
arrest of 110 demonstrators 
at one point the group tried to replace police at the front of 
a parade leading police to attack the demonstrators and causing a 
major disturbance 
we got a little arrogant in our popularity gonzalez said 
we were blamed and rightly so for a raucous mess 
born in puerto rico 43 years ago gonzalez was raised in new 
york by a mother who was a garment worker and a father who labored 
in a restaurant both belonged to unions 
in 1968 gonzalez refused to accept his diploma from columbia 
university when the school asked him to plead guilty to violating 
university regulations for his role in a student strike that shut 
down the school for six weeks 
the same year he participated in protests at the democratic 
national convention in chicago 
gonzalez spent the next decade steam pressing mens suits at a 
garment factory and as a pressman at a printing plant because i 
was afraid if i became a professional i would become a sellout or a 
wimp 
he eventually gave in to his lifelong dream of writing for a 
newspaper by accepting a clerks position at the philadelphia daily 
news where he quickly became a reporter and helped organize a 
strike in 1985 
marnal whitley a striking librarian said when he first learned 
about gonzalezs past i thought maybe it was an ironic twist 
that maybe he had sold out 
but when i read his columns i saw he was still a 
revolutionary he is still on the side of the oppressed whitley

fridays show to report on the state of the nation and how 
americans feel about their country 
however if there is major breaking news that day well put

nbc announced the unusual move monday the cbs evening news 
and abcs world news tonight never have devoted one of their 
broadcasts to a single subject spokesmen for those programs said

of the subject warranted it he noted that the three network 
newscasts in early august were largely devoted to a single subject 
the persian gulf crisis

battalion i havent seen an absentee ballot yet 
cpl patrick locke 20 of spokane wash who was repairing the

saudi arabia was equally astonished 
i think we have so much on our mind now and have so much work 
to do we dont have time to think about it he said the way 
they vote they help decide how long well be over here i wish i 
knew more about it 
a threeweek get out the vote blitz on armed forces radio 
and voting information booths in many of the big mess halls 
produced good results about 100000 applications for absentee 
ballots were handed out by the judge advocates office of the army 
forces central command which was in charge of promoting 
registration 
the navy launched a similar campaign for the elections which 
include congressional and gubernatorial races sailors aboard the

three weeks ago in alexandria va 
voting is your right said chief petty officer steven sisk 
45 of fremont calif if you dont vote dont bitch 
maj jerry kineen 46 of boston a lawyer on the staff of the 
judge advocate in the army forces central command said its a 
misconception that most troops didnt vote 
probably of those who were over here more of them voted in 
this election than would have voted had they not been here because 
it was made easier for them said lt col kevin v murphy 44 
of hanover mass the deputy staff judge advocate 
they didnt have to drive down to a polling place and take 
time off from work to vote we came right to them he said 
marine cpl daryl cherry 21 of harrington del watching a

straws and id rather not do that

removed

said 
many servicemen said they had trouble with the mail 
cpl frank gillyard jr 21 of mansfield la with the marine 
wing support squadron said he hadnt received his absentee ballot 
and probably wouldnt get to vote 
with 60 to 90 tons of mail arriving every day and delays on 
outgoing mail as well its impossible to say how may servicemen

the election marked the debut of fax voting 
there has been a limited voting by fax some of the individual 
cities and towns did allow this said kineen

the department also wants the state to send absentee ballots to the 
three gis so they can vote in tuesdays election 
murphy said a few ballots arrived by fax and were faxed back 
after completion but added one of the problems of sending them 
by fax is that there is no envelope to put the ballot back in its 
supposed to be a secret ballot 
lt col bill hagan 43 of key west fla the staff judge 
advocate with the army who is in charge of the registration 
program said he sent his absentee form early

the republican national committee was not 
involved in efforts aimed at intimidating black and elderly voters 
in north carolinas close us senate race a federal judge ruled 
monday 
the democratic national committee has not been able to 
establish that the republican national committee is involved 
directly or indirectly with activities taking place in north 
carolina said us district judge dickinson debevoise 
democrats had accused the national gop of indirectly aiding a 
ballot security program for republican sen jesse helms who is 
locked in a neckandneck race with democrat harvey gantt who is 
black the democrats complaint said that violated a 1982 consent 
decree on voter intimidation that was issued in debevoises court 
the electioneve ruling centered on mailings sent by north 
carolina republicans that warned voters in predominantly minority 
districts that it was a federal crime to provide election officials 
with false information 
party officials republican and democratic hailed the ruling 
what the judge did today was stop a fishing expedition said 
thomas kirby an attorney retained by the rnc there was no 
indication that we were involved in what was going on in north 
carolina 
democrats also claimed victory 
im satisfied because i want the rnc to know that were 
watching said bob bauer the democrats counsel we will be 
watching every county and precinct in north carolina for minority 
disenfranchisement 
at issue are 150000 postcards that the north carolina gop sent 
to predominantly minority democratic precincts 
a section on the card told voters it is a federal crime to 
knowingly give false information about your name residence or 
period of residence to an election official 
voter mailings also have been distributed to mostly elderly 
democratic voters in texas to encourage them to forego absentee 
ballots 
the hearing did not address the texas mailings 
debevoise found that republicans had failed to inform their 
staff and state campaigns of the 1982 consent decree that bars 
voter intimidation the decree was issued after the party was 
reported to have hired armed guards to watch over various polling 
places in new jersey 
deveboise ordered national republicans to remind their campaign 
staffs not to violate the decree and suggested that democrats 
should turn to north carolina courts if they were not happy with 
the voter mailing 
democrats also have charged helms with playing on racial 
stereotypes in television advertisements republicans have denied 
the charges 
rnc counsel ben ginsberg said he did not know if the national 
gop had asked helms to stop his mailing campaign and similar 
tactics 
in washington justice department spokesman dan eramian said the 
agency was taking appropriate steps to ensure there is no voter 
intimidation in north carolina 
but eramian declined to way what steps the justice department 
was taking in response to a request from the democratic national 
committee that it investigate the mailings in north carolina

with polls showing the governors race 
almost a dead heat democrat ann richards stumped through 
traditional democratic strongholds monday and republican clayton 
williams got a push from president bush 
the president not wanting to be embarrassed in the state he 
calls home campaigned alongside williams in tyler waco and 
houston 
i urge all texans to get out there and vote and do not 
take democracy for granted you have a chance to make a 
difference bush said in tyler 
richards riding williams weekend admission that he paid no 
income tax in 1986 campaigned from orange in eastern texas to the 
rio grande valley on the mexican border 
the winner of tuesdays election will succeed twoterm 
republican gov bill clements who is retiring 
the governors election was too close to call as of sunday 
night said the houston firm of tarrance amp associates which 
wrapped up a telephone survey of 1000 registered voter 
and a poll published sunday by the houston chronicle showed 
oilmanrancher williams with a slim lead over twoterm state 
treasurer richards 44 percent to 39 percent that same poll in 
midseptember had shown williams up by 15 points 4833 
the only person who can elect richards is claytie and hes 
working hard at it pollster richard murray of the university of 
houston told the chronicle 
that poll was conducted before williams two lastminute gaffes 
his noincome tax admission and his apparent failure during a tv 
appearance to understand the proposed constitutional amendment on 
gubernatorial appointments 
richards said the remarks bolstered her arguments that the 
republican making his first bid for public office didnt 
understand state government and that as one of the states 
wealthiest men he didnt understand the needs of average texans 
she hit the airwaves with a lastminute radio commercial that 
charged millions of average texans paid taxes while williams 
took advantage of loopholes for the rich 
williams said he paid no income taxes because he lost money when 
oil prices tumbled from near 30 per barrel to less than 10 
williams spokesman gordon hensley said williams creation of 26 
companies and 100000 jobs proved he could run state government 
he labeled the income tax attack a lastgasp assault 
the governors race was the most expensive in texas history a 
week before the election williams had reported spending 204 
million including 8 million of his own money richards campaign 
spending topped 11 million

sales of existing homes from july through 
september slipped 25 percent from their level a year earlier and 
will remain slow in the first half of 1991 because of the weakening 
economy a real estate trade group said monday 
the national association of realtors said sales of previously 
owned homes totaled a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 366 
million units in the threemonth period sales declined in the 
years two previous quarters as well 
the realtors recorded sales of 378 million last year down from 
395 million in 1988 
although there were areas of strength in the housing industry 
during the third quarter sales declined in 28 states and were 
unchanged in oregon nineteen states posted increases statistics 
were unavailable for alaska and maine 
overall however the market will remain slow for the rest of 
1990 and into the first half of 1991 as the country experiences a 
mild recession realtors president norman a flynn said 
the realtors also reported the median price of an existing home 
was 96600 18 percent above that for the third quarter of 1989 
it ranged from 375000 in honolulu to 49200 in saginaw mich 
among the 96 metropolitan statistical areas surveyed 
the median price means half of the homes cost more half less 
the survey includes detached homes town houses apartment 
condominiums and cooperatives 
the only region experiencing increased sales was the south 
where sales rose 14 percent to an annual rate of 142 million 
several oil patch areas that had suffered adverse market conditions 
in recent years recorded increases 
texas had a thirdquarter increase of 88 percent to a 
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 246300 units oklahoma another 
oilproducing state posted a 73 percent gain to 55100 units 
sales were up 59 percent in louisiana to 37100 units 
the median price of a home in the south was 87200 up 18 
percent from a year earlier 
the midwests sales rate of 10 million units dropped 10 
percent in the third quarter the median price jumped 36 percent 
to 75100 
john a tuccillo the realtors chief economist said the 
availability of moderately priced houses boosted sales in the south 
and kept them from falling faster in the midwest 
sales in the west fell 88 percent to an annual rate of 580000 
and in the northeast were down 85 percent to a 650000 rate 
tuccillo said the decline in the west largely resulted from a 
sharp drop in coastal california markets the median price dropped 
53 percent to 138200 reflecting more purchases in less costly 
inland markets 
sales in the northeast have been sluggish for nearly two years 
and although pennsylvania resale activity appears to be 
recovering the rest of the region particularly along the 
bostonnew york corridor remains down in the dumps flynn said 
the median price of a home in the northeast dropped 27 percent 
to 143100 
home sales along the new yorkboston corridor have been 
gridlocked by sellers whove been reluctant to lower their prices 
to fit a buyers market and by buyers whove been waiting for 
lower prices tuccillo said

both sides claimed an edge monday in a special 
parliamentary election viewed as a referendum on a government 
proposal to send troops to the persian gulf but the low turnout 
was seen as an even clearer sign of japanese sentiment 
only 387 percent of the 48 million eligible voters in the 
aichi district bothered to vote sunday 
yoshihisa oshima a 50yearold dentist from the governing 
liberal democratic party narrowly defeated michiko goto of the 
japan socialist party for a seat in the upper house winning a 45 
percent to 43 percent plurality 
the liberal democrats backed away from calling the slim victory 
an endorsement of its troop deployment bill which faces likely 
defeat in parliament 
aichi is an ldp stronghold and the home district of prime 
minister toshiki kaifu sponsor of the troop deployment bill 
the socialists called the election results a clear repudittion 
of the proposal because goto and communist party candidate yukiko 
seko together drew 55 percent of the vote or 1003815 votes to 
oshimas 833371 
kanju sato the socialist partys election committee chairman 
declared this was proof that a great number of citizens oppose 
the selfdefense forces deployment bill we will fight harder to 
prevent the bill from being passed 
a statement issued by kaifu read im so glad that we won as a 
result of the efforts by the candidate and the entire party 
kaifu visited aichi southwest of tokyo twice during the 
campaign the japan times said more than 100 ldp members of the 
diet parliament were sent in to campaign for oshima 
hideo sato international politics professor at tsukuba 
university commented japanese voters are most interested in 
bread and butter and the bill has little to do with that 
parliament now is debating the united nations peace 
cooperation bill the prime minister says any troops sent to the 
gulf under the measure would be limited to noncombat roles he has 
been under pressure from the united states and other nations that 
want japan to provide more than money for gulf multinational forces 
following iraqs aug 2 invasion of kuwait 
some members of kaifus own party agree with the oppositions 
argument that the proposal would violate japans postworld war ii 
constitution which prohibits the use of force to settle 
international disputes

archbishop desmond tutu urged 
churches once divided over apartheid to work together for a 
peaceful future as he opened a church conference monday 
about 300 delegates from 90 churches are meeting in hopes of 
reaching agreement on how to help south africa move peacefully to a 
nondiscriminatory democracy they will spend five days at the 
national conference of churches billed as the largest such meeting 
to be held in south africa 
the conference in rustenburg 62 miles northwest of 
johannesburg has brought together the white branch of the dutch 
reformed church with its black and mixedrace branches 
the white dutch reformed church the main church of the 
dutchdescended afrikaners who dominate the government argued for 
decades that the bible supported apartheid it has changed that 
view and says it wants to merge with the other branches 
the black and mixedrace branches have staunchly opposed 
apartheid 
tutu the anglican archbishop who won the 1984 nobel peace prize 
for his antiapartheid activism called for reconciliation we 
come here not to engage in recrimination he said in the opening 
speech 
in this land we are bound together by common humanity by 
having one god the only way we will ever be able to survive to be 
free to be human is together black and white tutu said 
khoza mgogo president of the south african council of churches 
urged delegates to adopt strategies for redistribution of wealth 
most of which is in the hands of the white minority 
the beauty of the meeting is that we are bringing the whole 
christian community of south africa together the establishment 
afrikans churches and their antiapartheid counterparts the rev 
frank chikane a conference organizer told the sunday times 
for the first time there is the distinct possibility that the 
christian churches representing 78 percent of the population 
can speak with one voice on apartheid and the countrys future 
he said 
two relatively small white churches that still support apartheid 
the afrikaans protestant church and the reformed church are not 
attending 
many of the churches represented belong to the south african 
council of churches which often has been at the forefront of the 
antiapartheid movement chikane is the general secretary of the 
council 
the nations church leaders met 30 years ago in an attempt to 
forge a united front to challenge apartheid but the agreement 
collapsed when the dutch reformed church rejected it 
the current conference was organized after president fw de 
klerk urged church leaders to develop a common position on the role 
they envision for the church in the future 
de klerk has said he wants to dismantle the apartheid system and 
negotiate a new constitution that would allow the countrys 5 
million whites and 30 million blacks to share power 
south africa is predominantly christian with large numbers of 
catholics anglicans methodists zionists and pentecostalists 
there also are many jews and moslems in the nation

the security council on monday cut the 
size of the un border patrol force in central america saying the 
monitors main mission has been accomplished with peace in 
nicaragua 
in the unanimous vote the 15member council also extended the 
mandate of the un observer group in central america for six 
months 
un officials said central american presidents requested the 
extension seeking to maintain a un military presence in the 
region to deter crossborder support for insurgencies 
since its formation a year ago the multinational force has been 
deployed in five central american countries but its main role was 
to oversee the demobilization of nicaraguas contra rebels 
following a nineyear civil war 
more than 22000 contras in nicaragua and neighboring honduras 
had disbanded by july after violeta barrios de chamorro and a 
14party coalition defeated the sandinistas in feb 25 elections

413 to 158 by middecember and put it under the command of a 
brigadier general the 11nation force has been led by maj gen 
agustin quesada gomez of spain 
the council also voted to halve the number of helicopters from 
12 to six sending home nearly all of a 130member canadian air 
unit 
the vote followed recommendations of a report by 
secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar that acknowledged the 
multinational force was very limited in its efforts to detect 
secret shipments of weapons or ammunition from one country to 
another

were broadcast on state radio and television 
arens said the moves cost israel about 1 billion and that he 
had asked the united states for more military assistance to cover 
the costs naveh said

began when iraq invaded kuwait on aug 2

iraqi threats to attack with chemical weapons the military 
announced monday that it would issue the masks to foreign nationals 
from nov 1216

chemical weapons factories in iraq it said the white house was

the environmental protection agency said 
monday that large cities and heavily populated suburban counties 
must develop programs to reduce contamination of water that flows 
through storm sewers 
the requirements apply to cities with a population of more than 
100000 as well as to heavily populated suburban counties and is 
hoped to reduce the discharge of pollutants into public storm sewer 
systems and eventually into public waterways 
the epa said that about 100000 industrial facilities also must 
obtain federal permits for discharging water into public sewer 
systems 
the new epa rules are required by a 1987 law that ordered the 
agency to reduce runoff pollution in water that flows into storm 
sewers storm water often contains a wide range of pollutants 
including toxic pesticides from lawns and oil or grease from roads 
and parking lots 
the best way for municipalities and industry to meet the storm 
water regulations and protect the quality of our waters is to 
prevent pollution before it washes into the storm sewers said 
lajuana wilcher an epa assistant administrator 
pollution in storm sewers often is released directly into 
rivers streams lakes and wetlands posing threats to drinking 
water as well as the recreational use of these waters said the 
epa 
the release of the storm water regulations was welcomed by 
environmentalists 
but bob adler an attorney for the natural resources defense 
council said the regulations should cover more municipalities and 
urban areas the epa rules cover only about half of the urban 
areas required by the 1987 law said adler

felix s bloch the career diplomat who was 
suspected of espionage was fired monday by secretary of state 
james a baker iii because of deliberate false statements the 
state department announced 
bloch who had been under investigation since early last year on 
suspicion of passing secrets to soviet agents was given written 
notice of bakers decision 
in a brief statement the department said baker found that the 
55yearold blochs removal from the foreign service was 
necessary because of his deliberate false statements or 
misrepresentations to the fbi in the course of a national security 
investigation 
blochs dismissal also was based on his behavior activities 
and associations the statement said there was no further 
elaboration 
in view of the national security aspects of this case and the 
privacy rights of the individual employee the evidence against mr 
bloch cannot be made public the state department said the 
departments legal affairs office is reviewing blochs pension 
rights 
the telephone at blochs residence was answered by a machine and 
he did not immediately respond to messages seeking his reaction to 
bakers decision 
bloch submitted his resignation on july 5 and withdrew a request 
for a hearing on the state departments attempt to fire him but 
state officials said they would not act upon his resignation until 
baker had ruled on whether to fire him on security grounds 
on feb 8 the state department suspended bloch from his 
80700ayear job in the european affairs bureau and said it would 
seek to fire him 
the 30year veteran of the foreign service was suspected by the 
fbi of selling secrets to the soviet union but the fbi was never 
able to identify any specific instance where bloch passed 
classified data to the soviets and charges were never filed a 
criminal investigation of blochs activities remains open 
during the summer of 1989 bloch was the subject of extensive 
fbi surveillance which was widely covered by news media he led 
processions of fbi agents reporters and cameramen on walks around 
the washington area and up to the new york city suburbs to visit 
relatives after it was first publicly reported in late july 1989 
that he was under suspicion 
the surveillance ended late last year after the bureau decided 
it was unlikely it could prove a case in court but in us 
district court here in may the state department won the right to 
use evidence gathered from secret fbi electronic surveillance of 
bloch in the dismissal case against him 
investigators believed bloch was recruited to spy for the 
soviets in 1974 while he was serving as economic counselor in the 
newly opened us embassy in east berlin he spent two years there 
after transferring from west berlin where he had served since 1970 
bloch served in austria from 1980 to 1987 as economic counselor 
and then as the secondranking official in the us embassy 
electronic surveillance was reported to have picked up bloch 
telling his wife in 1989 that he had accepted payments from the 
soviets french agents acting on a us tip reportedly photographed 
him meeting in paris in the spring of 1989 with a soviet agent 
a former viennese prostitute told the federal grand jury that 
has been examining his finances that bloch spent roughly 10000 a 
year for her services over seven years an amount investigators 
could not find withdrawn from blochs acknowledged bank accounts

independence from the soviet union

manufacturers would have to tell physicians 
how prescription drugs affect elderly patients under a government 
proposal announced monday 
the information some of which is already provided voluntarily 
by many companies already would have to be included in drug 
labeling sent to physicians and pharmacists said the food and drug 
administration this labeling required by the fda is usually 
available to patients upon request 
as our knowledge has grown of how drugs work within the body 
weve recognized the special concerns associated with drug use in 
the elderly health and human services secretary louis sullivan 
said in a statement 
physicians need to be provided with any patient information 
thats available about the drugs they prescribe for senior 
patients he said 
one of the differences between an old patient and a young one is 
the ability of their kidneys people lose a third or more of their 
kidney function between the ages of 30 and 90 sullivan said 
with less kidney function drugs do not clear the body as fast 
this might mean that a muscle relaxant that works fine for a young 
person might relax older people too much causing them to fall and 
break a hip he said 
the american association of retired persons said the proposal is 
important because those over 65 account for more than 30 percent of 
people taking prescription drugs while comprising 12 percent of the 
population 
one of the factors in drug misuse by the elderly is the 
amount of elderlyspecific information that comes from clinical 
trials and then goes to physicians to guide their prescribing 
practices said susan raetzman an aarp research analyst 
the proposal would require manufacturers to include in physician 
labeling all available information on the effects of the drug on 
the elderly this information could come from the clinical trials 
in which the drug was tested before it was approved for commercial 
sale or from medical literature said dr james mason assistant 
secretary for health at hhs 
if no information is available that would have to be stated 
clearly in the physician labeling but this would be the case 
primarily with drugs developed more than six years ago said dr 
robert temple director of the fdas office of drug evaluation i 
in the mid1980s the fda began requiring companies to include 
in drug applications any important data relating to the effects of 
the drug on the over65 population he said by 1988 most were 
doing it he said 
in march the fda issued guidelines to encourage drug companies 
to include the elderly when testing their products so they can pass 
on any effects of the drug in the elderly 
the labeling proposal could be made stronger if the fda made 
their guidelines for clinical trials mandatory aarps raetzman 
said as it is now their new labeling proposal is only as good 
as the information underlying it 
the fdas proposal would update the labeling regulation to 
standardize and make clear what information should be included 
the labeling information is also available in the physicians 
desk reference which provides information on all prescription 
drugs 
the fda said it will accept comments from the public for 60 
days after that a final rule will be drafted and published in the 
federal register 
drug manufacturers would have one year from the date of 
publication to comply updating the labeling of all their 
prescription products

after more than three years of fighting 
and 1100 dead the leaders of lebanons main shiite militias 
signed a treaty monday allowing the lebanese army to expand its 
control over the nation 
nabih berri leader of the syrianbacked amal militia and a top 
official of the proiranian group hezbollah signed a peace accord 
to allow army control of shiite moslem areas that included the 
southern slums of beirut where the 13 western hostages had been 
believed held 
the peace agreement which becomes effective saturday was 
signed at the end of a 10hour meeting with syrian and iranian 
officials by berri and hezbollah secretarygeneral sheik subhy 
tufeili 
amal which means hope in arabic and hezbollah or party of 
god have fought intermittently since june 1987 vying for control 
of lebanons 12 million shiite moslems 
they are among the major militias that lebanese president elias 
hrawis government is trying to disarm to implement a peace plan to 
end 15 years of civil war 
present for the signing of the agreement were syrian foreign 
minister farouk alsharaa and his iranian counterpart ali akbar 
velayati 
velayati said the subject of western hostages in lebanon 
believed to be held by groups loyal to hezbollah was not 
discussed 
before iranian and syrian officials went into three days of 
talks there was speculation the hostage issue was a prime topic 
but velayati said we did not discuss this subject at all 
sharaa and velayati held a joint news conference after the 
signing in which they expressed confidence the dispute between amal 
and hezbollah is over 
it is defititely settled said velayati 
we are sure that two sides will fully implement this 
agreement and we are committed to provide the lebanese army with 
any support it might need said alsharaa 
the agreement stipulates that 
the two groups will eliminate all obstacles in the way of the 
deployment of the lebanese army in southern lebanon in light of 
the improvement of the army capacities to maintain law and order 
in the event of disputes the two parties are committed to 
the interpretation provided by representatives of syria and iran 
all people displaced as a result of the fighting between the 
two parties will return to their areas villages and homes 
hrawis government wants all christian and moslem militias to 
leave beirut and its immediate suburbs as a first step toward 
spreading the authority of the army throughout lebanon 
major christian and druse militias have expressed approval of 
the plan since the lebanese and syrian armies put down the 
rebellion of christian gen michel aoun on oct 13 
hezbollah is the umbrella for shiite moslem fundamentalist 
factions believed to hold most of the westerners in lebanon 
lebanese security sources have said the hostageholders moved 
their captives from south beirut to other hideouts mainly in the 
eastern bekaa valley before the military move against aoun 
syria with its 40000 troops in lebanon is the major 
powerbroker in the country it controls the bekaa valley except 
for pockets still possessed by shiite groups 
the missing westerners include six americans four britons two 
germans and an italian longest held is terry anderson the chief 
middle east correspondent for the associated press who was 
kidnapped march 16 1985 
there have been reports more of them would be released as iran 
improves its relations with western nations particularly britain 
other sources have said the usled military buildup to confront 
iraq in the persian gulf has discouraged hostageholders from 
releasing their captives 
both iran and syria have condemned iraqs aug 2 invasion of 
kuwait but iran has also denounced the western military presence 
in the region while syria has committed more than 15000 troops to 
the multinational force

the european community pledged anew monday to remain 
united against saddam hussein by refusing to negotiate individually 
for the release of hostages in iraq and kuwait 
italy president of the 12member ec convened an emergency 
foreign ministers meeting monday night at the request of belgium 
and the netherlands to discuss potential cracks in the communitys 
iraq policy 
the meeting followed a series of missions to iraq including a 
trip to baghdad on monday by former west german chancellor willy 
brandt 
the ministers did not specifically condemn brandt or any other 
political figure 
ec leaders adopted a declaration at a summit meeting in rome a 
week ago pledging not to send government representatives to baghdad 
and to discourage others from doing so 
german foreign minister hansdietrich genscher told reporters 
after monday nights meeting that his government does not consider 
brandts trip a violation of ec policy 
foreign minister gianni de michelis of italy who presided at 
the meeting told a news conference the ministers agreed 
unanimously to uphold the declaration on hostages 
he said saddams policy of selectively releasing hostages 
increases the prospect of military conflict in the persian gulf 
we have achieved an important political result in a very 
difficult situation de michelis said we have clearly stated 
that the political will of the 12 governments is the same that 
is no government will accept any type of negotiations explicit or 
implicit with the iraqi government on the hostages 
if the aim of saddam hussein is to utilize the hostages for 
political advantage he now has a clear answer from rome no he 
can have no political advantage from the hostage issue 
de michelis said the 12 agreed the united nations should be the 
only mediator with iraq on the hostages he said he would press 
un secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar to increase his 
efforts to send a personal envoy to baghdad to discuss the issue 
de michelis said ec foreign ministry officials will meet this 
week to examine a german proposal to send a community delegation to 
tunisia algeria and jordan to sound out prospects for a political 
solution to the gulf crisis 
the crisis began three months ago with iraqs aug 2 invasion of 
kuwait 
britain and some other ec members have publicly criticized 
brandts mission to iraq 
but de michelis said mondays meeting was not called to consider 
brandts initiative italian foreign ministry spokesman giovanni 
castellaneta quoted genscher as saying his government does not 
want to give a positive or negative judgment on the trip by 
brandt the 1971 nobel peace laureate 
castellaneta said italy respected brandt as a statesman and was 
convinced he would not violate ec policy 
brandt says his trip is a private mission and he is not going as 
a representative of chancellor helmut kohls government 
in an interview with a german newspaper brandt said he would 
not negotiate with saddam he said he hoped he could help win the 
release of german and other hostages 
brandt is just one of several prominent political figures 
visiting baghdad to obtain freedom for the hundreds of hostages 
iraq has detained to discourage the united states and its allies 
from attacking 
former japanese prime minister yasuhiro nakasone met with iraqi 
officials over the weekend in an effort to free some of the more 
than 300 japanese held in the country 
former prime ministers david lange of new zealand and anker 
joergenson of denmark are also reported to be planning trips to 
iraq 
former british prime minister edward heath traveled to iraq last 
month and won freedom for 38 britons 
in calling for the ec meeting belgian foreign minister mark 
eyskens said sunday saddam is creating this royal court of all 
sorts of western pilgrims who visit him to obtain the release of 
hostages 
the meeting was only called on monday just six foreign 
ministers managed to attend the rest sent highranking deputies

to active duty possibly before years end 
the marines will call up individual infantrymen from various 
units around the country not entire units the source said 
the new york times reported monday that the pentagon already has 
decided to put major reserve combat units on active duty maj doug 
hart a pentagon spokesman said he was unaware of any such 
decision and that no combat units had been activated 
all of the more than 34000 reserves from all the armed services 
already called to active duty for operation desert shield are being 
used in support roles such as truck driving water purification and 
military intelligence the marines had accounted for only 200 of 
the 34000 total 
the marine infantrymen being called up will be among 
approximately 800 reservists in a variety of military jobs being 
ordered to report for active duty later this week the source said 
the source declined to say how many of the 800 are in combat 
roles 
use of reserves in combat jobs is politically sensitive because 
it can be viewed as putting the country on a wartime footing no 
shots have been fired in the confrontation with iraq other than 
warnings shots across the bows of ships but president bush has not 
ruled out the use of force to oust iraq from occupied kuwait 
the pentagon has been under pressure from some congressional 
leaders to use combat reserves defense secretary dick cheney had 
resisted using them saying the 180day maximum period of 
activation for reserves was too short to make good use of them 
even though some army threebrigade divisions were designed with 
one brigade a reserve brigade 
such divisions now in saudi arabia took an active duty brigade 
from elsewhere in the army rather than the socalled roundout 
brigades when they let for the persian gulf 
congressional concern was erased earlier this month when 
congress shortly before adjourning doubled the limit on active 
duty service for combat reserves to 360 days 
it appeared that the marine combat reserves would become part of 
a specially tailored marine expeditionary brigade that eventually 
would replace one of several such units already deployed in the 
gulf area during a rotation of marine units 
gen john r dailey the deputy commandant of the marines said 
in an interview monday that the rotation plan is mostly complete 
but that no decisions have been made on when a rotation of fresh 
forces would begin or how they would be structured

mount st helens belched volcanic ash 
and steam nearly 6 miles into the air monday and the powdery 
fallout settled up to 65 miles away in oregon 
there were no reports of damage and scientists said they had no 
evidence of a bigger eruption in the offing 
ashfall from the 8364foot mountain 100 miles south of seattle 
was reported as far away as the dalles ore 65 miles to the 
southeast said geologist steve brantley of the us geological 
survey 
residents of neighboring towns were not in any danger 
authorities said 
the explosion recorded on volcano seismographs at 207 am 
sent a plume of ash 30000 feet into the air said chris 
jonientztrisler a researcher at the university of washington 
winds carried the ash plume to the southeast toward the columbia 
river and into oregon the national weather service said 
jonientztrisler said the explosion was very minor minor 
minor compared with a may 18 1980 eruption that leveled 230 
square miles of forest left 57 people dead or missing and sent up 
an ash cloud that circled the globe 
this kind of thing is more like the steam and ash explosions 
that occurred last winter in december and january she said 
any hazards should be fairly confined to the crater 
scientists monitoring the volcano say there has been a gradual 
increase in small earthquakes there in the past three years there 
was no evidence however that they were associated with mondays 
eruption 
the steam and gases that are involved here could come from a 
couple of sources jonientztrisler said it could come from 
the magma bubbling out of solution or it could be rain and 
snowmelt percolating down to hot areas and bursting into steam 
its probably a bit of both processes 
in the past series of earthquakes have occurred in the days 
before eruptions of mount st helens 
the volcanos last large eruption was on march 19 1982 when 
mud flowed from the crater for six miles since then the mountain 
has had a series of domebuilding eruptions in which the 
mountain adds lava to the heap in its crater the last one occurred 
in october 1986 
the cataclysmic 1980 eruption blew off the top 1300 feet of the 
oncesymmetrical peak a lava dome dating to about the 16th 
century

at least 30 british hostages held in iraq 
telephned their families in britain last weekend the foreign 
office said monday 
the foreign office condemned the calls as a cruel and 
calculating iraqi ploy 
some of the hostages reiterated iraqs invitation last week for 
women to spend christmas with their husbands but the foreign 
office advised families against traveling to iraq or kuwait 
occupied since iraqs aug 2 invasion 
iraqi undertakings should not be trusted a spokesman at the 
foreign office said adding that officials realized the advice 
would be difficult for some family members to take 
the calls were placed directly to the families the foreign 
office said 
the family of john rattenbury spoke for five minutes to the 
61yearold businessman their first phone call since aug 1 
he said they were being well looked after he was obviously 
disappointed that he could not come home with ted heath but is 
still in good spirits lilian rattenbury said 
former british prime minister edward heath traveled to baghdad 
last month and negotiated the release of 37 british hostages who 
were elderly or ill 
some families received taperecorded messages from their 
husbands brought back by recently released french hostages the 
foreign office said 
a british hostage said in a taped message he had lost more than 
30 pounds on a daily diet of one tomato one onion one pepper a 
fourinch piece of cucumber and a bit of bread two pieces of bread 
if you are lucky 
a conservative party lawmaker called on families of british 
hostages to be brave and stop complaining 
i am sick and tired of the mewling and puking of the relatives 
of hostages in the gulf and of some of the hostages themselves 
said sir john stokes 
during the last war we never heard sobs of widows cannot 
these people keep a stiff upper lip and think of the country as a 
whole stokes said 
dorothy goodwin who said she intends to fly to the gulf to 
visit her husband called stokes criticism unhelpful and 
unnecessary 
he obviously doesnt have any relative trapped in iraq or he 
wouldnt talk that way 
the foreign office said there are 800 british citizens held in 
iraq

european community agriculture and 
trade ministers late monday suspended talks on a proposal to cut 
farm subsidies until tuesday to give time for highlevel 
consultations between ec governments 
officials said french president francois mitterrand and german 
chancellor helmut kohl were among the heads of state who would be 
talking by phone to try to hammer a final farm plan into shape 
ec officials expressed guarded optimism that tuesdays talks 
would yield agreement on a proposal that could be submitted to the 
uruguay round of world trade talks 
the danger of failure has passed germanys economics and 
trade minister helmut haussmann said 
failure to reach agreement could torpedo the uruguay round a 
fouryear effort of more than 100 nations to liberalize world 
trade 
the united states and other countries have threatened to abandon 
the genevabased trade talks if the community fails t make a 
proposal 
british agriculture secretary john gummer said of the 
communitys efforts if we lose this opportunity i believe it 
might have a longterm and very serious effect on the world 
economy 
the ministers were at odds over a proposal to trim farm 
subsidies on major crops by 30 percent over a 10year period from 
1986 to 1996 some reductions already have been made 
france and germany have insisted on guarantees that their 
farmers would not be seriously hurt the european commission the 
ecs executive body drew up a list of guarantees designed to allay 
the nations fears 
ec ministers failed in six tries last month to reach an accord 
the community is the only major participant that has not yet 
submitted a proposal to the agricultural trade talks within the 
uruguay round 
the talks held under the auspices of the general agreement on 
tariffs and trade seek to lower trade barriers in 15 areas 
including textiles manufactured goods and services such as banking 
and telecommunications 
but the united states and other countries insist agriculture is 
the key to the talks

an instrument on the hubble space telescope 
focused on a quasar billions of light years away to make the first 
spectral observations of a faint object by the 15 billion 
orbiting telescope nasa announced monday 
the instrument a faint object spectrograph targeted the quasar 
known as um675 in a study of the chemical composition of the early 
universe 
a nasa announcement said that the quasar appears to be receding 
from the earth at a speed of about 80 percent of the speed of 
light 
to make the readings the space telescope focused on um675 for 
33 minutes in each of three different orbits a computer at the 
goddard space center then combined the data to create a single data 
set 
the readings by the faint object spectrograph were in the far 
ultraviolet portion of the electromagnetic spectrum radiation of 
this type cannot be detected on earth because the planets 
atmosphere blocks it but it can be detected in space 
quasars or quasistellar objects are puzzling celestial 
bodies that emit more energy than would be expected from an objects 
of their size astronomers study quasars in several spectra in 
hopes of understanding their nature 
hubble has a focusing problem that seriously affects 
instruments such as cameras that work only in the visible portion 
of the spectrum the focusing flaw however has less effect in the 
invisible portions of the electromagnetic spectrum

col sir david stirling who founded britains sas 
elite special forces in world war ii has died his biographer said 
monday he was 74 
stirling died sunday night in the london clinic after a long 
illness said alan hoe a former sas major and stirlings official 
biographer 
the sas or special air service with its motto who dares 
wins continued after the war and has kept its reputation for 
swift clandestine and effective action one highly publicized 
exploit was its assault on the iranian embassy in london may 5 
1980 to end a siege by gunmen holding hostages 
born archibald david stirling on nov 15 1915 the son of a 
scottish brigadier general he joined the scots guards at the 
outbreak of world war ii six months later he transferred to no 3 
commando group of the brigade of guards and went with them to the 
middle east 
he persuaded military authorities that an army within an 
army was needed to make swift secret raids against the enemy 
they gave him six officers and 60 enlisted men to try out his 
theories in the western desert 
stirling became known as the phantom major among the german 
troops of field marshal erwin rommels afrika korps after 
destroying 250 enemy aircraft and scores of fuel and ammunition 
dumps in attacks on the enemy rear 
his tactics of operating so far behind german lines that his men 
could virtually walk into their targets and then retreating 
even farther into enemy territory against all expectations helped 
give him legendary status 
in 1943 stirling was taken prisoner in tunisia he escaped was 
recaptured and was transferred to colditz castle prison camp where 
he remained for the rest of the war 
stirling left the army on his release but retained close links 
with the regiment he became head of a series of private armies and 
security organizations many in africa 
in 1974 he founded the controversial organization great britain 
75 which aimed to keep britain running in the event of a general 
strike following a devastating mineworkers industrial action that 
year 
hoe said monday the sas is still based on the same concept of 
small highly trained groups of soldiers being used strategically 
rather than tactically 
former chief of the defense staff field marshal lord bramall 
said stirling was regarded as founding father of the sas 
it all started with this young 25yearold who had this idea 
that a few highly trained men inserted at very vulnerable points 
could do tremendous damage to the enemy 
it is an immense achievement and he has always been held with 
tremendous respect and regard 
stirling was not married no survivors were reported

secretary of state james a baker iii reached agreement monday 
with saudi arabia that if us troops go to battle against iraq 
they will be under american command a top bush administration 
official said 
a former west german chancellor meanwhile flew to iraq to seek 
freedom for foreigners held hostage by iraqi leader saddam hussein 
and the european community convened a special session in hopes of 
keeping members in line 
the decision on command and control was announced after baker 
held a twohour meeting with king fahd 
the senior official who insisted on anonymity said the saudis 
would play a decisive role because they would share command of 
american troops used to defend saudi arabia and would have to give 
a green light before the 100000 us troops in the oilrich 
kingdom are sent into action 
once the americans enter battle us commanders will direct 
them the official said 
the uss midway one of four american aircraft carriers deployed 
as part of operation desert shield entered the persian gulf on 
monday like the uss independence which left the gulf last month 
after a few days the midway apparently was sent in as a show of 
force 
later monday in washington a pentagon source said the marine 
corps is ordering the first callup of reservists for combat roles 
in the gulf crisis the marine callup is relatively small and will 
not add substantially to the estimated 220000 us forces in the 
gulf region 
however the pentagon is considering calling major army reserve 
combat units to active duty possibly before the end of the year 
the source said 
iraq meanwhile said that in the event of war over kuwait it 
would attack arab countries participating in the usled 
multinational force 
the latest mission to baghdad was mounted by former chancellor 
willy brandt who arrived in the iraqi capital late monday aboard a 
chartered lufthansa airbus that can carry about 250 people brandt 
who was seen off by iraqs ambassador to germany carried letters 
and a bouquet of flowers from relatives of the estimated 400 german 
hostages 
brandts mission has the backing of the german government 
despite the ecs stand against negotiating for the release of the 
hundreds of foreigners in iraq and kuwait saddam has tried to use 
the hostages whom he calls guests to splinter the alliance 
against him 
also monday a delegation of irish legislators left baghdad 
after talks with iraqi officials aimed at winning freedom for an 
estimated 220 irish citizens 
we are given to believe that the iraqi government will soon 
resolve the issue of iraqi guests said irish lawmaker michael 
higgins 
former prime minister yasuhiro nakasone of japan also was 
meeting with iraqi officials in hopes of winning the release of 
more than 300 japanese hostages 
diplomatic sources in baghdad said david lange a former prime 
minister of new zealand and anker jorgensen a former prime 
minister of denmark plan to come to iraq 
ireland germany and denmark are ec members a special meeting 
of european community foreign ministers was scheduled in rome for 
monday night to discuss departures from the ec policy 
during the weekend about 50 british and american hostages in 
iraq were allowed to call relatives at home 
state department deputy spokesman richard boucher quoted many of 
the hostages as saying they had lost weight that the food was poor 
and that they were often cold 
he added we think if he saddam is genuinely concerned about 
allowing husbands and fathers to talk to their wives and children 
he should simply release all the hostages and let them come home 
one father said his hostage son told him britain should not 
yield 
he said the telephone call was being recorded but he didnt 
give two monkeys and to let the government know that the hostages 
want no negotiations with the terrorists and they are 100 percent 
behind them the father said british officials did not identify 
the father and son by name 
but in brockton mass mary trundy said shell go to baghdad 
for christmas if it will help her twin brother john stevenson she 
said he had called other relatives in florida adding were all 
planning to spend the holidays with john 
baker was in saudi arabia as part of a sevennation tour aimed 
at testing support among arabs europeans and the soviets for 
military action against saddam 
in the saudi town of taif baker met with the emir of kuwait 
sheik jaber alahmed alsabah who was driven from his homeland by 
iraqi invaders aug 2 
as far as i am concerned i would like my country to be 
liberated today and before tomorrow the emir told reporters 
baker said the persian gulf crisis is entering a new phase 
and while we are still seeking a peaceful political and diplomatic 
solution we have to put ourselves in a position where we would be 
able to exercise any options that might be available 
while baker said he had not discussed a military timetable with 
the emir he added i dont think that we can or should rule 
out resort to force if that should be necessary 
in iraq the army newspaper alqadissiyah said arab nations that 
join the multinational force would suffer if there is a war 
all dens of evil everywhere and whoever supported them would 
not be safe from our attacks said the editorial carried by the 
official iraqi news agency 
the dispatch monitored in cyprus said that if war occurs as a 
result of the uswestern conspiracy and because of traitors such 
as saudi king fahd and egyptian president hosni mubarak our 
counterattacks will be destructive and will not be limited to 
securing our countrys sovereignty 
besides the forces massed by the united states britain france 
syria egypt and morocco also sent troops to bolster saudi forces 
in other developments 
special international aid to countries affected by the gulf 
crisis and un embargo on iraq has reached nearly 13 billion the 
gulf crisis financial coordination group announced most aid came 
from gulf states and about 80 percent of it will go to egypt 
turkey and jordan 
three french soldiers captured by an iraqi patrol last week 
exceeded their orders by straying too close to iraqs border with 
saudi arabia french defense minister jeanpierre chevenement he 
did not confirm the soldiers strayed into iraqi territory the 
three returned to france on sunday 
four fighter jets violated iraqi airspace sunday by crossing 
the border from saudi arabia the official iraqi news agency said 
ina said the intruders two f15s and two f14s all turned around 
shortly after entering iraqi airspace

prime minister yitzhak shamirs government 
narrowly defeated a noconfidence motion in parliament on monday 
the second such challenge to his fragile rightwing coalition in 
two weeks 
in the occupied gaza strip soldiers kept 150000 palestinians 
under curfew for a third day one arab was killed and at least 185 
people were wounded by army gunfire during weekend rioting 
eight palestinians and an israeli soldier were wounded in 
continuing clashes in gaza on monday arab reports said in one 
attack masked assailants opened fire on soldiers and troops fired 
back but there were no reports of injuries 
reporters were barred from gaza unless under military escort 
defense minister moshe arens said the unrest will not move us 
to surrender control of the occupied lands it will not 
influence us 
the parliamentary challenge to shamir was called by seven 
opposition parties protesting the governments failure to build 
enough housing for an influx of soviet immigrants 
a record 120000 immigrants arrived this year and at least 
75000 more are expected through december but according to israeli 
reports fewer than 10000 new apartments are being built much of 
the lag is because of bureaucratic infighting among ministries 
fueling the anger of leftwingers was a cabinet decision on 
sunday to give housing minister ariel sharon a free hand in 
distributing lands to contractors the move was said to be an 
attempt to cut through red tape but critics said it left the door 
open to corruption 
all this time nothing has been done and now suddenly you wake 
up and see theres no housing so you take emergency powers to get 
things done complained labor party legislator shimon shitreet on 
israel television 
the mishandling of the immigrants has broken all records 
lots of panic with no action avraham shohat of labor told 
lawmakers 
sharon responded by accusing his detractors of trying to delay 
efforts to provide housing and seeking to deter russians from 
immigrating 
when i look at the way the opposition benches are acting a 
wave of sympathy engulfs my heart sharon added 
shamir commands 62 seats in the 120member knesset or 
parliament he seemed assured of his majority monday until 
interior minister aryeh deris fivemember party threatened to join 
the opposition over a squabble involving a scandal investigation 
deris party kept lawmakers in suspense for several hours before 
a threehour debate the government won the confidence vote 5750 
with two abstentions the remaining lawmakers were absent 
deri suggested on israel radio his party was angry with police 
handling of a protracted investigation into alleged illegal 
handouts of thousands of dollars to religious councils 
he also said he was also dissatisfied with israels lack of 
flexibility toward the united states over middle east policies 
during the persian gulf crisis and the governments heavy hand in 
dealing with palestinians 
egypt on monday blamed israel for violence in gaza over the 
weekend and urged selfrestraint on the part of israeli forces the 
statement from the egyptian foreign ministry said harsh israeli 
measures against palestinians only lead to worldwide 
condemnation 
egypt is the only arab country that has diplomatic relations 
with israel

portauprince haiti ap tension mounted in haiti on monday 
the eve of a ruling on whether supporters of the duvalier 
dictatorship that terrorized the country for nearly three decades 
can run in the december elections 
the electoral council was expected tuesday to ban at least three 
duvalierists from participating and many haitians worried such a 
ruling could unleash a wave of violent retaliation as it did in 
1987 
november evokes for some a vision of apocalypse jean 
dominique director of the independent radio haitiinter said in a 
radio commentary in 1987 disqualified candidates put an already 
devastated country to the torch 
as night fell monday on the capital of portauprince where 
more than 1 million people live huge traffic jams formed as 
haitians stocked up on supplies and food in case of violence 
after the council barred 12 duvalierist candidates from the 1987 
race dozens of people were killed five radio stations were 
riddled with machinegun fire and put out of commission 
on election day goon squads in collusion with the army hacked 
and shot to death at least 34 voters at the polls the government 
then canceled the election 
this years elections are set for dec 16 the campaign 
officially begins wednesday and runs until dec 14 
the electoral council has constitutional authority to decide on 
the eligibility of the candidates the 1987 constitution bars 
architects of the duvalier dictatorship from running for 
office 
of this years 26 presidential candidates four are avowed 
duvalierists 
adding to tensions is the candidacy of the rev bertrand 
aristide an ardent foe of duvalierists and the military who has 
survived at least three assassination attempts 
many fear violent confrontations between duvalierists and his 
supporters a liberation theology advocate who believes the church 
should be involved in the social struggles of the poor aristide 
37 was ousted from his roman catholic salesian order in 1988 for 
allegedly inciting violence with his fiery sermons 
he is believed to have a mass following among haitis poor a 
majority in this caribbean nation of 6 million people 
the most feared duvalierist candidate is roger lafontant who 
ran the private tonton macoute militia that kept the duvalier 
family in power for 29 years 
the dictatorship ended in february 1986 when jeanclaude 
duvalier fled into exile but haiti has been wracked by political 
turmoil since he was toppled 
the current provisional government of ertha pascaltrouillot 
appointed in march is the fifth since duvalier fell 
there is a warrant for lafontants arrest charging him with 
conspiring against national security but it has not been served 
and hes thought to have military support lafontant returned to 
haiti in july after nearly five years in voluntary exile 
two other duvalierists candidates former army chief of staff 
claude raymond and clemard joseph charles a banker were barred 
from the 1987 elections 
remy joseph a doctor who was health minister under duvalier is 
regarded as a moderate and is expected to be allowed in the race 
about 800 observers from the united nations and organization of 
american states are expected to monitor the elections

candidates for congress and 36 governors seats made their final 
campaign rounds monday amid signs of extraordinary voter 
dissatisfaction but without any indication of a looming 
antiincumbent landslide on election day 
democrats were confident they would retain their majorities in 
both houses of the new 102nd congress and nary a republican 
disputed their claim 
the gop hoped to counter with victories in the bigstate 
gubernatorial races

florida spoke for nervous candidates everywhere when he declared 
im not saying the race is over anything can still happen his 
running mate gubernatorial candidate lawton chiles was leading in 
the late polls

bring a thorough housecleaning of the political establishment

accused gantt of supporting job quotas based on race we have not 
made an issue of race but he has gone around the state pleading 
for the bloc vote

carolina after democrats charged that the state gop was trying to 
intimidate black voters 
the state gop sent out postcards advising voters that they were 
ineligible to cast ballots if they had moved in the last 30 days 
the statement on the cards is misleading said a justice department 
official democrats said the postcards were targeted to heavily 
black precincts 
the state gop has pledged not to use any information it obtained 
from returned postcards to challenge the eligibility of voters at 
the polls on tuesday said the justice department 
gantt dreamed of the upset that would make him a national 
figure how sweet its going to be

than usual from the national parties both sides want the 
legislatures on their side when states redraw the boundaries of 
us house seats to reflect population shifts detected in the 1990 
census 
president bush on monday spent his second straight day in texas 
stumping for gubernatorial candidate clayton williams and other gop 
candidates every single one of them 
democrat ann richards launched a new radio advertisement taking 
aim at millionaire williams admission that he paid no income taxes 
in 1986 
millions of average texans paid taxes while williams took 
advantage of loopholes for the rich her ad said williams says 
he paid no taxes because he lost money when oil prices tumbled 
her supporters passed out buttons reading i paid my taxes in 
86 she nicknamed her opponent mucho dinero 
newport said a lateoctober poll found that only 24 percent of 
those surveyed approved of the job congress was doing yet 61 
percent said they approved of the job performance of their own 
representative 
he noted that despite a precipitous drop in bushs approval 
ratings in october the president still is well above 50 percent 
and the trend is up 
democrats control the current senate 5545 and most estimates 
were for little if any change in the lineup 
the closest senate races appeared to be north carolina and 
hawaii where appointed sen daniel akaka faced a stiff challenge 
from republican rep patricia saiki 
final preelection polls pointed to new terms for republicans 
mark hatfield of oregon and rudy boschwitz of minnesota both of 
whom hurried home from washington in october to confront 
unexpectedly strong challenges 
democrats were nervous about incumbents claiborne pell of rhode 
island tom harkin of iowa and john kerry of massachusetts but 
they harbored hopes of defeating gop sen mitch mcconnell in 
kentucky 
in the house most estimates were for a gain of roughly 10 seats 
for the democratswho hold a 258175 edge with two vacancies 
the illinois gubernatorial battle between democratic attorney 
general neil hartigan and republican secretary of state jim edgar 
defied prediction 
the final polls gave republican george voinovich the edge in his 
bid to claim the ohio governorship for the republicans 
two independents both of them former republicans were making 
strong gubernatorial bids lowell weicker in connecticut and wally 
hickel in alaska

senate incumbents worked to shore up their 
leads in the final rush toward election day and only the races in 
north carolina and hawaii remained tossups in the polls 
voters in 34 states elect senators on tuesday and democrats 
appeared to be in no danger of losing their control of the senate 
now split 5545 in their favor 
most observers predicted the senate would shift only a seat or 
two in either direction but that didnt dampen the intensity with 
which candidates were competing for votes in races across the 
country 
fights broke out over the weekend between supporters of 
threeterm incumbent sen jesse helms rnc and backers of 
challenger of harvey gantt the former mayor of charlotte polls 
differed as to who was ahead 
in no other states were voters being offered so clear a choice 
helms a leader of the right wing of the republican party and 
gantt an unabashed liberal who is black 
helms accused gantt of supporting racial quotas but denied 
monday that he made race an issue in the campaign 
we have not made an issue of race but he has gone around the 
state pleading for the bloc vote he has a right to do that but 
that has injected race into it said helms he toured the state 
with president bushs drug czar william bennett in tow 
gantt told supporters if helms wanted to call him a liberal 
fine if you care about people you can call me a liberal 
gantt said 
meanwhile the justice department sent a team of lawyers to 
north carolina after democrats charged that the state gop was 
trying to intimidate black voters 
the state gop sent out postcards advising voters that they were 
ineligible to cast ballots if they had moved in the last 30 days 
the statement on the cards is misleading said a justice department 
official democrats said the postcards were targeted to heavily 
black precincts 
the state gop pledged not to use any information it obtained 
from returned postcards to challenge the eligibility of voters at 
the polls on tuesday said the justice department 
in hawaii the differences between the candidates were less 
dramatic and the campaigning much more genteel incumbent 
democratic sen daniel akaka was fighting for election to the seat 
to which he was appointed last spring 
the islands are overwhelmingly democratic and so akakas 
challenger moderate republican rep pat saiki is asking democrats 
to cross over on tuesday she pointed over the weekend to the fact 
that sen daniel inouye hawaiis senior democratic senator was 
supporting oregon republican mark hatfields reelection bid 
hatfield was ahead in the polls although not safely out of 
reach of democrat harry lonsdale a businessman and scientist 
after six terms in the senate hatfield enjoyed support from a huge 
array of fellow politicians lonsdale was in striking range largely 
because of his ads portraying hatfield as too much the insider 
similar themes mark the contest in kentucky between incumbent 
mitch mcconnell a firstterm republican and democrat harvey 
sloane 
another insideroutsider campaign is in minnesota where gop 
incumbent rudy boschwitz was favored to win reelection over 
democratic upstart paul wellstone a college professor 
in one of the more unusual campaign pitches this fall the 
boschwitz campaign sent a letter to the minnesota jewish community 
pointing out that while both men are jewish wellstone had married 
a nonjew and was not raising his children in the religion 
wellstone on sunday called the letter unforgivable the 
most personal attack of all 
personal attacks have been routine in the senate campaigns this 
year 
in massachusetts incumbent democrat john kerry responded to 
republican jim rappaports attacks by running a series of ads 
raising questions about rappaports personal finances 
in new hampshire democratic john durkin accused republican 
robert smith of being in the pocket of the japs because his 
campaign was being assisted by independent advertising from 
japanese auto dealers 
new hampshire idaho and colorado are the three states where 
incumbents senators are retiring this year in all three 
republicans are expected to retain control of the seats 
in iowa incumbent democrat tom harkin is trying to become the 
first democrat in that state ever reelected to the senate his 
republican challenger rep tom tauke was less than 10 points 
behind in the latest polls 
other incumbents nursing uncertain leads into the final days 
were sen claiborne pell dri who faced republican rep 
claudine schneider and sen larry pressler rsd who was being 
challenged by businessman ted muenster in another 
throwtherascalsout effort

a senior communist leader who was 
believed to have helped plan the 1989 killing of a us army 
colonel was arrested on a suburban street the military announced 
monday 
reynaldo bernardo alleged deputy commander and intelligence 
chief of the new peoples army in the manila area was arrested 
sunday as he was waiting for a ride in quezon city according to 
maj gen guillermo flores chief of the philippine army 
flores said bernardo was involved in the planning of the april 
21 1989 killing of us army col james rowe who was gunned down 
on his way to work at the joint us military assistance group in 
quezon city 
rowe a counterinsurgency expert spent eight years as a 
prisoner of the viet cong until he escaped 
flores said bernardo was deeply involved in the selection of 
quality targets for assassination by the manilabased alex 
boncayao brigade 
the brigade has claimed responsibility for the killing of more 
than 300 troops and civilians in the capital since it was 
established in 1984 it also claimed responsibility for burning 
passenger buses during last months labor strike for higher wages 
flores said the initial confusion over identity resulted because 
bernardo was a relatively new personality in the underground 
who rose from the ranks 
the new peoples army has waged a 21year insurgency to 
establish a marxist state in the philippines 
at least five other senior officials of the outlawed communist 
party of the philippines have been arrested in manila this year 
in another development the military said six rebels and one 
soldier were killed in a series of clashes on samar island since 
last tuesday 
samar the third largest of the 7100 philippine islands is a 
longtime rebel stronghold

the justice department sent lawyers to north 
carolina on monday to try to ensure that black voters arent 
disqualified at the polls with information gathered by the state 
republican party 
assistant attorney general john r dunne said the state gop has 
pledged not to use any information it obtained from returned 
postcards to challenge the eligibility of voters at the polls on 
tuesday 
democrats charged the gop sent out the postcards to intimidate 
black voters and discourage them from casting ballots the 
neckandneck race between gop sen jesse helms and former 
charlotte mayor harvey gantt who is black 
in addition democrats feared that in cases where the postcards 
were returned to the state gop as nondeliverable indicating that 
someone had moved the party might challenge those people at the 
polls if they tried to vote 
dunne said a team of justice department lawyers would be in the 
state tuesday to consult with election officials and if necessary 
seek court injunctions to prevent the misuse of information from 
the postcards 
the postcards advised voters that they were ineligible to cast 
ballots if they had moved in the last 30 days officials feared 
that if the returned postcards were used to challenge eligibility 
it would place an unfair burden of proof on voters 
in our judgment the statement on the cards was misleading if 
not totally inaccurate dunne said 
dunne said the investigation began last friday a day after 
democratic party chairman ron brown charged in a letter that the 
north carolina gop had sent postcards bearing misleading and false 
information to residents of heavily black precincts 
browns handdelivered letter demanded an investigation by the 
justice departments civil rights division 
the charge was made as race flared as an issue helms bid to 
defeat a stiff challenge from gantt 
helms has accused gantt of favoring racial job quotas and he is 
airing an advertisement showing the hands of a white job applicant 
crushing a rejection letter the announcer states that the job went 
to a minority applicant to fulfill a hiring quota 
the votes of blacks in north carolina are considered a crucial 
ingredient in gantts efforts to unseat helms a threeterm 
conservative republican 
dunne said the investigation determined that the postcards had 
been disseminated on a fairly broad basis 
earlier in the day a federal judge in newark nj held that 
the republican national committee was not involved in the north 
carolina mailings which democrats charged violated a 1982 consent 
decree signed by the national gop 
fbi agents spent the weekend interviewing state party officials 
and two justice department voting rights lawyers were dispatched to 
north carolina on monday to pursue the investigation others were 
being sent to join them dunne said 
we will continue to look at the whole scheme that was 
utilized to determine if any civil rights violation occurred 
dunne said what we were concerned about in the short term was 
countering any negative or deterring effect these cards might 
have 
the investigation so far has determined that the postcards were 
mailed to voters in 29 different counties though dunne said the 
department had not had an opportunity to verify the democratic 
charge that they were targeted to heavily black precincts 
dunne said investigators were compiling a list of the precincts 
for the specific purpose of advising our team what to look for 
dunne said a large number of mailings were made in mecklenburg 
county near charlotte some were also reported in edgecombe 
county in eastern north carolina where 36 federal officials had 
already been sent to observe the election 
the north carolina republican party has turned over documents 
from the mailing campaign to the justice department dunne said 
evidence of any violations could be used to pursue a civil suit 
he stressed that there was no evidence of any criminal 
violations of civil rights laws 
republicans had dismissed the democratss complaint about the 
mailings as much ado about nothing 
its merely an effort to ensure that its a fair honest 
election rick shelby political director of the national 
republican senatorial campaign committee said last week 
jack hawke the north carolina gop chairman last week defended 
the postcards saying the only people who received a mailing from 
us are those that are improperly registered

a federal judge refused to set bail monday for 
joseph doherty who for seven years has fought deportation for the 
1980 slaying of an army officer in northern ireland 
us district judge miriam g cedarbaum rejected dohertys 
request for bail saying he was likely to flee if released 
doherty 35 was arrested in new york in 1983 he faces a life 
sentence for the 1980 slaying of a british officer killed in a 
gunfight between british troops and dohertys fourman irish 
republican army unit 
doherty has never been charged with a crime in the united states 
and has been held without bail since his arrest he has said he 
quit the ira before coming to the united states in1982 
the evidence is overwhelming that petitioner if released 
would pose such a substantial risk of flight that no condition of 
bail could reasonably assure his surrender for deportation 
cedarbaum said in her decision 
doherty escaped from prison in northern ireland in 1981 and hid 
in this country with help from americans sympathetic to his cause 
she said 
while conceding that the length of detention was extremely 
troubling the judge rejected dohertys contention that his 
lengthy imprisonment violated his constitutional rights 
the judge said many constitutional protections did not apply to 
aliens in deportation proceedings 
dohertys lawyer mary pike said she would appeal the ruling 
there is something very ominous in the notion that an 
individual who is unconvicted of any crime can be imprisoned for in 
excess of seven years pike said 
the irishamerican community has rallied around doherty naming 
him honorary grand marshal of st patricks day parades around the 
country and sending him thousands of letters of support 
dozens of politicians and religious leaders have visited him in 
prison the city also gave his name to a street near the facility 
the ira is fighting to drive the british out of northern ireland 
and unite the province where protestants outnumber roman 
catholics by a 32 margin with the overwhelmingly catholic irish 
republic 
more than 2700 people have been killed in northern ireland 
since political and sectarian violence erupted in 1969

vetoed the promotion of two army generals recommended by gen 
augusto pinochet his predecessor and still army commander 
aylwin refused to discuss his reasons but he told an 
interviewer on state tv he expects the army to accept his decision 
without any problems 
constitutionally my decision cannot be contested the armed 
forces must be obedient he said 
the army and pinochet have not commented 
the president acknowledged that pinochet finds it difficult to 
accommodate to his new subordinate position as army commander 
after ruling chile as an absolute master for almost 17 years

presidency over to aylwin an elected civilian last march

regime he remained army chief and aylwin cannot fire him 
aylwin said he vetoed the promotions to major general of carlos 
parera and ramon castro two brigadier generals considered staunch 
pinochet loyalists 
the president said he approved all the promotions suggested by 
the chiefs of the navy air force and national police because they 
previously discussed them with defense minister patricio rojas 
pinochet he added chose to make the proposal without any 
consultations whatsoever

the murder trial of marlon brandos 
son was delayed indefinitely monday by an appeals court decision to 
review the status of brandos daughter who is recovering from a 
drug overdose in tahiti 
cheyenne brando 20 is the key witness to events that led to 
the shooting death of her 26yearold lover dag drollet at the 
actors home on may 16 brandos son christian 32 had been 
scheduled to go on trial monday for firstdegree murder 
miss brando fled to tahiti a month after the killing gave birth 
to drollets child and had refused to return to california to 
testify authorities in tahiti also have barred her exit charging 
her as an accomplice in drollets murder 
the legal tangle over her testimony led to a lastminute stay 
prosecutors say they cant win the case without her testimony 
the states 2nd district court of appeal issued a brief ruling 
late monday upholding the stay and ordering legal briefs to be 
submitted by brandos attorney on nov 13 with responding briefs 
from the prosecution on nov 19 
the trial is on hold said district attorney spokeswoman 
sandi gibbons 
the threemember appeals panel said it would decide the issues 
on the basis of written documents however the court left the door 
open for the lower court to reconsider its role in prosecution 
efforts to force miss brando to return from tahiti and testify 
the main dispute is whether a california court can issue an 
international letter seeking official help from french authorities 
to arrange miss brandos testimony 
judges in superior and federal courts have refused to rule 
saying they lacked jurisdiction in the international matter but 
the appeals court said the superior court could take up the 
question again 
on thursday night miss brando was rushed to a tahitian hospital 
in a coma by friday she awakened and was reported to be 
recovering from a drug overdose 
cheyennes troubled life has been a subplot to the brando affair 
from the start she is said to be emotionally disturbed addicted 
to drugs and still suffering effects of a nearfatal auto accident 
in 1989 
she was seven months pregnant when marlon brando dialed 911 to 
tell police there had been a shooting at his mansion 
prosecutors say christian brando decided to kill drollet because 
he had been physically abusing his sister 
defense attorney robert shapiro said christian brando and 
drollet fought over a gun that accidentally went off 
miss brandos version of events has never been clear she has 
given at least five depositions in the united states and tahiti 
but shapiro says they have contained conflicting accounts 
marlon brando who wept last month when he spoke of his 
daughters plight flew to tahiti friday to be with her he is 
expected to testify at the trial

democrat dianne feinstein took a shot at 
malerun government and republican pete wilson got a bracing hand 
from ronald reagan in the final rounds monday in their 40 million 
bout for governor 
the candidates both 57 spent the day repeating their basic 
themes and exhorting volunteers to bring californias 135 million 
registered voters to the polls to decide a race expected to be 
close 
if wilson the junior senator from california had help from the 
former president and california governor feinstein the former 
mayor of san francisco had her own celebrity booster the last day 
on the hustings comedian chevy chase 
wilson began the day in sacramento and made the rounds of 
rallies from san jose to his hometown of san diego including two 
appearances with reagan 
feinstein campaigned from san diego to san francisco also 
finishing up on home turf 
much is at stake in winning the top job in the countrys most 
populous state 
the republican party nationally was hoping to install one of 
their own as governor to block a democratengineered 
reapportionment when political boundaries are redrawn as they 
always are after a national census the states 45member 
congressional delegation is expected to grow to 52 
democrats also want to take back control of the governors 
office after eight years in gop hands 
in mission viejo reagan urged 2500 republicans to vote for 
wilson to protect republican interests 
if we dont elect pete wilson as governor our opponents will 
gerrymander those district lines as they have been doing for half 
a century and draw them to elect more democrats to sacramento and 
washington reagan said 
reagan was a bit off on his history democrats controlled 
california reapportionment in the 1960s and 1980s but republicans 
controlled it in the 1950s then in the 1970s the state supreme 
court approved new districts after reagan then governor and the 
democratic controlled legislature deadlocked 
the candidates hit hard at each other wherever they went 
wilson depicted feinstein as a softoncrime fiscally 
irresponsible executive feinstein characterized wilson as a 
protectthewealthy conservative with little empathy for 
wageearners 
feinstein hammered on wilsons vote against the civil rights 
act wilson accused feinstein of trying to divide californians 
along racial and class lines 
this election may decide not only the next governor but the 
political future for feinstein the first woman to wage a 
majorparty campaign for governor of california 
i say weve had enough of the blue suits feinstein told 500 
students at the university of california davis its time to try 
a skirt 
the republicans want us to reward them for the fiscal decline 
of the 1980s she told a santa monica rally of 150 supporters 
for eight years they have taken us in the wrong direction for 
eight years weve had uncontrolled growth increasing crime and 
declining schools she said 
there will be no democratic gerrymander wilson told 200 
backers in sacramento 
he said feinsteins accusation that he is beholden to wealthy 
special interests leaves her sounding much more like 
massachusetts gov michael dukakis it doesnt sell 
speaking of selling between them feinstein and wilson have 
spent about 40 million on their campaigns since last year mostly 
for television advertising

flags fluttered at halfstaff monday 
across mary martins nevernever land 
it was here in a still gracious victorian country home that 
the beloved broadway star was born 76 years ago and where she 
returned often during a career that won her worldwide renown 
martin one of the new york theaters leading ladies for more 
than 30 years died of cancer saturday at her home in rancho 
mirage calif 
the newspaper in this town about 30 miles west of fort worth 
memorialized her monday with a frontpage drawing of a smiling 
martin and a crying tinker bell crouched in the corner 
critically acclaimed and widely admired for her roles in a 
number of blockbuster musicals it was a tune called my heart 
belongs to daddy that launched her career and it was her stage 
and screen renditions of peter pan that made her famous 
and she brought the magic of both back home in her own special 
way 
in her book my heart belongs she honored her hometown with 
a chapter titled my heart belongs to weatherford and she 
reminded the folks of that in 1983 when she was here to receive 
many honors 
on july 4 1976 americas 200th birthday martin came home to 
unveil ronald thomasons statue of peter pan that was being placed 
in front of the weatherford public library in memory of her 
parents 
quoting from her most famous role she said i have a place 
where dreams are born and time is never planned its not on any 
chart you must find it with your heart nevernever land 
weatherford she said was her nevernever land 
on monday the home at 414 w lee st had two pumpkins and a 
wooden swing on the front porch a for sale sign in the front 
yard and a family of admirers occupying the rambling fivebedroom 
turnofthecentury dwelling everyone loved her said molly 
carpenter who has lived in the house eight years with her husband 
jim and two daughters the family is getting preparing to move to 
nearby fort worth 
she was a remarkable person and part of this town she said 
you could stand in the middle of the street and scream whos a 
fan of mary martins and theyd come pouring out of their 
doors 
mrs carpenter said she met martins son dallas star larry 
hagman many times but the broadway star herself only once when 
she came back to weatherford for the funeral of a friend 
about three years ago martin had a friend take her picture in 
front of the house 
she sent the carpenters a copy which said to the carpenters 
in the house where i was born with love mary martin 
the flag at the old brick post office flew at halfstaff monday 
as did others scattered about the city of some 15000 residents 
old friends remembered martin as much for her close ties to 
weatherford as for her legendary star status 
however marge ashcroft a high school classmate of martins 
told the weatherford democrat she keeps thinking of the scene in 
peter pan where he encourages the audience to clap their hands 
to bring back a fading tinker bell 
it kind of makes us want to clap our hands to bring her 
back she said

president bush signed a 492 billion 
deficitreduction package into law monday night a reluctant 
electioneve reminder to voters of pending tax increases 
bush delayed signing the controversial budget package until 820 
pm 920 pm est beating a midnight est deadline when 
temporary spending authority was to expire the tortured passage 
last month of the package which includes 140 billion in tax 
increases as well as significant cuts in government spending 
plunged bushs administration into disarray and crippled his 
oncehigh approval ratings 
the president who spent the day campaigning on behalf of 
republican candidates in texas also signed the 13 appropriations 
bills that provide money for the government for the next 11 months 
bush wound up five days of political travel urging voters to 
get out there and vote ending a midterm election campaign 
marked by mixed messages and squabbling among his advisers 
the budget package caused the president considerable political 
damage within his own party and white house advisers had worked 
hard to move voters attention off the budget fiasco 
camaigning in his adoptive home state the president sought to 
emphasize positive electioneve themes acting on a recommendation 
from some advisers to look more presidential 
in the final days leading up to tuesdays midterm elections 
bush has been buffeted by conflicting recommendations from senior 
advisers about how to make the best of his falling popularity said 
aides who spoke on the condition of anonymity 
after bush found that the slumping economy and his wavering 
positions on tax and budget issues were not playing well to 
republican audiences he first embarked on a blistering attack on 
democrats blaming them for shoving new tax increases down his 
throat 
aides said that the democratbashing approach primarily urged 
by bushs combative chief of staff john sununu appeared to be 
backfiring 
according to sources bushs former pollster robert teeter and 
his 1988 media consultant roger ailes bypassed sununu last week 
and persuaded bush to lighten up and to stress positive themes 
one official said that bushs apparent wavering on themes over 
the past few days did not reflect shift of positions as much as 
conflicting advice 
as bushs political sights began to refocus toward his own 1992 
reelection effort the president also vented his frustration at 
commentaries on his diminished popularity and the mood of the 
electorate 
at a gop rally in tyler bush lashed out at the cynics these 
washington pundits that we see on these tiring shows all the 
time 
i dont know if youre like me maybe youve enjoyed these 
things but i can only take so much selfflagellation bush 
declared 
dont tell me whats wrong with this country show us whats 
right about it he asserted with gop gubernatorial candidate 
clayton williams at his side

jimmy carter saying i get so tired of contentions that 
theres a great malaise about the political process

demanding the iraqi leader withdraw from kuwait 
unchecked and uncontrolled aggression could be world war 
tomorrow he said 
at a final campaign gala in houston the presence of three or 
four protesters shouting no war for oil gave bush an entry into

arabia is not to secure oil but to oppose naked aggression 
the protesters were hustled out of the room 
bush was to vote in houston on tuesday before returning to 
washington 
as bush and his wife barbara campaigned across texas the

their longtime ties to the state

democrats filed a complaint monday with the 
federal election commission alleging that a group headed by 
evangelist pat robertson had failed to report spending against 
democratic house candidates in four states 
robertson rejected the suggestion that the group has failed to 
meet federal requirements 
the complaint alleged that robertsons christian coalition has 
been buying radio spots and sending mail opposing democratic 
candidates in at least four house districts criticizing and 
often distorting their voting records 
the documents filed by the democratic congressional campaign 
committee named incumbent reps ben jones of georgia pat williams 
of montana richard stallings of idaho and jolene unsoeld of 
washington unsoeld and jones both freshmen are locked in 
cliffhanger reelection races 
in a radio spot aimed at williams the group contends that the 
lawmaker wants to raise our taxes to pay for pornography 
williams has been a prominent defender of the national endowment 
for the arts against attacks by conservatives who say it funds 
obscene art 
letters addressed dear christian friend went into jones 
district making similar allegations and asking for money for the 
christian coalition 
organizations which spend money to promote or defeat candidates 
on their own without coordinating with the candidates own 
campaigns are allowed unlimited spending but must register with 
the fec and report their activities and the sources of their money 
the group has failed to do so the dccc charged 
the coalition isnt urging the defeat or election of any 
candidate and the radio spots constitute a public education 
campaign said frankie abourjilie a spokeswoman for robertson the 
spots suggest that listeners write the candidates and tell them how 
they feel about the issues 
it is incredible that some members of congress dont want to 
face voters on critical issues such as taxes and how those tax 
dollars are spent robertson said in a statement through 
abourjilie 
our interest is in securing votes against taxfunded 
pornography the coalitions executive director ralph reed said 
last week 
the christian coalition was formed as a nonprofit evangelical 
organization by robertson a religious broadcaster and 1988 
republican presidential candidate its literature says it is not 
affiliated with any political party and doesnt endorse candidates 
but coalition director ralph reed in a nov 1 appearance on 
robertsons 700 club television program said the group was 
distributing voter guides in hopes of increasing turnout and 
electing people like jesse helms and tom tauke gop senate 
candidates in north carolina and iowa 
reed also named jones unsoeld and stallings on the program as 
in serious trouble because of the obscene art issue 
the coalition has sent voters in several states reproductions of 
sexually explicit photographs by the late robert mapplethorpe that 
were displayed with the help of an nea grant

the supreme court carved out a oneman 
exception to the military services ban on homosexuals monday 
letting stand a ruling that forces the army to reenlist a gay 
soldier 
the justices without comment rejected the bush 
administrations challenge to the ordered reinstatement of perry 
watkins of tacoma wash a 16year veteran with an excellent 
service record 
mondays action is not expected to affect in any sweeping way 
the militarys ban on homosexuals the appeals court ruling in 
watkins case did not address the validity of that ban but instead 
noted the army repeatedly had reenlisted watkins while knowing he 
is gay 
the case nevertheless had been closely watched by gay rights 
advocates 
these days well take a victory any way we can get one 
said paul didonato of the national gay rights advocates in san 
francisco after acknowledging that watkins victory was a narrow 
one 
but didonato said watkins case sends a broader signal out to 
the military and the country at large that gays and lesbians cannot 
be treated unfairly forever by the military or any other 
employer 
watkins said my next step is obviously to get reinstated 
he said he wants to serve until he can retire with an army pension 
in about five years 
asked if he anticipated problems after his reinstatement 
watkins said that goes without saying the problems that are 
going to be there are the problems the system itself will 
create im asking for the same rights any other citizen 
receives 
there was no immediate reaction from the army or the department 
of defense 
in other matters the court 
refused to let some puerto rico cable tv systems be prosecuted 
for carrying the playboy channel rebuffing arguments that states 
antiobscenity efforts may be hampered unduly 
left intact a ruling from illinois that lets prosecutors punish 
businesses convicted of dealing in obscenity by seizing their 
property 
ruled unanimously in a mississippi case that someone suing more 
than one defendant generally does not have to include all of them 
in the same lawsuit 
agreed to decide in a case from california whether convicted 
defendants may seek a federal courts help if state courts refuse 
to explain why their appeals were rejected 
let stand an ohio supreme court ruling that the public has no 
constitutional right to attend juvenile court proceedings 
in the case of the gay soldier the 9th us circuit court of 
appeals last year said sgt watkins has greatly benefited the 
army and therefore the country by his military service 
in addition watkins homosexuality clearly has not hurt the 
army in any way the appeals court said equity cries out and 
demands that the army be estopped prohibited from refusing to 
reenlist watkins on the basis of his homosexuality 
watkins was drafted in 1968 during the vietnam war although he 
never served there he was 19 
in filling out a preinduction medical form he marked yes 
in answering a question that asked whether he had homosexual 
tendencies he was inducted anyway 
from 1967 through 1980 he was the subject of three army 
investigations each one was sparked by watkins telling a superior 
about his homosexuality but after each investigation he was 
allowed to reenlist 
watkins served two tours of duty in korea and subsequently was 
stationed at fort lewis near tacoma he was allowed to reenlist a 
total of three times 
in 1981 the army adopted a new regulation requiring the 
discharge of all homosexuals 
a review board in 1982 voted to discharge watkins but before 
the disharge orders were issued a federal judge barred the army 
from taking such action 
seven years of court maneuvering and conflicting rulings 
followed before the appeals court ruling but watkins now 42 was 
forced to accept an honorable discharge in 1984 after a threejudge 
appeals court panel voted against him 
his lawsuit against the army sought reinstatement with back pay 
he would be eligible for a full army pension with five more years 
of service watkins has 16 years paid but because of the legal 
battle only 15 years of active duty and thus needs five years more 
to reach the 20year mark at which service members may draw 
pensions 
the 1989 ruling by an 11judge appeals court panel that voted 
74 for watkins did not say he was entitled to back pay and 
implied the army could try to discharge him for any future 
homosexual acts 
but the ruling said the army may not attempt to discharge 
watkins for any alleged homosexual acts that were the subject of 
past discharge proceedings or for any past or future statements by 
watkins acknowledging his homosexuality

president bush officially ended months of 
partisan brawling with congress over taxes and the budget monday by 
signing a bill to cut 492 billion from the deficit over the next 
five years 
no one got everything he or she wanted but the end product is 
a compromise that merits enactment bush said in a statement 
affixed to the largest package of deficit cuts and tax increaeses 
in history 
bush also signed 13 separate appropriations bills to finance the 
government through the fiscal year that began last oct 1 and to 
carry out the edicts of the budget compromise 
while bush convened a rose garden ceremony to unveil an earlier 
version of the package he signed the final measure in private 
just hours before the midnight deadline after dinner at a local 
restaurant 
eleven of the bills were flown from washington by special 
courier so bush could sign them all together 
the plan calls for over 140 billion in new taxes over the next 
five years including in increase in the tax rate on the richest 
americans from the current 28 percent to 31 percent and even a few 
points higher for some 
bushs abandonment of his no new taxes pledge and the long 
budget stalemate between the white house and the 
democraticcontrolled congress contributed to bushs preelection 
decline in popularity 
it also caused severe dissension within the ranks of his own 
party as many republicans repudiated the package and bushs 
turnabout on taxes 
this act is the result of long hard work by the 
administration and the congress bush said in the statement 
he called the measure an important measure for ensuring 
americas longterm economic growth 
bush said that the package embodied a new fiscal order for the 
federal government 
the measure will lower taxes to 31 percent for some 35 
million uppermiddleincome taxpayers who now pay a 33 percent rate 
under an anonomaly in the tax code that has placed their marginal 
rates at more than the top rate for those earning substantially 
more 
the budget deal also phases out deductions for highincome 
americans and imposes higher taxes on gasoline cigarettes 
alcohol and on luxury items like exotic cars and yachts 
the legislation includes a new 22 billion program of tax 
credits and grant money for child care mostly for poor working 
families 
the president said the child care measure will enlarge the 
opportunities of parents to obtain the child care they desire 
bush also signed 13 separate bills providing funds for fiscal 
1991 for all federal agencies and programs among them 
a 153 billion foreign aid bill that would forgive egypts 
past military debt and sharply restrict aid to el salvador 
a 182 billion bill for health and human service programs that 
provides money for new programs to combat aids while retaining a 
10year limitation on the use of federal money for abortions 
a 193 billion measure to operate the commerce justice and 
state departments including more money for savings and loan 
prosecutions 
a 268 billion defense spending bill that cuts 2 billion from 
the presidents 47 billion request for the strategic defense 
initiative while keeping alive the stealth bomber sought by the 
administration and the tiltrotor v22 osprey assault transport 
bush has tried for two years to kill

information to traders 
conditions in most financial markets remain difficult and 
unsettled making forecasting beyond the current year more than 
usually hazardous said managing director glen renfrew we 
cannot rule out further setbacks but the recent new order rate has 
been large enough in combination with costcutting to support 
steady growth

company about 194 million in 1990

1990 to be about 620 million he said

united press international said nov 2 it will 
cut salaries of employees not covered by union contracts by 35 
percent for 90 days as part of an economy move designed to bring 
about a sale of the news service 
upi also said its board of directors had changed company policy 
so that nonunion employes can be dismissed without any notice or 
severance pay 
in a message to all members of the staff upi executive vice 
president pieter vanbennekom said the news agency had begun talks 
with the wire service guild which represents employees under union 
contract 
at the unions headquarters in new york a member said guild 
president kevin keane and secretarytreasurer chris dahl went to 
philadelphia on nov 1 to meet with upi officials he said they had 
not reported back on the meeting 
upi spokesman milt capps said employees in the guild 
jurisdiction are exempt from the salary cutback and still would be 
entitled to notice and severance whether or not they belong to the 
union 
capps declined to say how many employees are affected or what 
percentage of the staff they represent he said it would be against 
company policy to do so the order is systemwide he said 
upi has changed ownership three times in eight years and is now 
owned by infotechnology inc last week infotechnology announced a 
management shakeup and disclosed financial problems that could 
result in the sale of its businesses the company also owns 
financial news network 
upi announced in september that it was closing bureaus in five 
states and said oct 21 that it will dismiss an unspecified number 
of employes as it concentrates its reporting in 15 of the most 
populous states 
the salary cuts took effect nov 4 
all these drastic measures are necessary to bring upi 
immediately to cash flow selfsufficiency and to stabilize the 
company during the next few months to be able to effect a sale of 
upi in the shortest possible order vanbennekom said 
at least six preliminary expressions of interest in the purchase 
of the wire service have been received and more are expected he 
said 
many of the expressions of interest have come from the 
bluechip companies that have the greatest possible interest in 
preserving upis journalistic tradition of excellence 
vanbennekom said 
to bring the process to a successful conclusion we need the 
breathing space these measures will provide he said

reporters scrambling for stories and prosecutors 
trying to prevent news leaks that could jeopardize a trial will 
inevitably clash attorney general dick thornburgh said 
thornburgh said at a luncheon session of the 56th annual 
associated press managing editors convention on oct 31 that he 
supports the medias right to operate without censorship but he 
added that prosecutors must put an individuals right to a fair 
trial before any other concern 
as much as the defendant has the right to remain silent before 
the court the prosecutor has the obligation to remain silent 
outside the court said thornburgh who has headed the justice 
department since 1988 
prosecutors who leak information on pending criminal cases to 
the media jeopardize not only a persons right to a fair trial but 
also place the judicial systems integrity at risk thornburgh

an attorney sued the pittsburgh postgazette 
and an investigative reporter for libel nov 1 claiming his 
practice was hurt by articles about a state supreme court justice 
the lawsuit filed by james a ashton against the newspaper and 
reporter bill moushey seeks 20000 in damages 
it said an article published in july 1989 would have caused 
readers to believe that ashton improperly helped justice rolf 
larsen buy property for less than it was worth and that larsen in 
turn asked another judge to give favorable treatment to one of 
ashtons cients 
the suit says ashton acted properly and the postgazette 
articles were false 
postgazette editor john craig and moushey declined to comment 
saying they had not received a copy of the lawsuit

president bush campaigning hard for gop 
candidates in the final hours before tuesdays elections says 
people should ignore all these gloomy assessments about the 
national mood and just go vote 
the president is concentrating on energizing campaign workers 
and spurring voters to the polls as the election looms with 
uncertainty for the republican party 
bush was spending his last full day on the campaign trail today 
in his adoptive home state of texas trying to help gubernatorial 
contender clayton williams in his close race against democrat ann 
richards 
winding up an eightstate preelection tour bush was 
campaigning with williams in waco and tyler before returning to 
houston for a state republican party reception 
equals 
washington ap an americanled offensive to drive iraq out of 
kuwait probably would begin with nighttime air strikes inside iraq 
to sever saddam husseins links to his huge occupying army 
military planners and private analysts say 
such a campaign launched with the allied forces now arrayed 
against iraq would seek to exploit iraqs weaknesses in air power 
and its apparent vulnerability in kuwait to a seaborne assault and 
to naval bombardment from the persian gulf 
president bush has said repeatedly in recent days that he is 
growing impatient with saddams continuing occupation of kuwait 
though he has not decided to resort to military force he has 
stressed however that force remains an active option and that he 
will not permit the iraqi army to stay indefinitely in kuwait 
us military officials wont discuss specific war plans and 
they stress that bush for now at least has not changed their 
mission it remains the defense of saudi arabia and enforcement of 
united nations economic sanctions against iraq 
equals 
washington ap a new law limiting advertising on kids tv 
shows will force the federal communications commission to finally 
decide if toybased programs such as gi joe are really 
halfhour commercials 
if they are the shows will be taken off the air but such a 
finding also could threaten educational shows like sesame 
street and disney offerings because these programs too might be 
seen as promotions for their widely merchandised toys and other 
products 
the commission never has found productbased shows to be 
commercials and few observers expect it now to seriously clamp 
down on such programs 
color me skeptical i think the fcc is disposed to do as 
little as it thinks it can get away with andrew j schwartzman 
executive director of the washingtonbased media access project 
advocacy group said in an interview last week 
equals 
los angeles ap mary martin was remembered upon her death for 
a tomboyish charm and vibrancy that lit up the stage whether she 
flew high in peter pan or sang to children in the sound of 
music 
martin one of the new york theaters leading ladies for more 
than 30 years died of cancer saturday at age 76 at her home in 
rancho mirage 
the actress captivated audiences with her spunk and her joyous 
singing in such broadway musicals as south pacific the sound 
of music i do i do and leave it to me 
vibrant exciting and always full of life mary gave her 
millions of fans the world over some of the most memorable and 
thrilling moments in the history of entertainment said former 
first lady nancy reagan who appeared with her in the 1946 musical

in midterm elections that will deliver two 
more years of divided government president bush cant win as much 
as he has at risk 
and his republican party needs againsttheodds gains in the 
senate plus added strength in the statehouses to have a chance of 
cracking democratic control of congress later in the decade 
the danger for democrats is that voters really are frustrated 
angry enough to punish incumbents in congress the way gop 
campaigners have been urging since republicans are outnumbered in 
the house theyd stand to gain even if some of their own veterans 
are ousted 
but theres been no advance sign of a tide that would swamp many 
congressional incumbents most of them heavily bankrolled and 
heavily favored 
short of a change in congressional control which is not in view 
this time there is no simple test of national impact in offyear 
elections 
but todays balloting could affect bushs negotiating strength 
in dealing with the democratic congress for the rest of his term 
and republican chances of gaining house control for the rest of the 
century 
among the checkpoints 
bushs power to veto legislation and make it stick key to his 
bargaining power with congress should the democrats gain 10 to 12 
house seats or a handful in the senate that power would be at 
risk 
republican strength in congressional redistricting by the state 
legislatures and governors next year these elections will 
determine which party controls that process in the big states that 
are gaining and losing house seats because of population shifts 
reported in the 1990 census 
and the political alignment of the new districts will be a major 
factor in shaping the house for the next decade all told 20 
states gain or lose house seats the three key contests are 
election of governors in california florida and texas which are 
gaining 14 of the 19 house seats to be shifted in reapportionment 
positioning for the 1992 elections which are more likely to 
produce a congressional shakeup redistricting is one reason 
another is the law that entitles veteran house members who retire 
after this election to convert leftover campaign funds to personal 
use republicans look to those changes to help them whittle the 
democratic majority in the senate the gop hopes to move within 
range of control next time when 20 democratic seats will be at 
stake and only 11 of its own those longerterm republican aims 
could be put out of reach by democratic gains this time 
while the president is not on any ballot his performance is 
among the issues and bushs autumn slump has been a drag on the 
gop 
still offyear campaigns are not a referendum on a president 
even when he says otherwise as ronald reagan did in 1986 when he 
asked people to vote for him one last time it didnt work 
republicans lost control of the senate that year they had won 
control with a 12seat gain when reagan was elected in 1980 
this time neither party anticipates so clear a verdict 
republicans concede that the senate is beyond their reach john 
sununu the white house chief of staff forecasts a standoff or 
close to it in competition for 34 seats today the lineup now is 
55 democrats 45 republicans 
the house is more heavily democratic than it has been at the 
midterm of any republican president in this century the democrats 
have 259 seats and their strategists expect gains of 10 or so in 
todays balloting 
the offyear average is 25 seats lost by the white house party 
sununu cites that benchmark and says the gop goal is to hold losses 
to fewer than half the average 
but losses in that range would jeopardize the bush veto margin 
and with it his strategy for dealing with the democratic congress 
bush has used 16 vetoes and the threat of others to bargain for 
his position on issues from abortion to the minimum wage to crime 
legislation to the budget 
hes never been overridden which takes twothirds votes in both 
branches of congress but its sometimes been close the last house 
override attempt on a textile quota bill fell 10 votes short the 
senate came within a vote of overriding his civil rights bill veto 
and the enforceable veto is likely to become increasingly 
important in the next congress as bush and the democrats head 
toward the 1992 campaign for the white house

when americans prepare to vote today they might 
dwell again on those spending cuts passed by congress that will 
somehow cut household budgets but raise uncle sams expenditures 
a lot of americans say it doesnt make sense and it probably 
doesnt at the least its confusing did congress cut spending as 
it says it did or did it merely cut the spending ability of 
american households 
the easy explanation is the one usually offered that because of 
the seriousness of the budget deficit an enlightened congress 
reached the tortuously difficult decision simultaneously to raise 
your taxes and cut its spending 
but there is more to the explanation than that and some critics 
contend it involves financial sleight of hand accounting gimmicks 
and deliberate misrepresentation by those very people elected to 
represent americans 
taxes will rise for sure a laborsupported research group 
citizens for tax justice says the added tax tab for a family of 
four might be around 321 a sizable sum for families who felt they 
had cut their budget to the bone 
but spending will not be cut it will rise 
a conservative scholar scott hodge contends that to claim 
spending cuts is to lie congress did not have the courage to cut 
one dollar of waste pork fraud or unnecessary spending from the 
fiscal 1991 budget he says 
hodge budget expert at the conservative heritage foundation 
says congress will spend 175 for every new dollar of taxes raised 
in the new tax package they are lying when they say that 
spending will be cut he says 
indeed he continues they gave their favorite programs big 
increases over fiscal 1990 funding levels and he points out that 
these programs will continue to grow over the fiveyear life of the 
package 
by his calculations nondefense domestic spending is guaranteed 
to rise by 245 billion through 1995 or 6 percent a year and to 
this must be added net interest on the debt and whatever it takes 
to bail out the savings and loans 
but you say congress said it had cut spending yes it did 
but congress speaks a language neither linguists nor privatesector 
accountants understand briefly it first raises the numbers then 
cuts from them 
while some of the absurd projects the fabled 84000 study of 
why people fall in love or the 2500 study of the causes of 
rudeness lying and cheating on tennis courts might not be as 
obvious favorite local projects are 
bee research money for utah for example and peanut research 
for georgia north carolina and virginia locoweed research for new 
mexico a navigation project for redondo beach calif a zebra 
mussel research project 
such projects often are worthwhile but hodge suggests they 
might involve local special interests rather than those of the 
federal government and the public interest and for that reason 
should be scrutinized 
hodge has a long list of guideliness for use by congress if it 
really wants to cut rather than twist the language and the numbers 
to say it is cutting these he says are among those projects that 
should raise questions 
programs that serve localized or special interests 
programs that have failed fulfilled their missions outlived 
their usefuless or simply become irrelevant 
those programs that duplicate or contradict other programs 
proposals that suggest congress is engaging in central planning 
or seeking to set national priorities that should be left to 
individuals or communities 
programs that compete with private commercial enterprises 
hodge suggests still another area where spending reform could 
have been practiced at the time of his study he says the 
appropriations bill for the legislative branch was unavailable 
had it been printed he says it would show the 30 percent 
pay raise that congress gave itself earlier this year

a story venezuelans tell on their 
colombian neighbors is coming true at home 
a traveler tells a friend i saw the eiffel tower so i knew 
we were in paris i saw the pope and figured we were in rome one 
day i reached for my wallet and it was gone i knew i was in 
colombia 
these days with the oil boom of the early 1980s long gone 
venezuela is earning its own reputation for missing wallets armed 
robbery stolen cars business fraud and government corruption 
caracas was a small colonial city of unlocked doors 40 years 
ago now it is a metropolis of apartment buildings surrounded by 
walls of stone and steel patrolled by armed guards and dogs 
nightlife has dwindled hardly anyone stops to help a stranger 
squatter shacks sprout near mansions 
there are no safe zones one of the citys most hazardous areas 
is las mercedes known for fancy restaurants expensive boutiques 
and armed robbers 
the mayor of caracas outlawed liquor sales after midnight 
figuring less drinking would mean less crime but the trend 
continued upward 
last month president carlos andres perez sent a 600member 
national guard unit into the streets 
crime has forced us to require the national guard in new 
roles with greater importance more members and a mandate to 
work permanently in cities such as caracas he said 
venezuela had a decadelong oil boom during which its people 
felt immune to such problems the rich times were followed by seven 
years of economic decline that exposed the immunity as a myth 
half the nation is desperately poor and nearly half the workers 
earn less than 100 a month but most of those who try to explain 
the crime wave blame other things 
many mention a national desire to continue living high with 
little effort known as facilismo 
andres coba of the national neighborhood association facur said 
in an interview at a fashionable outdoor cafe we had so much 
money the whole world aspired to it we sat at tables like these in 
our new york clothes and talked about france and madrid 
police chief gonzalo elias bajares colmenares who has 7000 men 
in a city of about 45 million took a similar view 
people arent stealing eggs or ham or bread or meat he 
said but generally trying to get money to pay for luxury 
items 
authorities blame youths under 18 for 75 percent of street 
crime but many run free because of lenient punishment for 
juveniles and become pawns of adult gangs overcrowded jails and 
political judges clog the criminal justice system 
here are some recent cases 
a youth gang attacked a 15yearold handicapped boy and stole 
his wheelchair

pulitzer prizewinning reporter hg bissinger 
went to a small texas town to discover how high school sports can 
bind a community 
what he found was a town where racism was rampant football 
received more support than english and school district lines were 
drawn to make sure that the best athletes went to the best school 
friday night lights a town a team and a dream has become 
a best seller but not in odessa where threats were made to two 
bookstores carrying the volume the author said 
bissinger gives a graphic look inside the permian high school 
huddle and field house and into the friday night spectacle of 
packed stadiums and screaming fans 
i went in search of the friday night lights to find a town 
where they brightly blazed that lay beyond the east coast and the 
grip of the big cities a place that people had to pull out an 
atlas to find and had seen better times a real america writes 
bissinger who won a pulitzer prize in 1987 with two other 
philadelphia inquirer reporters for a sixpart investigative series 
exposing corruption in the philadelphia court system he now works 
for the chicago tribune 
bissinger said he found those lights in odessa and they burned 
with more intensity than he had ever imagined 
like thousands of others i got caught up in them he said 
so did my wife so did my children as someone later described 
it those lights become an addiction if you live in a place like 
odessa the friday night fix 
he was troubled by how many people in odessa traced the citys 
troubles to a judges desegregation order in 1982 the order forced 
the closing of odessas predominantly black ector high school and 
divided its students between permian and odessa high schools with 
district lines suspiciously drawn so the top black athletes would 
go to permian 
bissinger said he found common use of the word nigger among 
boosters public officials merchants and ordinary residents as 
well as coaches and white players on permians predominantly white 
football team the panthers 
permians coaches were openly derisive of blacks when none was 
around and forced players to compete when injured the author said 
shots were given at halftime of games to relieve pain or to replace 
body fluids 
i was extremely disappointed there were so many things he 
could have written that were positive that werent focused on 
said thencoach gary gaines who gave bissinger unrestricted access 
to permian during 1988 when the twicebeaten panthers lost again in 
the state semifinals 
we just gave him free run of the mill said gaines now 
defensive secondary coach at texas tech he came and went and 
attended every practice every game every meeting he was writing 
all the time we didnt have anything to hide we really liked the 
guy 
what stings the most gaines said is the books portrayal of 
him and his coaches as racists 
that hurts because that certainly is not what we based our 
program on he said we dont talk like that and didnt 
gaines said he took bissinger at his word that he planned to 
write a positive book about the fabled odessa permian football 
program 
bissinger however said he doesnt recall telling gaines he was 
doing a positive piece 
i think i told him there were elements that would be positive 
and i felt that the book would have been positive the author 
said but a lot of things happened that made it impossible to be 
a positive book im not the one who called an 18yearold 
black kid a big old dumb nigger one of his coaches did that i 
certainly wasnt the one who sent the wrong film to harvard on 
behalf of a black kid a game in which the student didnt play 
that was coach gaines 
i knew these people and became friendly with them and it was 
difficult to write the things i did but i had to be honest and 
objective and say things i felt had to be said 
bissinger was spurred into writing the book in part because of 
his own past as an addicted sports fan who had spent much of 
his time watching football basketball and baseball 
the idea had been rattling in my head since i was 13 years 
old the idea of high school sports keeping a town together 
keeping it alive he said 
bissinger played two years of high school football and was 
sports editor of both his high school and college newspaper the 
daily pennsylvanian at university of pennsylvania 
friday night lights describes a city hit hard when oil 
prices plummeted in the early 1980s ruining a region that depends 
upon petroleum 
odessas obsession with one of the nations most successful high 
school football programs enabled residents to keep their heads high 
and remain upbeat no matter how bleak the economy the panthers 
have been in nine state finals since 1965 winning five 
championships three in the 80s 
but to its detriment odessa relegated everything else behind 
football bissinger writes 
little was expected academically of permian football players 
the book says one linemans senior year classes consisted of 
government and the electives of sociology computer math 
photography and food science 
he breezed through them with ease then came the hard work he 
got to football practice where the demands and pressures were 
ceaseless the second he stepped on the field bissinger wrote 
nothing he did went unnoticed if he did something well he 
received praise if he did something wrong it was pointed out in 
painstaking detail and if it wasnt detected during practice it 
was discovered afterward when the coaches retired to their office 
to watch videos of the days workout on the elaborate video machine 
that had been donated by the booster club 
during the 1988 season permian spent 70000 for chartered jets 
for the players to and from distant game sites 
the school spent more for medical supplies for athletic programs 
at permian 6750 than it did for teaching materials for the 
english department 5040 which did not cover required 
textbooks 
the salary of the head of the english department at permian was 
32000 compared to gaines salary of 48000 plus free use of a 
new sedan each year

screenwriter bruce joel rubin recently talked 
about how to turn nighttime dreams into fun and profit 
jacobs ladder came to me as a dream he said it 
started with me in the subway the underworld of new york in a 
sense as i left the train and walked along a very deserted 
platform late at night i walked up the stairs and found the gate 
was locked that has happened to me in real life but in the dream 
i just felt that something was wrong 
i walked to the other end of the platform and that exit was 
locked as well i got very frightened and i said something 
terrible is happening i had this feeling that the only way out 
was down through the bowels of new york i felt i would have to go 
to hell to become free to get out 
thats the start of tim robbins descent into a personal hell in 
jacobs ladder its a thriller written by rubin a hot 
screenwriter because of ghost and directed by adrian lyne 
also hot because of fatal attraction 
robbins is a vietnam veteran beset with dreams and 
hallucinations he learns that his combat buddies have undergone 
the same bedevilment and he tries to discover the reason 
two years have passed since lynes sensationridden fatal 
attraction why the gap the director explained that jacobs 
ladder started at paramount pictures but fell from favor after a 
change in regimes the project shifted to columbia pictures 
also i worked for a year on the special effects aspects of 
the movie he added one problem that took a long while was 
that we did all the special effects incamera when we shot rather 
than handing over the special effects as a kind of package to a 
company like ilm industrial light and magic 
i was anxious to do it that way because i think that sometimes 
movies with special effects get into a kind of sameness because 
the same guy is doing the special effects for all of them 
robbins known for his offcenter comedy in such movies as 
bull durham and cadillac man was a surprise casting as the 
bedeviled veteran 
he obviously wasnt an obvious choice in commercial terms 
lyne admitted the studio would have been happy with a mel gibson 
or a harrison ford who bring an audience to a movie i liked tim 
i think hes a very vulnerable sympathetic man for a start and i 
loved him in bull durham 
because this is a kind of dark story i thought it was 
important to have an actor who had a sense of humor tim is an 
actor who finds humor where it doesnt necessarily exist in a 
scene 
lyne who also directed flashdance and 9 weeks now has 
made two thrillers in a row how far can he go with terror 
i think if its kind of gratuitous if youre just doing it 
for effect the audience senses it and it doesnt work he said 
i learned an awful lot from making fatal attraction i studied 
a lot of suspense movies and hopefully i learned from them i 
think there are moments in jacobs ladder that are genuinely 
frightening 
when i see a movie i like to be put through it i like having 
highs up there and lows down there and feeling drained at the end 
of the movie as though id been through something thats better 
than a movie that just washes over you and is forgotten in two 
minutes 
bruce joel rubin will turn directorwriter on his next project 
for paramount 
one of the wonderful benefits of being a successful writer in 
hollywood is that they allow you to do what i consider to be 
writing the final draft of a movie that is to direct it he 
said screenplays in hollywood are never really seen by anybody 
but the director and some studio people what is on the screen is 
the ultimate screenplay its not what the writer wrote 
its very frustrating for a writer to have his work translated 
by other people im the luckiest guy alive to have had wonderful 
translations what ive wanted more than anything is to direct my 
own scripts now thanks to the success of ghost paramount has 
given me that opportunity

buy extra water hoard some groceries and 
dive under your desk nbc is about to ravage the nations second 
largest city in an upcoming miniseries the big one the great 
los angeles earthquake 
just remember its sweeps time 
in the quest for big ratings televisions magnitude8 seismic 
disaster is far more catastrophic than the real big one the 
government says is at least 60 percent likely to rock southern 
california within 30 years 
modern skyscrapers are flattened quakes last too long for the 
magnitudes they are assigned by the movies writers death and 
destruction are rampant even though scientists and officials 
expect most of the city and its residents will survive the real 
great earthquake 
the twopart series airs 9 pm to 11 pm est next sunday and 
monday 
i dont think we will ever see the devastation they depicted 
in the movie said paul flores director of the southern 
california earthquake preparedness project part of the state 
office of emergency services 
the concern is that its difficult to sell preparedness when 
people are shown that level of devastation it leads to fatalism 
the public will ask how do you prepare for something like 
that 
lucy jones a seismologist at the us geological survey in 
pasadena served as a technical adviser for the miniseries and 
also as a model for its heroine crusading quakepredicting usgs 
seismologist claire winslow played by joanna kerns of growing 
pains 
the damage from the earthquake is awfully extreme theyve 
gone for the worst possible earthquake the 35yearold jones 
said it gives the image that in an earthquake youre likely to 
die 
the truth is that even in the worstcase scenarios with 
10000 or 20000 people dead thats onetenth of 1 percent of the 
people in the affected area even in a bad disaster chances are 
youre not going to die 
jones convinced the miniseries makers to tone down some 
exaggerations but said many of her objections were met by the 
response thats too bad we need that for the dramatic effect 
unfortunately the movie often lacks enough drama it takes all 
of part one to reach the brink of disaster and the plot is mucked 
up by a political assassination attempt a soap opera involving 
winslows mother and sister and what jones calls gratuitous 
sex between winslow and her husband portrayed by dan lauria of 
abcs the wonder years 
the big one does have some redeeming social value 
it emphasizes the need for citizens to prepare themselves by 
learning how to shut off natural gas lines to their homes and 
assemble quake supplies such as water food batteries and 
flashlights 
damage to lifelines such as electricity water lines phones and 
transportation links is depicted fairly accurately 
the movie also illustrates possible shortcomings of locating los 
angeles emergency operations center four levels underground and 
correctly shows how most citizens must fend for themselves after a 
big quake 
but seismologist claire winslow displays absolutely unrealistic 
certainty in predicting the big quake is imminent and an office of 
emergency services official played by joe spano of hill street 
blues is unrealistically portrayed as a political hack trying to 
muzzle winslow to protect a wealthy developer 
such drawbacks seriously hurt and oversimplify the depiction of 
the dilemma facing officials who must decide whether to warn the 
public about very uncertain signs that seismic disaster might be 
imminent 
while the expected big one most likely will be an magnitude 
75 to 8 quake some distance from los angeles on the san andreas 
fault the movie version is a magnitude 8 quake on the elysian park 
fault directly under the heart of the city seismologists suspect 
that fault probably would produce a quake no worse than magnitude 
65 to 7 
the quake in the miniseries is a very unlikely quake jones 
said it could happen but its improbable its an 
absolutely worstcase scenario 
flores objects to the public hysteria looting and panic shown 
after the quake prediction is publicized 
people behave a lot more rationally he said 
nevertheless jones enjoyed working on the big one and said 
viewers should remember its a movie its not reality 
as for kerns portrayal of a joneslike character the real 
seismologist said ive never been as skinny as she is and never 
will be in my life 
 
elsewhere in television 
theyve got your number frontline the distinguished pbs 
investigative documentary series takes a long hard look tonight at 
lotteries the staes that run them the promoters who design and 
sell them and the people who buy the tickets 
betting on the lottery focuses on sharon sharp the director

three years ago with a mandate to revitalize it 
frontline also visits maryland a state with the

he was an explorer a thrillseeker a womanizer 
insatiably curious painfully opinionated and maybe a spy 
disguised he was the first westerner to visit mecca and he led 
the first white mans expedition to africas lake tanganyika 
sir richard francis burton was the james bond of the 19th 
century says author edward rice 
but unlike agent 007 burton really existed 
rices new biography captain sir richard francis burton the 
secret agent who made the pilgrimage to mecca discovered the kama 
sutra and brought the arabian nights to the west is a surprise 
best seller making its way to nonfiction top 10 lists 
a british edition of the rice biography is being prepared and 
rice says he recently started negotiations for translations into 
german spanish and japanese 
the book charts ruffian dick from his peripatetic childhood 
in france england and italy through his arabian and african 
adventures until his restless final years in trieste italy 
there he translated the arabian nights and erotic works such as 
the kama sutra which were hardly sittingroom fair in prim 
victorian england 
burton spoke at least 29 languages often passing for a native 
speaker when his life depended on it mastered swordsmanship 
survived a spear through his jaw wrote 43 books and over 100 
articles and translated at least a dozen works from at least five 
tongues 
stubbornly unwilling to bend to victorian prohibitions or 
political expediency burton detailed female circumcision and 
homosexual brothels with the same zest as he did the ethnography of 
nile river peoples 
a man of extremes he gorged opium and other exotic drugs and 
spent much of a halfyear trip to the united states drunk 
and writes rice burton played a large but much more secret 
role in the great game the british machinations which led to 
eventual conquests of much of the middle east india and northern 
africa 
yet dogged by sometimes jealous and vituperative political 
enemies burton dubbed the white nigger went largely 
unrewarded and never surpassed the unremarkable rank of captain in 
the british armed services in his 40s he was posted as consul to 
backwater sao paolo brazil and to fernando po an isolated 
foresaken island in the bight of biafra on the african west 
coast writes rices 
largely through the efforts of his devoted and wellconnected 
wife isabel burton finally escaped for a stint as consul of 
beloved damascus 
but again unable to appease his powerful foes as skillfully as 
he charmed his myriad friends burton was soon posted to the 
nearexile of trieste 
a life as fascinating as burtons of course has not escaped 
previous notice those around him including isabel wrote 
sometimes emotionally charged articles and biographies after his 
death at age 72 100 years ago 
but not until 1963 did byron farwell in burton a biography 
of sir richard francis burton take a comprehensive and more 
objective look farwells work was reissued in 1988 and for the 
first time published in the united states by penguin at least 
four other biographies followed before rices burtons character 
also dominated the 1972 bbc miniseries the search for the nile 
rudyard kipling based at least two fictional characters on 
burton says rice philip jose farmer chose him as the hero of his 
riverworld science fiction series in which everyone who has 
died past the age of five comes back to life burton as if not 
intriguing enough in fact was fictionalized in william harrisons 
burton and speke the basis for this years film mountains 
of the moon which portrays burtons endeavors and tragic 
confrontrations with rival explorer john hanning speke 
that hollywood movie is one reason rices was the first burton 
book to reach bestseller lists 
clearly publicity and promotion can turn the tide for a book 
and a movie tiein always helps says gayle feldman an editor at 
publishers weekly 
publisher charles scribners sons pushed the book sending rice 
on book tours and national tv shows and the biography got good 
reviews throughout the media 
rices book is perhaps the most comprehensive of the burton 
biographies it quotes liberally from burtons writings and puts a 
lot of the explorers life in the context of the times drawing 
upon rices considerable knowledge of eastern religions and 
cultures 
throughout rices admiration of burton is clear and he makes 
some controversial assertions that burton was a spy has not been 
proven though rice ties scant evidence into a somewhat convincing 
whole 
rice who has written a dozen other books also seems convinced 
that burton had a mysterious persian lover whom he wooed lost and 
pined for the rest of his life 
in perhaps his most contentious argument rice says burton was a 
devoted moslem maybe even a sufi mystic scholars today heatedly 
debate burtons religious leanings as did those who lived with and 
near him 
after burtons death his wife a devout catholic burned the 
personal diaries which may have solved the arguments

author edward rice was 13 when he first 
encountered sir richard francis burton in the english explorers 
book wanderings in three countries 
later supporting himself as a freelance photographer for the 
united nations the world health organization and town and country 
magazine rice spent about three years in india traveled overland 
1800 miles up the indus valley in pakistan and went to kenya and 
somalia which burton opened up to the west 
whenever i traveled burton was always there because i turned 
to burton as a reference says the 72yearold rice whose 
captain sir richard francis burton the secret agent who made the 
pilgrimage to mecca discovered the kama sutra and brought the 
arabian nights to the west is a surprise best seller 
just coincidentally i was going to the same places that 
burton went coincidentally well i dont know maybe burtons 
spirit was up there telling me you go here or there he says 
and laughs squinting through pale blue eyes under a shock of white 
hair 
rices health has plagued him however like burton the author 
has persevered through near blindness and more 
he signed a contract for the biography in 1979 by 1980 his 
eyes were failing by 1985 he was legally blind soon thereafter 
he underwent open heart surgery he has had two eye operations 
when he finally finished the book in 1987 his publishing house 
was being overhauled and his editor left he took the book to 
charles scribners sons which published it 
rice may be one of the last burton biographers who saw cities 
the way burton did i was there just before westernization 
baghdad in 1966 just before hussein damascas was an incredibly 
beautiful arabian nights city now its full of highrises built 
by arabian oil sheiks 
rice is doubtful a burton could exist today hed be the ideal 
person to go into iraq in disguise he could have gone into iran 
during the hostage crisis and found out what was going on 
author of a dozen other books many about the middle east or 
eastern religions rice is now working on a book about a central 
pakistan civilization lost in 1500 bc but rediscovered in 1922 
the indus valley empire included the first known examples of 
central planning a grid plan and indoor plumbing according to 
rice

in taking on the presidency of the american 
red cross elizabeth dole is moving to the helm of an organization 
that has known controversy from the days of clara barton to the era 
of aids and the loma prieta earthquake 
she isnt likely to face criticism for living in a tent and 
directing operations from the field as red cross founder barton 
did but she could end up having easily as many battles on her hand 
as she did in president bushs cabinet 
after a year in which it faced record disaster expenditures the 
organization has taken heat not only for its handling of such 
emergencies but for its role as a supplier of blood for 
transfusions 
elizabeth dole has the stature and talent to revitalize the 
national red cross and make it the kind of modern helping force 
necessary for disasters in the 1990s san francisco mayor art 
agnos said when the outgoing labor secretary was named to the new 
job 
from our experience in the loma prieta earthquake it is 
needed agnos added 
others echoed his view 
when the national red cross has become involved in the past 
there has been a letdown in coordination said carl bradford 
director of emergency services for west virginia the red cross 
seems to function very well at the local level but when national 
comes in they do not work as well with state and local 
governments 
carol mcarthur press secretary to oakland calif mayor lionel 
wilson was so upset by the red cross performance after the oct 
17 1989 earthquake in northern california that she resigned from 
the board of the organizations oakland and east bay chapter 
the local red cross was very very efficient but they had 
national representatives breathing down their necks ms mcarthur 
said mainly the problems had to do with individuals not 
understanding the varied needs of the ethnically diverse community 
we have here 
jim cassell a media associate at red cross headquarters said 
the organization is making a study of its disaster services due 
for completion in march 
we will look at all disasters including the major ones of 
last year the earthquake on the west coast and hurricane hugo in 
the east cassell said he said the study was in large measure 
due to our own interest in always improving our services and 
not just in response to criticism from outside 
richard smith vice president and general manager at the 
organizations eastern operations headquarters in alexandria va 
said we have learned a lot of lessons we can put into our 
operational planning right away 
mostly our need is to try to streamline our training he 
said at a time when emotions and passions can run rather high 
and then you bring augmented resources in from outside it is very 
challenging to make sure you do that so that feelings dont get 
rubbed in the wrong way some people have worse skills than others 
in doing that and we sometimes have moments of tension 
we had a difficult year but all that assessment is being put 
to our improvement said smith 
in a separate initiative the red cross announced in august that 
it was substituting centralized management for its system of local 
control in each of 54 blood service regions which supply blood to 
more than half the hospitals in the united states 
the action followed months of scrutiny by the news media and the 
food and drug administration in 1988 the red cross acknowledged 
it distributed 24 pints of blood that had failed aids procedures 
but said none of the blood was used and none carried the aids 
virus the fda said the units were shipped by red cross centers in 
washington and nashville tenn 
brad stone an fda spokesman said the purpose of those 
reforms is to help the red cross come into greater compliance with 
our standards we have an ongoing system of inspections and so we 
hope the improvements they are making will be reflected in those 
inspections we are very encouraged by the steps they are taking 
the american red cross is one of 150 national red cross and red 
crescent societies affiliated with the international committee of 
the red cross based in geneva in some countries the society is 
an arm of the government but in the united states it is a private 
organization supported by contributions 
congress gave the red cross a charter in 1918 to conduct 
disaster preparedness and relief there is no congressional 
oversight however 
the american red cross has around 2700 chapters a paid staff 
of 25000 and more than 1 million volunteers in 1989 it received 
a record 165 million in donations and spent 151 million more 
than tripling the previous record its national office is in 
washington it has operational headquarters for the east coast in 
alexandria va for the midwest in st louis and for the west in 
burlingame calif 
clara barton a former schoolteacher and government clerk who 
became a superintendent of nurses during the civil war founded the 
group as the american association of the red cross in 1881 and 
became its first president 
she was always very much handson when a big disaster 
struck said james perry a national park service ranger at the 
clara bartoassifies as either palefaces or redskins they are the 
art for arts sake ivorytower aesthetes who worry an abstraction 
to death as opposed to those who take their stance on raw 
experience henry james says dickey was a classic paleface 
here it comes 
clover adams he continues grinning said this about 
henry james henry chews more than he bites off aint that 
perfect 
james dickey is the author of a shelf full of books a wall full 
of literary awards and served two terms as consultant in poetry to 
the library of congress hes probably most widely known for his 
1972 novel and screenplay deliverance 
but any student who expects so celebrated a writer to be a 
remote or fragile sort strutting in his own importance could not be 
more surprised walking into this classroom a paleface james dickey 
is not 
he comes to class in jeans and sneakers he is big 63 with 
big forearms and a big voice and a paunch that covers his belt 
buckle when he sits he is 64 his thick sandy hair gone gray his 
speech is in an idiom and accent that to borrow a phrase from a 
brand new dickey poem is homeborn southern 
his students are aware that james dickey is a man of daunting 
erudition but his artless earthiness masks this at least they seem 
at ease in his presence 
i confess i was a bit shy about expressing an opinion at 
first said one student margaret taylor but hes why im 
taking the class 
when i went by his office to talk about signing up he asked me 
who i was reading i told him robert lowell and he immediately 
quoted a whole stanza of lowell and asked me what i thought of it 
i was like blown away hes too much 
the man has a photographic memory said another student 
peter harley name a poet and hell tell you his favorite lines 
or something personal about them he knows everybody no hes not 
showing off he makes the writers become real and interesting you 
wouldnt get that from someone else 
at one recent class for example dickey was asking students 
what authors they had chosen as the subjects for their papers 
margaret gibson one replied 
isnt she good though said dickey i thought long walks 
in the afternoon was her best you should write to her in fact 
if i like your paper i will insist that you write to her 
a student named a more obscure poet 
let me know if you can decide what hes writing about 
dickey said 
the poet edwin arlington robinson dickeys students learned 
was not only one of americas most admired in his time but also one 
of its shyest 
he had to drink himself into a conversation remarked the 
professor and this is why he became one of the most monumental 
drinkers in the whole spectacular history of american poetic 
drinking a category in which dickey at one time but no longer 
might have included himself

historian marvin olasky looked at how american 
society took care of its wretched poor 100 years ago and how it 
does it now and concludes people did it better then 
charity in the 1890s he said was not left to the welfare and 
charitable bureaucracies compassion was not dispensed with a 
checkbook 
instead he said helping the poor involved ordinary working 
people not much better off than those they helped they took the 
needy into their homes or into church basements and showed them 
the door if they refused to lift a hand on their own behalf 
in a word charity involved compassion he said an element that 
is lost when helping the poor is left to institutions 
olasky a university of texas professor of journalism history 
is on leave as a scholar in residence at an antiabortion group 
the americans united for life legal defense fund 
he is writing a book on the role of compassion and spent a year 
at the library of congress digging into newspapers and magazines 
studying how paupers were treated a century ago 
then for contrast he spent a few days walking around 
washington posing as a homeless person in shelters he said he 
got plenty to eat but no one ever suggested that he do anything for 
himself at one shelter he said he asked for a bible and got a 
stare instead 
in an article in policy review quarterly magazine of the 
heritage foundation a conservative research organization olasky 
asks whether society is better off now than it was when charity was 
a function of individual responsibility he concludes that then was 
better than now 
but robert bothwell executive director of the national 
committee for responsive philanthropy a nonprofit organization 
that monitors the world of charity has some doubts our 
industrialized society he said has eliminated many jobs formerly 
done by the unskilled poor 
olaskys thesis is that the way the poor are helped now is 
expedient but ultimately unhelpful 
the major flaw of the modern welfare state is not that it is 
extravagant but that it is too stingy he writes it gives the 
needy bread and tells them to be content with that alone it gives 
the rest of us the opportunity to be stingy also and to salve our 
consciences even as we scrimp on what many of the destitute need 
most love time and a challenge to be little lower than the 
angels rather than one thumb up from monkeys 
but most significantly he said a century ago people made 
moral demands on recipients of aid they did not allow anyone 
to eat and run 
a century ago olasky writes charitable people often poor 
themselves provided food shelter work organized excursions and 
summer camps staffed dispensaries and ran schools missions and 
reading rooms 
new york city alone had 1288 charitable organizations many 
looked after members of their own nationality group 
firstgeneration italians took care of newly arrived immigrants 
from the homeland the same was true of swedes irish russians 
some charities had remarkably nononsense names such as the 
erring womans refuge or the union for homeless and friendless 
girls 
women volunteers worked by day men by night 
these principles olasky said prevailed 
before someone received a handout an effort was made to find 
family members who could care for him 
longterm oneonone contacts were forged between the volunteer 
and the needy person 
charity went only to those worthy of relief those poor 
through no fault of their own and unable to change that situation 
quickly the aged ill and children the shiftless and 
intemperate were classified not entitled to relief and shown 
the door before a man got a meal he was asked to spend two hours 
chopping wood a needy woman was shown to the sewing room 
woodyards next to homeless shelters were as common in 1890 
said olasky as liquor stores are in 1990 
relief was given only after investigation benign suspicion 
was applied to those seeking aid 
freedom from dependency was crucial the goal of charity 
workers said olasky was to show poor people how to move up 
while resisting enslavement to the charity of governmental or 
private masters 
charity had religious underpinnings groups such as the 
industrial christian alliance didnt hesitate to remind the poor 
that god made them and had high expectations for them 
in an interview olasky spelled out his conclusions it all 
comes down to your understanding of what compassion is mutual 
obligation was essential the person who was better off was 
obligated to suffer with not just write a check or pass a law 
and the person who needed help was obligated to change 
now if your definition of compassion is merely the provision 
of material help then youre not going to like my suggestions 
bothwell of the national committee for responsive philanthropy 
is somewhat skeptical he welcomes olaskys holistic remedy 
charity should treat the whole person not just a segment of the 
problem but makes the point that society has changed in 
fundamental ways 
in 19th century cities sweatshops provided jobs for unskilled 
immigrants the gap between workers and nonworkers was not great 
and an unemployed person could easily move into the ranks of the 
respectfully employed by taking such a job 
todays counterpart job bothwell notes might be flipping 
burgers in a fast food restaurant but that kind of work doesnt 
pay enough to lift a family from poverty 
it is true bothwell said that society in this era of busy 
lives and twoincome families largely has turned over to 
government the responsibility of providing a safety net but he 
said olasky overlooks the enormous amount of private help that 
still exists in a country with more than 800000 nonprofit 
organizations 
moreover todays immigrants now likely to come from the 
soviet union east europe latin america or asia still find 
nationality groups to give them a lift newcomers still move in 
with those who proceeded them 
everybody knows that weve grown into a society that is much 
more distant than the world olasky describes bothwell said so 
you devise different ways of assisting people and one of them is 
the more distant more automatic way of providing money to the 
destitute through the governments safety net

jean kahn president of the representative council of jewish 
institutions in france issued a statement in august saying 
manifestations of antisemitism in france have sometimes been 
overdramatized in other countries 
we feel this is not justified because it does not reflect 
french reality the statement added except for the tragic 
period of 193945 the jews of france for the last 200 years 
have been completely integrated into the national community 
crozier says the jewish element is part of the french 
identity as it is part of the american identity we can accept 
anyone provided he accepts our culture thats why the moslems are 
such a problem they have a culture of their own which we do not 
recognize 
some sociologists and others say this sense of insecurity 
explains the rise of the extremeright national front party of 
jeanmarie le pen le pen contends that traditional french values 
are being corrupted by foreign influences 
le pen who wants to deport north african immigrants says 
france risks becoming an arabicspeaking moslem nation if 
immigration is not stemmed 
the national front the most powerful farright group in europe 
consistently holds about 15 percent of the electorate 
france inherited its moslem population mainly north african 
from its disintegrating colonial empire thousands were lured 
across the mediterranean from 1960 to 1975 to man the factories 
during an economic boom 
tinroofed shantytowns that sprung up around major cities to 
house the workers eventually were razed to make way for concrete 
apartment buildings cut off from city life illmanaged and 
deteriorating these highrise complexes remain the principle 
source of housing for immigrant families 
this is a basic problem which will weigh for years on our 
society said president francois mitterrand in response to 
october riots in a lowcost housing complex outside lyon the 
projects provoke rejection despair and make dialogue 
difficult 
at the moment its hard to find a real frenchman said a 
35yearold algerian theyre all rich and removed 
the algerian who refused to give his name owns the cafe balzac 
at the corner of two housing complexes near vitry south of paris 
he has lived in france since he was a baby but refuses to exercise 
his right to become a french citizen 
they exploited my parents they have done nothing for me he 
said we are badly viewed so why accept something they dont 
really want to give you i have my pride 
many algerians feel they are an unwanted reminder of the 
inglorious eightyear war france vainly waged to keep algeria a 
colony 
france tried early on to rid itself of what clearly was becoming 
the immigrant burden arranging to pay off workers and their 
families willing to return to their homeland the program largely 
failed and officials now grope for ways to promote cultural 
integration 
the immigrant question shares the political agenda with the 
new europe an interloper of another sort 
france has been a driving force toward unity challenging the 
european community to go beyond the open frontiers of 1992 toward 
political union 
but the bravado masks worries that are particularly french how 
to remain rigorously independent in an interdependent community of 
nations and retain the national identity that is it often seems 
frances raison detre 
france currently is facing its most profound identity crisis 
since the advent of the fifth republic in 1958 according to 
gregory flynn a european affairs specialist with the carnegie 
endowment for international peace in washington 
the french he wrote in the wall street journal fear for 
identity more than security and worry about losing all traces of 
their status as a world power 
france appears wellplaced to assume a leadership role in a 
united europe but questions arise about its willingness to 
suppress its nationalistic instincts 
everything is happening as though the french no longer able 
to change the world or protect themselves from it persuaded 
themselves that as a nation they can do nothing at all says the 
governmentordered report on the state of the nation 
the french have long sought to protect their national identity 
politically and culturally the report says from now on they 
will have to choose other criteria for success 
many experts are optimistic 
todd a member of the government panel says france has far more 
confidence now than a few decades ago when the folly of grandeur 
a perverse national obsession bolstered a humiliated nation 
france is one of the european countries changing most 
quickly todd says so its normal that some people have 
doubts nostalgia dream of a peaceful and tranquil france 
crozier says you dont redefine what is french its not an 
intellectual operation its something that just happens

he recommended to the class a collection of robinson poems for 
which he had written an introduction some years ago i read this 
through last night to see if i agree with myself which i dont 
always and i must say i do so its safe 
later dickey was reading from the critic edmund wilson who 
wrote in passing that he thought emily dickinson was overrated 
dickeys eyes left the page rolled upward and he shook his head 
no no edmund youre wrong about that dead wrong he 
said then continued reading 
mr dickey has opinions all right said a student alan 
asnen you have the feeling he knows what hes talking about i 
think he knows everything he certainly knows poetry and loves 
it 
dickey at one moment appears hard and demanding and at the next 
soft enough to cry on 
lecturing from his place at the head of the table he rarely 
glances at the notes spread before him instead as he talks his 
gaze flits from face to face lighting on each randomly like a 
pollenating bee 
when he reads a poem aloud he yields completely to the lust of 
language and rhythm and imagery the effect sifts through the room 
like perfume he caresses each word his soft voice adding its own 
poetic sauce at the end he holds the final lines in his mouth 
tasting them and raises his face to the class with a spreading 
glow of satisfaction 
cut he says at last ending the spell go to black or 
whatever it is they say in hollywood when it cant get any 
better 
james dickey georgia born has been writer in residence at the 
university of south carolina for 23 years now but he is no campus 
decoration seen only at book signings and sherry parties clearly 
he loves the classroom 
a lot of american writers feel that teaching is an imposition 
keeping them from their work he says i dont teaching forces 
you to get your own ideas straight they vary from year to year 
but when you get in front of a classroom you at least have to say 
what you think and how you feel 
so dickey teaches two courses four classes twice a week 
although the school has asked him to drop one a workshop on modern 
american poetry to give him more time to write lack of time 
however doesnt seem to have hampered him so far he has eight 
projects in the works including a sequel to his 1987 novel 
alnilam which he considers 20 times better than 
deliverance hes also working on a book of collected poems a 
book of literary criticism and a fourth childrens book 
just last month he brought out a book of poems titled the 
eagles mile which he brought with him to class 
there will be a signing at the bookstore saturday he said 
then he added in a conspirators whisper im going to take 
roll 
then he reminded the class of aspiring young poets yearning to 
be published of what the poet conrad aiken said about bringing out 
a new book of poetry 
he said waiting for the reaction is like dropping a feather 
into the grand canyon and listening for the echo 
james dickey continued 
for everybody in this class i wish only one thing that you 
concentrate your efforts to one end 
not to publish not to be famous not to make money because 
that just aint going to happen no matter how good or famous you 
are 
concentrate all your energies toward writing something that 
will stand up that will move people that will stay with them 
disturb them amplify what used to be called their souls 
do that do that there is hope for all of us

columbia sc ap james dickey can trace his long rise to 
the heights of american letters to a single word in a single line 
of a forgotten sonnet by an obscure poet 
he recalled the occasion recently during a poetry class at the 
university of south carolina 
i was a young air force pilot in okinawa during world war ii 
i was sitting by the bay overlooking a graveyard where thousands of 
americans were buried and there were no flowers 
i had with me an anthology of poems one of them was by joseph 
trumbull stickney who had died when he was 30 just when he was 
getting going it contained this line about the pagan god apollo 
and all his island shivered into flowers 
i thought that was truly unusual truly remarkable shivered 
into flowers shivered 
i thought maybe i could do something like that maybe maybe 
i decided to try

editors note the torch is being passed in singapore the 
former british colony that has become one of asias most prosperous 
nations under the authoritarian rule of lee kuan yew after more 
than three decades lee on nov 28 will relinquish his post as 
prime minister to goh chok tong who like george bush is 
promising a kinder and gentler country 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
in his 31 years as prime minister of singapore 
lee kuan yew ruled as a nononsense stern taskmaster 
we decide what is right he once said never mind what the 
people think 
there were no free lunches fun and games had to have a purpose 
and hopefully show a profit 
now that lee is stepping down his successor says that the time 
has come to lighten up 
first deputy prime minister goh chok tong is scheduled to take 
over on nov 28 he says he plans no radical change but will scrap 
the paternalistic approach and loosen the reins of government 
the society which we want to bring about will be more refined 
more compassionate kinder and gentler goh promised 
under lee the former british colony of singapore began its 
existence as an independent citystate with a weak economy no 
industry unfriendly neighbors and bitter racial divisions among 
chinese malays and indians 
today singapore with 27 million people is one of asias most 
prosperous nations 
described as authoritarian even by his admirers lee offers no 
apologies for his hardnosed methods 
no leader can be a softy and hope to survive the worlds 
longestserving elected government head told university students 
recently 
the largest single difference in style between goh chok tong 
and me will not be because of differences in temperament or 
character but because of his commitment to team leadership he 
consults all key parties affected before he takes major 
decisions 
lee said several years ago that his political heirs sometimes 
did not seem tough enough to handle the opposition and other 
critics have they got enough people with that fire in the belly 
and iron in the soul 
goh has a quick brain and is decisive but tries to please too 
many people lee said with typical bluntness 
lee nevertheless planned an orderly transition of power to a new 
generation but he admitted publicly in 1988 that he preferred 
education minister tony tan instead of the amiable goh as his 
successor tan did not aspire to the role 
while relinquishing the prime ministers title lee 67 expects 
to remain politically active he will serve in gohs cabinet as 
senior minister without portfolio and continue as chairman of the 
ruling peoples action party 
it is to singapores advantage that he should remain as a 
factor in our domestic politics and even in our foreign 
relations goh said 
as the elected head of the peoples action party lee became 
prime minister and controlled who was named to cabinet positions 
he also had the power to choose his successor 
under the constitution elections are held at intervals not to 
exceed five years 
the constitution is being amended to elect and give executive 
powers to the nowceremonial and appointed presidency lee 
suggested the change in 1984 to help safeguard the countrys vast 
financial reserves 
he has not ruled out the possibility that he might seek the 
revamped post after president wee kim wee retires 
the lee factor in singapore politics was also reflected by gohs 
appointment of lee hsien loong 38 the prime ministers eldest 
son as one of two deputy prime ministers in the new government 
the appointment came as no surprise goh earlier acknowledged 
that the younger lee was his logical successor as prime minister 
but goh 49 insists that he will not serve in a transitional role 
to keep the seat warm for the ambitious lee 
there is no such arrangement goh says 
lee hsien loong is the cabinet member in charge of trade and 
industry he entered politics in 1984 after a 13year army career 
in which he moved through the ranks from cadet to brigadier 
general 
there will be life after lee kuan yew because we have a team 
of men who are just as determined as lee kuan yew was when he 
started building singapore goh says 
against heavy odds lee turned an unpromising relic of the 
british empire into a glittering commercial success and test tube 
for social change 
fortunately for us when we set out to organize ourselves in 
the 1960s we did not believe in pie in the sky lee told a 
recent gathering in his tanjong pagar constituency we went in 
for equality of opportunity but not equal pay that made everybody 
do their best 
the cambridgeeducated lawyer took charge in 1959 when the 
colony gained limited selfrule it joined the new malaysian 
federation in 1963 only to be expelled two years later because lee 
and other chinese leaders were seen as a threat to the political 
control of indigenous malays

lee lamented at the time that his country was the smallest of 
shrimps in a sea of hungry fish 
few states faced sovereignty in such dismal circumstances 
unemployment poverty and ethnic tensions were rife the economy 
was weak and the armed forces ineffective indonesia was 
threatening military action against malaysia and singapore 
i say without the slightest remorse that we wouldnt be here 
we would have not made economic progress if we had not intervened 
on very personal matters who your neighbor is how you live the 
noise you make how you spit or what language you use lee once 
said in a speech 
more than half of the present citizens were born during lees 
tenure and more than 80 percent have known no other leader during 
their adult lives 
his assorted views and prejudices on matters ranging from good 
neighborliness to genetics have over the years assumed the force 
of law some are resented as quirky or intrusive but are not 
seriously challenged 
those who challenged lees leadership found themselves subject 
to arrest detention without trial public humiliation and general 
harassment by a government reluctant to acknowledge dissent 
he has survived in confrontational politics to the point that he 
is respected and regarded with awe but not love that appears to 
be the image he prefers in much the way of an emperor in imperial 
china 
in answering foreigners who criticize his tough treatment of 
opponents lee once told an interviewer that the chinese people 
have no concept of a loyal opposition their support is firm even 
if you detain people without trial but once that support is 
withdrawn it is sudden and complete lee said 
if you break faith with them and lose your mandate youve had 
it it will go completely the other way 
an island about the size of chicago singapore has no natural 
resources except a strategic location and the skills of a 
multiracial population 
lee demanded discipline to overcome hardships obedience hard 
work cleanliness thrift and the profit motive all played a part 
as a shabby colonial backwater was transformed 
years of firm political leadership and stable economic growth 
helped attract investment by multinational corporations seeking a 
doorway to the booming markets of the asiapacific region now its 
a thriving financial and manufacturing center with hightech 
industries firstclass schools and glitzy shopping centers 
the lee administration has a reputation for honesty efficiency 
and a strong sense of direction standards are high and there is a 
strict moral code 
do not try to get a government on the cheap money politics 
will result in a poor bunch of mps members of parliament plus a 
lot of hypocrisy fiddling and eventually dishonesty and 
corruption lee told the country on aug 8 in his final national 
day address as prime minister 
tipping jaywalking littering and discourtesy are officially 
denounced those who neglect to flush public toilets after use may 
be fined 
those suspected of more serious transgressions such as 
subversion and drug abuse can expect no mercy suspected 
subversives can be detained indefinitely under the internal 
security act without being charged or put on trial dozens of 
convicted drug traffickers have been hanged 
lee has described his role in recent years as that of 
chairman of a citystate run on corporate lines cabinet 
ministers act as executive directors largely untroubled by 
ideological issues or domestic political infighting they are 
chosen less for their appeal among voters than their capacity to 
manage a department effectively 
the danger now is that many believe that wehave arrived and 
can therefore relax in that case standards will go down and we 
will lose out as long as we do not forget this we need not fear 
the future lee said

other voices columbia paul young 
paul young says other voices his first album in two years 
represents a change in musical direction but its hard to hear 
much difference between the best material on this album and youngs 
bestknown songs from the past including his huge 1985 hit 
everytime you go away 
youngs strength is his passionate way with a soul tune hes in 
fine form here with a tasty cover of the 20yearold chilites hit 
oh girl and a muscular production of peter wolfs its what 
she didnt say a song cowritten by young 
one wonders though why young doesnt stick with what he does 
best instead other voices is a grab bag of styles with a 
different producer on almost every track 
it also features a long roster of guest artists chaka kahn 
david gilmour steve winwood peter wolf and stevie wonder among 
others 
but the guest stars hardly shine and this likeable album would 
have been better with a bigger dose of soul

french eelodies emi jose van dam baritone jeanphilippe 
collard piano 
songs piano works by reynaldo hahn ades jeanchristophe 
benoit baritone bernard ringeissen piano 
 
italy in the 19thcentury never really answered the german lied 
preferring to let its voices excel in opera the french with their 
melodies did a better job 
two recent cd releases in very different ways give a taste of 
a form that began with berlioz gloried in debussy ravel and faure 
and continued through les six that rebellious collection of french 
composers after world war i which included poulenc 
hahn 18751947 a now obscure frenchman of venezuelan descent 
wrote operas operettas and ballets and conducted in the theater 
during his maturity but his guarantee against oblivion are songs 
written when hahn was a teenager and in his early 20s 
benoit offers 19 of them around a fivepiece piano solo 
interlude they are plenty charming in the best parisian salon 
sense but frequently hahn rises above that with some truly 
beautiful writing its hard to resist them 
benoits voice has an open appropriate drawingroom quality 
but it wavers and sounds a little unsteady his pitch sometimes has 
the same problem but the performances are genuine and 
affectionate the recorded sound has immediacy and rengeissen is 
always sensitive ten demerits to ades for providing no text 
of a wholly different vocal order is van dam his voice has a 
beautiful rich quality in which the vibration is a natural 
outgrowth of the core of his sound a quality which benoit lacks 
van dam brings strong characterizations to this varied survey 
which includes songs by berlioz his famous les nuits dete 
ibert faure poulenc and ropartz 
van dam defines dynamic control producing tightly reined 
crescendos and diminuendos the highlights are the ibert songs on 
poems about don quixote who van dam portrays with a melancholy 
nobility and poulencs baudy chansons gaillardes based on 
anonymous 17thcentury texts of a rabelaisian flavor the program 
is well put together the wideeyed piety of faures at prayer 
immediately precedes the first poulenc number about a fickle 
mistress and her virginity collard is exceedingly elegant

carl reiner was in an especially jovial mood the 
other day during one leg of a daunting nationwide promotion tour 
for his new film sibling rivalry that would have tired a man 
half his age 
but reiner tall trim and as busy as ever at 68 still looks a 
lot like his most wellknown character alan brady the arrogant 
variety show host on the old dick van dyke show 
his good humor was evident despite decidedly mixed reviews about 
the movie his latest film in a career that spans 40 years and 
includes such tv and movie comedy classics as your show of 
shows wheres poppa all of me and the jerk reiner 
directed sibling rivalry 
the critics have not been not especially kind to the comedy 
which stars kirstie alley and involves a man who died during sex 
with her and the various cases of mistaken identity that occur as a 
result 
the title refers to three sets of siblings in the film and how 
they interact and compete with with each other familial rivalry is 
a familiar subject to reiner both with his own brother who he 
credits with pushing him into show business and his famous son 
rob 
the prospect of a new reiner comedy is a lipsmacking one rob 
reiner that is not papa carl whose best comedies were made years 
ago wrote the new york post film critic in panning sibling 
rivalry 
carl reiner does not dispute those sentiments 
rob had the toughest time of all my kids he said he 
wanted to be in show business and he had a father who was going on 
all cylinders he was in competition with me and he was impatient 
then he ended up outrunning dad 
reiner lists his sons movies with pride saying hes been up 
at bat six times and you cant find anything really wrong with his 
work 
reiner also said that his son outstripped me as far as acting 
too whenever theyd see us on the street theyd start yelling 
hey meathead one time somebody called him meatloaf and i yelled 
back no its meathead 
according to carl reiner family members have always been 
competitive with each other but theyve also remained loyal 
reiners brother charlie who owns a printing business in 
atlanta was always the funnier one when they were growing up 
in the bronx the sons of a watchmaker 
but charlie suffered because i was the more quiet studious 
one and my mother would always say why cant you be more like 
your brother carl we still talk about it 
but it was his brother who urged him to enroll in drama school 
and become an actor and his brother still religiously tapes all 
reiners appearances on tv and saves all news clippings about him 
everytime im on carson he still tapes it said reiner 
reiners other two children are daughter annie a playwright 
and artist and lucas who directed the film spirit of 76 
my other kids have had a problem with it said reiner of 
both his success and robs annie was showing some of her work 
recently and the first people who greeted her at the door said 
arent you carl reiners daughter shes trying to have to her 
own identity you want to make it on your own 
but reiner said his family is very closeknit despite the 
inherent rivalries and often gather for dinners at the beverly 
hills home he shares with wife of 47 years 
estelle reiner played the woman in the deli in rob reiners 
film when harry met sally who said ill have whatever 
shes having in the memorable scene in which meg ryan faked an 
orgasm 
the reiner family has a history of inserting relatives and other 
autobiographical details into their work carl reiners most 
celebrated comedy the dick van dyke show was set in new 
rochelle ny where he lived with his wife after their marriage 
and van dyke character was of course named rob after you know 
who 
but even if he believes rob has surpassed him as a director 
carl reiner is keeping as busy as ever he continually sifts 
through new scripts in search of a new movie to direct he was 
eager to return to beverly hills where hes in the midst of a 
novel about hollywood 
im a worker he said ive worked steadily all my life 
ive become venerable ive gone through several incarnations but 
ive kept current theres a whole generation of adults who grew up 
with me 
he and his wife live there yearround with the exception of six 
weeks they spend in the south of france each year reiners best 
friend is mel brooks with whom he wrote the legendary 2000 
yearold man they have dinner together several times a week and 
go out to movies

it is a still life of sorts a babys 
crib made of tightly bound strands of metal and a little cloth it 
is a square cage in which nothing goes in and nothing goes out 
artist doris salcedo sculpted this work about a woman who 
continually washed her dead baby who had been killed by death 
squads in northern colombia she bathed the infants cadaver 
applying creams and ointments 
the crib symbolizes the mothers desperate acts which salcedo 
called useless but dignifying 
bombs massacres kidnappings and disappearances are causing 
angry colombian artists to illustrate their countrys nightmare in 
paintings and sculptures 
these artists paint scenes of army soldiers hovering above dead 
bodies animals devouring other animals and bleeding women crying 
out for help sickened by colombias trauma they say they want to 
wake up people to the countrys bloody reality 
i want to sensitize people to the violence were forced to 
live in salcedo said many of her scupltures contain membrane 
material cloth made from the lining of animal intestines because 
she wants people to perceive the pain at skin level she said 
tens of thousands of colombians have died in the past decade in 
violence ranging from peasant massacres to bombings by the medellin 
cocaine cartel 
much of the bloodshed has been blamed on rightwing death 
squads leftist guerrillas drug traffickers and other armed 
groups colombia also has a long history strife between political 
parties 
a war between the countrys two biggest parties the 
conservative and the liberal took at least 250000 lives in the 
early 1950s 
atrocities in that war were common such as spilling live 
captives from a dump truck over cliffs 
many artists who illustrate violent themes must make their 
living by teaching or rely on prize money the works themselves 
dont sell 
enrique jaramillo set up a display entitled childrens game 
consisting of rifles made of scrap material and garbage powerful 
imagery but hardly livingroom adornment 
many colombian artists reject what they call the 
superficiality of mainstream decorative art 
joseph kaplan 23 pointed to a painting he did of two faceless 
animals one overpowering the other in a mass of blood 
this is not a pretty decorative piece but i hope it makes 
people reflect on why i would paint it he said 
many of kaplans works contain a ray of hope dark violent 
scenes often give glimpses of a brighter more serene landscape 
theres always an opening to a more colorful surreal world 
he said colombias beauty is as powerful as its dark side 
kaplans works sometimes reflect both his jewish and colombian 
ancestry in one painting smoke hovers alongside a faint image of 
a star of david 
miguel angel rojas winner of colombias most prestigious art 
award in 1988 sometimes paints violence against indigenous 
colombian tribesmen 
in one piece a large male figure carrying a coin and a 
television runs away from a tribesman rojas says it illustrates 
modern society leaving the indian behind 
the indigenous are relegated to virtual death the artist 
said 
in one painting rojas depicts a precolombian tumaco statue 
above a huge black oil stain its a protest against bombings by 
leftist guerrillas of the countrys main oil pipeline 
the national liberation army has blasted the pipeline scores of 
times since 1986 often causing oil to spill into nearby rivers 
in this country we have to construct not destroy rojas 
said 
another painter beatriz gonzalez sometimes puts powerful 
newspaper images on canvas 
when the body of a slain billionaire drug trafficker appeared in 
press photos gonzalez painted the image the cadavers of drug lord 
jose gonzalo rodriguez gacha his son fredy and three bodyguards 
lie faceup on the ground 
rodriguez gacha considered the number two man in the medellin 
cartel was shot dead by police last december the image is of a 
complete and total fall gonzalez said 
at 52 gonzalez is among colombias most celebrated artists 
rojas often gets his inspiration from the days news as well 
seeing a violent event in art is different from watching it on the 
news he said 
in art it takes on a poetic content he said 
it is a tragic poetry most of salcedos sculptures represent 
objects left behind by victims of violence she sculpts furniture 
clothing a babys crib the objects which force people to feel 
their loved ones absence she said 
in one exhibit mens shirts made of white cotton cloth are 
lined up in neat piles each pile has a metal rod piercing it 
running its length 
salcedo said the metal is wounding the soft material as in 
many of her scupltures 
as she sculpted the shirts salcedo imagined she was the wife of 
a peasant murdered last year during a massacre in cordoba a 
northern bananagrowing province 
violent art is not new in colombia debora arango caused a stir 
in the 1940s by her paintings depicting vultures victimized women 
and people piled into box cars 
in 1962 alejandro obregon won widespread acclaim for his work 
la violencia in the painting a white bird flies over a 
mountain shaped like a pregnant woman with a bleeding breast 
despite the violence colombia has become a center for latin 
american culture major cities are filled with museums galleries 
theaters and libraries 
gonzalez says she and other artists who depict violence are not 
ideologues just people with conscience 
when viewers see my work i hope they feel the violence deep 
within sometimes its the only way to move people she said

aiming his tenor sax at the sky above 
the pacific charles lloyd blows shades of bird bhudda and bartok 
much the same way he did when he and keith jarrett introduced jazz 
to flower children during the 1960s 
lloyds new album fish out of water is the first recording 
by his new quartet and a more mature sound by the oncefrenetic 
performer who burned out in 1969 and headed for the california 
coast to meditate 
his free airy impressionist style that turned on hardcore 
jazzers as well as rock fans is both personal and political a 
departure from elevator jazz or what he calls hip muzak 
it articulates the human condition not just the surface 
level like popsicles and stuff says lloyd who at 52 is graying 
but otherwise youthful its a music about freedom 
fish out of water his first since the early 1980s is not 
being stuck in the net its about leapin out of it says lloyd 
perhaps a flying fish that feels like a bird the nickname for 
bebop sax great charlie parker 
after an onagain offagain career in the 80s lloyd says he 
is back for keeps and has begun a string of more than a dozen 
appearances in europe including jazz festivals in paris brussels 
and madrid this month he plans to record a new album in oslo 
norway 
fish on ecm records is also a great soundtrack for a misty 
fall morning drive through orange and avocado groves that lead to 
lloyds haciendastyle home high above the coastline just south of 
santa barbara 
lloyd walks out on his porch clad in jeans loafers and a blue 
work shirt whose open front reveals a tshirt with chinese script 
underneath lloyd of african cherokee and irish descent says his 
indian blood links him to asian roots via the bering strait 
he excitedly shifts from subject to subject thinking ahead of 
himself as he tries to make several points at the same time 
explaining points with bhuddist hindu biblical and secular 
allegories 
stuff goes by too fast to articulate he says 
apologetically 
born in memphis on march 15 1938 he was 8 years old when he 
heard charlie parker and told his parents get me a saxophone 
cause thats what i speak on 
i wanted to be expressing those fractions this thing where 
you get in between the cracks he says 
parker died at the age of 34 in 1955 after years of drug abuse 
but lloyd says gosh you need some kind of relief from this 
jackhammer society fifty yards away stone workers were 
jackhammering stones to build a new house on his property 
lloyd acknowledged that he experimented with drugs i did 
research in that manner but only during the 60s 
after playing with blues greats including howlin wolf and bb 
king in the 50s lloyd went to los angeles and got a masters in 
music at the university of southern california there he studied 
under the late bartok expert halsey stevens and by night played 
the club circuit with ornette coleman don cherry and others 
in 1960 at age 21 lloyd joined chico hamiltons group and 
played with julian cannonball adderly in 1964 the next year he 
formed his own quartet with keith jarrett on piano cecil mcbee on 
bass and jack dejohnette on drums 
his bestknown composition forest flower was warm upbeat 
and at times chaotic in which he dueled in dissonance with 
jarrett 
it was one of the first jazz records to sell 1 million copies 
and along with the montreux jazz and other festivals the quartet 
also played on the same stage as jimi hendrix janis joplin and 
jefferson airplane 
sweden which produced lloyds new quartet was like groupie 
heaven in the 60s five million blond amazons he says 
lloyd says members of his new quartet were teen fans in the 60s 
jarretts influence on pianist bobo stenson is very apparent palle 
danielsson is on bass and jon christensen on drums 
in 1969 lloyd was exhausted from 10 years of touring and 
devastated by the death of his mother the same year 
i was socaled successful but my spirit wasnt happy he 
says and he didnt want to die in beer taverns 
i was restless intense had great insecurities 
he left new york and moved to malibu and big sur studied 
eastern religions was introduced to introduced to transcendental 
meditation in the 70s by mike love of the beach boys 
in the 80s lloyd recorded and toured on and off with pianist 
michel petrucciani 
lloyd suffered a setback about four years ago when he had anodes 
removed from his throat although a nonsmoker he says his doctor 
told him smokey clubs caused the benign growths he is to stay out 
of cloudy dives limiting the venues he can play 
fish is much more lowkey and mystical than lloyds 
moreintense bebop chops of the 60s the title track has warm 
airy tones though with lloyds signature runs that pull a quirky 
riff from the outer reaches of a scale 
another track haghia sophia or st sophia is named after 
a mosque in istanbul that was once a church symbolizing his 
interest in east and west lloyd has a flute intro much reminiscent 
of paul horns recordings in the taj mahal 
lloyds solos are sparing and thoughtful eking out or bending a 
tone whispering a run blending in with the rest of the quartet 
not dominating 
even when i wasnt playing i was playing he says its 
deep solitude in the midst of activity i spend my time in silence 
i walk these hills in quiet solitude 
lloyd shares the serenity of his sageperfumed mountain retreat 
with his wife dorothy darr a gauginesque painter who created the 
album cover they also have a home in big sur 
he hopes his new album his 25th solo recording and altogether 
his 40th inspires people to look deeper 
maybe one of them may be a scientist who says we dont need 
fossil fuel we can do it with steam or solar he says or we 
cont have to have so much homelessness or deprive people of 
opportunity 
i hear about people talking about jobs and sampls and oil those 
war cats good thing they got that cat over there to fight iraqs 
saddam hussein cause otherwise that other stuff would be hitting 
the fan 
those cats need to hear the music he says you can tell 
these cats cant swing 
whatll the new album sound like lloyd spins around on his 
piano bench and begins fingering rich warm sometimes dissonant 
chord progressions squinting grimacing head bowed into the keys 
he calls it his bartok piece 
the record he says will be rustling more like dry leaves 
no doubt the tactful nuanced windpower will come from the lungs of 
a seasoned reed man

with three novels in print and a fourth on 
the way clyde edgerton is supposed to be taking a break so here 
he is on stage with banjo and piano reading his often rollicking 
sometimes riveting southern fiction 
its southern fiction by an author who thinks the catchall 
category of southern writer doesnt do justice to the diversity 
of the regions literature his own diversity was on display during 
a recent reading at agnes scott college where he is a visiting 
writer this semester 
edgerton mixed music a frequent topic in his work with 
passages from his novels about the comic elements of family life in 
the south and the moments in which people reveal or struggle for 
their souls 
its been a winning combination for edgertons books raney 
walking across egypt and the floatplane notebooks 
algonquin books declined to release exact figures but sales of 
raney in hardcover and paperback went well over 200000 copies 
publishers weekly reported ballantine paid six figures for 
paperback rights to the floatplane notebooks 
all three novels have enjoyed enthusiastic reviews movie 
options have been negotiated although no productions are under 
way 
success has transformed edgerton from a college english teacher 
squeezing in some longhand writing at 6 am into a fulltime 
writer with his own word processor and basement office in durham 
nc 
for now though edgerton is popping in and out of agnes scott 
a liberal arts college for women attending literary conferences 
and readings and awaiting the february publication of killer 
diller 
im taking my first break in 13 years from writing fiction 
he said 
edgerton 46 started writing in earnest after seeing eudora 
welty one of his favorites reading a story on public television 
scenes he saw or heard about became starting points 
there will be an incident a woman stuck in a chair that 
happened to my mother edgerton said my family thought it was 
the funniest thing theyd ever heard so i went home and wrote a 
short story and it turns out the short story turned into a 
novel 
the woman who was stranded when she forgot there was no bottom 
in her rocking chair became mattie rigsbee the elderly church lady 
of walking across egypt she and the juvenile delinquent she 
befriended will return in killer diller which will be the 
first of edgertons novels not to begin as a short story 
i try not to think of themes and ideas when i write fiction i 
try to put interesting characters in interesting situations and 
just keep writing edgerton said 
but edgerton does grapple with themes as profound as war 
reflecting his years as a reconnaissance pilot in vietnam and 
racism racial prejudice in particular tests his ability to paint 
his characters sympathetically while pointing out their faults 
i have decided not to skirt the issue simply because its 
real its hard to love a character who says nigger in a novel 
he acknowledged but he said its a situation that parallels life 
one of the greatest paradoxes in some southerners lives is 
having people who would die for them that is their parents who 
are also people who say nigger edgerton said 
carefully choosing his words to avoid any hint that he condones 
racism edgerton said the thoughtless slurs used by otherwise 
lovable characters may be put in perspective by the other isms 
such as ageism or class prejudice harbored by those who think 
themselves above racism 
when these characters are attacked for their racism the 
writer may speculate on how the attackers think of old people and 
plumbers and painters and how they behave toward those people 
which raises the whole question of the meaning in behavior as up 
against the meaning in words and labels 
edgerton said he did not want to downplay the horror of racist 
labels and pointed out the floatplane notebooks includes an 
account of a lynching 
most of edgertons scenes however are warm conflicts often 
are hilarious the title character from raney for example is 
a traditional young woman who has married a more worldly man she 
is somewhat alarmed when he swigs champagne on their wedding night 
and is moved to terror by some of his other ideas for the evening 
edgerton delivered raneys outraged account in an affected 
accent to his agnes scott audience his variety of voices facial 
contortions and runon breathless delivery are reminiscent of 
garrison keillor the prairie home companion radio star who 
also writes sympathetic stories about rural characters although 
his are in the midwest 
edgerton doesnt resist comparisons to keillor were both 
tall he joked but he does object to the casual labeling of 
authors as southern writers 
too often the analysis stops there and all kind of 
assumptions go with it careful readers know that there are 
vast differences among the group referred to as southern writers 
he said

the years between his landmark movie easy 
rider and his recent return to film prominence were a waste 
says dennis hopper 
the drugs and alcohol that i was involved with stopped me from 
working stopped me from being creative the problem with being an 
alcoholic and a drug addict is that you dont think its happening 
you dont know that youre addicted and dont admit that youre 
addicted its always somebody elses fault that youre not 
working he said 
those were wasted years ive directed six movies now i 
should have directed 20 its unfortunate because all that was 
ever important to me was the work i justified my own addictions 
because i was an artist and all the great artists of course 
were drug addicts and alcoholics because of that stupidity i 
dont yet have a body of work that i consider important 
hopper is striving to make up for lost time his sixth film as a 
director the hot spot starring don johnson has been released 
to hot and cold reviews and soso business 
while not in the scorsesespielbergpollack range of directors 
he has no trouble finding employment particularly for 
hardtextured works such as his sensationcausing colors which 
was blamed for scattered theater violence and the current film a 
study of sex and crime in a small texas town 
this is a departure for me he said i actually used a 
novel by charles williams you might say we were of like mind he 
wrote the book in 1951 it was published in 1952 then in 1962 he 
wrote a screenplay with nona tyson it was intended for robert 
mitchum 
i found that script and updated it to now its about an 
amoral drifter johnson who comes to a small town in texas and 
sells cars its a throwback to the filmnoir dark movie a 
pulp novel its fun i like it 
johnson finds himself caught between two women an oversexed 
schemer virginia madsen and an innocent young beauty jennifer 
connelly who is also manipulative he also gets involved in bank 
robbing blackmail and murder all the good stuff 
hopper considered other stars before deciding on johnson late 
of miami vice 
i edited the movie for a year and now i cant imagine anyone 
else playing the role said the director people should really 
look at him as a force to be dealt with in movies he could be a 
major star theres a place there for him 
he found madsen while watching television via a satellite dish 
during the filming of flashback in which he acted but did not 
direct he saw her as a throwback to lana turner perfect for the 
femme fatale role he remembered jennifer connelly from her role as 
a 12yearold ballet dancer in once upon a time in america he 
considers her more beautiful than elizabeth taylor and a better 
actress 
hopper talked about the notices for the hot spot and said 
its getting some good stuff and some bad stuff but i think that 
runs with the territory its a hot movie but then ive always 
gotten widely divergent reviews starting with easy rider 
colors out of the blue also it sort of follows me around 
like a pet snake 
nothing in hoppers background provided any hint of his later 
notoriety he was born in kansas in 1936 and spent much of his 
youth on his grandparents farm five miles from dodge city his 
parents moved to san diego where hopper won a scholarship to the 
old globe theater a taste of shakespeare emboldened him to try 
hollywood and he landed a sevenyear contract at warner bros

more than two decades in the music business both 
as a disc jockey and a performer have given peter wolf a certain 
maturity sort of 
i tend to wear longer socks now he jokes and i look both 
ways before i cross the street 
but seriously the former j geils band frontman has been 
struggling since the 1983 breakup of the group to strike out on his 
own 
his mostrecent solo album up to no good was a critical 
success but did not sell well now hes planning a tour to show 
people hes still around 
i havent done it in eight years wolf said the beatles 
were together and broke up in less time than that in rock n 
roll its a millennium 
with j geils wolfs athletic antics onstage became as well 
known as some of the bands songs including love stinks and 
centerfold then at the height of the groups popularity it 
was announced that wolf was leaving 
wolf said hes still bitter about the breakup but added t 
hasnt crushed his spirit 
i became a soloist really not by choice but it was the only 
way a necessity to keep on rock n rollin because i loved the 
band and i really would have liked to see the band stay together 
he said 
it was like someone who would have liked to see their marriage 
stay together but there just wasnt any reason to hang in there 
still persistent rumors abound surrounding a j geils reunion 
especially every new years eve when the band used to play its 
annual bash in boston wolf is pessimistic about the prospects 
the geils band we were a family sort of like a bunch of 
brothers sticking together through thick and thin it just was hard 
to try to keep that collective spirit he said people wonder 
if the band is ever going to get back together i really have no 
set plans to do it the only way i would do it is if i really felt 
that kind of spirit could be regained 
recently in a posh boston hotel suite he took to meet the 
press wolf looked unchanged from years of musical mayhem the hair 
may be shorter but wolf 42 remains painfully thin adorned with 
eyeliner and dressed completely in black his wit still is sharp 
wolf grew up in the bronx his father was an entertainer his 
mother a political activist and the eclectic home life gave him 
inspiration to be an artist so he relocated to boston in his early 
20s to pursue painting 
but art fell by the wayside when wolf became the overnight disc 
jockey at bostons wbcnfm and caught the music bug it was there 
that he met fellow musician van morrison 
van used to live in cambridge and he used to listen and 
thats how we become friends he used to come by and we ended up 
doing gigs together wolf said my band opened up for him and 
we toured around new england together in station wagons 
in 1967 the j geils band was born taking its name from the 
lead guitarist along the way there were moderate album sales a 
string of gigs opening for the rolling stones and the eventual 
success of the 1982 album freeze frame which sold 5 million 
copies 
but then came the unexpected breakup with the band citing 
socalled creative differences for the split 
wolf said he still prefers the group atmosphere rather than 
taking the risky solo route 
i really enjoy being in a band i enjoy the responsibility i 
enjoy sharing things i enjoy the collaborative sense of it he 
said its a lot tougher being a soloist theres a lot more 
demands all the focus is on one individual im still not used to 
that 
wolf made two solo lp before up to no good this time around 
he decided to venture into unfamiliar territory for a rock n 
roller nashville 
many people think of it as just a country town but theres a 
lot of good rock n rollers down there and theres a lot of 
studios he said so i thought it would be interesting to see 
what it would be like to record outside of a big urban city like 
new york or la once i started spending some time there i really 
liked it 
he says the slogan on up to no good is a quote from a john 
lee hooker song if its in you its got to come out sums up 
his feeling about getting older the business and his own 
personality 
to me rock n roll is infectious in the sense that you 
sometimes cant control it its something thats beyond the 
senses he said 
youve got to really have that desire as long as its there 
you can keep on rocking 
wolf was in boston this october conducting interviews for 
perspective band members the tour which does not have a firm 
opening date will likely take on small intimate clubs and 
despite the years wolf said hes confident that on the tour he can 
live up to the frantic stage persona he had with j geils 
no one questions frank sinatra who started out as a 
bobbysocks idol no one says can he still be singing 
witchcraft when hes 67 obviously he can because hes in his 
70s and still doing concerts wolf said 
but wolf adds that he doesnt have plans to mellow 
i dont think im going to be perry como in a sweater holding 
a pipe

immaculate conception when the pope blesses a statue of mary near 
the spanish steps

transportation schedules are extended so shoppers can search for 
that perfect gift seven days a week until as late as 9 pm 
despite the lack of snow rome becomes its own kind of winter 
wonderland the citys streets decked out in all their christmas 
finery bask in the glow of holiday lights one can stroll along 
the elegant via veneto under twinkling tree branches and stop for a 
steaming cappuccino or a hot chocolate at a sidewalk cafe 
in via dei condotti at the heart of the citys historic center 
one can wander down the redcarpeted street windowshopping to the 
sound of christmas carols in the exclusive boutiques 
nearby in the piazza di spagna those looking for more 
traditional holiday sights will find a gaily decorated christmas 
tree and a beautiful example of the nativity scene or presepe 
the creche is the most important symbol of christmas in italy 
and in addition to those on view in the citys major squares 
almost every roman family displays one at home down the street 
from the piazza di spagna in the piazza del popolo there is an 
annual exhibit of more than one hundred nativity scenes from around 
the world made of everything from chocolate to shells to origami 
the sacred meets the profane in piazza navona where from dec 8 
until jan 6 there is a huge openair market a brilliant array of 
christmas goodies are sold from exquisite handmade figurines for 
the nativity scene to christmas stockings to toys and the customary 
sweets for children most notably the long spiralshaped 
multicolored lollipops known in italian as spun sugar 
for romans the high point of the holiday is christmas eve woe 
to the hungry tourist in search of an evening meal as almost every 
restaurant in rome is closed after lunch on dec 24 when everyone 
goes home to help prepare for the traditional cenone the 
christmas eve dinner that romans eat at home with their families 
the holiday meal is based on seafood and always consists of at 
least four courses traditional dishes include batterfried 
broccoli and cauliflower the classic roman fried artichokes pasta 
with tuna and capitone a dish made with eel all of which is 
topped off by fresh fruit and cheese the meal lasts from 830 pm 
until around 1130 pm when it is time to go to church for 
midnight mass 
be it for romans or for tourists nothing can be more moving 
than attending midnight mass at the imposing st peters basilica 
in vatican city 
the ceremony is led by the pope who reads his homily from under 
the magnificent berninidesigned canopy of the papal altar tickets 
to the mass are available free of charge but must be requested by 
writing several weeks in advance to the prefecture of the casa 
ponteficio vatican city 
after midnight mass families return home to drink spumante and 
eat the special christmas desserts panettone a kind of fruit 
cake and pan doro a light sponge cake topped with powdered 
sugar afterward gifts are exchanged and the family sits down to 
play various games such as cards or tombola an italian version of 
bingo often until sunrise 
on christmas day those who can rouse themselves after a long 
night of festivities will go to the morning mass or to see the 
pope deliver his annual christmas message urbi et orbi latin 
for to the city of rome and to the world to the crowd in 
st peters square 
the holiday season continues through new years until jan 6 
after the night of the befana a witchlike character said to have 
arrived with the three kings at the stable where jesus was born 
the custom of having presents beneath a christmas tree brought by 
babbo natale or father christmas is relatively new and many 
families prefer the older tradition of the visit of the befana 
who comes down the stovepipes to leave candy for good children 
and lumps of charcoal for bad children in stockings hanging in the 
kitchen

children 100 years ago used to occupy themselves making paper 
decorations for the holidays snowflakes lanterns and families 
would create advent wreaths and calendars together they might have 
had a taffy pull to amuse themselves during long winter evenings 
dear reader families have it within their power to resurrect 
these wholesome and homely pastimes mrs sharp will tell them how 
children learning how to amuse themselves is practically a 
lost art says sarah ban breathnach author of mrs sharps 
traditions simon amp schuster a compendium of victorian customs 
ceremonies and amusements for seasons and holidays the year round 
a modern child if theres nothing on television or he 
doesnt have a readymade toy is bored says ban breathnach 
pronounced bon brannock in contrast the victorian child could 
turn to inspiration and instructions for simple crafts from 
childrens or womens magazinss such as godeys ladys book 
demarests family magazine the mothers magazine or the 
illustrated london news many of these were published on both sides 
of the atlantic the crafts gave them a sense of the family 
working together 
ban breathnach says the victorians practically invented the 
traditional christmas before the middle of the 19th century 
the holiday was observed but not celebrated a legacy of the 
puritan era by midcentury though dutch and german immigrant 
families arrived bringing their customs for merrymaking and 
celebrating with them and across the ocean queen victoria married 
prince albert who introduced the christmas tree and other german 
traditions to england and america 
the reasons behind their yearning for ceremony and custom were 
surprisingly similar to those for presentday revivals 
there was a great upheaval in the lifestyle of the victorians 
they were moving from the farms to the cities the railroad had 
changed their lives by letting them move more freely around the 
country along with this the womans role as an educator and home 
manager became magnified she was responding to what she thought 
home life should be says ban breathnach 
they often felt threatened by new things there even were 
sermons preaching against the corrupting influence of ice cream 
parlors 
they turned to traditions to give them a sense of control over 
their lives 
so today with violence on the street and on television and a 
recession possible people feel the same way she says theres 
the sense that things are out of control again 
she became interested in the period when she found some of the 
old magazines while browsing in an antique shop i got 
transported back to the victorian era when life seemed so ordered 
so serene and blissful so completely unlike my own life she 
writes in the foreword to the new book like fifty million other 
working women juggling the demands of work and raising a family 
all i knew about home life was that when push came to shove what 
got shoved out of my life was the very thing i valued most quality 
family time 
so she created the mythical mrs sharp a mrs beetonlike 
authority on family tradition ban breathnach did a radio series on 
the subject for national public radio and ran workshops about 
victorian holiday and seasonal pastimes later she started a 
column for the washington post writers group 
though the character is fictional the name is real she is 
married to edward f sharp a washington lawyer and city council 
member in takoma park md 
now dear readers can find how to cut snowflakes for their trees 
or holiday tables instructions below they can learn about 
stirup sunday when preparations for holiday goodies including 
the christmas pudding begin they can read about victorian 
sugarplum trees or santa lucias day or the entire christmas 
holiday cycle culminating in twelfth night celebrations they can 
try recipes and crafts included in the text 
ban breathnach also has a few words of advice to single parents 
sometimes single parents feel left out of it but its 
important to carry on the traditions to help establish an 
equilibrium for the children 
and she urges jewish parents to invite their childrens 
christian friends to share hanukkah traditions and not feel 
pressured to turn the holiday into a jewish christmas she 
recalls her own daughter was fascinated by the menorah when invited 
by a jewish schoolmate to share a family festival of lights 
observance 
but whatever they do families should celebrate together she 
says the victorians did these things all year round it gave 
them a sense of continuity of being in rhythm 
 
victorian paper snowflakes 
 
based on instructions from mrs sharps traditions simon amp 
schuster 
have an older child or adult first cut a hexagonal template from 
cardboard one for each child 
then let the children trace all the basic snowflakes they want 
from white tissue paper 
to cut the lace fold each tissue hexagon across its center 
then into thirds so it forms a sixply triangle any design as 
long as it doesnt cut the corners that hold the snowflake 
together can be traced and then nipped with scissors into the 
folded sides 
open it up and mount on colored paper or string a dozen or so 
together on thread to hang from branches or lay across a table

secular jews observe it as a celebration of the victory by the 
small band of jewish rebels over their mighty syrian rulers as a 
symbol for modernday zionism 
 
religious jews emphasize an ancient miracle said to have 
occurred at the temple after it was liberated when an eternal 
flame burned for eight days on oil that should have lasted one day 
 
whatever their level of observance almost all israeli jews at 
some time light the menorah the holy lamp that recalls the story 
of judah and his followers 
 
jewish tradition holds that when the rebels were purifying the 
temple of pagan rituals performed by the syrians they found enough 
oil for only one day to relight an eternal flame but miraculously 
the flame burned eight days until more oil arrived 
while the traditional menorah is described in the bible as 
having seven candlesticks a special candlelabrum with nine 
candlesticks the hanykkiyah is used only to celebrate hanukkah 
 
for the eight days of hanukkah jews celebrate by lighting an 
additional candle each night on the candlelabrum a ninth candle in 
the middle known as the shamash or servant in hebrew is used 
to light the other eight 
in the united states hanukkah is often marked by giving lavish 
gifts but hanukkah presents are rarely exchanged in israel 
children receive small sums of money known as hanukkah gelt in 
yiddish or the traditional foursided spinning top called a 
dreidel 
many believe that hanukkah giftgiving became popular in the 
united states because of the holidays proximity to christmas

and visions of computer games expensive doll 
houses and noisy wheels dance in their wee little heads 
most american children today live in isolation from the 
workplace or the farm and have no idea of the labor needed to earn 
money for expensive toys says a catholic university of america 
psychology professor 
it is difficult for young children to understand why their 
parents wont buy them the bike they want when they see that 
parents have money says hans furth a developmental psychologist 
who has researched childrens ideas about the marketplace 
furth says that children cant be expected to learn the value of 
money until they are at least teenagers young children arent 
curious about how things get their value and they arent ready to 
learn 
so what about the holidays 
it depends on how children relate to their parents if 
children respect their parents and see their parents handling money 
sensibly the children will probably do the same 
peer pressure to get in toys is a big problem furth 
observes our children live in a world of commercialism and we 
have to help them learn to live with it 
but dont try to make junior financial wizards out of children 
children should be free to be children and to dream and 
fantasize especially at christmas he says

together in a way that will let you use your creativity stack the 
rings to make a christmas tree lay them out into a cornucopia or

after royalty or famous people at the shop which has been at the 
same skoubogade 3 address in copenhagen for 120 years another

2 cups sugar 
23 cup egg whites 
white icing 
 
blend marzipan and sugar well then add egg whites mix well

individual 
this is the kind of cheering information for the season that can

book of records facts on file under their trees note the 
tallest cut christmas tree was the 221foothigh douglas fir put up 
at the northgate shopping center in seattle in 1950 
the guinness has a record of its own it has sold 61 million

thought was the far east two in the first batch of anniversary 
books are rand mcnallys atlas of columbus and the great 
discoveries by kenneth nebenzahl and america 1492 portrait of 
a continent 500 years ago by manuel lucena salmoral facts on 
file 
nebenzahl a map historian traces the cartographic history of 
the columbus expedition noting that misrepresentations of the 
oceans breadth on the ptolemaic mappaemundi world maps and 
portolan sea charts of that era were behind the discoverers belief 
that he could sail westward to the east the book is illustrated 
with many of these early maps including a portolan sea chart 
attributed to columbus himself 
the book continues with the story of how mapmakers in the 
ensuing years dealt with the change in their concepts of world 
geography and how europe colonized the new world 
salmorals book focuses on the americans that columbus 
mistakenly called indians histories of such tribes as the inuits 
in the north to the mays aztecs and incas of the south are 
extrapolated back to precolumbian times drawing on eyewitness 
accounts of contemporary spanish historians and a few surviving 
native documents

about f scott fitzgerald liked the cover art for the great 
gatsby so much that he wrote to his editor for christs sake

john steinbeck in an effort to confront accusations that the 
grapes of wrath was alien propaganda insisted that the lyrics to 
the battle hymn of the republic from which his title was 
taken be printed on the endpapers the gatsby cover for the new 
series was reproduced from the only known original in the authors 
scrapbook now at the firestone library in princeton

crafters who knit crochet and sew have transformed a neonatal 
intensive care unit in akron ohio from a sterile atmosphere into 
a rainbow world of babies wearing tiny stocking caps and bootees in 
colors that celebrate the holidays seasons and life itself 
according to christmas ideas a better homes and gardens 
publication this volunteer project at childrens hospital medical 
center started nine years ago and now provides muchneeded garments 
each month for 100150 premature babies some of whom have major 
health problems 
volunteering to knit or crochet tiny caps and bootees or sew 
small kimonostyle gowns for premature infants in childrens 
hospitals across the country is a christmas craft project that can 
be extended yearround childrens hospitals welcome all of these 
garments says susan bales public relations person for the 
national association of childrens hospitals and related 
institutions 
even in a hospitals controlled environment the tiny babies 
still need caps and bootees for warmth their bodies however are 
too small for newbornsize clothes some of the infants weigh less 
than 1 pound 
at the childrens hospital of akron nurses used cutoff tube 
socks to cover the infants heads before volunteers started 
providing garments that fit says marilyn mcguckin director of 
volunteers we now have a core of volunteers who regularly make 
tam hats caps topped with big pompoms and others knitted in 
bright seasonal holiday and school colors 
volunteers also are needed to make small mittens to keep some 
infants from pulling out stitches in addition dollsize kimono 
gowns can be sewn from soft fireretardant flannel materials for 
the babies 
the babies in our neonatal intensive care unit start out so 
small but after they progress through several stages gain weight 
and become healthier then they go home wearing colorful caps and 
bootees mcguckin says 
the capsandbootees program is one of many examples of what 
volunteers in a community can do to support their childrens 
hospital says william h considine president of childrens 
hospital medical center of akron it requires just a small 
investment of time and money but it means so much to the families 
of these infants the caps and bootees provide these families with 
a special keepsake of their babys first days in this world the 
program also provides a human touch of kindness at a critical time 
for parents and their newborn child 
instructions and patterns for six projects are given in the 1990 
issue of christmas ideas magazine 
for a local listing of hospitals that are embers of the

traditional family holiday house and tree decorations have 
always seemed to be a mix of favorite baubles kept from one year to 
the next and new homemade ornaments often made by the children 
kids can make sculptured ornaments with glue dough using cookie 
or canape cutters or dull knives to cut out holidays shapes like 
stars bells santas and so on 
the clay recipe calls for cup each of flour cornstarch and 
elmers glueall roll out the dough on a floured board to a lsqbinch 
thickness then cut the shapes adding a hole in each use a piece 
of plastic straw leaving it in for an hour or so allow the 
ornaments to dry for 12 to 14 hours turning them occasionally 
then color them with a glue paint made from the glue and food 
coloring or cake decorating gels apply right from the glue bottle 
or use toothpicks beads glitter ribbons and other trims can be 
pressed directly onto fresh glue paint once the paint is dry 
details can be added with a finetipped marker 
in this media age nostalgia may be an old advertising campaign 
and if youre over 50 you may remember one of the most common 
images of santa claus was the one in the cocacola ads with that 
in mind communicorp of atlanta has created ornaments based on coke 
christmas art originally painted by swedish artist haddon sundblom 
during the l930s and 1940s the ornaments in threedimensional 
interpretations or tins with lithographed reproductions include 
santa swigging coke and the bottle cap sprite 
the modern decorating urge extends to the tshirt and other 
wearables washing the item first and inserting a piece of 
cardboard for firmness under the spot you plan to use for your 
masterpiece create wearable holiday art or greetings with tulip 
paints special effects can be achieved with the puffy suede 
slick or iridescent versions of the tulip line 
dizzle also makes fabric paints and transfer art as well should 
you feel less than competent at drawing transfers are shaded and 
colored and can be combined with regular and glitter paints for 
maximum effect the company also offers bright opaque paints that 
work on denims and other dark fabrics 
and decorate the air too sylvania has come up with light bulbs 
that spread the aroma of potpourri in a variety of fragrances heat 
from a 25watt light scent bulb activates scented tablets placed in 
an indentation in the top of the bulb tablets last the average 
life of the bulb 1000 hours

fight back at the candy the gravy the 
booze 
heres an example of sheer heresy from kay stanfill associate 
professor of dietetics at the university of oklahoma health 
sciences center 
dont put out a dish of candy this year 
stanfill says that while americans are improving they still 
feel the urge to indulge at holiday time theres always a lot of 
food around along with the pressure to have a bite or more and 
as if the temptation isnt bad enough there also is more alcohol 
at hand the more you drink alcoholic beverages the more the 
willpower is significantly decreased she says 
dig in she advises but not at the table 
if youre invited to a party plan your early day calories 
around it eating lightly at breakfast and lunch then at the 
party eat slowly just sip your drink and talk a lot all of 
which will reduce your intake you can visit the buffet table and 
take a moderate portion of the dip and vegetables that are usually 
there and fill yourself up but dont just stand at the table and 
graze go sit down somewhere with a specific amount so if you go 
back to the table its an action you have to be aware of 
she advises both guest and host to take alcohol seriously if 
youre the host serve food protein and carbohydrates along 
with the drinks make punch with a noncarbonated base like fruit 
juice since carbonation makes the body absorb alcohol faster 
serve nonalcoholic beverages too have jiggers or selfmeasuring 
oneounce bottle spouts at the bar if guests mix their own dont 
force drinks on your guests or refill their glasses without being 
asked and stop serving alcohol two hours before the party is over 
on the other hand dont try too hard to control yourself during 
the holidays she says because its bound to fail its better 
to plan to eat those things that really matter to you that really 
represent the holiday and skip the things that arent as 
important

the governments gauge of future economic 
health dropped 08 percent in september the second straight big 
decline and the third month without improvement the commerce 
department said 
many analysts responded to the friday report by saying a 
national recession not only had arrived but was intensifying 
the bush administration contends the economy is growing and will 
continue to do so at least into the new year but the question for 
many private analysts instead is how long and severe the 
contraction will be 
 
washington ap americas unemployment rate held at 57 
percent in october after rising for three straight months but big 
new job losses still cut across the us economy the government 
said 
for the third month in a row more industries lost jobs than 
gained them the labor department said friday in a report analysts 
took as new evidence a recession is taking hold 
 
washington ap the resolution trust corp announced it is 
putting up for sale 18 failed savings institutions including 
lincoln savings and loan association considered to be the 
costliest collapsed thrift ever 
the failure of lincoln formerly owned by charles keating jr 
is costing taxpayers an estimated 2 billion keating faces 
numerous civil and criminal charges 
the rtc the federal agency responsible for disposing of 
hundreds of failed sampls said friday it is accepting bids from 
potential buyers for the 18 institutions 
 
new york ap pan am corp said its thirdquarter losses 
increased by 62 percent reflecting sharply higher fuel costs 
brought on by the persian gulf crisis 
the ailing airline reported friday it lost 291 million or 19 
cents per share for the quarter compared with a loss a year 
earlier of 18 million or 12 cents a share 
 
detroit ap the shaky economy caused chrysler corp and fiat 
spa to call off months of talks about possible joint ventures or 
other business arrangements the no 3 us automaker and the 
italian company said 
uncertainties in the global economy rising oil prices brought 
on by the crisis in the gulf the slowdown in sales in both the 
us and european automotive markets and the overall deterioration 
in worldwide business conditions created overwhelming obstacles 
chrysler chairman lee iacocca said friday 
 
new york ap fastfood giant mcdonald corps decision to 
abandon foam packages wont put much of a dent in the plastics 
industry but it symbolizes americas growing discomfort with the 
throwaway image and could prompt other businesses to shun the 
material 
the containers for big macs quarter pounders and other 
sandwiches served at mcdonalds 8000 restaurants nationwide 
account for less than 1 percent of the 5 billionplus market for 
polystyrene says the society of the plastics industry a 
washington trade group 
the immediate impact will be felt by mcdonalds suppliers 
 
paris ap the bottlers of bubbly perrier water reported that 
net profits more than doubled in the first half of 1990 despite a 
worldwide recall after dangerous chemicals turned up in some 
samples 
the profit increase came mostly from the sale of the groups 
softdrink operations source perrier sa said friday 
firsthalf volume sales of the popular mineral water were down 
14 percent from 1989 and revenue slipped 3 percent due to the 
recall and delays in restocking the beverage source perrier said

ball corps failure to obtain financing for 
a 1025 billion acquisition of a european can producer illustrates 
how important or fatal timing can be to expansion plans 
a year ago experts say the munciebased manufacturer of 
containers and aerospace systems would have had no problem finding 
625 million in cash to pay peter kiewet sons inc for the 
european operations of continental can co 
kiewet of omaha neb also would have received 400 million in 
ball stock 
however in the three months since the tentative deal was 
announced world financial markets have been thrown into turmoil 
amid the persian gulf crisis 
the prospect of a recession has loomed larger the magnitude of 
the savingsandloan crisis has become more clear and banks have 
felt the pinch of regulatory oversight 
its all coming to the front here simultaneously said 
robert c klemkosky a financial market expert at the indiana 
university school of business in 1989 this deal would have 
gone it would have been a slam dunk 
wall street agrees 
i think it has less to do with ball than it has to do with the 
credit markets today said robert bishop a stock analyst with 
salomon brothers inc 
its more difficult to get financing today than it was back in 
july youre in a situation where you have a big sampl bailout going 
on were starting to find out more about all the loans that were 
made throughout the 80s bishop said 
he added the gulf certainly didnt help matters any 
ball announced the acquisition plans on july 30 three days 
before iraq invaded kuwait at the time ball stock was trading 
around 32 per share and the dow jones industrial average was 
threatening to break 3000 today ball trades closer to 26 
reflecting the stock markets loss of about 16 percent during the 
three months of the usled military buildup in the gulf 
ball and kiewet announced oct 26 their deal was off 
unfortunately due in major part to the recent turmoil in 
world financial markets and in particular the us banking 
community ball has not yet arranged financing and the certainty 
of closing the transaction on the agreed upon terms and time frame 
have become compromised they said in a joint statement 
ball officials have declined to comment further on the 
circumstances that led to the deals failure 
they stood to gain much from acquiring continental caneurope 
ball already was established as one of the top five producers of 
beer and soft drink cans in the united states but lacked a major 
presence in one of the worlds fastest growing markets europe 
ball has only a plastics plant in northern ireland and an 
electronics operation in germany 
continental can europes no 3 container producer appeared to 
provide the opportunity ball long had sought but never attained 
ball has abandoned european joint ventures that never proved as 
profitable as hoped and it failed two years ago to acquire 
metalbox ltd a continental can competitor eventually bought by a 
french suitor 
packaging revenues would have tripled continental can had sales 
of 147 billion last year and projected them to reach 166 
billion in 1990 ball container sales last year were only about 
half of that 781 million 
ball which likes to keep its debttoequity ratio around 40 
percent was prepared to temporarily sacrifice that conservative 
position financing would have raised the ratio to 60 percent 
qualifying the deal as a highly leveraged transaction 
such deals attract closer scrutiny and that no doubt scared 
some lenders 
the markets going to look very skeptically at that 
klemkosky said the banks are selfimposing capital rationing 
banks are just being extremely careful who theyre lending to 
h edward schollmeyer an analyst with painewebber inc 
speculated ball may have been forced eventually to walk away from 
financing that came at too high a price in interest and bank fees 
no matter how badly it wanted continental can 
they spent a lot of money working on it and i think theres a 
lot of broken hearts schollmeyer said

what does an oil trader do when the industry 
says the nations supply of crude is falling by about a million 
barrels and the government says its rising by about a million 
when this happened last week futures players on the new york 
mercantile exchange used the bullish numbers from the industry to 
push prices higher they paid less attention to the government 
numbers even though some in the industry believe the government 
usually comes closer to the mark 
others have their doubts as they analyze weekly petroleum 
reports that are generally released tuesday evenings by the leading 
industry group the american petroleum institute and wednesday 
evenings by the independent statistical branch of the department of 
energy 
a lot of people feel the doe numbers are more correct but at 
the same time you have to remember they have that government 
influence on them said thomas p blakeslee an energy analyst 
with pegasus econometric group inc in hoboken nj are they 
receiving better information or are they simply trying to paint a 
better picture a lot of people figure if they have a chance to 
paint a better picture they will 
the government disputes the contention that its numbers are 
anything but the most accurate it can compile and many industry 
observers doubt the doe numbers are manipulated for political 
reasons 
analyst bob baker of prudentialbache securities inc sees such 
a charge as the type of cynicism that leads some people to believe 
anything negative they might hear about the government 
these numbers are so open for inspection that it would be 
pretty hard to bugger them baker said 
nonetheless during the persian gulf crisis that has now entered 
its fourth month the discrepancies that have shown up between the 
two statistical reports have tended to show higher stockpiles for 
crude and gasoline in the federal reports 
in last weeks reports the api showed gasoline stocks falling 
by 22 million barrels and crude oil stocks falling by 900000 
barrels doe showed gasoline stocks rising by 14 million barrels 
and crude stocks rising by 12 million barrels 
those swings were larger than usual analysts said although 
baker points out they were smaller than the gap that showed up a 
few years back when a difference of 8 million barrels of crude 
raised questions about the ways the government and the industry try 
to keep track of oil 
baker said he puts more faith in the government numbers saying 
that months after the fact when the statisticians release modified 
reports that are supposed to be more accurate the api generally 
adjusts its figures in the direction of the doe numbers 
he also pointed out that the api report contains a fudge 
factor showing a discrepancy in all the barrels of oil and 
refined petroleum products that didnt quite add up from week to 
week last week it was 405000 barrels 
on imports sometimes they dont get a tanker counted when it 
lands baker said api statistician edward murphy acknowledges 
its easier to keep track of refineries than tankers so sometimes 
the giant ships are left out and oil imports can be the trickiest 
number to estimate 
still oil traders are more likely to respond to the api 
numbers which those in the industry refer to simply as apis 
the api report has been around longer it comes out first giving 
it a definite edge in potential to move a market that often jumps 
at the latest shred of information floating in 
api waits until the mercantile exchange closes each tuesday 
before it even compiles the numbers once they are compiled they 
are released immediately so no one ever has access to any 
unreleased information murphy said 
the api numbers are the industrys bellwether according to 
senior oil analyst annlouise hittle at shearson lehman brothers 
inc 
despite that the general perception is if you had to youd 
probably put the does as being more accurate she said 
statisticians from api and the energy information 
administration which compiled the government numbers agreed its 
hard to say why they sometimes chart crude stocks moving in 
different directions but both groups say their numbers are 
generally quite close with most discrepancies being statistically 
insignificant

investor harold l arbit who bought 
timber stocks for clients despite his fondness for forests laughed 
at the first rumor attacking him for bankrolling a ballot measure 
to protect californias redwoods 
he was trying to make a killing by cornering the redwood 
futures market claimed opponents of the voter initiative in 
timber country 
that rumor died quickly after folks found out there are no such 
things as redwood futures 
but the campaign against arbit didnt stop and he isnt laughing 
now 
the timber industry is fighting this issue with slander and 
lies said arbit president of concord capital management a firm 
that manages a 208 billion stockmarket portfolio for pension 
funds universities and foundations 
he spoke at a recent interview in concord capitals offices 
overlooking brushcovered hills and eucalyptus trees in san mateo 
ive had people tell me they would have supported the 
initiative financially but they dont want to take the same kind 
of abuse and heat that ive taken arbit said it doesnt mean 
enough to them to do that they dont want to jeopardize their 
privacy and business reputation the message thats gotten across 
is that the timber industry is going to do whatever it has to do 
to make life difficult for anyone who challenges them 
arbit has spent 51 million a record for an individual in 
california to support the forests forever proposition on the 
ballot tuesday his contribution along with 1 million from walt 
disney productions executive frank wells and his wife has provided 
the bulk of the 65 million funding for prop 130 
opponents of prop 130 have raised 96 million most of it from 
timber companies 
i guess if someone gives to a museum so he can put his name on 
it or creates a wing in a hospital thats something people can 
relate to said arbit who calls the 51 million a large 
chunk of his wealth but if you contribute to an initiative or 
an environmental cause somehow thats viewed as being different 
im not quite sure why 
hed given several million to other environmental efforts in the 
past sometimes anonymously but he didnt go into this campaign 
thinking hed spend so much 
at first when he asked attorneys last year to draft the 
initiative with a coalition of environmental groups he figured 
hed lay out about 15 million but the ante grew as the timber 
industry mounted its response 
my banker keeps saying are you sure you want to do this are 
you sure its worth it and i keep asking myself what material 
possession would i rather have versus knowing that ive helped 
save a unique natural heritage arbit said 
his decision always came down on the side of the redwoods 
arbit 43 said hes been fascinated by the giant trees since 
his childhood in california 
i remember reading rachel carsons silent spring in high 
school he said it made me aware that people could have an 
impact on nature 
nonetheless arbit still invested 154 million of his clients 
funds in eight logging and forestproducts companies last year 
along with aluminum and chemical companies as part of a strategy 
to buy cyclical stocks 
my personal beliefs are separate from the hat i wear as a 
fiduciary said arbit whose clients include the rockefeller 
foundation ford motor co and the state of connecticut 
that separation of beliefs and responsibilities opened arbit to 
early suspicion by other environmentalists and repeated criticism 
from prop 130 opponents 
if clearcutting of forests in california is restricted that 
could drive up lumber prices in other states and benefit some of 
the companies in which arbit invested according to one argument 
the problem with that according to timber industry analyst mike 
shea of black amp co in portland ore is that the companies arbit 
invested in such as louisianapacific corp probably would have 
their gains outside california offset by losses in california 
on balance it might be a wash shea said i dont 
understand what arbit is doing hes a large shareholder of 
louisianapacific and there are aspects of the initiative that 
are brutal to the timber companies if the initiative passes 
its certainly not going to make him any money 
some timber companies such as pacific lumber a unit of maxxam 
inc of los angeles might profit from the sale of bonds to buy 
their redwood forests but arbits portfolio doesnt include 
maxxam pacific lumber bonds or any other bonds he invests 
strictly in stocks 
whether the timber companies gain or profit from prop 130 
arbits clients wont feel much impact the eight lumber and paper 
stocks represent a small portion of the nearly 200 stocks in 
concord capitals portfolio 
no one who has attacked arbit over the past year including 
lawmakers and a spokesman for the timber industry campaign against 
prop 130 has come up with evidence that his motives are anything 
but altruistic 
rep doug bosco of sebastopol where many voters depend on the 
timber industry said in july he was sure arbit was trying to 
manipulate the stock or bond markets bosco now admits arbit may 
be perfectly innocent 
dave fogarty a public relations spokesman for the timber 
industry calls arbits donation obscene challenges his 
motives and says the industry has done a little research on 
arbit fogarty says however that he cant prove arbit would 
profit from prop 130 and adds our job is to raise the question 
and move on

gasoline prices at the pump declined over the 
last two weeks for the first time since the persian gulf crisis a 
new survey says 
the national average price for all grades of gasoline fell 018 
cent to 14691 per gallon according to the nov 2 lundberg survey 
of 13500 stations 
although the retail price did not change much on average gas 
prices were volatile across the country this week analyst trilby 
lundberg said sunday prices generally rose on the east and west 
coast while falling on the gulf coast and in the midwest and rocky 
mountain region 
since july 20 the last survey before iraqs aug 2 invasion of 
kuwait prices rose an average of 2920 cents said lundberg 
an estimated 43 million barrels of oil a day were lost because 
of iraqs invasion of kuwait and the resultant embargo of iraq the 
energy department said increased production shrunk that deficit to 
11 million barrels a day in october 
lundberg said a lower demand for gas after the summertime 
driving season contributed to lower prices 
however she added that crude oil prices have risen more than 
gasoline prices these costs have not yet been passed by stations 
to the consumer and that may check any downward trend in prices 
she said 
the average price for gas at selfservice stations was 13610 
per gallon for regular unleaded 15242 for premium unleaded and 
13264 for regular leaded 
the average price for gas at fullservice stations was 15777 
per gallon for regular unleaded 17134 for premium unleaded and 
15408 for regular unleaded

a federal bankruptcy judge has given 
olympia holding corp another month to turn around its financially 
troubled pie international trucking subsidiary 
over strong objections from the companys largest secured 
creditor fidelcor business credit corporation us district court 
judge george proctor said sunday the truck line could continue to 
use money from its accounts receivable to operate until the next 
court hearing set for dec 15 
proctor also ruled pie could resume making payments to the 
teamsters unions health and welfare and pension funds last week 
the unions leadership threatened to strike on monday if the fringe 
benefits were not funded 
olympia filed last month for protection from its creditors while 
it reorganized under chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy code it 
listed debts of 237 million supported by assets of 169 million as 
of aug 25 
pie owes fidelcor nearly 40 million the loans are backed by 
certain equipment and accounts receivable which are what pie 
customers owe for services already rendered 
attorneys for the new yorkbased lender argued that pies 
survival is not viable and that it is continuing to erode an asset 
more than 60 million in accounts receivable pledged to 
creditors 
the debtor has no money the debtor has no assets said 
george ridge a jacksonville attorney representing fidelcor the 
only way it can succeed is on the back of one creditor 
fidelcor 
it was shocking that fidelcor wanted to close the company 
down countered steve busey an attorney representing pie 
we are pleased the court overruled fidelcors objections 
permitted pie to continue to operate and ruled that it has a 
reasonable prospect for a successful reorganization 
at sundays hearing proctor also said pie can resume paying 
freight discount payments to customers something the company said 
it needed to do to retain its customer base 
meanwhile olympia holding has signed a letter of intent with 
envirosource inc and its subsidiary iu international corp to form 
a new transportation company 
in part the new corporation would include pie iu 
internationals 72 percent interest in landstar system inc a 
company that owns five truc lines including ranger and poole and 
itofka consolidators inc a company that sells piggyback railroad 
service to trucking companies court documents show 
iu international based in stamford conn had owned pie but 
sold it in 1985 owed more than 20 million by pie iu 
international now is the second largest secured creditor

british telecommunication plc and mci 
communications corp have agreed to build a 400 million 
transatlantic fiber optic cable to relieve a telecommunication 
capacity shortage mci said today 
the two companies are inviting other international 
telecommunications carriers to participate in the planning 
construction and operation of the new highcapacity cable expected 
to be the largest undersea telecommunication line ever constructed 
the companies will share the cost of construction according to 
their percentage of ownership mci spokesman david thompson said 
this is the first time that mci initiated the planning of a 
transatlantic cable that will be built operated and owned by a 
consortium of common carriers mci president bert c roberts jr 
said in a written statement 
it is a step toward providing an integrated network of 
mutually supportive cables across the north atlantic he said 
mci said it would handle the equivalent of 150000 simultaneous 
phone calls the first transatlantic cable completed in 1956 
could handle only 60 simultaneous calls thompson said 
the cable currently called tatx is scheduled to go into 
service in 1993 it will be the seventh such cable in operation 
after the construction of tat9 is completed in 1991 thompson 
said 
the companies plan to use the line with synchronous optical 
transmission equipment which is designed to allow centralized 
control of circuits maintenance testing and cable restoration 
tatx also will provide service for other cables in case of 
service interruptions

less than a week after announcing it would buy the 
remaining stock in neiman marcus group general cinema corp 
announced today the deal was off 
general cinema which already owns a little more than half of 
the 332 million shares of outstanding common stock in neiman 
marcus said it would not begin its 1440 per share offer for the 
remainder 
general cinema said it took the action because a special 
committee of the neiman marcus board of directors had decided to 
withdraw its recommendation of the tender offer 
general cinema announced the deal last tuesday saying it had a 
large available pool of cash for buying the stock 
analysts said although the retail industry is sluggish neiman 
marcus represented a good longterm investment for general cinema 
aside from its stake in neiman marcus common stock general 
cinema also holds an issue of convertible preferred stock in the 
specialty retailer which if converted would increase general 
cinemas total interest to about 60 percent 
general cinema owns 168 million shares of common stock in 
neiman marcus

scott paper co announced monday it has 
formed a joint venture with feldmuhle ag to own and operate the 
europthere is little doubt in our 
minds that the company needs a lot of money and it needs a lot of 
money fast we are simply saying that they are coming to the wrong 
people to get that kind of money 
these employees cant afford a 35 percent wage cut dahl 
said they upi officials have come to us for concessions 
probably seven times in the last decade and there is no more left 
to give 
he said officers of the union were sticking to their 
recommendation that the contract be rejected but would submit it 
to the full membership because they believe this is a very very 
serious situation that every member should have the opportunity to 
have their own say on 
upi announced friday that it has cut management salaries by 35 
percent for 90 days and would seek similar concessions from 
employees represented by the guild as it seeks a buyer for the news 
service 
upi has changed ownership three times in the past eight years

in five states and said oct 12 it was dismissing an unspecified 
number of employees

real chance at taking its rightful place among the successful 
giants of the growing information industry it is up to us now to 
make sure we get a real chance 
he cautioned however that approval of the pay cut would not 
guarantee upi will be successfully sold 
the only thing it guarantees is that we will be able to take 
the process to its conclusion giving us vital breathing room to 
find the best possible home for upi he said 
vanbennekom said last friday that several offers had been made 
for the news service which is owned by infotechnology inc

domestic sales in the first half of fiscal 1990 
but atsushi muramatsu a nissan executive vice president said 
the company may face falling consumer demand higher costs and 
funding constrictions in the second half he said the tokyo stockmmarkets 
plunge and the uncertainties of gulf crisis may prompt 
households to reconsider spending plans 
for the six months ended sept 30 net income was 4684 billion 
yen or 3678 million a 165 percent increase from the same 
period a year earlier nissan reported 
it said brisk consumer demand for new models kept sales growing

percent from a year earlier while proceeds from the sales grew 13 
percent to 59913 billion yen or 47 billion

special aid to countries hit hardest by the persian 
gulf crisis has reached nearly 13 billion a new coordinating 
committee announced monday 
since the united nations embargo was imposed against iraq for 
invading kuwait on aug 2 the gulf states have pledged 84 
billion in assistance for countries hurt financially by observing 
the embargo said the gulf crisis financial coordination group 
the 12nation european community has promised another 22 
billion japan pledged 2 billion and other countries committed 
300000 the group said 
about 80 percent of the aid will go to egypt turkey and jordan 
the group said another 25 billion will be sent to other 
countries including syria morocco djibouti and lebanon 
according to the group 
were very very satisfied with these commitments which are 
very sizeable said david mulford the us undersecretary of the 
treasury 
the gulf crisis financial coordination group was proposed by 
us president george bush in september the group determines which 
countries need aid most and works to assemble and disburse the 
money quickly 
the united states was not listed as a donor because the us 
is forgiving almost 7 billion of egyptian military debt and also 
has 250000 troops on the front line mulford said 
he said the groups figures are the first substantive accounting 
of the aid to nations affected by the un embargo 
before the group reached the conclusions presented monday he 
said it was believed that 10 billion to 11 billion had been 
promised to countries hurt by their compliance with the embargo 
however a western diplomat said many of the earlier numbers 
were political numbers that didnt have a recipient attached and 
were simply estimates of aid that might be given 
as of today these numbers are the commitments and thats 
important for mr saddam hussein to see mulford said 
he said that more than onethird of the money had already been 
disbursed in the form of lowcost loans grants and contributions 
of oil and other goods the 13 billion in aid comes in addition to 
countries contributions to the multinational military force and 
previously established bilateral assistance 
more than 25 nations sent delegations to mondays meeting the 
groups third representing countries in western europe and the 
middle east as well as japan the united states canada australia

the leading airline industry group on monday 
recommended up to an 8 percent increase in passenger fares and 7 
percent rise in cargo prices to help airlines offset high fuel 
costs caused by the persian gulf crisis 
the international air transport associations recommendations 
issued during its conference in geneva marked the second time 
since the crisis began three months ago that the airline industry 
has moved to raise prices because of fuel inflation any increase 
is subject to approval by affected countries 
the airlines want the increases to take effect by middecember 
but association officials said some governments might not address 
the question until after the christmas holidays 
airline industry profits have been battered by slowing economies 
in the united states and elsewhere the rising cost of jet fuel 
since iraq seized kuwait three months ago has made matters worse 
for many carriers who must buy enormous quantities of fuel at 
prices that fluctuate daily 
the association said in a statement the increase in prices to 
customers are to recover at least partially continued cost 
increases particularly in fuel prices 
in august airlines in the association said they would initially 
boost international passenger fares by 8 percent 
unlike fares in the united states which have been deregulated 
since 1978 most international fares are determined by agreement 
among airlines and national governments 
industry officials say the previous fare increase which 
generally took effect this month failed to cover higher costs 
caused by the jump in oil prices seesawing crudeoil prices in 
recent weeks have added to the financial strain 
the international air transport association is the industrys 
leading group with about 200 member airlines

the big three automakers sales of north 
americanmade cars and light trucks rose 53 percent in late 
october and were up 27 percent for the first month of the 1991 
model year the companies said monday 
the upturn countered other portents of a slowing economy 
incral of which are expected to testify 
lawyers promised to raise new issues about sexual consent and 
mental illness during the trial of mark a peterson 29 of 
oshkosh 
there are a lot of people who are just plain skeptical about 
this thing district attorney joseph paulus told reporters during 
a court recess the bottom line will be if the jury believes it 
the disorder or not 
under wisconsin law sexual contact is forbidden with those 
suffering from a mental illness or deficiency so severe they cant 
understand the consequences of their behavior 
prosecutors allege peterson had sex with one of 27yearold 
womans personalities last june after learning she was mentally 
ill 
petersons lawyer edward salzsieder said he will show peterson 
didnt know the woman was mentally ill and thought he had proper 
consent the attorney said he also would try to convince the jury 
that the woman doesnt suffer from a mental illness and has put on 
a big show 
the woman was expected to take the stand under the influence of 
six or seven of her personalities which psychiatrists have 
documented 
circuit judge robert hawley ruled the jury will be sequestered 
during the trial which was expected to last three days 
the charge against peterson carries a maximum prison term of 10 
years 
the woman changed personalities on the witness stand during a 
preliminary hearing earlier this year she blinked her eyes and 
paused each time she was asked by lawyers to switch identities 
the judge required during the hearing that each of her 
personalities take an oath before testifying 
a psychiatrist who has treated the woman for four years said he 
diagnosed last february that she suffered from multiple personality 
disorder 
the disorder is triggered by emotional or physical abuse during 
childhood forcing victims to create separate personalities to 
avoid confronting reality it affects about 7000 people in the 
united states psychiatrists said 
the woman a college graduate testified at the preliminary 
hearing that she told peterson she was a woman of many 
personalities 
one of her personalities is that of a male bodybuilder

oil prices fell more than 2 a barrel monday 
reflecting what traders called the growing realization that global 
demand has declined and supplies remain adequate despite the 
persian gulf crisis 
oil trading strategists noted that the market has now gone more 
than a week without any wild trading based on war jitters or 
speculation that peace could be near they said the market may have 
settled into a phase of trading based more on the fundamentals of 
supply and demand 
a lot of people are not playing the market said trader ed 
kevelson of dean witter reynolds inc i think theyre waiting for 
some real substantial news theyre not reacting any more to the 
bullish news and rumors you get a sense its going to be a real 
drawnout thing 
light sweet crude oil fell 204 to 3196 per barrel for 
december delivery contracts on the new york mercantile exchange 
later contract months all fell by the marketimposed daily limit of 
1 per barrel volume was light 
crude had opened lower in new york following a pattern set 
earlier in londons petroleum market prices stayed down all day 
analysts said oil traders have calmed down recently as the 
organization of petroleum exporting countries particularly key 
member saudi arabia pretty much made up for the shortfall of 4 
million barrels a day brought on by the international boycott of 
oil from iraq and kuwait 
also recent reports have shown that world demand for oil has 
tapered off amid sharply higher prices 
oil analyst peter beutel of pegasus econometric group inc in 
hoboken nj agreed the market has seemed to stop moving on 
tidbits of news at least for the past week he nonetheless said 
the bullish news has perhaps kept oil prices propped up 
one thing that kept prices high last week was a constant 
stream of comments from the white house beutel said in a series 
of republican campaign appearances president bush pointedly 
refused to rule out the use of force to push iraqi troops out of 
occupied kuwait and said his patience was waning 
other news such as bushs announcement he would visit troops in 
the gulf for thanksgiving has given traders a sense that the 
crisis will drag on for a while without escalating into a shooting 
war 
senior oil analyst annlouise hittle of shearson lehman brothers 
inc said part of crudes initial rapid rise came at a time when 
opec members could not agree on whether they would lift production 
quotas to make up for the shortfall of iraqi and kuwaiti crude 
now they have stepped up production and the shortfall has been 
virtually eliminated so the oil market has fallen back 
refined petroluem products weakened along with crude in mondays 
session 
home heating oil was off 296 cents at 8446 cents a gallon on 
contracts for december delivery unleaded gasoline dropped 167 
cents to 8754 cents a gallon for december delivery later months 
closed lower for both products 
natural gas prices were mixed with coldweather months trading 
higher and later months trading lower december delivery contracts 
fell 27 cents to 2385 per 1000 cubic feet

soybean futures prices sagged to new threemonth lows monday on 
the chicago board of trade amid disappointment over export sales 
and perceptions that the 1990 us soybean production will exceed 
expectations 
grain futures finished mixed

metals rose coffee was down livestock futures were mixed and 
pork bellies soared 
soybean futures settled 3 cents to 12 cents lower with the 
contract for delivery in november at 581 a bushel the lowest 
settlement for nearterm soybeans since aug 2 
analysts traced the steep midday selloff to two main factors 
fading hopes for sales of soybean meal to the soviet union and 
expectations that thursdays agriculture department crop report 
will contain a significantly larger soybean harvest projection than 
last months government estimate of 182 billion bushels 
joel karlin an analyst with the chicagobased brokers advisory 
service research department inc said some of the heaviest sellers 
were speculative funds that bought soybean contracts last week 
expecting the bush administration would grant export credits to the 
soviet union to enable the soviets to buy soybean meal and other 
agricultural commodities 
but there was no such announcement and agriculture secretary 
clayton yeutter indicated monday that president bush had not 
changed his position of withholding export credits to the soviets 
until moscow relaxes its emigration policies 
after the close the usdas weekly exportinspections report 
showed 77 million bushels of soybeans were inspected for export 
last week compared with 266 million a year ago 
anne frick senior oilseed analyst with prudentialbache 
securities inc said the report was another indication of slack 
foreign demand for soybeans 
the soybean harvest estimate in thursdays usda crop report is 
widely expected to exceed last months projection of 182 billion 
bushels analysts said 
frick said she expects the usda to peg the soybean crop at 1835 
billion bushels karlin said hes looking for 185 billion and 
sparks commodities inc a memphisbased analytical firm estimated 
1990 us soybean production at 19 billion bushels

exchange following a report that saudi arabian crude oil output has 
reached 82 million barrels per day its highest level in 10 years 
oil traders said realization is growing that global demand has 
declined and supplies remain adequate despite the persian gulf 
crisis

a state bank official on monday added his voice to 
the growing criticism of mikhail s gorbachevs plan for the switch 
to a market economy warning it could hurt overall reforms 
the criticism followed gloomy predictions from two of the soviet 
presidents economic advisers who warned that the plan could spark 
hyperinflation and cut the standard of living 
oleg mozhaisky head of the banks hardcurrency department 
told a news conference that recent gorbachev decrees expanding the 
use of hard currency were misguided 
referring to the use of dollars in the soviet economy mozhaisky 
said dollarization wouldnt bring us closer to the goals of 
perestroika but would worsen the state of the ruble and could make 
those goals more distant 
gorbachevs compromise program for restructuring the economy was 
adopted oct 19 by the soviet legislature it is already under 
sharp attack in many of the 15 republics 
gorbachevs own advisers have expressed doubts that it will 
succeed 
the economic advisers nikolai petrakov and stanislav shatalin 
said in a letter to a liberal newspaper that gorbachevs plan will 
increase the budget deficit and disrupt economic links among the 15 
soviet republics the soviet union has a deficit of 60 billion 
rubles or about 96 billion 
the decrease in the standard of living of the population will 
be significant before stabilization the inflationary spiral is 
winding up too quickly the collapse of the consumer market is 
growing and the economy is moving further from a state of 
equilibrium the economists said in the letter published sunday 
in komsomolskaya pravda 
the letter signed by 11 other economists accused the soviet 
leadership of indecisiveness and inconsistency in economic 
reform 
the statement was a rare public airing of differences between 
gorbachev and his aides 
shatalin a member of gorbachevs presidential council an 
advisory body had written a plan to switch to a market system in 
500 days gorbachev first supported it then backed off 
immediately after the gorbachev plan was adopted shatalin said 
he supported it generally since then he had refrained from public 
comment 
the criticism was particularly striking coming from petrakov 
gorbachevs usually loyal personal economic adviser 
mozhaisky told reporters he had not read the letter 
he expressed general support for gorbachevs economic reforms 
but took issue with two decrees one creating an auction among 
soviet businesses for the foreign currency they hold and the other 
setting up a network of stores selling goods in hard currency or 
currency that can be converted on the world market 
in their criticism the economists appeared to side more with 
russian president boris n yeltsin than gorbachev yeltsin has 
described gorbachevs plan as a catastrophe that will drive up 
prices and the budget deficit and decrease the rubles purchasing 
power 
russia the countrys largest republic voted to go its own way 
and implement shatalins 500day plan on nov 1 the gorbachev plan 
merged that blueprint with a more cautious plan drafted by prime 
minister nikolai ryzhkov 
in their letter the 13 economists also criticized russian 
officials 
they said the russian parliaments decision to raise purchase 
prices and to consider raising pensions will mean that within six 
months the entire population of the republic including 
pensioners will live worse as a result of inflation or 
introduction of rationing 
the 500day plan the economists noted had envisioned delaying 
increases in pensions and prices until the slide of the rubles 
value was arrested 
the economists also said 
the governments plan to raise retail prices by decree and 
compensate lowincome groups is a path to hyperinflation 
the soviet legislatures onemonth delay in adopting a reform 
program leaves less time by the end of this fiscal year for 
reforming the banking system controlling the budget and 
undertaking tax reform meanwhile they said the population is 
losing faith in both the reform and in authorities 
that representatives of republics had agreed to a unified 
economic program but because it was bypassed they are going their 
own way and a unified allunion market is under threat 
that the governments plan to cut the budget deficit by 25 
billion to 30 billion rubles in 1991 is absolutely unrealistic

ibm northern telecom inc and nynex corp on 
monday announced a product that links incoming phone calls at a 
company or organization with computerized information on the 
caller 
the system will make it easier for example for customer 
service representatives at a mailorder house to handle inquiries 
and for publicsafety officials at a college to locate a caller in 
an emergency the companies said 
previously such systems only were available to companies owning 
expensive inhouse phone switching systems 
the new system is aimed at companies and organizations that do 
not have their own private phone system it operates through the 
electronic centraloffice switch of the local phone company 
the systems match the number of an incoming phone call with a 
computer file the file then pops up on a screen using the same 
telephone network technology as residential caller id systems 
that flash the number of an incoming call on a small screen near 
the telephone 
for instance a customers file would appear on a screen at a 
mail order catalog company where that customers has an account 
before the customer service representative even picks up the phone 
syracuse university will become the first phone user to 
participate in a demonstration of the new system which is called 
compucall by northern telecom a canadianbased maker of phone 
company switching gear 
with the system the colleges inhouse emergency phone number 
will be linked to computerized files on the location of every phone 
on campus and nearby emergency exits the information for the 
particular phone will show up on a computer screen as the call is 
answered 
like the caller id system the new phone technology could raise 
concerns about callers privacy caller id systems have been 
criticized because they provide a callers phone number which can 
be used without permission for marketing or other purposes 
american telephone amp telegraph co northern telecoms principal 
north american rival in central phone switches does not offer a 
similar system said joe bellace a merrill lynch amp co analyst 
however he called the system a future product that should 
not have significant earnings impact for the three participating 
companies for some time 
northern telecom said the system only works with international 
business machines corp minicomputers but eventually should be 
expanded to other makes 
ibm earlier this year announced a system called callpath that 
links its minicomputers with incoming phone calls over private 
phone systems made by several companies

swiss franc as traders continued to take a pessimistic view of the 
us economy

analysts said there were no news developments to affect the 
dollar monday the us currency slid on the continued expectation 
that the federal reserve would be forced to move interest rates in 
this country lower to shore up the flagging economy 
market watchers said they expected the dollars decline to 
continue 
theres no reason why the trend should not continue said 
robert ryan corporate foreign exchange manager with bank of new 
york co 
as long as the economy weakens traders are expected to shun the 
dollar like all currencies it is supported by higher interest 
rates and the prospect of lower rates means the dollar cannot 
compete against currencies of nations with higher rates

mark the us currency closed at 14850 german marks down from 
14945 on friday its previous low

the market for socalled multimedia computing 
got a boost monday as intel corp announced new chips that should 
cut the cost of adding video technology to personal computers 
intel says its chips should allow computer makers to offer 
machines that edit and store moving images much like they do text 
for about 1000 more than a regular computer 
while similar technology exists it costs at least 2000 above 
the price of a personal computer intel said 
intel said its technology should spur the growth of multimedia 
or the marriage of television and computing multimedia which has 
yet to take off allows the data text and interactive capabilities 
of computers to be mixed with video stereo sound still 
photographs and animation 
multimedia already is used fornd zeros of 
computer language intels chips for example compress video data 
by a factor of at least 100 to 1 
the images then can be stored on a computers internal hard disk 
or for greater capacity on a compact disk similar to those used 
in home audio systems 
intel says its system is the only one designed for ordinary ibm 
personal computers and compatible models competing systems require 
specialized more costly computers said intel spokeswoman karen 
andring 
intel said its technology also is superior to systems using 
video disk players to incorporate video into computer programs 
since these systems do not convert the video into digital form it 
cannot be manipulated on the computer screen in addition intel 
says its system is cheaper 
with intels system a computer user could connect a vcr to a 
desktop machine and insert sections of a television program or 
movie into a computer program the system allows special video 
effects such as fading zooming and panning 
intels technology originally was developed at the david sarnoff 
research center in princeton nj intel bought the technology from 
general electric co in 1988 and since has been developing it in 
conjunction with ibm 
the technology which intel calls dvi for digital video 
interactive originally took up seven computer boards and cost 
about 22000 in february intel made the same system available on 
two computer boards for 2000 
at a demonstration monday in new york intel announced it had 
shrunk much of the technology to fit onto two fingernailsized 
computer chips for under 100 further enhancements should make the 
chips even more powerful and cheaper intel said 
however the chips only provide the heart of the system so 
other components are needed to actually incorporate mulitimedia 
into computers boosting the price to the expected 1000 level 
among computer and software makers exploring intels technology 
or already offering it are american telephone amp telegraph co 
compaq computer corp microsoft corp lotus development corp 
olivetti of italy and toshiba aiwa and matsushita of japan intel 
said 
in addition picturetel corp a maker of video phones is 
collaborating with intel in research that could slash the price of 
video phones and make the technology common on personal computers 
said norman gaut picturetels chairman

european community agriculture and 
trade ministers late monday suspended talks on a proposal to cut 
farm subsidies until tuesday morning to give time for highlevel 
consultations between ec governments 
officials said several ec heads of state including french 
president francois mitterrand and german chancellor helmut kohl 
were talkin by phone in attempts to arrange a final farm plan 
an ec official who asked not to be named said negotiators were 
treating the tuesday meeting as an unofficial deadline for an 
agreement 
the ministers are working under the threat that failure to reach 
agreement soon could torpedo talks to liberalize world trade 
the issue of farm subsidies is one of the key obstacles to the 
broader trade negotiations the united states and other 
agricultural exporters contend the ec unfairly subsidizes farmers 
enabling them to sell food more cheaply abroad 
officials said italian trade minister renato ruggiero told the 
ministers during mondays meeting that it was crucial they 
agree on cutting subsidies for farmers 
if not the united states would use the ecs failure to do so as 
a reason to abandon the uruguay round talks a fouryear effort of 
more than 100 nations to liberalize world trade the officials 
quoted ruggiero as saying 
those talks are due to end in december 
british agriculture secretary john gummer said if we dont 
find a solution now we will look ridiculous 
the ministers were at odds over a proposal to trim farm 
subsidies on major crops by 30 percent over a period of years 
france and germany have been insisting on guarantees that the 
trims would not seriously hurt their farmers in preparation for 
mondays meeting the european commission the communitys 
executive body devised a list of guarantees designed to allay the 
nations fears but it was not clear whether it would succeed 
logically there ought to be no reason why we cant come to an 
agreement said gummer 
but another community official said i dont see any change i 
dont see any movement the ministers were repeating the same 
position they have held for a month the official said 
france the communitys largest exporter of farm products still 
appeared to have doubts 
ministers from the 12 ec nations failed in six tries last month 
to reach an accord 
ruggiero opened mondays session saying the offer of a 30 
percent cut in subsidies is not minimal but of great value

probursa mexicos third largest stock 
brokerage opened a us office monday with plans to use it to help 
find funding for mexican companies 
probursa said its decision to open the new york office was 
prompted by the increasing privatization of many sectors of the 
mexican economy particularly banking as well as by the surge in 
mexican manufacturing and the possibility that a usmexican free 
trade pact will be reached 
as wall street is feeling the effects of the sluggish united 
states economy leading investors are looking elsewhere to place 
their investment dollars said jose madariaga probursas 
chairman 
increasingly they are turning to the mexican market which is 
no longer depending only on oil exports said madariaga who also 
is chairman of the mexican stock exchange 
the new york office is probursas first outside mexico where it 
operates 25 retail brokerage outlets

sun microsystems inc on monday introduced 
four new workstations that it called faster and more sophisticated 
machines which form the high end of the companys desktop line 
the new sparcstation 2 computers are almost twice as fast as the 
sparcstation 1 models introduced last year sun said they range 
from a 14995 monochromedisplay workstation to a 49985 
colorscreen version offering threedimensional modeling and 
animation 
workstations are highpowered personal computers aimed primarily 
at scientists engineers and others who need great computing 
capacity or highquality graphics 
the addition of the sparcstation 2 line with its great 
graphics simply makes this environment better for technical 
professionals who have real performance needs said scott 
mcnealy president and chief executive officer of the mountain 
viewbased company 
like its predecessor the sparcstation 2 uses the popular unix 
operating system and open look graphical interface and packages the 
electronics in a small pizza box enclosure but while the 
earlier models offered from 8 to 48 megabytes of memory the new 
ones offer 16 to 96 megabytes a megabyte is roughly a million 
characters of information 
the new line also includes a lowcost file server a computer 
that acts as the hub of a network of desktop machines 
the new products are being offered in addition to the 4995 
sparcstation slc and 7995 ipc desktops introduced last year

local and national labor leaders pledged 2 
million monday to help the unions striking the daily news while 
management fought to get the newspaper to readers 
the tabloid has continued to publish since the strike began 
nearly two weeks ago with editors joined by reporters and editors 
from other newspapers union members who have crossed the picket 
line and new hires 
but with editorial and production problems apparently licked the 
job of getting the paper to wouldbe readers remained 
eight unions struck on oct 25 followed the next day by the 
newspaper guild which represents reporters photographers and 
other workers about 2000 people are on strike although some have 
returned in various guild departments 
the unions went on strike over what they termed unfair labor 
practices they had been involved in negotiations since january 
over contracts that expired in march 
the printers stayed on the job to preserve lifetime job 
guarantees negotiated when automation was introduced 
nine other unions representing groups from teamsters to teachers 
agreed monday to cosign a 2 million loan to assist the strikers 
we were very delighted to hear this morning that they were 
going to help us reach a strike fund of 2 million said george 
mcdonald president of the allied printing trades council a 
coalition of 10 unions at the news 
we need it to go out on radio and tv and fight the enemy he 
said 
news spokeswoman lisa robinson has declined to provide printing 
and circulation figures since friday figures provided by the news 
have been widely disputed 
however robinson did say the news has had tremendous success 
getting the paper out hawkers are giving away free papers 
including 50000 on sunday more are to be placed in regional 
malls but she would not disclose where 
were moving toward our normal routine circulation she 
said the news circulation is 109 million on weekdays and 14 
million on sundays it is the third largest metropolitan daily in 
the country 
however news management sources speaking on the condition of 
anonymity said the paper printed 600000 copies of its sunday 
editions 
a source at a rival newspaper also speaking anonymously said 
its circulation people estimated the news distributed 257000 
copies sunday including home delivery that would be down from 
300000 distributed on the first sunday of the strike the source 
said 
since the strike began most of the sports department the 
library staff the features department and the photography staff 
have returned a news official said that about 150 guild members in 
the 350member editorial department have returned including seven 
on monday 
at least two others who went back to work rejoined the strike on 
monday 
violence filled the first few nights near the brooklyn printing 
plant and there have been arsons and misdemeanor charges laid to 
the unions for damage done to newsstands 
mcdonald and other union leaders have denounced violence and 
said they would call upon their members to refrain from it 
theres no violence there mcdonald said monday ive 
talked to a lot of newsdealers about not carrying the daily news 
but thats all i did those arent threats
