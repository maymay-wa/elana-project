about 400 romanianamericans sipped champagne in 
a rally to celebrate the downfall friday of romanian president 
nicolae ceausescu but their joy was tempered by continued 
bloodshed in their homeland 
i have mixed feelings about the overthrow said lumi sava a 
rally organizer its extremely sad that so much innocent blood 
was spilled women and children its a high price for freedom 
buts its worth it 
thousands of civilians have been reported killed in romania 
since the revolt against the last soviet bloc dictator began dec 
15 in the western city of timisoara hundreds more reportedly died 
friday in the uprising that sent ceausescu fleeing from the 
presidential palace 
in new york demonstrators gathered in 12degree cold across the 
street from the romanian mission to the united nations the same 
spot where many of them have held nightly protests against 
ceausescu since the upheaval in their homeland began 
the ralliers sipped champagne from plastic cups waved red blue 
and yellow romanian flags minus the socialist symbol and 
chanted victory victory 
speakers addressed the crowd in romanian and english presenting 
their demands for a completely new romanian government sava called 
on the us government to send emergency medical and food aid to 
romania 
blood is especially needed we have heard that ceausescu 
bombed the blood bank and main hospital in bucharest she said 
sava said the coalition romania 21 would ask the us government 
to seize the assets of the romanian government in this country to 
set up a congressional observation team to report on what happened 
in romania and to bring ceausescu to trial in the un security 
council 
some members of the crowd were able to reach friends and 
relatives in romania by telephone friday 
my mother was crying all she could say was im free 
said horia dugala 26 who spoke with his mother in brasov on 
friday afternoon 
after hours of trying to contact his family by phone radu 
tuian 32 reached a friend in bucharest 
the most important thing was that he could speak freely for 
the first time tuian said after 45 years of darkness they 
came out into the light 
mircea ionescu a playwright who fled his country after his 
works were banned by the ceausescu regime said romanians will be 
able to celebrate christmas openly for the first time since the end 
of world war ii

ionescu editor of the romanianlanguage weekly lumea noastra 
still he added now im proud of being romanian 
a demonstration celebrating the revolt also is planned sunday at 
chicagos city hall an estimated 20000 romanian emigres live in 
the chicago area 
for us this is really the biggest day of our lives said 
rodica perciali director of the romanian folk art museum in 
suburban evanston ill but she too expressed remorse at the loss 
of life in the upheaval 
mrs perciali said romanians had felt ashamed as the rest of 
eastern europe enacted sweeping reforms of their communist 
governments 
we felt guilty and also powerless we almost lost hope to see 
any change in romania she said

a thai airways boeing 747 made an unscheduled 
landing here after two of its three inertial navigation systems 
malfunctioned and the plane flew more than 600 miles off course 
the federal aviation administration said 
the errant flight 741 en route from seattle to tokyo was 
spotted by the anchorage international airport airtraffic control 
center said faa spokesman paul steucke 
he said a controller gave directions to the nearest faa 
navigation aid at st paul island in the bering sea about 800 
miles southwest of anchorage so the captain of the jet could 
establish its location 
after learning that the plane carrying 319 people lacked fuel to 
reach tokyo the controller provided directions to anchorage 
steucke said 
problems with the jetliners inertial navigation systems were 
discovered when faa inspectors checked them after the plane reached 
anchorage he said 
the navigation devices were replaced in anchorage and the plane 
continued on to seattle where passengers transfered to a 
tokyobound flight officials said 
in 1983 korean airlines flight 007 was shot down by a soviet 
warplane after it ranged more than 100 miles off course over the 
siberian island of sakhalin killing all 269 people aboard 
it was speculated at the time that a failure of the planes 
navigation systems might have figured in the course error but a 
federal jury ruled in august that the victims families could 
collect damages for the flight crews willful misconduct

wide discrepancies surfaced in results of 
lyme disease tests last year indicating a crying need for 
standardization to help in diagnosis and research a new study says 
the low agreement among laboratories has many implications for 
the diagnosis of lyme disease and for future research in this 
field researchers say in an article appearing fridays issue of 
the journal of the american medical association finally the 
economic implications are of concern and need to be addressed 
in an accompanying editorial louis magnarelli of the 
connecticut agricultural experiment station in new haven says 
commercial test kits should be evaluated and state or federal 
proficiency testing for laboratories is critically needed 
the study focused on tests performed on new jersey residents 
about 90000 tests for lyme disease were performed last year in the 
state at a cost of 35 million the researchers reported patients 
were charged 35 to 63 
as the test is increasing in use its important to take a 
step back and see how the laboratories are agreeing on those 
tests said the studys lead author dr brian schwartz formerly 
of the university of pennsylvania and now with johns hopkins 
university 
lyme disease named for the connecticut town where it was first 
documented in 1975 can cause rashes headaches and sore muscles 
and if not detected early arthritis and heart irregularities it 
can be treated with antibiotics 
the disease is spread through tiny deer ticks and is most common 
in suburban and rural wooded areas 
according to the centers for disease control 4572 cases of 
lyme disease were reported in 1988 almost double the 2368 in 
1987 the cdc said only nine states all west of the mississippi 
river have not reported lyme disease 
for the study blood specimens from 132 workers of the new 
jersey department of environmental protection were sent to four 
laboratories a state department of health laboratory one large 
commerical lab near philadelphia and two research centers the 
researchers compared results among the four labs and among samples 
sent to the same laboratory 
all participants had at least two tests 105 had at least three 
and 100 had at least four blood samples taken the laboratories 
used one of two common types of tests 
the laboratories had a low to moderate level of agreement 
and the results from different samples sent to the same lab showed 
similar discrepancies according to the study 
the researchers said the discrepancies arose from subjective 
interpretations of results differences in how blood specimens were 
prepared the nonstandardized tests and the unreliability of tests 
adminstered shortly after a person shows the first symptoms of lyme 
disease 
the lack of standardized tests harms not only humans who may be 
infected but impedes research on the disease according to dr 
daniel cohen associated dean of penns veterinary school 
there is a real need for the us government to step in and 
standardize the tests cohen said its very difficult to pass 
judgment on comparing research based on different standards 
the study shows physicians should not rely only on current 
laboratory tests which do not always diagnose the disease in its 
early stages according to magnarelli 
the clinical picture should come first followed by 
laboratory testing for confirmation magnarelli said thursday 
we now have antibody tests of varying sensitivity and 
specificity values and it is not surprising that interlaboratory 
comparisons of test resuls often show poor agreement he wrote 
when one considers the healthcare dollars spent on serological 
testing these discrepancies do not rest well with the medical 
community or the public

a man who died of aids won a posthumous legal 
victory in his fight with a nail salon that refused to give him a 
pedicure 
the state court of appeals on wednesday upheld the 
constitutionality of a west hollywood ordinance that bans 
discrimination against people with acquired immune deficiency 
syndrome 
paul jasperson had sued jessicas nail salon for cancelling his 
july 1986 appointment for a pedicure after he mentioned to a client 
that he had aids 
im just overwhelmed with happiness i spoke at his funeral 
all of us wanted to win this for paul and for the millions of 
people with aids his attorney gloria allred said thursday 
in a march 1988 los angeles county superior court ruling a 
judge found that jasperson was denied service because of his 
illness but refused to issue an injunction 
judge lawrence waddington ruled that the pedicure potentially 
exposed salon workers to aids and the risk though marginal was 
unacceptable 
jasperson 37 died of aids in may but his appeal continued 
on wednesday the threemember second circuit court of appeals 
court ruled 21 to reverse the lower court ruling and enforce the 
ordinance 
the court said the ordinance by preventing discrimination 
serves a public health function by encouraging those with aids to 
make their illness known to providers of personal services who 
then can take precautions 
this case was extremely important because we were seeking to 
enforce the west hollywood city ordinance which had been used as a 
model and copied by many other cities throughout the nation ms 
allred said 
attorneys for santa monica and los angeles which have similar 
ordinances had filed briefs on behalf of jasperson as did the 
city of west hollywood and the american civil liberties union of 
southern california

this final part of a threepart christmas series 
is about the big galilean family of which jesus was a part 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
baffled and sometimes upset by jesus independent streak his 
family tried to curb him even his brothers did not believe 
him the record says but they stuck by him eventually becoming 
pillars of his cause 
a putative aunt sought to curry preferential status for her 
sons supposed cousins but he wouldnt play favorites when still 
a boy of l2 he distressed his elders by quitting them to converse 
with temple scholars 
son why have you treated us so his mother remonstrated 
noting that she and her husband joseph had hunted him for three 
days they did not understand his explanation about being drawn to 
gods house 
the pushandpull of those closest and dearest is a common 
experience in the best of families that sort of pressure rimmed 
jesus life the chafing caring concern of relatives he had many 
in that small closeknit enclave of israel bound together by its 
belief in one god in a pagan world 
relationships near and distant pervaded that tiny insulated 
society it was a hemmedoff connected household especially in 
jesus rural hometown of nazareth in upland galilee 
a prophet is not without honor except in his own country and 
among his own kin and in his own house he said indicating the 
negative reactions of kin to his newly launched ministry 
he marveled because of their disbelief marks gospel notes 
his family must have been aghast when nazareth townspeople 
dragged him angrily from the synagogue after his first sermon about 
liberty for captives and the oppressed and good news to the 
poor 
neighors intended to hurl him from a cliff but stopped at the 
last moment hesitating his gaze burned into them and they shrank 
back opening a path for him he walked away never going home 
again 
he who loves father or mother or son or daughter more than 
me is not worthy of me he said adding that his truth requires 
greater devotion than to parents wife children brothers sisters 
or even to ones own life 
his immediate family included a flock of brothers and 
sisters the record says naming james joses judas and simon 
plus an unspecified number of sisters 
differences exist about their exact relationship because of 
catholic belief in marys perpetual virginity some hold that the 
brothers and sisters were offspring of joseph by a previous 
marriage though this is without biblical support 
it also has been claimed they were cousins in the loose 
terminology of ancient times in any case a batch of them were 
linked in scripture with joseph and mary and obviously shared an 
upbringing with jesus 
scripture in saying jesus was marys firstborn son 
implies she later had others and in saying joseph knew her not 
until she had borne a son implies subsequent marital relations 
whichever it was a big family 
it tried to deter jesus ministry at the outset distressed by 
talk that he was beside himself his family descended on a 
synagogue where he was preaching intending to seize him 
when word reached him that your mother and your brothers are 
outside asking for you the personal pain of it must have torn 
him he lowered his head momentatily then spread his arms wide and 
said 
who are my mother and my brothers his gesture embraced 
everyone here are my mother and my brothers whoever does the 
will of god is my brother and sister and mother 
a poignant interlude it projected jesus work beyond intimate 
bonds to humanity at large but it must have hurt such steps are 
never without pain said the late theologian paul tillich 
noting that the depth of the gap between him and his family 
became acute only with the start of his public ministry tillich 
added 
something unconditional breaks into the conditional relations 
of the natural family and creates a community which is as intimate 
and strong as the family relations and at the same time infinitely 
superior to it 
jesus apparently rich aunt is identified in three of the 
gospels john referring to his mothers sister mark to 
salome and matthew to the mother of the sons of zebedee 
zebedee ran a properous fishing fleet on the sea of galilee and 
two of his sons james and john quit the business to become 
disciples of jesus presumably also cousins salome evidently was 
among wealthy women who supported jesus out of their means 
that james and john were cousins is further indicated when 
jesus on the cross assigned care of his mother to john a family 
responsibility not likely to be placed outside blood ties 
salome was a strongminded practical woman something of a 
firebrand like her sons whom jesus nicknamed sons of thunder 
she also was ambitious and she saw majestic prospects for jesus 
while some relatives doubted his course she felt sure of it 
even though misconstruing his goal as a restored jewish kingdom 
she wanted some key places reserved for family 
she put it bluntly a senior to a younger clan member command 
that these two sons of mine may sit one at your right hand and one 
at your left in your kingdom 
jesus looked fondly at his aunt and slowly shook his head you 
do not know what you are asking it aroused jealousy among his 
apostles he told them his domain would not be run like the roman 
occupation by force and domination 
impatience also was registered by jesus brothers his 
growing impact in rural galilee impressed them john 7 notes and 
they proposed he go to jerusalem for a coming festival to establish 
himself at the heart of judaism if he could 
leave here and go to judea they urged suggesting somewhat 
skeptically that if his works were genuine he could gain greater 
fame for no man works in secret if he seeks to be known openly 
if you do these things show yourself to the world 
he looked at them affectionately reading their doubts my 
time has not yet come but your time is always here go to the 
feast yourselves 
later however he went curious crowds besieged him leading to 
his crucifixion by roman authorities and his resurrection 
that event transformed his brothers binding them to him in 
unwavering loyalty the oldest brother called james the just 
became head of the church in jerusalem his leadership ranked above 
the 12 apostles 
he presided over the churchs first council which widened doors 
of the new faith beyond jews to gentiles to all the world many 
scholars ascribe to him the biblical epistle of james with its call 
to apply jesus teachings in deeds 
be doers of the word he wrote faith if it has no works 
is dead 
after james was slain in rising revolutionary tides of the early 
ad 60s church historian eusebius says another brother of jesus 
simon took over church leadership in jerusalem 
initially unresponsive relatives became mainstays of the 
worldgirdling faith jesus started however he says the principle 
relationship extends beyond blood to all believers 
i am the vine he said you are the branches

from the bluecollar housing projects 
of cockney east london to the gardens of the gentry grown men scan 
the skies for hours most weekends waiting for their pigeons to 
race home 
they rhapsodize about pigeon racing the sport known as the 
fancy and now one of britains more popular pastimes 
all you see is a pinprick in the sky said maj edward 
camilleri they fly toward you and you hope its yours then they 
fold their wings they drop out of the sky they literally do they 
come straight down like bullets 
says bernie bennett who has 60 pigeons unless youre a 
pigeon fancier you just find it very hard to understand to see a 
person out in the garden like me yesterday bucketing down with 
rain looking for pigeons to come from 100 miles 
with pigeons i find one thing and one thing only youre the 
jury youre the prosecution you are the judge all that happens 
down in your backyard is down to you 
camilleri a retired soldier who runs the royal pigeon racing 
association estimates britain has more than 200000 pigeon 
breeders and racers among its 56 million people 
nearly 2 million pigeons many with meticulously documented 
pedigrees dating back several avian generations are registered 
with camilleris association alone 
the sport has an honorable history the ancient egyptians kept 
pigeons hannibal took them over the alps they served in both 
world wars carrying messages for the allied intelligence forces in 
europe thirtyone pigeons were awarded the dickens medal the 
animal victoria cross in world war ii 
in britain pigeons were traditionally associated with 
beerdrinking clothcapped men but it has moved upmarket in 
recent years attracting lawyers actors and titans of industry at 
the top end of the scale queen elizabeth ii maintains a pigeon 
loft 
britains largest pigeon breeder louella pigeon world is a 
hightech enterprise that paid a world record 77000 pounds 
120120 in 1988 for the racing pigeon emerald ii 
that pound for pound makes it more valuable than the derby 
winner camilleri said referring to britains most prestigious 
horse race 
emerald ii is moved from one secret location to another because 
with the large sums sometimes at stake in bets and prize money 
sabotage and pigeonnapping are not unheard of 
however high prices dont always guarantee success camilleri 
said and a good racing pigeon can start as low as 20 pounds 32 
stockmanship comes into it knowing and understanding 
pigeons he explained they all have their individual 
characters and what youve got to do is understand their character 
well enough and encourage them to come home quicker than the next 
pigeon 
no one knows exactly how pigeons they find their way home after 
being released sometimes hundreds of miles away 
the sun is definitely one factor and magnetic field is 
definitely a second camilleri said research in europe indicates 
the sense of smell also may help 
theres also a very basic urge 
most pigeons in britain are kept on the widowhood system as 
soon as a hen and cock produce a pair of young or squeakers 
theyre separated only the males are raced and the only time they 
get to see their hens is when they return to the loft at the end of 
a race 
each fanciers loft is registered and the distance between it 
and any of the 200 official british liberation sites measured 
to the nearest yard 
pigeons are bundled into baskets sometimes the night before a 
race and taken to the liberation site in airconditioned trucks 
each wears a rubber band about the size of a wedding ring on its 
leg with the details of where it came from 
the pigeons are all released at the same time they ascend 
rapidly quickly become oriented and head for home 
when they land the fancier removes the rubber band and puts it 
in a timeclock that is sealed and taken to the local racing club 
the flight distance is divided by the time it took to determine who 
won the race 
what is it about pigeons that engenders such passion and loyalty 
the fascination about it you get a few pigeons you start 
winning races and from then on its a lot like horse racing only 
cheaper camilleri said 
you can pit your wits against nature

it would seem at first glance that lille 
berger has much to be thankful for this christmas 
an amnesty for political prisoners has freed her younger son 
and the parting of the berlin wall has brought home the older one 
she feared shed never see after his escape to the west in july 
like many east germans mrs berger is grateful for the first 
fruits of reform that have eased a life of torment and allowed a 
holiday reunion of her family 
but the division of germany now runs through her heart with one 
son lost to a new life in hamburg and the other committed to the 
revolt for change at home 
i have nothing to be happy about this christmas said mrs 
berger whose lined face and redrimmed eyes testify to 53 years of 
hardship and worry for me this year has been like 1945 
everything in my life has been ruined 
despite the heartening hurtle toward democracy that has 
engendered new hope for a united berlin an atmosphere of anxiety 
pervades both sides of the city deeply scarred by four decades of 
division 
christmas and the approaching new year are a time for 
reflection and burdened and preoccupied berliners this year are 
counting mixed blessing 
a glittering consumer wonderland has danced before the eyes of 
millions now free to travel west to see what they cannot yet have 
champagne celebrations and the euphoric street party that 
erupted when the wall fell on nov 9 have given way to west berlin 
resentment of the daily invasions of frustrated consumers 
my daughter is a physician who earns a good salary and has 
everything our life has to offer but she says she feels like a 
secondclass citizen when she comes here said maria schwage 74 
of dresden who was shopping with her grandson at west berlins 
famed kadewe department store 
as a pensioner i was able to travel before the reforms and i 
must say the atmosphere is now very different she said 
no east german visitor can miss the discouraging glance of the 
redhaired hostess passing out christmas cake nibbles as inducement 
to buy gourmet baumkuchen for 17 a fortune in the eyes of 
most east germans 
cheap goods like 5 umbrellas and fake gold necklaces have been 
relegated to sidewalk sales bins encouraging the crowds of 
cashshort east germans to do their window shopping outside 
little remains for the holiday season of west berliners spirit 
of sharing that choked millions with emotion seven weeks ago when 
stalinist bounds were broken by the forces for freedom 
there is a lot of dissatisfaction over the hectic nature of 
this christmas said ziegfried kasper a west berlin cab driver 
born in a far corner of the former german empire in what is now 
soviet russia 
as an immigrant myself i feel empathy for those coming 
over kasper added but this is not the kind of reunification 
many people expected 
east and west berlin have been released from forced division 
but their differences remain apparent and will take years to 
overcome 
west berlin is awash in light and bustle its neonflanked 
shopping boulevards strewn with fresh evergreens its light 
standards beribboned in red gold and green 
handmade ornaments are hawked from rustic wooden booths at the 
central christmas market and an aroma of plenty fills the damp 
cold air pungent with hotspiced wine and sizzling sausages 
along east berlins karl marx allee a monotony of white lights 
illuminates the grime of the coaldusted city that is ominously 
quiet in the last days before christmas 
poorly stocked stores are being spurned this year by a people 
set free on the west and political turmoil has cast a shadow of 
uncertainty over the very survival of the east german nation 
what i feel mostly is fear said ursula engel a 
welltraveled researcher for leipzigs institute for foreign 
studies no one knows where we are going yet we are racing ahead 
with all speed 
with the breaching of the wall a bitterness has been loosed 
among many of the middleaged who have sacrificed their prime 
years to a socialist system now being swept into the scrapheap of 
history 
no one can give me my life back said gabriela kleiner 42 
a translator of russian novels who expects little improvement 
during her lifetime we have hope for the future but this will 
be enjoyed only by our children and grandchildren 
hope tempered by uncertainty rides higher with the very young 
who have time on their side in the long struggle for prosperity 
and the elderly who have lived through the nazi period and 40 years 
of socialism have little fear of what democracy could have in store 
for them 
sylvia deutschmann 26 a file clerk and mother of two hasnt 
spent much time thinking about the consequences of the reform 
movement dominating east german politics and the media 
were all hopeful that conditions will change for the 
better she said perusing the slim pickings of her neighborhood 
grocers at a grimy corner on krausnickstrasse but for now life 
goes on as normal i still have to get the kids fed and to bed each 
night 
like many young east berliners the deutschmanns have made their 
prechristmas trek to west berlin to collect the 55 per person of 
welcome money from the west german government 
the radio and leather fashions bought with the handout may make 
their holiday a little brighter but the drudgery of making ends 
meet on small incomes in a ravaged economy will confront them with

suffered for 40 years said kostina hoeft an east berlin

in cardboard boxes and carefully sealed 
envelopes leibl koniuchowsky carried with him tales of the 
holocaust for more than four decades 
the files which meticulously document civilian nazi 
collaboration through eyewitness testimony were known only to a 
few yiddishspeaking scholars and researchers as publishers 
rejected koniuchowskys queries over the years 
but his recent decision to donate the records to a holocaust 
archives in israel has given nazi hunters new leads on war crime 
suspects and drawn attention to the civilian role in the mass 
killings of european jews during world war ii 
the nazis signed the death papers but the common people who 
pulled the triggers are the greater murderers the 80yearold 
koniuchowsky said in an interview wednesday at his home west of 
fort lauderdale 
its something different to aim the gun and look into the eyes 
of someone about to die said koniuchowsky who lived in the 
lithuanian city of kovno 
his records are now at jerusalems yad vashem memorial which is 
documenting the slayings of an estimated 6 million jews by nazi 
germany 
koniuchowsky keeps a silver medal from yad vashem in its wood 
and velvet case english translations of some of his records are 
stored under a bookshelf in his condominium 
nearby a photograph shows a 19yearold koniuchowsky standing 
behind his parents who died in one of the killings of jews across 
lithuania 
why i survived is just a miracle he said long ago i 
stopped looking for answers 
the baltic states were annexed into the soviet union under the 
secret molotovribbentrop treaty of 1939 following the war 
koniuchowsky a civil engineer took a government job traveling the 
lithuanian countryside looking for salvageable machinery 
he began to keep a diary of his conversations with jews in the 
villages he would transcribe their descriptions of the executions 
and record names of civilians the witnesses said had participated 
handdrawn maps and photographs of the mass grave sites were made 
each page was signed by the person who was interviewed 
lithuania a center of jewish culture in eastern europe had a 
jewish population of nearly 15 million at the turn of the century 
about 26000 were left after world war ii according to yad vashem 
records more than 200000 jews are believed to have been killed by 
the nazis in lithuania 
some places there were only one or two jews left said 
koniuchowsky their stories would have died with them if someone 
didnt listen 
koniuchowsky quit his job and spent four years traveling through 
villages and refugee camps collecting stories from jewish survivors 
in poland germany and austria 
the testimony of 153 jews was gathered in nearly 1700 pages 
written in yiddish the records included the names of about 1300 
alleged nazi collaborators and sympathizers 
koniuchowsky emigrated to new york in 1951 then moved to israel 
in the mid1970s he returned to the united states following a 1983 
heart attack 
koniuchowskys files are significant because few records exist 
of jewish killings in the small villages said efraim zuroff 
director of the jerusalem office of the los angelesbased simon 
wiesenthal center which compiles records of the holocaust and 
assists in tracking down suspected war criminals 
based on our past experience this can lead us to numerous nazi 
war criminals now living in the united states canada australia 
and the united kingdom zuroff said tuesday in israel 
zuroff said the center will add names from koniuchowskys 
records to the list of soughtafter war criminals 
after the war everyone wanted to get the big guys the top 
nazis said koniuchowsky but i know that the real criminals 
mostly got away the people who did the killing walked away 
john loftus an author and former justice department war 
criminal prosecutor said the cvilian role in nazi atrocities has 
never been fully examined loftuss 1982 book the belarus 
secret chronicles the paths to the west taken by those involved 
in the massacre of nearly 40000 jews in the belorussian section of 
eastern europe 
for every known war criminal there are many others who 
committed horrible acts but were simply passed over because no one 
was there to tell the story said loftus from his st petersburg 
home 
koniuchowsky says he doesnt seek revenge he decribes himself 
only as a messenger with a sad tale 
i did what i did because it was an order it was an order 
directly from those who were being taken to die he said they 
would look back and shout please remember us please dont 
forget

candles flickered in the bitter cold 
of a scottish winter night lit by stillgrieving american 
relatives to remember the 270 people killed one year ago in the 
bombing of pan am flight 103 
the candle lanterns provided by an albany ny couple whose 
only daughter died in the terrorist attack cast a soft 
illumination over a granite memorial bearing the names of each 
victim 
its a beautiful memorial said paul hudson an attorney who 
heads the american relatives support group pan am flight 
103lockerbie 
i think most of us will be back here many times 
later thursday many of the more than 20 americans who crossed 
the atlantic attended a memorial service at the small stone 
tundergarth church three miles outside town near where the planes 
blueandwhite nose cone smashed down 
the rev cameron gibson called the bombing an act of 
indescribable evil and wickedness and read the biblical passage 
vengeance is mine saith the lord 
the service concluded just about the time the boeing 747 
exploded last year and some relatives made short pilgrimages to 
the surrounding farms and fields where 90 bodies were recovered 
flight 103 bound for new york and detroit exploded in midair 
at approximately 703 pm on the wednesday before christmas last 
year killing all 259 people on board and 11 on the ground 
police say a bomb made of plastic explosives was concealed in a 
radiocassette recorder in a suitcase loaded into a forward cargo 
hold 
the dedication of the memorial by local clergymen began poignant 
and somber commemorations that culminated in an outdoor ecumenical 
service in lockerbies town square no formal invitations were 
issued but us ambassador henry catto was present and queen 
elizabeth ii sent a representative 
the lanterns waxcoated paper bags filled with sand containing 
a candle and each inscribed with the name of one of the victims and 
the silhouette of a dove were made for hudson and his wife 
eleanor by students at the albany academy for girls their 
16yearold daughter melina had attended the school 
as darkness fell the lanterns lined both sides of the footpath 
leading to and surrounding the garden of remembrance the memorial 
site carved from the local cemetery 
later outside the town hall a temporary morgue in the days 
following the disaster more than onethird of the towns 3500 
residents gathered to hear the rev patrick keegan say from this 
disaster there is no complete recovery 
quite simply life cannot be the same again it has changed 
we have changed he said 
to say that there is no recovery that things wont get better 
is to say to the terrorists here you can have our lives as 
well 
many of the american relatives wore simple blueandwhite lapel 
buttons bearing the words pan am 103 the truth must be known 
relatives in the united states and britain have closely 
monitored the police investigation in their campaign to bring the 
bombers to justice and to improve airport security 
police confirm they have investigated the popular front for the 
liberation of palestinegeneral command and are interested in 
mohammed abu talb a member of another radical palestinian faction 
sentenced thursday to life in prison in sweden on unrelated bombing

us sen alan cranston announced thursday 
he has called off his plans to marry a 49yearold woman on 
christmas eve a spokesman for his office said 
the democratic senator under intense scrutiny for his role in 
the lincoln savings amp loan scandal said through a spokesperson 
that the wedding would be unfair to his fiancee cathy lee pattiz 
of beverly hills 
when the press pounced upon us before we filled out the 
marriage license forms it became clear to me that this is not an 
appropriate time to start a marriage and it would not be fair to 
cathy to bring her into the middle of a stressful situation so we 
will not be married on dec 24 cranston said in a prepared 
statement 
cranston 75 surprised associates recently by announcing he 
would marry pattiz at his sisters home in los altos hills the 
marriage would have been the third for cranston whose last 
marriage ended in divorce in may and the first for pattiz an 
illinois native who has known cranton since 1968 
no other details of the decision were immediatley available 
the couple appeared smiling tuesday when they posed for 
photographs while taking out a marriage license in palo alto 
cranston is one of five us senators under fire for accepting 
large contributions from charles keating jr the conservative 
arizona financier who ran lincoln in 1987 the five interceded on 
behalf of keating with a federal regulator involved in probing 
lincoln which declared bankruptcy last april

six years after us troops invaded 
grenada and threw out a marxist junta the tiny caribbean island 
boasts a sturdy democracy but an expected economic bonanza has 
failed to materialize 
the story in grenada has been a very mixed one larry birns 
director of the washingtonbased council on hemispheric affairs 
said in a telephone interview thursday one of the failures is 
that grenada hasnt developed a dependable economy 
it still faces a rather precarious future he said 
just this week grenada the last country invaded by us 
troops before panama demonstrated its commitment to parliamentary 
democracy with a smooth transfer of power after the death of prime 
minister herbert blaize 
blaize 71 the first prime minister elected after the 1983 
intervention died tuesday after a long illness the same day 
deputy prime minister ben jones was sworn in to head an interim 
government and prepare for elections within 90 days in strict 
accordance with the constitution 
but the former british colony of 94000 inhabitants on the 
southern tip of the caribbean chain has been going through a long 
period of political uncertainty and economic difficulty 
this month 7000 public workers staged a crippling oneweek 
general strike after blaize reneged on a promise to pay them 925 
million in back wages saying the government did not have the money 
in 1983 grenada was ruled by a revolutionary regime allied with 
cuba and the soviet union a power struggle within the government 
led to a bloody coup and the firingsquad execution of prime 
minister maurice bishop the radical junta that seized power 
imposed a 24hour curfew 
a force of us marines and paratroopers numbering 7000 at its 
height along with 300 soldiers and policemen from neighboring 
caribbean islands invaded on oct 25 1983 and quickly gained 
control 
the reagan administration already alarmed by bishops soviet 
and cuban ties said the invasion was necessary to protect the 
lives of 480 american medical students and their families on 
grenada and to keep the island from being used as a staging post 
for communist aggression in the region 
despite criticism abroad the invasion was almost universally 
welcomed by grenadians who refer to the operation as a rescue 
mission and observe oct 25 as an annual holiday known as 
thanksgiving day 
since 1983 the united states has pumped more than 110 million 
into grenadas economy with the stated aim of transforming the 
island into a haven for american investment 
but us aid has dropped off sharply in the past few years and 
only a handful of american companies have set up operations on the 
island 
unfortunately foreign and private investment has lagged 
behind optimistic expectations and only recently have we seen 
an increase in new projects said a 1988 report by the grenada 
office of the us agency for international development 
although the economy grew by a respectable 53 percent last 
year grenada remained saddled with a foreign debt of 487 
million a domestic debt of 359 million and a trade deficit of 
596 million by the end of 1988 according to the caribbean 
development bank 
unemployment is officially pegged at around 20 percent and 
among youthful workers is estimated as high as 40 percent 
alcoholism and drug addiction are said to have reached record 
levels 
the lucrative tourism business is growing but business leaders 
complain that americans tend to avoid grenada because of a lack of 
direct flights and the islands lingering image as a war zone 
meanwhile years of factional disputes over blaizes handling of 
the economy and his authoritarian style of leadership have left 
grenadas centrist political parties in disarray 
the disunity raises the prospect of a split in the moderate vote 
in the upcoming election and a possible comeback by sir eric gairy 
the eccentric former prime minister once described by the economist 
magazine of london as a corrupt buffoon gairy was ousted in 
1979 by leftist elements ultimately overthrown by the united states 
if gairy wins we may very well be back to square one birns 
said

lawyers for imelda marcos met with federal 
prosecutors earlier this month to discuss a possible plea bargain 
in the racketeering case against the widow of former philippine 
leader ferdinand marcos an attorney said thursday 
john j tigue a marcos lawyer in new york said a series of 
discussions initiated by the philippine and united states 
governments took place in california over dec 912 
he said the talks were preliminary chitchat nothing came 
of it 
in this sort of case these things happen all the time he 
said 
tigue said mrs marcos defense team was still preparing for her 
scheduled trial march 14 on charges she and her late husband 
siphoned more than 100 million from the philippines treasury and 
funneled it into this country for the purchase of new york real 
estate and art 
according to tigue the proposed plea agreement called for mrs 
marcos to plead guilty to mail fraud and obstruction of justice 
charges in exchange for a suspended prison term 
under the proposal mrs marcos would have to provide a full 
financial disclosure and forfeit hundreds of millions of dollars in 
assets tigue said she also would have to remain on probation in 
the united states as long as the current philippine leader corazon 
aquino was in power 
tigue said the prosecutor assistant us attorney charles 
labella gave mrs marcos until jan 12 to decide whether to accept 
the plea agreement he however dismissed the date as an 
artificial deadline 
the attorney also said any settlement of the criminal charges 
also would have to include several civil racketeering lawsuits 
brought by the philippine and us government against the marcoses 
labella reached in his office in new york said he could not 
comment on the reported plea bargain discussions 
tigue said mrs marcoss attorney in san francisco john j 
bartko was her representative at the talks also present were 
labella and representatives from the philippine government he 
said bartko was not in his office thursday and did not return 
phone calls for comment 
saudi financier adnan khashoggi one of mrs marcoss 
codefendants in the racketeering case said thursday that he also 
was aware that negotiations were taking place with mrs marcoss 
lawyers 
khashoggi who was in court to formalize a change in attorneys 
said he had not had similar discussions he said he was still 
hoping to have the charges against him dismissed 
id like to see an innocent man go free as soon as possible 
said khashoggi who was released on 10 million bail while he 
awaits trial

after days of scouring panama for manuel 
antonio noriega us forces still dont have their quarry but 
they do have a surplus of tips and rumors about the whereabouts of 
the fugitive general thanks largely to the posting of a 1 million 
reward 
the number of calls jamming us military switchboards in panama 
rose sharply on wednesday in response to the white houses 
announcement that the money was available for anyone providing 
information leading to noriegas capture 
we got lots of nibbles a lot of it turned out to be very 
bogus said rear adm ted sheafer an intelligence specialist for 
the joint chiefs of staff 
sheafer said callers reported sighting noriega in at least 12 
locations throughout panama 10 sites in panama city and in three 
foreign countries colombia the dominican republic and mexico 
us officials said however they believed noriega had not left 
the country 
noriegas wanted poster will be in every post office in 
town president bush told reporters jokingly at a white house 
news conference thursday adding that thats 1 million bucks id 
be very happy to sign the check for 
but noriega proved an elusive target for the commando forces and 
intelligence analysts who set their traps for him 
after rumors spread that noriega or other members of the 
panamanian defense forces high command were in the nicaraguan and 
cuban embassies us troops in armored personnel carriers 
surrounded the two missions 
but despite the massive dragnet for noriega aided by a force of 
24000 troops us hopes lay almost solely on reliable 
intelligence information 
were looking for him very hard said lt gen tom kelly 
the pentagons operations chief of course thats all contingent 
on intelligence 
american interrogators questioned hundreds of captured 
panamanian soldiers for clues about noriegas plans said one 
official who asked not to be named 
kelly said american forces were turning on all our looking 
listening and hearing devices to see if we cant pick up noriega 
the man in charge of the panama strike lt gen carl w stiner 
who now commands the 18th airborne corps at fort bragg nc 
formerly headed the us special operations forces which are tasked 
with commandostyle activities 
special forces units reportedly were deployed to look for 
noriega aided by infantry troops of the 7th army which are 
especially trained for urban warfare 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater conceded that finding 
noriega in panama city would be difficult in a city of a million 
people its not hard to hide out he said 
pentagon officials also held out the possibility that us 
troops may have to stalk noriega or his loyalists in panamas 
jungles 
although he is vastly outnumbered by the 24000strong us 
strike force noriega former head of military intelligence and 
paid informer for the cia in the 1970s is hard to outmaneuver 
officials said 
hes a crafty devil as you know said kelly he grew up 
in a very tough academy so hes been used to this for many years 
it was unclear how many forces noriega still has under his 
command although sheafer said we do not think he is effectively 
in command of anything at this time 
bush said he would not be satisfied until noriega was brought to 
justice in the united states and would keep up the search as long 
as it took 
but noriega has vowed to fight to his death and those who know 
him well say he would resist capture at all costs 
said reserve col charles stone who served in panama until 1987 
and often met with noriega i think before hed face that hed 
take his own life

dissent has been rare in romanian 
president nicolae ceausescus realm where a vast secret police 
force and a wide network of informants have traditionally stifled 
public criticism of the bucharest regime 
many of those who have protested ceausescus policies are 
unknown to westerners largely because of the regimes swift 
repression critics have landed in jail or been committed to mental 
hospitals for speaking to the western media or standing up for 
human rights 
leaders of a worker protest by some 10000 people in brasov in 
november 1987 disappeared without trace 
here is a list of some of the most prominent people known to 
have criticized ceausescus policies 
doina cornea 60 a french teacher who lives in the western 
city of cluj is the most prominent dissident she has been 
persecuted repeatedly put under surveillance and house arrest and 
beaten by police for her outspoken support for human and religious 
rights 
cornea has been especially vocal in criticizing a national 
resettlement plan that western human rights activists say could 
destroy village culture and tradition 
laszlo toekes a protestant minister who has championed 
religious rights as well as those of the ethnic hungarian minority 
in transylvania an attempt to arrest him one week ago sparked the 
antigovernment protests in timisoara that have now spread around 
romania 
silviu brucan 73 a former ambassador to the united states 
who early this yeasr joined five other prominent former communists 
in signing a letter to ceausescu criticizing the presidents 
policies and disrespect for the law 
brucan also issued a statement to western media after the 1987 
worker protest in brasov supporting the workers demands for that 
he was placed under house arrest for several months 
the other signatories of the letter to ceausescu were gheorge 
apostel a former politburo member and first deputy premier 
alexandru birladenanu a former politburo member and former 
minister of foreign trade and chief of state planning corneliu 
manescu a former foreign minister and ambassador to france 
constantin pirvulescu one of the founding fathers of the 
romanian communist party who accused ceausescu in 1979 of putting 
personal interests above the interests of the party also signed

in the central committee was purged in 1958 and later 
rehabilitated 
his son mircea raceanu a diplomat in the united states in the 
1970s was arrested in january and charged with espionage his 
arrest was linked in the official media with the letter of the six 
party veterans 
among others harassed for critical stands is poet dan desliu 
who in april sent a letter to ceausescu deploring the lack of human 
rights in his country he was reported on hunger strike in march 
and was later placed in a mental hospital 
writer dan petrescu a resident of the northern university town 
of iasi was arrested for a month before novembers party congress 
in romania after he gave an outspoken interview to radio free 
europe he is now reported again under house arrest in iasi 
mircea dinescu also a poet was fired from his job with the 
literary weekly romania literara for an interview published in the 
french daily liberation in march in which he criticized official 
policies on writers

successes and failures in the war against aids 
show that concern for patients rights is essential if health 
authorities hope to stem the epidemic the director of the world 
health organizations aids program says 
in an interview thursday dr jonathan mann said many of the 
discriminatory laws put in place during the initial panic earlier 
in the 80s have been repealed as governments discovered the laws 
were impeding efforts to fight the diseases spread 
we made a big discovery during the 1980s that ranks right up 
there with the discovery of the virus and the modes of spread 
mann said by telephone from geneva and that discovery is that to 
fight this global epidemic of infectious disease you must also 
fight against prejudice and discrimination 
health officials have been successful in curbing risky sexual 
behavior among homosexual men in san francisco and among female 
prostitutes in nairobi kenya and peru among other places mann 
said 
all of those programs have in common the careful attention 
to developing a supportive social environment that refuses 
discrimination against infected people he said weve realized 
that in order to fight successfully against aids it is vital to 
protect the rights and dignity of people 
mann said that more than 35 countries including the united 
states passed laws in the 1980s restricting immigration by people 
infected with the human immunodeficiency virus hiv that causes 
acquired immune deficiency syndrome 
other countries including the soviet union south korea and 
iraq established mandatory screening for hiv infection some 
including china south africa and chile passed laws that require 
the isolation of people infected with hiv mann said 
in cuba when people were found to be infected they were 
asked to leave their home and their job and go to a renovated 
hospital on the outskirts of havana where they were given a salary 
but were basically kept mann said 
such laws have crippled efforts to block the spread of aids he 
said 
if you knew that being tested for hiv infection could result 
in your having to leave your family lose your job and in every 
other way be separated from society would you be tested 
mann noted that illinois and louisiana recently repealed laws 
requiring aids tests for couples seeking marriage licenses 
concluding that the laws were ineffective and wasteful 
costa rica repealed a law requiring that foreign sailors display 
a certificate showing they were free of aids before they could come 
ashore 
it sounds like good sense superficially to build a wall 
around a country and say everybody who comes into this country has 
to be tested for hiv infection mann said then you get into 
the realities 
in 1987 a group of experts convened by the world health 
organization concluded that hiv screening for international 
travelers would at best and at great cost retard only briefly 
the dissemination of hiv both globally and with respect to any 
particular country 
a virus a disease doesnt respect walls mann said as 
the berlin wall has shown walls dont protect people they 
actually endanger the people within the walls

two us planes late thursday bombed 
a strong pocket of resistance in the capital manned by troops loyal 
to fugitive gen manuel antonio noriega as the second day of the 
american invasion ended 
flares lighted the moonless sky helicopters flew low over parts 
of panama city shining bright lights 
on thursday afternoon hours before the bombing us troops on 
armored personnel carriers shouted over megaphones for residents 
near the tinajitas garrison in the northeastern san miguelito 
neighborhood to evacuate sporadic machinegun fire could be heard 
us soldiers throughout thursday ducked occasional gunfire in 
mopup operations and ringed the nicaraguan and cuban embassies 
with armored personnel carriers in case the elusive noriega was 
inside 
thousands of us servicemen swept into panama city on the 
second day of their huge offensive trying to wipe out diehard 
resisters and hunting for noriega while also searching for missing 
americans believed to be hostages 
president bush pledged in washington thursday that us forces 
would scour panama as long as it takes to capture noriega he 
said the military operation he ordered created stability in panama 
and said its been worth the american lives it cost while 
expressing sorrow over the deaths 
he has ordered a 1 million bounty for the capture of noriega 
who has been charged in the united states with drugrunning and 
moneylaundering 
looters swarmed the streets of panama city like locusts 
thursday thousands from children to grandparents stripped store 
shelves down to bare wood on central avenue 
us soldiers were too busy with snipers and small bands of 
armed noriega loyalists to challenge the looters 
the force in san miguelito was composed of fighters from the 
civilian paramilitary dignity battalions and other noriega 
loyalists 
us armored personnel carriers were seen heading thursday night 
toward san miguelito a large workingclass neighborhood of 340000 
people 
residents said people they believed were panamanian combatants 
were fleeing to more secure areas and the poor were being evacuated 
elsewhere machine guns rattled and explosions boomed near cerro 
patacon hill behind santa maria university close to us army 
communications installations 
pentagon officials said us troops had military control of 
panama city they said most units of noriegas defense forces had 
fled into the jungles and us troops may be ordered in to follow 
them 
they reported 21 americans killed 208 wounded and four missing 
in two days of fighting 
figures for panamanian casualties were hard to come by 
an official in the office of leonardo diaz medical director of 
the santo tomas hospital said the hospital had taken in 80 dead 
and more than 1000 wounded 
we have really lost count of the wounded she said refusing 
to give her name she said many of the wounded were civilians 
coming from areas of fighting near defense forces barracks 
the morgue is now full we have no place to put the dead 
she said 
she added the hospital was running low on medical supplies 
santo tomas is the hospital nearest the bombed and burnedout

women with furs are facing a new threat on the 
streets not muggers but animalrights activists who have adopted 
confrontational tactics in their fight to mothball the fur industry 
women strolling down the street in fur coats report theyve been 
jeered at sprayed with ketchup or red paint even had their coats 
slashed 
were encouraging people to go up to fur wearers and to say 
something to them said dana stuchell national director of 
transspecies unlimited one of the countrys leading animalrights 
groups 
some people are extremely mild some people are more abrasive 
but the point is to let them know how you feel about their fur coat 
and to explain that animals had to suffer and die for it 
transspecies unlimited says it doesnt condone violence 
thats what animal rights are all about nonviolence 
stuchell said 
but the attacks on furwearers and vandalism at some fur stores 
by extremists has begun to raise the hackles of furriers 
there was a feeling a couple of years ago that the thing would 
go away that if we responded to it it would just lend credit to 
the movement said jack neal a spokesman for the fur information 
council of america but its gotten to the point where furriers 
were under such attack that we couldnt ignore it 
the animalrights movement has been growing in recent years 
people for the ethical treatment of animals was started in 
washington by two friends in 1980 it now has 250000 members a 
staff of 70 and a 7 million budget said spokeswoman carol l 
burnett 
transspecies unlimited based in williamsport pa led the 
first national antifur protest in 1985 since then it has 
organized ever larger annual marches the day after thanksgiving 
kickoff day of the holiday shopping season 
this year protests were held in 94 cities including a march 
with more than 3000 people on new yorks fifth avenue led by game 
show host bob barker one fur store in miamis posh coconut grove 
allegedly was vandalized by activists 
on another front aspen colo voters are being asked whether 
their tony ski resort should become the worlds first furfree zone 
the aspen city council voted last month to hold a special 
election in february on banning fur sales within city limits they 
have already banned the use of steeljawed leghold traps and the 
sale of all furs caught in such traps 
instead of aspens being known as a glitzy egocentric kind of 
place i think it can be known as a town thats sensitive to the 
environment and sensitive to the delicate balance between humans 
and wildlife mayor bill stirling said 
the measure could put the citys four furriers out of business 
and drastically change the stock in another 25 to 30 ski accessory 
shops 
the fur industry denies the animalrights movement has had any 
economic impact 
sales of fur items have quintupled since 1972 and retailers say 
they are selling more coats each year but overproduction and 
pricecutting have kept the total sales figure at a flat 18 
billion since 1986 
mink the most popular fur has dropped in price from a recent 
high of 43 a pelt in 1987 to about 26 this year according to 
david bavins marketing director at the seattle fur exchange which 
handles most of the us crop 
new yorkbased fur vault inc announced last month that it is up 
for sale after losing 72 million in the past two fiscal years 
animalrights groups which generally oppose use of animals for 
research food and clothing like to take some credit 
people are starting to change their attitudes about fur 
stuchell said theyre no longer a symbol of status 
although this years fur season is still young early reports 
are that furriers are doing better than last year thanks in part 
to the frigid temperatures in much of the country 
chuck kehoe president of revillon furs which are sold at saks 
fifth avenue and other stores nationwide said business in the 
first three weeks of december was up 12 percent over last year

george bush the most public of presidents is 
surely among the most private of presidents too he meets anyone 
and travels anywhere yet he acts alone surprising the world and 
his own closest advisers 
he is his own secretary of state his own director of central 
intelligence his own china expert his own national security 
adviser 
he is such a product of government the house the republican 
national committee the cia the united nations the embassy in 
beijing the vice presidency that he does not need advice from 
the professionals who surround him he was there first 
george bush is very comfortable with himself says clemson 
university political scientist charles dunn an observer of 
presidents he has a good sense of person of who he is he is 
not awed by the oval office or by the press 
moreover says dunn secrecy has worked for bush he has 
thrived by exceeding at least modestly the level of expectations 
for himself dunn says 
bush says thats the way he is take it or get someone else 
youve got your job he told reporters thursday afternoon 
but i have mine and that is to conduct the foreign policy of 
this country the way i think best if the american people dont 
like it i expect theyll get somebody else to take my job 
bush doesnt like handlers says fred greenstein of 
princeton university hes going to do it his way 
bushs tendency to look inward showed up even before he won 
office 
his most important political decision was the choice of a 
running mate he made the selection of dan quayle by himself and 
kept it to himself 
last june he decided to propose a summit conference to mikhail 
gorbachev in december and kept it under his hat 
he sent brent scowcroft off to china and had it announced at 2 
am on a sunday morning astonishing even the china experts on his 
team 
later it came out that scowcroft made a similar trip in july 
when bush was publicly isolating china for the terror at tiananmen 
square 
when reporters complained thursday that he had misled them bush 
at first fell back on a seeming technicality i said no high 
level exchanges had taken place so please look at it 
carefully he told reporters 
questioned further about his decision to keep the secret he 
said i have an obligation as president to conduct the foreign 
policy of this country the way i see fit 
without asking the cia for advice bush decided in october to 
sit out an attempted coup against panamas gen manuel antonio 
noriega 
then in maximum possible secrecy on sunday afternoon he 
decided to commit armed forces to the biggest us military 
operation since vietnam 
yet this keepasecret president is among the most talkative of 
presidents he conducts so many news conferences that reporters run 
out of questions 
someone who counted up early this month determined that bush had 
held 105 oneonone meetings with presidents prime ministers and 
kings those he hasnt seen hes telephoned if he hasnt he will 
greenstein chairman of princetons politics department says he 
sees another aspect in bush an occasional spasm of 
impulsiveness 
he cites bushs hotdogging at malta his decision to ride a 
cutter through rough seas and his determination to attend a 
hemispheric drug summit in colombia where drug producers have put 
a 30 million price on his head 
other presidents have been secretive and as bush pointed out 
they have to be when planning a military operation the public 
understands 
some secrets are political harry truman called a special 
session of congress from the rostrum of the 1948 democratic 
national convention without telling anyone beforehand lyndon 
johnson astonished his closest advisers by tacking his announcement 
that he would not seek reelection in 1968 to the end of a sunday 
night television speech on vietnam 
bush even while flying to the republican convention in 1988 
didnt tell most of his political advisers that he had chosen a 
littleknown senator as his running mate when he made the 
announcement upon landing jaws dropped 
presidential secrecy can be risky says greenstein but so can 
consultation 
students of decision making say that solitary decisionmakers 
are likely to miss some facet of the problem theyre bound to have 
some blind spots he says 
on the other hand he says likeminded people can become 
isolated locking out of the process all who are likely to 
disagree while reassuring one another of their astuteness 
dunn agrees to this extent presidents who want support when 
their decisions go sour had better confide in advisers in advance 
he cites an adage if you want me with you on the landing 
make sure im with you on the takeoff

agriculture secretary clayton yeutter says the 
private sector should get behind the us negotiating effort to 
gain more freedom in international trade for farm commodities 
negotiations under the uruguay round of the general agreement on 
tariffs and trade are aimed at revamping global trading rules the 
talks in geneva switzerland are scheduled to end a year from now 
at a news conference on thursday yeutter said american farmers 
are closing out one of their best years financially and that 
decisions in congress and geneva will bear heavily on their 
fortunes in the 1990s 
yeutter said it will require an immense amount of effort and a 
strong political commitment on the part of the united states the 
european economic community japan the developing countries and 
others to bring the gatt talks to a close a year from now 
the private sector including farm groups also will be 
important in reaching us objectives during the negotiations he 
said 
they can disagree about tactics if they wish or they can 
disagree about particular nuances of the program yeutter said 
but its important that we have broad support for our fundamental 
objectives 
yeutter said he believes there is broad support for the bush 
administrations gatt proposals but that it is not unanimous 
we have seen some evidence of some undercutting here and there 
by particular groups but well have to try to minimize that of 
course because that simply reduces and weakens our negotiating 
leverage in geneva he said and were going to need all the 
negotiating leverage that we can possibly muster if were going to 
make the progress that we believe is important 
meanwhile yeutter said farm income reached nearrecord levels 
in 1989 agricultural exports have improved and that the farm 
credit situation has eased for both lenders and borrowers 
this will help provide building blocks for new farm legislation 
due next year as well as the gatt talks he said the 1985 farm law 
will expire next year and congress is writing a new bill to 
succeed it 
yeutter was asked if he thought there would be a freer 
international market by 1999 one of the goals sought by us 
negotiators particularly for agricultural products 
my personal assessment is that we have the best chance for 
significant trade liberalization in agriculture that weve 
experienced since the gatt began 40 years ago he replied 
i do believe itll be a freer market 10 years from now than it 
is today and i also believe firmly that that will work to the 
advantage of the american farmer 
the united states at the gatt talks has sought a gradual 
reduction and eventual elimination of all tradedistorting 
subsidies and policies but administration officials have adamantly 
insisted that no us programs would be scrapped unless other 
countries did likewise 
though we may want to make some changes in all of these 
programs in the 1990 farm bill because those may be desirable in 
their own right were not going to unilaterally disarm 
internationally in that legislation yeutter said 
so whether were talking about sugar the wheat program or 
any other program i determined that we not forgo any of our 
negotiating leverage in that 1990 legislative debate he added 
but at the same time i am not prepared to accept the arguments 
of any individual industry to the effect that says all changes in 
the program are offlimits 
yeutter who joined president bushs cabinet last january was 
us trade representative in the reagan administration and has been 
in the thick of uruguay round negotiations since those began sept 
20 1986 in punta del esta uruguay 
while many farm organizations have endorsed all or parts of the 
us plan to overhaul global trade some have reservations about 
free trade and how that might affect specific commodities 
mike dunn legislative director for the national farmers union 
said in an interview that gatt operates in many legitimate areas 
but that free trade raises serious questions 
the bush administration he said has a rather myopic view 
that free trade is a total solution to agricultural woes 
but if free trade ends up hurting us producers then we 
ought not to be pursuing that he said i think we ought to be 
pursuing fair trade 
one of the fears expressed by dunn is that under a global system 
of free trade a country that produces a commodity at the lowest 
cost would have an automatic competitive advantage 
i have serious reservations about the wholesale shipping of 
commodities to other nations simply because they can do it 
cheaper he said 
assurances by yeutter that no us farm program or price support 
structure would be abandoned by gatt negotiators unless all other 
countries did likewise are not good enough dunn said 
when he can come up with positive proof that what theyre 
trying to do would increase the net farm income of individual 
operators family farmers i think we would support it he 
said but thats not the case

the dozens of giggling children lined 
up to see santa claus at the shopping mall fell silent and watched 
intently as 10yearold jeannette johnson climbed into his lap and 
started talking with him 
jeannette and santa used sign language to speak jeannette is 
deaf making bruce partridge one of the few santas to whom she can 
tell her wishes 
with hands fluttering she told him what presents she wanted 
including a guitar if its very loud i can feel it she said 
using his white woolgloved hands santa promised to stop by on 
christmas eve ho ho ho doesnt exactly translate so he 
made the sign for laughter a kind of rotating motion from the 
belly 
this is the third year that partridge a kent county sheriffs 
deputy has put his sign language talents to as st nick 
adults think its such a small thing but its so important 
for kids to believe that santa can sign too partridge said 
deaf kids grow up in a hearing world on the outside looking 
in but they dont want pity they want to participate this is 
one way to show them its ok to be deaf 
partridge 36 began signing about five years ago to communicate 
with deaf relatives and because he occasionally dealt with deaf 
citizens on the job 
now a parttime interpreter at a local school district 
partridge and another grand rapids man began posing as santas for 
an annual potluck dinner for deaf people a few years ago and 
decided that there were other deaf children in the area who might 
like to talk to santa 
while deaf children may miss out on the bell choirs and holiday 
music partridge believes that after seeing santa they go away 
happy that they can have christmas too

american automakers inspired by consumer 
demand for safer cars are trying to regain the competitive edge by 
offering more safety features than imports says the head of a 
private consumer group 
that change is reflected by an increase in the number of 
american cars among the highest rated in the 1990 edition of the 
car book an annual car buying guide said jack gillis exectuive 
director of the center for auto safety and principal author of the 
book 
we are seeing a marked improvement in the overall quality and 
safety of cars being offered to the american consumer said 
gillis in a telephone interview following release of the book 
thursday 
the reason is because more and more consumers are considering 
safety in the purchase of a new car and because the automobile 
represents one of the most potentially dangerous products that we 
will purchase gillis said 
most of the cars tested very well there were very few poor 
performers added gillis explaining crash test information is 
not available for many of the vehicles 
gillis said the government hasnt crash tested them because 
requirements for automatic crash protection standards safety 
belts air bags or other mechanisms are new with 1990 cars 
the guide also rated cars on their performance in five other 
categories fuel economy repair costs warranties insurance 
costs and complaint history 
gillis gave more weight to crash safety than to other rating 
components however since that information was limited gillis 
guide names only automobiles in various size categories that were 
best in the overall rating 
gillis said us carmakers are taking back the competitive 
advantage they lost in the late 1970s when japanese auto 
manufacturers built more safety into their small cars 
now we see the pendulum swing the other way and the us 
carmakers are gaining a strong safety competitve advantage over 
the japanese because of the widespread offering of air bags said 
gillis 
the tenth edition of the guide first produced in 1981 for the 
government but now published as a private venture also offers a 
list of cars which include air bags as a standard or optional 
feature 
the center for auto safety is an nonprofit consumer group 
established in 1970 to improve vehicle quality and highway safety 
the groups book offers a best and worst list of 1990 minivans 
because those vehicles which dont have to meet the same safety 
standards as cars have been crash tested 
the best overall rated 1990 cars and minivans include 13 
american 4 japanese and one german cars 
but he said the distinctions may soon disappear as more cars are 
jointly produced by manufacturers 
according to gillis here are the best overall rated 1990 cars 
by size category 
subcompact toyota corolla mercury tracer volkswagen golf 
pontiac lemans ford escort only the 1989 mercury tracer is 
offered for sale until introduction of the 1991 model 
compact pontiac grand am 2door buick skylark 2door toyota 
camry oldsmobile cutlass calais 2door 
intermediate oldsmobile cutlass ciera oldsmobile cutlass 
supreme buick regal 
large pontiac bonneville mazda 929 cadillac eldorado 
the book lists the best minivans as the plymouth voyager 
mitsubishi van and dodge caravan the worst includes the ford 
aerostar volkswagen vanagon chevrolet astro and toyota van 
a companion guide the used car book names the 30 best and 
worst older autos based on a complaint index devised by gillis the 
index is based on the ratio of the number of complaints received by 
the government from carowners to the number of cars sold 
the government figures show four cars three japanese and one 
american had no complaints 
copies of the car book published harper amp row may be 
obtained at bookstores or by writing to the center for auto safety

the energy department is considering whether 
to modify its nuclear weapons plants in response to a report that 
exposure to lowlevel radiation may carry more cancer risk than 
previously believed 
a national research council committee said in a report this week 
that exposure to lowlevel radiation poses a cancer risk three to 
four times greater than previously thought 
many workers in the 17 major weapons facilities work with 
equipment that emit lowlevel radiation and recent government 
reports on plants in ohio colorado tennessee and texas said 
workers have too little protection from radiation exposure 
on thursday the department released copies of a memorandum from 
energy secretary james d watkins ordering his acting assistant 
secretary for environment safety and health peter n brush to 
assess the implications of the radiation study for the weapons 
program 
your report should include recommended options for modifying 
operations where such changes appear warranted watkins wrote in 
the memo dated wednesday he did not indicate whether he believed 
any changes would be necessary 
watkins asked for an interim report within 90 days and a final 
report by june 30 1990 
the national research council committee used new methods of 
estimating and assessing the health effects of radiation and it 
concluded that a 1980 study by another nrc committee significantly 
underestimated the cancer risk from lowlevel radiation 
the risk for solid tumor cancer is three times greater than the 
earlier estimate and the risk from leukemia is four times greater 
the committee concluded 
and the committee found a much greater danger for mental 
retardation among unborn babies exposed to lowlevel radiation from 
the eighth to 15th weeks after conception its study was based 
partly on the medical history of 76000 survivors of the 1945 
atomic bombings in japan health studies of workers at nuclear 
facilities and the records of patients treated with xrays for 
certain medical conditions 
in a separate report released wednesday another nrc committee 
said past and current releases of radiation from the nuclear 
weapons plants appear to be too low to have caused any significant 
increase in risk to public health it added however that the 
energy department should do more to study the health effects

the discredited communist party 
trying to salvage its image as it prepares for free elections next 
year is moving to purge hardline members linked with repressive 
policies of the past 
ending a twoday extraordinary party congress delegates 
suspended 32 party leaders who are to be investigated for abuse of 
power including former president gustav husak 
they also voted to expel vasil bilak the partys former chief 
of ideology as a representative of forces who initiated the 
invasion by soviet tanks and troops in 1968 that crushed prague 
spring reforms 
the party is trying to win the trust of the people it ruled for 
41 years persecuting its critics 
bilak is viewed by many czechoslovaks as the man most 
responsible for the inviting the soviets to invade in 1968 he 
stepped down from the partys ruling politburo last year and from 
parliaments presidium on dec 12 
during the congress delegates voted in a progressive 
leadership streamlined the partys policymaking central committee 
and adopted an action program that rejected stalinism 
the congress attended by more than 1500 members also 
abolished a hated paramilitary force and apologized for persecuting 
those who disagreed with the party line 
the partys stranglehold on power was broken during four weeks 
of peaceful mass protests that led to the formation on dec 10 of 
the countrys first noncommunist dominated government since 1948 
the monthold revolt forced the resignation of husak who took 
power after the communist leader of the prague spring reform 
movement alexander dubcek was ousted and expelled from the party 
the party on wednesday issued an unprecedented apology to the 
czechoslovak people for the 1968 invasion and to those like 
dubcek who suffered unjustified repression 
husak and the other party leaders were suspended for serious 
political mistakes which will be investigated by a special 
commission set up thursday by the partys new central committee 
others who have had their membership suspended and will be 
investigated include alois indra former parliament chairman who 
resigned last month jan fojtik communist party ideology chief 
until nov 24 ignac janak until recently head of the slovak 
communist party and lubomir strougal a former premier 
former politburo members josef lenart and karel hoffman who 
with indra and bilak are often linked to the warsaw pact invasion 
former foreign minister bohuslav chnoupek who lost the post last 
year and former prague party boss antonin kapek also will be 
investigated 
there is the possiblity that the commission during its work 
could expand the list party spokesman josef hora told reporters 
at a news conference thursday 
results of the investigation which could lead to expulsion from 
party ranks are to be delivered at the regular party congress in 
may 
party spokesman hora said the streamlined 138member central 
committee elected thursday contains a majority of new faces the 
old central committee had 156 members 
the action program adopted by the congress emphasized the 
break with the past and called for the party to become a modern 
political party which will become a party of the democratic 
movement of the european left 
it also called for the rapid elimination of the stalinist 
model of the party and society 
the party began purging undesirable members in late november 
beginning with hardline party leader milos jakes who was replaced 
by karel urbanek 
urbanek lost the post he had held for four weeks on wednesday 
but he was elected thursday to head the control committee 
responsible for overseeing finance and operations 
the allpowerful position of secretarygeneral was divided into 
two posts during the congress which elected two men known for 
their ability to work with the opposition 
former premier ladislav adamec was elected party chairman and 
politburo member vasil mohorita was tapped for first secretary 
delegates voted thursday to disband the despised paramilitary 
peoples militia which had already been disarmed 
meanwhile the interior ministry announced that it was 
dissolving the state secret police and transferring all equipment 
used for wiretapping and bugging from the phone company offices 
where it had been installed by the secret police to the transport 
and telecommunications ministry

scientists delving into one of the 
immune systems deepest mysteries reported today they have 
discovered the genetic trigger that equips the body to hunt down a 
bewildering array of invading germs 
one expert described the discovery as one of the most important 
ever made in the young field of immunology the study of the bodys 
builtin defenses against disease 
researchers from the whitehead institute for biomedical research 
said they found a gene that ceaselessly reshuffles the genetic 
library inside newly made white blood cells this lets the body use 
a limited amount of genetic material or dna to concoct an endless 
assortment of antibodies capable of zeroing in on bacteria and 
viruses that it has never before encountered 
their discovery should improve understanding of how the body 
arms itself against infection while it doesnt immediately open up 
new ways to treat disease it may someday let medicine finetune 
the bodys weapons to improve health 
the gene dubbed the recombination activating gene or rag1 
was discovered by graduate students david g schatz and marjorie 
oettinger they described their work in todays issue of the 
journal cell 
its one of the top 10 or 20 discoveries in the history of 
immunology commented dr michael lieber of stanford university 
it deals with the basic way that our bodies make antibodies in 
the most fundamental sense 
the researchers believe the gene makes all or part of an enzyme 
called recombinase which cuts and splices bits of dna these 
scraps of genetic material are assembled into new genes which in 
turn provide the dangersensing radar for b cells and t cells the 
bodys principal warriers against invading microbes and cancer 
b cells work by secreting uniquely shaped chemicals called 
antibodies occasionally an antibody encounters a microbe with a 
spot on its surface that is a mirror image of the antibody when 
this happens the antibody latches onto this spot known as an 
antigen this marks the invader for destruction by other soldiers 
in the immune system 
t cells attack invaders directly and they look for them with 
uniquely shaped structures on their coats that are known as antigen 
receptors 
the body constantly pumps out b cells and t cells equipped with 
an everchanging assortment of these unique shapes and each unique 
form requires the work of a unique gene the body gets these genes 
by randomly piecing together scattered bits of dna from throughout 
the cells genetic archives 
two years ago dr susumu tonegawa of japan was awarded the 
nobel prize for discovering that this shuffling explains the 
diversity of antibodies 
since then we have learned surprisingly little about how 
the body achieves this rearrangement said nobel laureate david 
baltimore a coauthor of the latest work this is the first step 
toward finding a chemical basis of diversity 
schatz compared the immune system to an automobile factory in 
this analogy rag1 is the assembly line worker who puts together 
the cars engines 
this reaction is the very heart of what makes the immune 
system go he said 
schatz said it may soon be possible to watch and manipulate this 
assembly process in the test tube and someday even in the human 
body one potential though distant application is in replenishing 
the ravages of aids 
the aids virus selectively seeks out and destroys a particular 
variety of blood cell called helper t cells maybe in time we 
will be able to specify the production of these particular cells 
he said replacing those lost to the disease

nearly 27 million elderly people will get 
refund checks in february and april to offset overcharges early 
next year in their medicare health premiums 
the treasury department on thursday announced an unusual 
twostep process in which the government will overcharge the 
elderly on their medicare premiums and then turn around and mail 
out refund checks 
bush administration officials said the process was necessary 
because congress repealed the controversial law providing medicare 
catastrophic health benefits after computers were set up to make 
the deductions 
the treasury plans to issue a refund of 1060 in february to 
cover deductions of 530 in january and february another 1060 
refund will be issued in april to cover march and april deductions 
nearly 27 million social security beneficiaries who have 
medicare premiums deducted directly from their benefit checks will 
be forced to pay an overcharge of 530 a month from january 
through may officials said there was no way to adjust government 
computers quickly enough to halt the withholding of the extra 
premium for catastrophic coverage 
the law providing catastrophic health coverage was intended to 
prevent a serious illness from wiping out the finances of a 
retiree but it sparked a revolt among senior citizens who 
complained that they already had sufficient coverage and did not 
want to pay the higher costs of the new program 
after president bush signed the law repealing catastrophic 
coverage on dec 13 members of congress urged the administration 
to come up with a plan to expedite refunds to retirees arguing 
that a treasuryfavored proposal to make only one lumpsum refund 
late in the spring would penalize retirees on fixed incomes 
i am pleased that millions of medicare beneficiaries will not 
be deprived of money they may urgently need said sen david 
pryor dark and chairman of the senate aging committee five 
dollars and 30 cents can be a lot of money to someone on a fixed 
income 
the financial management service which issues the governments 
checks said it expects to complete the computer reprogramming in 
time for the may social security checks to reflect the correct 
medicare premium 
this twophase plan will provide the most timely service to 
recipients without jeopardizing over a quarterbillion other 
payments including regular social security benefits and tax 
refunds which we make at this peak time of the year 
commissioner wc douglas of the treasurys financial management 
service said in announcing the decision thursday

defense secretary dick cheney said thursday he 
was pleased with the operation of the media pool that accompanied 
the us invasion force to panama despite complaints that 
reporters had been kept away from the action 
i think there was adequate coverage i think our commanders on 
the scene had their priorities straight said cheney noting that 
media executives had called his office demanding that the military 
protect reporters who were not in the pool 
later in the day about 50 more journalists arrived in panama 
with 300 expected by early friday 
lt col james swank a military spokesman said the reporters 
would be allowed to camp out in the officers club restaurant but 
by friday night would be expected to have their own accommodations 
several nonpool photographers were killed or wounded in the 
action and other journalists were taken hostage by forces loyal to 
ousted panamanian strongman manuel antonio noriega 
pentagon spokesman pete williams sitting with cheney in an 
interview with 11 newspaper and wire service journalists 
acknowledged that we wish we could have done a better job getting 
people around on wednesday 
the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff gen colin powell 
also said he was pleased with the operation of he pool especially 
because the news organizations involved had not leaked word of the 
invasion in advance 
i think it worked marvellously powell said noting that it 
had not always gone well on previous occasions the institution was 
created following the secret 1982 invasion of grenada news 
organizations which take part in the pool agree in advance to keep 
its activation a secret 
we did what we promised you we would do and the media in the 
pool did what they promised they would do powell said pool 
members were collected late tuesday night and flown to panama with 
the invasion force 
there never was any concern in my mind it would break security 
and it didnt powell said of the pool 
oddly enough white house spokesman marlin fitzwater earlier 
thursday had charged that a pool participant had divulged their 
participation and departure before they left here he wouldnt 
say what organization had done so 
williams speaking to reporters earlier said his office had 
complained to field commanders because pool members had been 
restricted largely to interviews with us embassy officials during 
most of the first day of the invasion 
he laid the problem to incompetence and said there really 
is no excuse for it 
later he said he was personally responsible for the operation of 
the press pool and was accepting the characterization of 
incompetence for himself rather than for the officers in the field 
theyve been working day and night for five days he said of 
the southern command officers 
williams spoke at the close of a news conference at which top 
military officers also were asked why they had not taken more steps 
to protect us reporters who were not members of the pool from 
being taken hostage at the marriott hotel 
the spokesman and other senior pentagon officials said the first 
objective of the invasion force had been to disperse the panamanian 
defense forces and occupy their base which they said they 
accomplished on wednesday 
the lives of american hostages became a prime concern for us 
forces as the fighting died down williams said there were reports 
of an unknown number of americans being held in three separate 
incidents 
we take them all seriously he said those held were said to 
include jon meyersohn a cbs news television producer 
us troops evacuated 29 americans and 35 foreigners mostly 
panamanians from the marriott hotel in panama city late wednesday 
night but williams said a list of the evacuees was not available 
overall 35000 us citizens live in panama and there are 
americans scattered throughout the city said williams

laboratories that conduct aids tests should 
doublecheck their results and report them clearly to doctors say 
researchers who got incorrect or confusing aids reports from six of 
13 labs 
the researchers also suggested that criteria be developed to 
help labs lessen the number of indeterminate results so they 
can say with more certainty whether a person carries the aids virus 
the report in todays journal of the american medical 
association was based on tests on blood samples sent to 13 labs 
all but two of them in california 
dr abram benenson of the san diego state university school of 
public health said in a telephone interview thursday that 
laboratories frequently return their results to doctors and 
hospitals with so much gibberish on the report that it hides and 
obscures the data 
he and his colleagues urged supplemental tests and standardized 
criteria to ensure positive results 
in the summer 1988 the researchers provided medical facilities 
with specimens that carried the human immunodeficiency virus which 
causes aids 
the hospitals clinics and one doctors office that got them 
were asked to submit the samples to the laboratories they generally 
use for aids tests the laboratories werent told the samples were 
part of a study 
the medical facilities were all in san diego county while some 
of the laboratories were elsewhere in california and in two other 
states 
benenson said that most laboratories first test for the virus 
using an enzyme immunoassay or eia test if that test is 
positive they repeat it 
if the second test is also positive labs often then use another 
test frequently one called the western blot to verify the 
results 
the problem with the western blot test benenson said is that 
it has had inconsistent criteria which made a positive 
determination a matter of interpretation 
of the 13 labs reporting back in the study all reported 
positive results to the eia test on the sample that did in fact 
carry the aids virus 
but at the next stage in which the positive result is verified 
by a second kind of test the labs didnt fare as well the study 
said 
eleven used western blot testing to back up the eia results of 
those five reported the specimen was positive five reported 
indeterminate results and one lab returned the raw results to the 
physician and told him to do his own interpretation the study said 
one of the labs didnt do a confirming test and one used an 
immunofluorescence test to correctly confirm the positive result 
the researchers said some of the labs gave excessive and 
potentially confusing information when reporting back some of 
the language was so confusing it would be difficult for a physician 
to know if the test was positive or negative the authors said 
one lab said a positive result is not diagnostic of aids only 
of possible riskexposure 
so far as we know if you have a positive seriological test 
you have the virus and you are capable of transmitting the 
infection benenson said adding that labs may use obscure 
language to try to be kind and not frighten the patient 
in an accompanying editorial in the journal two doctors at the 
federal centers for disease control in atlanta said they 
enthusiastically endorse the studys recommendations for clear 
concise laboratory results

the nations thrift institutions will continue 
to suffer heavy losses unless the bush administration speeds up its 
savings and loan bailout private analysts contend 
the countrys 2903 sampls including 256 under government 
control lost 38 billion in the julyseptember period down only 
slightly from a record 41 billion in the second quarter the 
office of thrift supervision said thursday 
for the first nine months of 1989 industry red ink totaled 
115 billion on track to top the 134 billion loss for all of 
1988 a postdepression record 
about twothirds of third quarter loss 26 billion came in 
institutions already under government management and earmarked for 
liquidation or sale all but 275 million of the remaining 12 
billion loss occurred at 223 institutions targeted for government 
takeover but still under private management 
i just dont really see any hope of turning around the overall 
profit numbers until we get these insolvent institutions out of 
the market said economist catherine england of the cato 
institute a conservative research organization 
about half of the red ink at governmentcontrolled thrifts 13 
billion was from nonoperating losses mostly from recognizing 
sour loans that had long ago gone bad but the other half was from 
current operations 
the faster we get the depositors paid off and those 
institutions closed the lower the ultimate cost of the cleanup is 
going to be and the sooner well be able to turn around the 
marginal and healthy thrifts ms england said 
only about 35 failed sampls have been dealt with since the aug 9 
enactment of president bushs rescue plan the others are open and 
continue to lose money 
economist edward kane of ohio state university said managers at 
weak but still open institutions have every incentive to take big 
risks in hopes of staving off closure 
when you get desperate people doing desperate things on 
average they tend to lose money he said 
the sampl bailout law provided 50 billion through 1991 to close 
or rescue failed thrifts but many analysts say mounting industry 
losses show that wont be enough 
we still have as much as 20 billion in losses out there that 
havent come to the surface said bert ely a financial 
institutions analyst in alexandria va its like a water 
torture its going to continue quarter after quarter after 
quarter 
ely estimated that third quarter losses would have been about 
16 billion greater if not for what amounts to a continuing 
government subsidy to 220 institutions rescued in 1988 
also as part of the bush plan the government poured 85 
billion into thrifts under its control during the last half of the 
third quarter paying off highcost deposits although that reduced 
costs at those institutions ely said it probably did little to 
blunt total industry losses 
thrift office economist james freund attributed losses at sampls 
outside government control to restructuring taking place in 
response to stricter capital requirements that took effect dec 7 
many institutions must shrink to meet the standards and when 
they sell assets they often are forced to recognized embedded 
losses he said 
nonoperating losses at sampls outside government control were 
19 billion up from 14 billion in the previous quarter 
meanwhile operating profits at the nongovernment thrifts 
slipped from 900 million to 800 million because of the recent 
pattern of interest rates he said shortterm rates paid on 
deposits are almost as high as longterm rates sampls can earn on 
loans 
texas as usual recorded the biggest loss by any state 998 
million however that was an improvement from the 17 billion 
loss a year ago the second biggest loss came in arizona 443 
million followed by california 426 million pennsylvania 322 
million and arkansas 246 million 
twentynine states recorded losses while 21 and the district of 
columbia and puerto rico reported profits the largest profit 24 
million came in washington state 
former thrift office economist james r barth of auburn 
university warned that real estate problems once confined largely 
to the southwest were spreading

the government moved tanks and armored 
cars into positions outside the us embassy thursday after us 
soldiers surrounded the nicaraguan embassy in panama but later 
withdrew them without explanation 
president daniel ortega said earlier thursday that if the us 
government withdraws the armored cars and troops that surround the 
nicaraguan embassy then we will respond in the same way here 
a curfew was in effect in panama city and it was not immediately 
known if the us troops left the nicaraguan and cuban missions 
associated press photographers in managua saw at least seven 
sovietmade t55 tanks three armored personnel carriers and three 
trucks of antiaircraft weapons leave the embassy between 930 and 
1030 pm 1030 and 1130 est 
embassy spokesman lou falino said people at the embassy heard 
the noise of several engines but they could not determine if the 
tanks were withdrawn because it was dark he was contacted at his 
home 
american armored cars part of a us invading force surrounded 
the nicaraguan and cuban embassies in panama city thursday after 
rumors spread that gen manuel antonio noriega was hiding in one of 
the two missions 
we have ordered exactly that the same thing be done here 
around the us embassy as was done in panama city foreign 
minister miguel descoto told a news conference he indicated he 
was holding the united states responsible for the safety of 
nicaraguan diplomats in panama 
reporters in managua saw the sovietmade t55 tanks and armored 
carriers brought in thursday afternoon and parked partially 
hidden behind the us embassy 
each vehicle was manned by a crew of six and armed with a 
machine gun and a light cannon col julio ramos of the army 
general staff personally supervised the deployment shortly after 
midday 
an ap photographer at the scene said at first the armored 
carriers were pointing their machine guns and cannon away from the 
embassy compound but an officer ordered the crews to keep the 
weapons aimed at the mission 
asked for comment ramos said he was acting on higher orders 
for reasons already explained by foreign minister descoto but 
an unidentified officer interviewed live by state radio said 
this is in response for what they are doing to us now in panama 
they have just surrounded our embassy in panama and they 
think we are going to remain here with our arms crossed the 
officer added 
descoto told reporters nicaragua has demanded the immediate 
withdrawal of the invading imperialist us military presence 
around our diplomatic mission in the independent and sovereign 
republic of panama 
as soon as they dismantle their deployment there we are going 
to do the same here so we are going to wait until they become 
reasonable descoto added calling the american encirclment of 
the embassies in panama city an act of intimidation 
he said there were women and children as well as diplomats 
inside the nicaraguan embassy in panama 
sovietmade t55 tanks guns mortars and antiaircraft cannon 
were in place all over managua and in other strategic locations 
around the country early wednesday hours after american troops 
invaded panama to oust and try to capture noriega 
the deposed strongman is wanted in the united states on 
drugtrafficking and moneylaundering charges 
nicaraguan officials said the measures were taken in case the 
united states instigates military action against this country 
for many years sandinista spokesmen have been saying the united 
states intends to invade nicaragua us officials have persistenly 
denied this 
charge daffaires john leonard has been the senior diplomat here 
since ambassador richard melton was expelled july 11 1988 after 
the ruling leftist sandinistas accused him of interfering in 
nicaraguas internal affairs 
relations between the sandinista government and the united 
states have been steadily deteriorating since 1980 about a year 
after the sandinistas came to power when they established military 
ties with cuba and the soviet union

president bush says the united states will 
hunt for deposed dictator manuel antonio noriega for as long as 
it takes to bring him to justice at the same time thousands of 
us troops settle in on panamanian soil to help restore order in a 
chaotic country 
this operation is not over but its pretty well wrapped up 
bush said thursday at a news conference that coincided with return 
of the first bodies of us soldiers killed in the massive strike 
in panama 
general noriega is no longer in power he no longer commands 
the instruments of government or the forces of repression that hes 
used for so long to brutalize the panamanian people bush said 
at the same time the president said the us military operation 
was openended as far as going after noriega openended as far 
as restoration of order in panama where looters were hauling 
away goods from virtually every shop in panama city defense 
secretary dick cheney said a sizeable troop presence would remain 
until a condition of normalcy had returned 
the pentagon said 21 troops were killed in the first two days of 
battle 208 were wounded and one was missing american military 
aircraft were bringing the bodies of the dead back to dover air 
force base in delaware their coffins draped with american flags 
bush cheney and other key administration officials hastened to 
claim success for the military strike force at the same time the 
united states came under criticism from latin american nations for 
its armed intervention the organization of american states held 
backstage meetings on a resolution condemning the action and peru 
withdrew its ambassador from washington 
usbacked panamanian president guillermo endara in a 
telephone interview from panama city with abcs nightline said 
thursday night he hoped to organize a new police force to take over 
from the us military within a month 
some congressmen called for the troops to be brought home 
quickly though one rep les aspin chairman of the house armed 
services committee said some might have to remain as policemen 
until christmas eve a year from now 
said white house press secretary marlin fitzwater we 
certainly arent willing to give a timetable to it but everyone 
recognizes this is not going to be a case of going in wednesday and 
coming out thursday 
the president readied a formal report today for congress 
justifying his use of military force as envisioned under the war 
powers act 
asked at his white house news conference whether the potential 
capture of noriega was worth the cost in american lives bush 
replied 
no way can you do an operation this large and not have 
american casualties every human life is precious and yet i have 
to answer yes it has been worth it 
military casualties he said are a burden which a nation must 
endure and all presidents have to face up to but which we can 
never accept 
us officials said 59 panamanian soldiers were killed and 66 
wounded army lt gen tom kelly said us troops had taken 1500 
prisoners most of them regulars from the panamanian defense force 
an american civilian candy helin 43 was killed by stray fire 
from the panamanian defense forces officials said 
speaking a day after ordering 9500 fighting men into panama to 
join more than 13000 already stationed there bush said that 
helping provide a stable environment for endaras government helps 
ensure the integrity of the panama canal 
at one point he used the word invade to refer to the us 
operation in panama but caught himself and changed it to send in 
those troops down into panama 
bush said that with noriega on the run and endara in office 
the government is beginning to function and the man noriega 
controls no forces and hes out but yes i wont be satisfied 
until we see him come to justice 
meanwhile fitzwater said bush still anticipates attending a 
feb 15 drug summit with latin american leaders in cartagena 
colombia even though perus president alan garcia pulled his 
ambassador from washington in protest of the panamanian 
intervention and called for postponing the summit 
noriega is under indictment in the united states on 
drugsmuggling charges and the president has offered a 1 million 
bounty for him 
his picture will be in every post office in town said the 
president hes a fugitive drug dealer and we want to see him 
brought to justice and if that helps if theres some incentive 
for some panamanian to turn him in thats a million bucks that i 
would be very happy to sign the check for 
the president acknowledged he had changed course from october 
when he was criticized for not supporting or joining the effort by 
panamanian officers to overthrow noriega 
i think what changed my mind was the death of the marine 
brutalizing really obscene torture of the navy lieutenant and the 
threat of sexual abuse and the terror inflicted on that navy 
lieutenants wife the declaration of war by noriega he said

the us military in panama opened the doors 
to about 350 journalists today after two days of controversy about 
restrictions put on the small pool of reporters who accompanied the 
original troops 
some 50 newsmen and women arrived by charter plane late thursday 
from costa rica and the us southern command based in panama 
was bracing for the arrival early today of a jumbo jet carrying up 
to 300 more 
a special media pool in its most significant test since the 
concept was created was activated tuesday night and flown from 
washington to panama however military officers on wednesday kept 
the journalists from actually covering any hostilities 
military commanders in panama are doing their best to protect 
members of the media covering the us military action in that 
country defense secretary dick cheney said 
asked about the problem white house spokesman marlin fitzwater 
had a complaint of his own claiming that a news organization had 
broken pool security he would not name the organization 
we were greatly disturbed that one of the major organizations 
had divulged their participation and departure before they left 
here fitzwater said 
it does call into question the integrity of the pool and the 
commitments made he said 
news organizations which take part in the pool agree in advance 
to keep its activation a secret tuesday night the pool was 
activated about six hours before the military assault was announced 
publicly 
military officials in panama said thursday they would let the 
new wave of reporters camp in the officers club restaurant 
initially but expected them to have their own accommodations by 
friday 
fitzwaters complaint about security was not echoed by the 
chairman of the joint chiefs of staff gen colin powell 
i think it worked marvelously the other evening he said 
we did what we promised you we would do and the media in the 
pool did what they promised they would do he said pool members 
gathered late tuesday night and were flown to panama with the 
invasion force under a promise of secrecy 
there never was any concern in my mind it would break security 
and it didnt said powell 
pentagon spokesman pete williams sitting with cheney in an 
interview with newspaper and wire service reporters acknowledged 
that we wish we could have done a better job getting people 
around on wednesday 
i think there was adequate coverage i think our commanders on 
the scene had their priorities straight said cheney noting that 
media executives had called his office demanding that the military 
protect reporters who were not in the pool 
a photographer who was not in the pool was killed and other 
journalists were taken hostage by forces loyal to ousted panamanian 
gen manuel antonio noriega 
before the joint cheneypowell interview williams was asked why 
pool members had been restricted largely to interviews with us 
embassy officials during most of the first day of the invasion he 
responded incompetence there really is no excuse for it

gen manuel antonio noriega kept 
extravagant quarters on the military base shared by the united 
states and panama said us soldiers thursday who toured and 
helped secure the building noriega used 
the structure known as building 8 at fort amador contained a 
cache of automatic weapons a private movie theater and a poster of 
adolf hitler on the wall in noriegas library the soldiers said 
until the us invasion early wednesday morning the base was a 
joint installation under terms of the panama canal treaty 
they have all our military manuals because we were allies 
said sgt first class joseph torregrossa who looked over the 
noriega quarters thursday 
torregrossa said the dea report discovered was a 198687 
hardcover book that read the battle against drugs in panama 
torregrossa said he found nightvision goggles in noriegas 
offices and fullyautomatic weapons topoftheline items like 
israeli uzis in all about 250 weapons including small 
derringers were discovered he said 
soldiers said noriegas quarters in the upper two floors of the 
building 8 contained plush carpeting a fancy dining room and a 
movie theater there are no windows where noriega spent his time 
one soldier said 
this is what freaked me out said another soldier identified 
only as sandridge underneath his glass coffee table he had a 
ceramic leopard 
sandridge said there was a row of noriega bats and baseball caps 
on a shelf and a box of havana cigars wrapped in paper printed 
with the words manuel antonio noriega 4 stars 
originally reporters were to be taken to a socalled witch 
house that is owned or was frequented by noriega 
according to folklore the house contains entrails and vats of 
blood but after being diverted to the army base to get clearance 
to view the house reporters were told a boobytrap had been 
found inside and the house was not yet open to visits

the losing candidate gained only 113 votes 
in a recount that certified the victory of democrat l douglas 
wilder as the first elected black governor in the nations history 
the recount conducted at republican j marshall colemans 
request was certified thursday by a threejudge panel 
while accepting the results the coleman camp claimed the tally 
uncovered evidence that thousands of felons voted illegally 
indicating a need for election law reform 
the recount conducted wednesday found that wilder defeated 
coleman 896936 votes to 890195 votes the difference was 6741 
votes making the gubernatorial race the closest in virginia 
history the tally certified by the state board of elections on 
nov 27 showed wilder winning by 6854 votes 
coleman issued a statement conceding that the outcome of this 
hardfought contest is no longer in doubt 
as an individual and as the nominee of my party i cannot deny 
that it hurts to come so close and yet fall short coleman said 
but the system has worked the people have spoken and doug 
wilder deserves and will have my full support as our new governor 
wilder who has said all along that the election would withstand 
colemans challenge repeated that position thursday night 
i never had any doubt about the outcome wilder said in a 
brief written statement 
coleman contended that his investigation of alleged voting 
irregularities found that as many as 4000 felons are registered to 
vote as many as 3000 of them may have voted contended colemans 
attorney william hurd 
clearly that was not enough to change the outcome of this 
election hurd said 
in virginia a citizen is automatically stripped of his right to 
vote upon a felony conviction the right can be restored under 
certain circumstances 
gop legislators likely will introduce legislation to catch 
felons who try to vote coleman said

even though electroshock therapy may have had 
a bad reputation in the past the treatment is safe effective and 
important for a small percentage of mental patients according to a 
new study by the american psychiatric association 
despite its reputation in some circles ect electroconvulsive 
therapy or electroshock is not justified to be known as an unsafe 
procedure dr richard weiner chairman of an apa committee that 
studied the therapy said at a news conference on thursday 
he said that use of ect is controversial because it has had a 
bad reputation in the press and it has had some abuses but in 
the hands of competent doctors electroshock is safe and effective 
about 30000 mental patients receive electroshock therapy 
annually said weiner eighty percent of these patients suffer from 
a profound major depression that has not responded to drugs and he 
said electroshock often represents the only way to put the illness 
into a remission that would allow the use of other therapies 
i think in the elderly it is considered the safest treatment 
available particularly for depression weiner said 
dr herbert pardes president of apa and a former director of 
the national institute of mental health called ect a safe and 
very effective treatment for certain severe mental illnesses 
ects effectiveness in rescuing severely ill patients is 
well accepted by psychiatrists by the rest of the medical 
community and by thousands of patients who are better because of 
it pardes said 
but he noted the therapy is not a cure and it does have some 
adverse effects such as memory loss in some patients 
weiner an associate professor of psychiatry at duke university 
medical center in durham nc directed an apa taskforce study of 
the use of ect the committee report released thursday proposes 
guidelines for the use of electroshock and details the type of 
training health care workers need to receive before administering 
it 
electroshock in one form or another has been used to treat the 
mentally ill for more than 50 years its popularity with 
psychiatrists has risen and fallen but is enjoying renewed use 
the therapy consists of using electrodes to send small charges 
of electricity through select portions of the brain the shocks 
cause short seizures similar to epileptic convulsions that for 
reasons not understood have a beneficial effect on some patients 
in a typical course of treatment patients receive six to 12 
treatments at the rate of three a week if the therapy puts the 
illness into remission doctors then use other treatment such as 
drugs in an attempt to gain a cure 
despite its renewed use weiner said electroshock will continue 
to be used for only 1 percent to 2 percent of all mental patients 
for the majority of patients with significant depression 
there is an effective drug he said only a very small 
percentage have to go to ect

former president reagan and the judge in john 
poindexters irancontra case appear to be on a collision course 
over the use of the expresidents notes and diaries in court 
us district judge harold greene on thursday gave reagan until 
jan 7 to turn over to the court excerpts from those documents for 
possible use at poindexters trial 
greene said he wants to review material from the expresident 
before deciding whether it should be supplied to poindexter who 
subpoenaed documents reagan may have relating to 67 meetings and 
events fifty of them concern assistance to the contras and 17 
relate to the administrations secret arms sales to iran 
greene said he is moving the start of the trial back a month to 
feb 20 to deal with the subpoena and other issues 
the former national security adviser says reagans documents 
will bear out that the former president authorized activities for 
which poindexter now is charged with crimes 
the court will promptly conduct its review of the 
reagan documents and it will render a decision on the segments 
of the subpoena that will be quashed and the parts of the reagan 
diary notes and notebooks that must be made available for 
poindexters defense said the judge 
lawyers for reagan and the justice department had offered to let 
greene see excerpts from the diary but only if the former 
president and the bush administration were permitted to see a 
proffer poindexter filed spelling out why he believes he needs the 
reagan material 
the judge flatly refused to let them see the proffer now 
it would be going too far to accord to the attorneys for 
president reagan and for the incumbent president a special role 
in the determination whether particular documents must be turned 
over said greene the judge noted their direct interest in the 
outcome of the subpoena dispute and said transferring the courts 
responsibilities to them would be unprecedented 
greene said the justice department and reagan will be permitted 
to see the proffer next month if the judge decides to turn the 
material over to poindexter and reagan invokes executive privilege 
using executive privilege presidents can shield from public 
disclosure documents used in carrying out their constitutional 
duties 
poindexter is accused of conspiracy two counts of obstructing 
congress and two counts of making false statements the charges 
focus on his alleged lies about a november 1985 ciaassisted 
shipment of hawk missiles to iran and denials that north was 
raising money and providing military advice to the contras 
meanwhile irancontra prosecutors say greenes restrictions on 
oliver l norths testimony may make it impossible to use the 
former white house aide as a witness against poindexter 
greene said he would limit norths testimony because it might 
have been tainted by poindexters immunized testimony on capitol 
hill in 1987 
the judges decision rules out use of most of norths testimony 
from his trial in april in which north frequently mentioned his 
former boss 
but the office of the independent counsel lawrence walsh urged 
greene to permit north to testify to all events he currently 
recalls even if his current recollection has been refreshed by 
poindexters immunized testimony 
refreshing his recollection from poindexters congressional 
appearance does not constitute an impermissible use of that 
immunized testimony said prosecutors 
north said last week he doesnt want to testify against 
poindexter 
norths demonstrated unwillingness to answer substantively any 
question posed to him by the government may well preclude 
from calling this witness at all walshs office said in court 
papers

usbacked president guillermo 
endara promising peace and justice in panama is moving to 
establish his government by organizing a new national police force 
and making his first handful of appointments 
under heavy us guard endara and his two vice presidents met 
thursday with members of the national legislative assembly later 
he said he hoped to organize a new police force to take over within 
a month from us military forces now seeking to impose order and 
searching for ousted dictator gen manuel antonio noriega 
i think we can lift up the country and do our duty in 
making peace and quiet in panama peace and justice in panama with 
noriega in hiding endara said in a telephone interview with 
abcs nightline program thursday night 
i hope in a month we can put up a police force a public force 
good enough to keep peace and order in all panama and then the 
us forces would leave according to what mr bush promised us 
endara said 
in washington president bush told reporters on thursday im 
pleased that the endara government is taking charge and they made 
several appointments today starting to govern the country 
endara said he talked to bush by phone and asked him for 
immediate emergency help in food and medicine for those who are 
injured hungry and sick he said he was told aid was coming 
gunshots echoed in the streets outside as endara making his 
first appearance since he was sworn in early wednesday and vice 
presidents ricardo arias calderon and guillermo ford presided over 
the legislative meeting sprinkled through the audience were us 
soldiers who wore jeans sweatshirts and other civilian clothes at 
the request of panamanian officials who sought to avoid the image 
of heavy us control 
in new york endaras designated envoy to the united nations 
eduardo vallarino said if noriega is captured he should not be 
extradited to the united states to face drugsmuggling charges but 
should be tried in panama 
if noriega is apprehended by the authorities in panama he 
will have to be duly charged and tried in panama vallarino said 
but added that the situation was irregular 
speaking to the legislative assembly endara held out an olive 
branch to noriegas followers and said he would welcome back 
members of noriegas defense forces who can show they support our 
democracy 
but he said on abc that in organizing his new police force he 
would rely on officers that were not implicated in any kind of 
corruption officers who were not implicated in any kind of beating 
of the people 
endara asked panamanian exiles to return because the military 
dictatorship has fallen 
endara ordered a curfew expiring this morning in hopes of 
maintaining law and order as thousands of looters roamed the 
streets smashing in windows and hauling away goods from virtually 
every shop in the city 
one of our first problems is that of anarchy and the civil 
order endara told the national assembly i hope these steps 
and others will restore the order that we need he said 
several people attending the session said they were grateful for 
the us intervention 
the united states is responsible for delivering the dream we 
have had since 1968 said cattleman felix espansona an assembly 
member in 19521956 we have had a dictatorship for 20 years and 
now we feel liberated 
vice president ford said it will take some time to restore 
order but us troops should leave the sooner the better 
the new government by the accounts of most foreign observers 
overwhelmingly won an election on may 7 but noriega canceled it 
and continued his rule until us troops invaded early wednesday 
endara contended on abc that even if noriega remains at large he 
would not be a major threat to the new government because he lacks 
popular support 
he was able to thwart the will of the people because he had a 
dictatorship that was powered by fear endara said but added 
the people are not hiding noriega i think noriega really does 
not count that much in panama 
endara appointed first vice president ricardo arias calderon as 
minister of government and justice responsible for internal 
security he named second vice president ford as minister of 
planning and political economy 
endara also announced the appointments of vallarino as 
ambassador to the united nations lauren fabrega as ambassador to 
the organization of american states and carlos rodriguez as us 
ambassador 
francisco rodriguez who was appointed noriegas provisional 
president after election results were annulled told reporters 
wednesday we are prepared to resist rodriguez apparently was 
in hiding thursday

the first sign of trouble came with the planes giant c141 and 
c5 jet transports landing every ten minutes at howard air force 
base only four miles west of gen manuel antonio noriegas panama 
city headquarters 
hours later just after midnight mortar blasts and machinegun 
fire lit the sky the dark shapes of helicopters roared through the 
moonlit night their running lights out 
operation just cause was under way president bush was striking 
for noriega the accused drug trafficker who had controlled panama 
and thumbed his nose at american power for years 
thousands of soldiers marines sailors and pilots were on the 
move by 1230 am wednesday paratroopers landed at omar torrijos 
international airport to secure it for landing 
in a blaze of gunfire american soldiers battled panamanian 
forces and surrounded noriegas defense forces headquarters by 2 
am flames a hundred feet high rose from the building 
were kicking ass tonight boasted one us soldier 
but the target noriega disappeared into the night noriega 
bodyguard lt asuncion gaitan said by radio that the dictator had 
been warned 
shortly after the fighting broke out opposition leader 
guillermo endara was sworn in as president and asked panamanian 
forces to surrender 
noriega loyalists however did not and the massive us 
military operation turned bloody in the metropolis of 1 million 
with garrisons destroyed or under siege many panamanian 
officers in noriegas 15000strong defense forces joined 
paramilitary groups and the socalled dignity battalions of armed 
citizens 
a media war began

states has no territorial ambitions in panama an unintentional 
reminder that until a decade ago washington controlled a 
10milewide zone through panamas center 
on a pronoriega radio network radio announcers called for 
neighborhood resistance and guerrilla war

the pentagon said us troops took 1500 prisoners most from 
the defense force 
in a somber speech on national television at 7 am wednesday 
president bush announced that american servicemen had been killed 
the us death toll began a climb into double figures 
bush said he ordered the invasion to protect the lives of 35000 
americans in panama in light of noriegas announcement five days 
earlier that panama was in a state of war with the united 
states 
bush said the assault was aimed at capturing noriega who had 
just been named panamas chief executive to bring him to trial in 
the united states on charges of cocaine trafficking 
it was the first us attack against a government since the 1986 
air raid on libya and the first us invasion of a country since 
the grenada intervention in 1983 
latin american allies condemned the action and called for 
withdrawal the soviet union called it gunboat diplomacy 
sources in washington later said bush decided on sunday to mount 
the assault one day after a us marine lieutenant was killed at a 
panamanian defense forces checkpoint and a us navy couple was 
held beaten and the woman threatened sexually 
panama was tense after the killing of the marine with american 
troops on maximum alert and panamanian news media trying to whip up 
a frenzy of antiamerican sentiment screaming that bush was 
preparing an invasion 
on monday a us army officer wounded a panamanian policeman 
because he thought the man was going to draw a weapon 
secretary of state james a baker iii claimed the invasion came 
after the administration received unconfirmed reports noriega 
planned to attack a us residential neighborhood 
on wednesday the bush administration offered a 1 million 
reward for information on noriegas whereabouts 
from an undisclosed location that night the elusive noriega 
spoke briefly over national radio and vowed to fight were in 
trench warfare now and we will maintain the resistance he said 
pronoriega radio stations were able to keep broadcasting all 
day but finally were shut off the air shortly after noriega made a 
brief statement 
on thursday the us troops were in control of panamas 
strategic points but scattered fighting took place in the capital 
despite a massive manhunt noriega remained at large 
a massive wave of looting that began wednesday spread throughout 
the city thursday every kind of business from bakeries to car 
dealers was picked clean by swarming hordes of panamanians 
entrepreneurs stripped warehouses and set up bargain street stalls 
to sell the merchandise 
endara the candidate elected in a may 7 election nullified by 
noriega left his shelter on a us base and spoke at the national 
assembly announcing a curfew to try to control looting 
in the absence of police who as members of the defense forces 
were either in combat or vanished his order had little effect 
us troops rescued 29 americans and 35 foreign nationals 
wednesday night at the marriott hotel but other us citizens were 
still missing thursday and three photographers were shot one of 
them dead by american troops in the hotel parking lot 
the 51mile panama canal opened thursday but only during 
daylight hours not enough workers could get in to keep the canal 
open at night a spokesman said 
the white house said the occupation could last for a 
considerable time but defense secretary dick cheney said some 
troops might return by christmas other officials worried the 
united states had impulsively entered an openended commitment that 
might end in guerrilla war 
bush said thursday the military mission is not over but 
pretty well wrapped up 
he vowed to continue the search for noriega who had commanded 
the defense forces since 1983 and earned a reputation as a miracle 
man by defying us economic sanctions and frustrating two coup 
attempts

uncertain prospects over interest rates in japan 
and the united states coupled with the panama situation slumped 
the dollar against the japanese yen and share prices on the tokyo 
stock exchange today 
the dollar closed at 14367 yen down 010 yen from thursdays 
close of 14377 yen after opening at 14367 yen the currency 
ranged between 14365 yen and 14379 yen 
the nikkei stock average of 225 selected issues a 29652point 
loser thursday lost 17511 points or 045 percent closing the 
week at 3804037 
masahiko sahara a dealer with industrial bank of japan ltd 
said the market was unable to find the dollars direction 
squeezed by the issues of japans official discount rate and signs 
of easing us monetary credit 
finance minister ryutaro hashimoto reiterating his earlier 
stance of three days ago told a news conference this morning that 
current price and monetary conditions in japan do not require 
changes in monetary policy 
but hashimoto added monetary authorities will look at movements 
in currency and money markets in determining when to raise the key 
lending rate 
lower interest rates make a countrys currency less attractive 
to investors 
yasushi mieno the new governor of the bank of japan said in an 
interview with the nihon keizai shimbun japans largest economic 
newspaper that a discountrate hike would be needed to stem 
excessive price rises and stabilize the foreign exchange rate the 
paper reported today 
during a briefing thursday on wholesale price trends central 
bank officials said upward price pressures have been increasing 
over the last few months 
a bank of japan official briefing reporters on condition of 
anonymity said higher prices for oil and natural gas the yens 
continued weakness and the effect of higher wages on prices in 
certain sectors such as machinery were threatening price 
stability 
earlier this week news reports said the bank of japan planned 
to raise its official discount rate by 05 percentage points from 
the current 375 percent points some time this week the finance 
ministry and central bank officials have denied any central bank 
action would be taken in the near future 
the official discount rate the rate the bank of japan charges 
on loans to commercial banks influences other domestic interest 
rates 
speculation that the central bank now is considering to hike 
its key lending rate next year probably in january or early 
february sent many investors reteating to the sidelines said 
sachiko hata a dealer with nikko securities co 
investors were wary how the situation in panama following 
wednesdays us military intervention in that central american 
country would develop she said 
ms hata said prospects that the us monetary authorities would 
lower the nations discount rate early next year also worked as a 
negative factor in the days securities market

the nations worst drunkendriving 
disaster has prompted federal and state officials nationwide to 
work to make school buses safer 
kentucky in particular has approved new safety standards for 
future school buses and is poised to toughen its drunken driving 
laws after the fiery bus crash that killed 27 people including 24 
children 
the crash happened when a church bus collided with a pickup 
traveling the wrong way on interstate 71 near carrollton ky a 
jury on thursday convicted the pickups driver larry mahoney of 
27 counts of seconddegree manslaughter 
the former school bus owned by the first of assembly of god 
church in radcliff ky burst into flames upon impact defense 
lawyers contended that safety defects in the 1977 bus caused the 
loss of more lives 
investigators said the victims were trapped inside the bus with 
only one working exit and were overcome by smoke from a fire that 
spread among highly flammable seats 
the magnitude of the tragedy exacerbated by its young victims 
ages has drawn attention from all parts of the united states 
theres been a lot of changes as a result of the carrollton 
accident than anything else weve seen said don carnahan 
director of pupils transportation in washington state 
since the may 14 1988 crash officials at all levels of 
government have taken steps to add emergency exits install less 
flammable materials reconsider the location of the gas tank on 
buses and restrict the use of older buses 
across the country school officials government regulators and 
bus manufacturers say the crash has torpedoed a decade of 
confidence in the safety of school buses confidence dating back 
to the last extensive changes in federal regulations in 1977 
the crash has caused more dialogue within the industry than 
any other accident in recent history said ray kroll director of 
transportation for minneapolis schools and president of the 
national association for pupil transportation 
in kentucky the state school board approved new safety 
regulations in july for new school buses that will require them to 
have roofescape hatches fire resistant interiors and a wider 
space by the emergency exit 
those were among some of the recommendations made by the 
national transportation safety board after it concluded an 
investigation of the bus crash 
the board also urged the state to enact stricter laws for 
driving under the influence 
in its final report the board praised the work of a task force 
on drunken driving appointed by gov wallace wilkinson 
among the task force recommendations was proposed legislation 
that would make it an offense for any driver to test above a 010 
level on a blood alcohol level current law presumes that a driver 
is intoxicated if they have a test at that level 
a state attorney generals task force later recommended the 
state lower the bloodalcohol level at which a person would be 
considered legally drunk 
both proposals among numerous others will be dealt with when 
the state legislature convenes in january

taking advantage of chaos in the 
streets and the absence of police panamanians ignored a curfew to 
strip store shelves bare and drive spanking new bmws off new car 
lots 
while people in some poor districts hawked the spoils of their 
sprees at cutrate prices others fled bombs and gunfire as us 
troops hunted soldiers and paramilitary bands loyal to gen manuel 
antonio noriega 
to try to control the situation usinstalled president 
guillermo endara on thursday ordered a curfew that was to last 
until 6 am today but there was no one to enforce it 
the police are part of the panamanian defense forces which 
either scattered after the us attack or are still fighting us 
troops were busy chasing the resisters 
at us southern command an officer said plans were being made 
to start enforcment action 
this city has been raped both by the us army and by 
looters said one man along the via veneto a row of fancy stores 
near the hotel district 
planes dropped two bombs late thursday in san miguelito 
location of the tinajitas garrison where dignity battalions and 
other noriega loyalists were holding out 
flares lit the dark sky and machine gun fire rattled in the 
night the firing had tailed off by early this morning 
us troops and armored personnel carriers surrounded the cuban 
and nicaraguan embassies once they found them 
do you speak english do you know where the cuban embassy 
is asked one armored vehicle driver who had parked near the 
spanish embassy when told where to go he roared off 
soldiers at us checkpoints scrutinized identifications at 
some checkpoints soldiers checked ids against lists of suspects 
hundreds of panamanians had been detained at the checkpoints but it 
was unclear what was happening to them 
dignity battalions temporarily took over a central hotel 
district but appeared more interested in looting vandalizing and 
stealing cars than confronting us troops 
thousands of people from children to grandparents poured through 
peeled back iron doors on stores along central avenue finding 
products with flashlights and matches 
some looters hit the basics like food soap and toothpaste 
which could become scarce many were poor and said they had come to 
look for clothes or christmas presents 
somebodys going to take it anyway said one embarrassed man 
carrying a trash bag stuffed with loot like most panamanians met 
on the street he refused to give his name 
others ran to more expensive tastes 
on the road to the airport where looting continued through the 
afternoon new bmws were being driven off a car lot 
at a large supermarket one man got to the last case of 
champagne 12 bottles picked it up and began walking out 
merry christmas he said 
teams of four or five men lugged furniture and large appliances 
a warehouse district near san miguelito was sacked and some 
buildings were burned 
some storeowners stayed put or hired armed guards 
stores that were open made customers stand outside barred gates 
and give their orders to the owners who took the money and passed 
out merchandise through the bars 
much stolen merchandise ended up in impromptu markets in poor 
districts designer brassieres french champagne and gucci watches 
were going at bargainbasement prices 
he doesnt have any running shoes for me but i ordered a pair 
for tomorrow said a buyer about 50 years old at one of the 
markets 
look said a young man showing off a gold watch i bought 
it for 20 the salesman didnt even realize it is a gucci 
looking down on the scene from a nearby balcony a middleaged 
woman shook her head in dismay 
it makes me feel like sitting down and crying she said as a 
couple of handcarts were rolled down the street full of looted 
merchandise

gorbachev for freedom for jews denied the right to emigrate from 
the soviet union to join their families elsewhere 
well get the job done bush promised an audience thursday 
at a ceremony in the old executive office building commemorating

emigrated youngsters bush said for sake of the children who are 
with us today from countries that still deny freedom of faith we 
will strive for the religious freedom their parents have never 
known 
the soviet union has greatly loosened emigration restrictions in 
recent years and as a result bush may grant that country trade 
concessions denied in previous years

measles has claimed more lives in 1989 than in 
any year since 1971 mainly among unvaccinated preschoolers and 
schoolchildren whose shots didnt work federal health officials 
say 
so far this year there have been 42 deaths among 14714 
reported measles cases compared with 90 deaths among 75290 
measles cases reported in 1971 measles specialist dr william l 
atkinson of the national centers for disease control said thursday 
but atkinson said the seemingly higher fatality rate 29 
deaths per 1000 measles cases so far in 1989 compared with 12 
deaths per 1000 cases in 1971 may be deceptive he suspects that 
many milder cases have gone unreported in some urban areas this 
year 
as it is there have been five times as many measles cases 
reported in 1989 as the 2876 reported by this time last year 
in the first six months of this year 30 percent of the cases 
occurred in children under 5 who are too small to be covered by 
schoolvaccination laws while 51 percent occurred among people 
519 
half the cases were among people who had been vaccinated the 
cdc said 
the cdc recommended this fall that children be given two 
vaccinations one at age 15 months the second at about age 5 that 
strategy is designed to break the spread of measles among 
schoolchildren who were vaccinated young and had to prove it to 
get in school but whose vaccinations for some reason failed to 
protect them 
but the new doubledose recommendation will do nothing to combat 
the outbreak of measles among unvaccinated preschoolers atkinson 
noted 
weve got to find some sort of clever ways to motivate parents 
to get their kids vaccinated he said a 15monthold doesnt 
walk in on his own 
federal health officials believed measles eradication was within 
reach early in this decade just 1497 cases were reported in 1983 
but the disease characterized by fever and a red spotty rash 
has bounced back although it remains far less common than it was 
before a measles vaccine was introduced in 1963 before then it 
was not unusual for the nation to report half a million cases a 
year

bells tolled and candles flickered in memory of those killed on 
pan am flight 103 but sorrow mixed with anger for some of the 
mourners who feel their loved ones fell victim to inadequate 
warning of the terrorist bombing 
memorial services in several eastern cities and in lockerbie 
scotland marked the first anniversary of the dec 21 disaster that 
occurred when a bomb splintered the new yorkbound 747 killing all 
259 aboard and 11 on the ground 
to the bereaved as to the world at large the tragedy seemed 
more dreadful because it came at the height of holiday 
preparations mary mann a friend of 20yearold victim julianne 
kelly described the feeling to 500 mourners at st susannas roman 
catholic church in dedham mass 
on a day that began with making plans to attend chistmas mass 
we received word that pan am flight 103 had exploded our holiday 
season will never again be as happy as it was before the tragedy 
in north adams mass candles set in brown paper bags lined the 
walkways to st francis of assissi church where the names of all 
the victims were read at a service for native wendy amy lincoln 23 
church bells pealed for the dead at 202 pm est in greensburg 
pa and ramsey nj among other places services were held in 
new york city washington dc and ridgefield conn 
in lockerbie a line of lanterns one for each victim 
flickered against a granite memorial dedicated before grieving 
relatives and residents in a 19th century graveyard 
pan am held memorial services at airports in new york london 
and frankfurt and employees observed a moment of silence at 202 
pm said spokeswoman pamela hanlon 
for some the anniversary was a time to vent anger at the airline 
and the government for their perceived failure to warn travelers 
to detect the bomb hidden in a radiocassette player to prevent 
the mass murder or to catch the terrorists responsible 
in new york about 50 of the 330 who attended services at st 
georges episcopal church held a silent march outside pan ams 
offices carrying signs with messages like pan am flight 103 
the truth must be known 
the pain will never go away and we have a great deal of 
bitterness and emptiness at the lack of support from the 
government jack schultz father of victim thomas 20 said at 
the connecticut service 
in the year since the crash relatives of the dead formed a 
group called the vicitims of pan am flight 103 to work for better 
airport security and press the government on the case 
we feel this is a commitment we have made to our sons memory 
and we must struggle to do everything we possibly can said doris 
cory of old lyme conn whose son scott was one of 35 syracuse 
university students killed in this instance my husband and i 
feel this was a preventable terrorist act

long county known as one of the georgia 
coasts great speed traps became a goodwill trap for a day 
motorists got a firm handshake a bag of fruit and an invitation 
to return instead of a ticket the project was the brainchild of 
danny norman chairman of the long county commission 
norman sheriff cecil nobles and offduty deputy fred williamson 
made up the welcoming delegation they had about a dozen large bags 
of fruit to give away and spent the afternoon waiting along us 
301 and us 82 until they spotted a license plate from another 
state 
with blue lights flashing theyd take up the chase 
norman said the idea would go a long way toward overcoming the 
national notoriety as a speed trap that the county once possessed 
you dont understand how much good as small a thing as this 
is can do norman said multiply the number of people in the 
car by 250 and youll see what kind of positive impact you can 
have with a bag of fruit 
one car they pulled over carried arthur and mildred green of 
inglewood fla who were en route to dayton ohio norman told 
them 
tell all your folks and everyone you see we want folks 
coming through long county

the investigation of the 1981 murders of two 
filipino union leaders has been reopened after a civil trial found 
the late philippine president ferdinand marcos liable for their 
deaths a prosecutor said 
the victims silme domingo and gene viernes worked in this 
country against marcos and their survivors claimed they were 
killed on orders from the philippines police laid their deaths to 
union activities and three men were convicted 
on thursday after meetings with attorneys for the dead mens 
families the king county prosecutors office announced the probe 
would be reopened 
we plan on taking a very serious look at the matter said 
prosecutors spokesman dan donohoe 
the followup investigation should take about two months 
donohoe said 
last week the families of domingo and viernes won a civil suit 
in us district court here against the estate of marcos who died 
in september and his widow imelda 
the civil jury decided that marcoses were conspirators in the 
deaths of the two men and were negligent in failing to control 
their intelligence agents in the united states the families were 
awarded more than 15 million 
after the trial seattle attorney michael withey who 
represented the families said the survivors wanted criminal 
charges filed against the man whose gun was used in the killings in 
light of evidence presented in their civil suit 
the gun belonged to constantine tony baruso 61 of seattle 
who was never charged in the case baruso was president of the 
alaska cannery workers union when domingo and viernes were gunned 
down at the unions seattle headquarters 
baruso and dr leonilo malabed a san francisco physician who 
allegedly managed an intelligence fund for marcos also were named 
in the civil suit baruso and malabed waived their right to a jury 
trial and us district judge barbara rothstein has yet to rule on 
their part of the case 
in a related matter attorneys defending mrs marcos in a 
federal racketeering case in new york have discussed a plea 
bargain but are preparing for the march 14 trial anyhow 
the talks with prosecutors were preliminary chitchat and 
havent led to any sort of deal for her to plead guilty to lesser 
charges said mrs marcoss lawyer john j tigue 
the charges stem from allegations she and her late husband 
siphoned more than 100 million from the philippines treasury and 
funneled it into this country for the purchase of new york real 
estate and art 
the prosecutor assistant us attorney charles labella refused 
to comment on the negotiations

stadium in new jersey 
after investigating a description of the exteamsters union 
leaders death by donald tony the greek frankos in the november 
issue of playboy magazine the fbi said thursday that evidence 
doesnt support the account 
frankos claimed hoffa was shot to death in the detroit area and 
that his dismembered body was trucked to new jersey and buried 
under the football stadium which was being built in east 
rutherford nj 
we have conducted an investigation concerning his assertions 
and cannot find any substantiation for what he said said hal 
helterhoff special agent in charge of the fbi in michigan never 
say never but it is a remote possibility he is buried there 
the hoffa case remains open helterhoff said adding that the 
fbi was investigating statements by frankos and other leads 
unrelated to his story 
the former teamster leader disappeared without a trace in july 
1975 outside a detroit restaurant 
fbi officials have said previously they believe hoffa was slain 
and know who did it but are unable to get proof 
helterhoff said parts of frankos story in playboy were true 
but nothing specific about the alleged murder and burial of hoffa 
was substantiated agents investigated mob figures frankos 
mentioned and assessed times and dates to check his story

a perservation group is trying to save the 
landmark texas theater the movie house where lee harvey oswald was 
captured after the assassination of president kennedy 
the theater built in 1931 by billionaire howard hughes and 
considered one of the finest movie houses in texas at the time is 
scheduled to close dec 31 united artists which owns the theater 
in the oak cliff section of dallas says the texas is losing money 
showing secondrun movies for a dollar 
the texas theater historical society made a hurried appeal to 
the company thursday after learning of its decision earlier this 
week to close the theater the group says the texas has historical 
significance both as an example of a 1930sstyle movie palace and 
because of the oswald connection 
its just losing money said dale chappell general manager 
of the southwest division of ua theaters our companys policy is 
to close down the theaters that are not profitable 
were not picking on the texas chappell said noting that 
ua had closed 17 theaters this year including five or six in this 
region because of their inability to make money 
on nov 22 1963 the movie house gained notoriety as the place 
where dallas police captured oswald after kennedy was shot 
the warren commission later concluded that oswald shot kennedy 
from a snipers perch in the texas schoolbook depository building 
on the edge of downtown dallas 
the historical society was formed to work with ua or a future 
owner to preserve the theater and help it turn a profit the 
societys president dennis hamilton said in a letter to ua the 
society is seeking to buy lease or be given the theater the 
letter said 
they say its not making any money and that theyre trying to 
cut their losses said cheryl griffith secretary of the texas 
theater historical society but you cant give a movie house 
third and fourthrate movies and expect it to make money she 
said 
this week the theater was showing indiana jones and the last 
crusade which made its big splash in the summer 
uas chappell said the company which has owned the theater 
since the mid1950s would consider proposals from the preservation 
group 
i think theres a real possibility of leasing it out 
chappell said some of the others weve closed weve leased 
out 
donating the property however would be another matter he said

latin american states voted today an 
expression of deep regret of us military force in panama and 
urged an immediate end to fighting there 
the vote after a marathon emergency session of the organization 
of american states also called for the withdrawal of troops used in 
the us action but it did not condemn the intervention outright 
and sought no timetable for the american troops to leave 
a resolution by nicaragua to condemn the use of force to oust 
panamanian gen manuel antonio noriega from power was not formally 
considered 
john maisto the us deputy permanent representative to the 
oas called the final resolution a mixed bag were a little 
disappointed it certainly wasnt an extreme resolution but its a 
little detached from what is really happening in panama 
the oas political council voted 201 with six abstentions to 
deeply regret the military intervention in panama 
the spanishlanguage version of the resolution distributed after 
the vote used the words deplorar profundamente which 
translates more closely to deeply deplore but james todd a 
spokesman for the us delegation said the stronger spanish 
language was a mistranslation of a resolution drafted in english 
and he expected a clarification later in the day 
the english version was circulated and voted on were using 
the english said todd 
the resolution noted the serious events in panama 
especially the armed clashes resulting from the military 
intervention by the united states and the deplorable loss of lives 
and property 
us ambassador luigi enaudi cast the only negative vote on the 
motion engineered by peru brazil mexico colombia uruguay and 
argentina 
the resolution urged the immediate cessation of hostilities 
and bloodshed in panama and the launching of negotiations between 
the various political sectors of that country that will lead to a 
concerted solution of the panamanian institutional crisis 
there was not a condemnation said maisto it was just an 
expression of the need for withdrawal of troops which is not 
unlike what president bush has called for when the job is 
completed 
a us attempt to term the invasion a military action failed 
with only three votes among the 26 delegates who attended the 
17hour debate and negotiation only honduras and costa rica 
supported the united states 
another amendment by costa rica and guatemala to blame noriega 
for the chaos and anarchy that prompted the us move was also 
defected by a 72 vote with 12 abstentions 
venezuela was the only leading latin democracy to abstain from 
the final vote venezuela has urged the oas to express some form of 
recognition to the usinstalled government of president guillermo 
endara 
the oas said it reaffirmed that solving the crisis panama is 
undergoing at this time necessarily requires the full respect for 
the right of the panamanian people to selfdetermination without 
outside interference and faithful adherence to the letter and 
spirit of the treaties under which the united states is to turn 
the panama canal over to panama in 2000 
the security of the canal is one of the reasons cited by the 
bush administration for launching the invasion 
enaudi also failed by an 114 vote with two abstentions in an 
attempt to add to the resolution a mention that the oas charter 
itself allows each nation the right of selfdefense 
enaudi said that once noriega declared a state of war against 
the united states the us government clearly have the 
legitimate right of selfdefense 
enaudi also said the us has tried to work out a peacefully 
solution of the panamanian situation thought the oas but it is 
impossible to reason with a dictator at the end noriega has got 
what he deserved

of panama marched outside the us embassy in lima and at american 
missions in two other latin american capitals 
president alan garcia a strong critic of the us action in 
panama on thursday repeated his proposal to postpone the feb 15 
drug summit with president bush and the presidents of three andean 
nations 
i cannot meet with the leader of an invading nation he said 
in washington the organization of american states suspended its 
session thursday five minutes after it opened because delegations 
were divided on the wording of a resolution condemning the us 
action 
oas chairman angus albert khan of trinidad and tobago said he 
was approached by several delegations asking for more time before 
debate begins on a resolution submitted wednesday by nicaragua he 
did not say when the session would resume 
thousands of american troops were sent to the central american 
nation wednesday to topple the government of gen manuel noriega 
who is wanted in the united states on drug trafficking charges and 
who voided free elections in may 
hundreds of protesters chanting antiamerican slogans marched in 
downtown lima thursday night and burned an american flag near the 
us embassy to protest us military actions in panama 
in mexico city about 2000 people shouting yankee killers 
and american terrorism gathered outside the us embassy for 
the second such demonstration there in as many days 
protesters threw rocks and eggs filled with red and blue paint 
the colors of panamas flag leaving the embassys white marble 
facade speckled with at least a dozen stains more than 100 police 
officers kept the crowd from rushing a barricade and no injuries or 
other incidents were reported 
in the dominican republic about 200 protesters picketed in 
front of the us embassy in santo domingo president joaquin 
balaguer condemned the us invasion calling it a violation of 
panamanians right to selfdetermination 
bush is to meet with garcia and presidents virgilio barco of 
colombia and jaime paz zamora of bolivia on feb 15 in cartagena 
colombia to discuss how to fight drug trafficking in the four 
countries 
but in a communique released thursday by the peruvian government 
news agency andina garcia said holding a dialogue with a pistol 
on the table cannot be tolerated 
the communique did not give a time or set conditions under which 
the summit should be held 
referring to the us intervention in panama garcia said in the 
communique that the united states could seek to do the same in 
peru if it should think the peruvian government isnt doing 
enough to fight drug trafficking 
in bogota foreign minister julio londonno said the united 
states must pull its invading forces out before latin american 
nations will work for a solution to the panama crisis 
no country can assume the right of intervene directly or 
indirectly in other states affairs whatever reasons or purposes 
it may have much less militarily he told a news conference 
some latin american leaders including venezuelan president 
carlos andres perez have proposed a recognition of guillermo 
endara as panamas president in exchange for an immediate 
withdrawal of us troops 
endara winner of the may 7 presidential elections annulled by 
the noriega government proclaimed himself president on wednesday 
as the invasion began

state farming and grocers groups hope to 
weed out an antipesticide ballot initiative sponsored by 
environmentalists with a countermeasure aimed at cultivating more 
trust in food safety 
a coalition of agricultural groups thursday unveiled a proposed 
59page wholesome food initiative that would double the amount 
of food tested by the state for pesticide residues 
but advocates of the antipesticide measure which would phase 
out the use of suspected cancercausing pesticides over six years 
say the farming groups countermeasure was designed to enhance its 
image without eliminating toxic bugkillers 
this is not to protect food this is to protect their 
privileged position their status quo said assemblyman tom 
hayden who is cosponsoring the antipesticide initiative with 
attorney general john van de kamp for the november 1990 ballot 
the measure promoted by hayden van de kamp and environmental 
groups deals with a variety of issues including global warming and 
offshore oil spills 
but to farmers the important part is the provision to phase out 
the use of known cancercausing pesticides opponents say that 
would eliminate 70 percent to 80 percent of the registered 
chemicals now used on californiagrown food reducing quality and 
quantity 
the haydenvan de kamp measure is irresponsible it takes a 
sledgehammer approach rather than a commonsense approach to the 
food safety issue said jasper hempel vice president of 
government affairs for western growers association 
weve come up with a better mousetrap to reassure or assure 
the public that our californiagrown food is in fact safe he 
said 
the farmers measure is being pushed by a coalition calling 
itself californians for responsible food laws or careful 
it would among other things double the amount of food tested 
for pesticide residue mandate a state review of childrens health 
protection laws and increase mediterranean fruit fly eradication 
research 
but hempel said the main goal of the measure was to forestall 
the radical pesticide phaseout proposed in the environmental 
bill 
the coalition which plans to begin gathering signatures for the 
ballot measure in february has hired a political consulting firm 
the dolphin group and is prepared to spend 3 million to 5 
million on the initiative campaign said lee stitzenberger a 
political consultant with dolphin 
signatures to qualify the antipesticide measure for the 
november ballot already were being collected 
each bill needs 372178 signatures of registered voters to 
secure a place on the ballot

us troops storming the witch 
house quarters of gen manuel antonio noriega found cigarettes 
smoking in ashtrays and believe they missed the panamanian fugitive 
by minutes military sources say 
the witch house one of noriegas residences was filled with 
bizarre black magic paraphernalia another of the ousted dictators 
quarters was decorated with portraits of nazi dictator adolf 
hitler american servicemen told reporters on thursday 
the witch house is on the sea coast near panama city close to 
several us military bases 
military investigators believe that the house may have been 
boobytrapped and would not allow reporters and photographers 
inside until it could be made safe said gen john huston 
soldiers on the scene some six hours after the fighting started 
said they thought noriega may have made a narrow escape 
the cigarettes were still smoking in the ashtray and the women 
left their purses which no woman would ever usually do said a 
soldier familiar with the house 
troops who saw the house spread word that the room in which the 
purses were found was apparently devoted to the occult with signs 
of animal entrails and vats of blood the soldier said 
military officials could not immediately confirm the soldiers 
account he declined to permit use of his name 
sgt 1st class joseph torregrossa said there were some bizarre 
trappings in noriegas private office in the no 8 building of 
panamas military barracks at fort amador 
when we went inside there were all of these expensive prints 
but he also had a portrait of adolf hitler and a lot of expensive 
weapons mostly automatic torregrossa said 
he had german lugers israeli uzis and all sorts of real 
sophisticated stuff

the united states intervention in panama was 
rejected today by latin american neighbors who called for an end to 
the bloodshed and a us withdrawal president bush notified 
congress that he could not predict the precise scope and 
duration of the military operation 
the war powers act requires the president to formally notify 
congress anytime he commits military force in a written message 
bush accused deposed panamanian leader manuel antonio noriega of 
directing vicious and brutal acts against americans and 
asserted that the lives and welfare of us citizens had been 
increasingly at risk 
although most organized opposition has ceased it is not 
possible at this time to predict the precise scope and duration of 
the military operations or how long the temporary increases of us 
forces in panama will be required bush said 
in panama city thousands of us troops were settling in to 
restore order in the chaotic streets while in washington within 
blocks of the white house the organization of american states 
political council voted 201 with six abstentions to deeply 
regret the military intervention 
the united states cast the sole no vote in a spanish 
translation the resolution used the words deplorar 
profundamente profoundly deplore a resolution to condemn 
the invasion was never formally taken up 
the pentagon revising its casualty report said 20 american 
troops and two female dependents were killed in the first two days 
of battle 202 were wounded and two were missing american military 
aircraft were bringing the bodies of the dead back to dover air 
force base in delaware their coffins draped with american flags 
us officials said 122 panamanian soldiers were killed and 45 
wounded army lt gen tom kelly said us troops had taken 1500 
prisoners most of them regulars from the panamanian defense force 
this operation is not over but its pretty well wrapped up 
bush said thursday at a news conference that coincided with return 
of the first bodies this mornings report to congress our 
additional forces will remain in panama only so long as their 
presence is required 
sens john warner rva and christopher dodd dconn called 
on other latin american states to recognize panamas 
newlyinstalled usbacked president guillermo endara the oas 
group had not taken up the matter 
warner said it was time for the hand wringing and second 
guessing to stop 
the senator in a television interview also said it would be 
helpful if panamas neighbors would begin to rally behind him and 
perhaps even send in their own police so that president bush 
can withdraw our troops as soon as possible 
endara acknowledged in an interview on abcs good morning 
america that he could not safely walk the streets of his country 
today nobody is secure right now he said but he claimed 
that he was the countrys legitimate leader 
i have the wholehearted support of the people right now 
endara declared he said noriegas capture was not absolutely 
necessary for an endara government to establish roots 
if noriega is caught by panamanian forces endara said he could 
not under panamas constitution be extradited to the united states 
where he is under indictment on drug trafficking charges so 
therefore im not looking for him 
following the oas vote us representative john masisto said 
were a little disappointed it certainly wasnt an extreme 
resolution but its a little detached from what is really happening 
in panama

nicolae ceausescu the president and 
communist party leader of romania created a cult of personality 
and ruled his country with an iron hand during 24 years in power 
the 71yearold ceausescus hold was so firm that he could carry 
out a foreign policy independent of the soviet union and the other 
east bloc countries he also managed to outlast oldline leaders in 
poland hungary east germany bulgaria and czechoslovakia 
but the changes encouraged by soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev 
also swept over romania after seven days of widespread 
demonstrations and attempts by security forces to quell them by 
force ceausescu was driven from power by a mass uprising 
the oldstyle marxist invested billions of dollars in a crash 
industrialization program that led to widespread food and energy 
shortages and despair for romanias 23 million people 
the longer the food lines and the more vocal the peoples 
complaints the more harshly the regime cracked down on critics 
at a mass meeting in bucharest earlier this year ceausescu 
said the triumph of the revolution requires unity severe 
discipline and a spirit of sacrifice a firm organization is needed 
as well as a tested political leader who knows how to unite and 
lead the masses 
ceausescus firm organization was the romanian communist 
party which he turned into a personal instrument after taking over 
in 1965 
he gradually pushed aside all leaders who opposed his policies 
and installed loyalists on the ruling 23member politburo 
including his wife elena a chemist 
the personality cult he encouraged particularly after he was 
sworn in as romanias first president took on the trappings of 
worship and pervaded practically all aspects of public life his 
pictures lined the streets in bucharest and other romanian cities 
and bookstores were full of works attributed to him 
when he was elected president in march 1974 an official picture 
showed him holding a silver scepter as the symbol of authority 
during the ceausescu era romania once known as the breadbasket 
of the balkans became one of europes poorest countries still 
the official media frequently described ceausescus long tenure as 
romanias golden epoch 
billions of dollars were spent on industrial and public works 
projects and food was rationed as the government exported all it 
could to pay off its foreign debts the debt was eventually paid 
off in the spring of 1989 but the shortages continued 
a massive secret police kept strict control on religious and 
political expression and dissent was quickly crushed 
as he grew older and turned more dogmatic ceausescu rejected 
the need for reform adopted by other bloc allies such as poland 
and hungary 
romania became increasingly isolated in both east and west 
particularly after 30000 romanians mostly ethnic hungarians fled 
to hungary last year 
the hungarians complained about alleged discrimination and 
denial of their ethnic and cultural rights but they also sought 
refuge in hungary to escape chronic hardships under ceausescu 
ceausescu viewed the changes in eastern europe with alarm and 
accused other warsaw pact countries of abandoning communism 
the united states and other western powers originally encouraged 
ceausescus relatively independent foreign policy stand within the 
sovietled warsaw pact two us presidents visited bucharest 
richard m nixon in 1969 and gerald f ford in 1975 
ceausescu who took power as communist party leader on march 22 
1965 maintained diplomatic relations with israel even after other 
soviet bloc countries broke them during the 1967 middle east war 
in keeping with his maverick image he denounced the sovietled 
invasion of czechoslovakia in 1968 refused to participate and 
refused to allow any foreign troops in romania 
romania was the only east bloc country to send athletes to the 
1984 olympics in los angeles breaking the sovietled boycott 
ceausescu placed members of his family in key posts 
his wife elena was a politburo member and first vice premier 
and by the mid1980s she had become the virtual secondincommand 
of national life and shared the limelight with her husband 
nicu their youngest son was regional party chief in central 
romania valentin an adopted son zoiaelena their daughter and 
ceausescu brothers held prestigious posts as did several inlaws 
western analysts and knowledgeable romanians estimate that some 
40 members of his family held top jobs in the party and state 
hierarchy 
born jan 26 1918 in scornicesti ceausescu was the third son 
of a large peasant family an elementary school dropout he was 
apprenticed as a shoemaker took a job in a factory and joined the 
illegal communist party youth organization at age 15 he became a 
party member three years later in 1936 
before and during world war ii his communist activities landed 
him in jail several times he became a protege of communist leader 
gheorghe gheorghiudej rose quickly in the party and succeeded 
his mentor after his death 
the party under gheorghiudej had grown accustomed to oneman 
traditional stalinist rule and ceausescu continued the tradition 
moving trusted associates into key posts 
i dont give orders he once quipped to visiting us 
secretary of state william rogers i make suggestions but they 
had better be carried out

the world isnt all black and white 
for mans best friend but pooches are better at spotting blue and 
big red than old yeller a research study concluded 
three dogs named flip gypsy and retina helped scientists at the 
university of california santa barbara dispel the belief that 
dogs live a colorless life according to a study published in 
januarys scientific american and in the journal visual 
neuroscience 
the yearlong study found that dogs do distinguish colors but it 
also showed the animals have limited color vision similar to men 
who suffer from a type of colorblindness once known as green 
blindness 
the dogs could not distinguish yellow green orange and some 
other shades the study said 
psychologists jay neitz and gerald h jacobs and technician 
timothy geist used greyhounds flip and gypsy and toy poodle retina 
in the studies exploring photopigments the molecules in the eyes 
receptor cells that help differentiate colors 
the researchers trained the dogs to respond to colored lights on 
a display panel the study said 
in each test two lights would be of the same color while a 
third would be different the dogs were trained to push the 
different light with their noses and they got a snack if they 
pushed the correct one 
the dogs had no trouble distinguishing red and blue the colors 
at the opposite end of the spectrum they could even tell more 
subtle differences in the similar hues of blue and violet 
but the dogs could not discriminate among colors from 
greenishyellow through orange to red the account in scientific 
american said 
the study was partly funded by the national eye institute 
jacobs interviewed by telephone thursday said the research 
team was careful to make sure the dogs werent simply 
distinguishing between shades of gray 
we went to elaborate lengths to make sure they could not go on 
brightness cues he said 
besides disproving the popular notion that dogs see in black and 
white the study gives insight into the eyes mechanisms for 
differentiating color he said

a sensitive new genetic test has enabled 
researchers to determine the sex of 19 fetuses merely by taking 
blood from their mothers arms says a new report 
the technique might one day be used to diagnose birth defects 
before birth replacing present methods in which cells must be 
obtained from the uterus researchers said 
the test called the polymerase chain reaction or pcr was used 
to search for y chromosomes in the blood of the 19 mothers females 
do not have y chromosomes 
the researchers were hoping that enough fetal cells had leaked 
into the mothers bloodstreams that the y chromosomes from male 
fetuses could be detected 
they detected the y chromosomes in seven of the mothers and 
predicted that those women were carrying males all seven delivered 
boys all of the 12 women in whom y chromosomes were not found 
delivered girls 
with stringent precautions against contamination this 
technique may assist prenatal diagnosis of sexlinked disorders 
said the researchers led by dr kenneth fleming of john radcliffe 
hospital in oxford england the researchers reported their results 
in the dec 9 issue of the lancet a british medical journal 
in may dr diana bianchi of boston childrens hospital used a 
different technique for analyzing mothers blood samples and 
correctly predicted the sex of two out of three male fetuses 
other studies had raised the possibility that fetal cells could 
be found in mothers blood but no one had proven that fetal cells 
could be reliably distinguished from the mothers cells 
the sex of a fetus can now be determined as early as the eighth 
week of pregnancy through a technique called chorionic villus 
sampling or cvs in which cells from the precursor of the placenta 
are removed and tested 
cvs allows the testing of cells for any of the genetic 
abnormalities for which tests exist including such disorders as 
downs syndrome huntingtons disease and sickle cell anemia 
the hope is that mothers blood can one day be used for the 
detection of these other genetic abnormalities because getting a 
blood sample is simpler and safer than cvs or the standard sampling 
method amniocentesis 
in that procedure a small amount of the amniotic fluid that 
bathes the fetus is withdrawn about the 16th week of pregnancy 
genetic testing is done on fetal cells that have escaped into the 
fluid

a recordbreaking cold snap caused power outages today in at 
least three states posed perils for the citrus industry and 
threatened the lives of the homeless and impoverished elderly from 
the rockies to the east coast 
thursday night the longest of the year was one not fit for 
man or beast said hugh crowther of the national weather service 
in kansas city 
temperatures sank even lower today the first full day of 
winter following a day that saw wind chill readings of 89 degrees 
below zero at dickinson nd the mercury steady at 40 below at 
noon in havre mont and temperatures about zero as far south as 
tennessee and alabama 
record lows set this morning included 29 below at rapid city 
sd 13 below at syracuse ny and 3 below in memphis tenn 
light snow was falling in houston this morning for the first 
time since january 1985 
thousands were without power today in texas west virginia and 
ohio 
the weather service was predicting bonechilling weather at 
least until sunday 
as for a white christmas weve got it already said john 
hart of the weather service in west virginia where windchill 
readings reached 40 below early today and the snow was squeaky dry 
underfoot its certainly not going anywhere 
storm systems had dumped up to 1 feet of snow early today 
across the great lakes from indiana to upstate new york the cold 
was forcing homeless into packed shelters and was blamed for more 
than 50 deaths 
oil companies said thursday that the cold had drained heating 
oil supplies causing temporary shortages in some areas of the 
northeast and driving up prices exxon usa mobil corp and star 
enterprise a texaco inc affiliate reported temporary oil 
depletions at their terminals 
utilities in several states reported record demands for power 
most of the power outages reported were caused by system overloads 
from the increased demand or coldrelated equipment failure 
in texas an estimated 12500 homes were without electricity in 
the fort worth area early today because of such demand and a tu 
electric spokesman predicted it would take several hours to restore 
power the temperature dropped to 5 and the wind chill index was 
minus 26 at the time of the outage 
about 10000 customers in kentucky 2300 in several ohio 
counties and about 500 in the charleston wva area lost power at 
least temporarily utilities spokesmen said 
potomac electric power co which serves the district of 
columbia and the maryland suburbs cut voltage by 5 percent this 
morning due to extremely heavy demand said spokesman tom welle 
natural gas and electricity delivery problems were reported in 
missouri and texas 
the national weather service predicted a possible repeat of the 
killer freeze of december 1983 which destroyed the citrus crop in 
the rio grande valley and parts of louisiana 
if the predicted freeze today through sunday is as bad as 1983 
citrus growers will suffer the same consequences go broke 
said jerry walzel of the texas citrus and vegetable association 
when it gets down below 20 citrus trees just explode 
theyre evergreen trees and are full of water and they split 
walzel said you can actually hear it it sounds like a 3030 
rifle cracking 
about a third of the 30 million crop was picked and the 
weather service urged farmers to pick as much as they could 
thursday 
the cold front brought snow early today to the mountains of 
northern georgia and record lows thursday of 12 below in kansas 
city and 22 below in sault ste marie mich where an 18foot deep 
wall of brash broken ice left by passing ships mired the 
canadian freighter travailleur in the st marys river 
on a day where the mercury rarely reached zero those 
unfortunate enough to be working outside had to devise tricks to 
save extremities from frostbite 
we rotate said rick kiolbasa an assistant manager for 
cablevision in lincoln neb where the cold knocked out service to 
20000 households there are three guys in the truck one guy 
goes out for five minutes gets cold and then the next guy goes 
out 
bad as it was to work outside it was worse to be living there 
in new york city where an estimated 80000 people live on the 
streets 9140 people were in the citys shelters thursday morning 
up 1200 over last year at this time officials said 
at least 15 weatherrelated deaths have been reported in chicago 
since the cold snap began according to the cook county coroners 
office 
some homeless were itching for a fight so they could be jailed 
through the worst of the cold 
its pretty typical this time of year for homeless and needy 
people to act intentionally or unintentionally so they can be 
locked up said dale davis executive director of the michigan 
sheriffs association 
but michigan jails are too crowded for inmates who arent 
dangerous davis said so most of the idlers are held only briefly 
if we can get them shelter elsewhere we will he said 
the christmas holiday came early in nebraska kansas missouri 
north dakota new york iowa and minnesota where schools were 
closed thursday by officials worried at the thought of youngsters 
waiting for buses that might break down in the cold 
in farmington maine hundreds of townsfolk most wearing 
earmuffs turned out to celebrate chester greenwood day in honor

manuel antonio noriegas longstanding 
relationship with the cia could pose problems for federal 
prosecutors if the deposed panamanian strongman is caught and 
brought to trial on us drug trafficking charges government 
sources say 
federal prosecutors expect noriega would try to force the 
government to drop charges against him by seeking court disclosure 
of classified information that he was an informant for the spy 
agency these officials added 
such an approach would mirror the legal defense strategy used by 
oliver north and others with some success in the irancontra 
affair in which independent counsel lawrence e walsh was forced 
to drop some key charges when the government refused to allow 
disclosure of secrets in open court 
at the same time justice department officials said thursday 
they do not expect the secrecy problems in noriegas case to 
scuttle any of the charges that the panamanian helped colombian 
drug lords smuggle cocaine and marijuana through panama to this 
country 
noriega was indicted in 1988 by grand juries in miami and tampa 
fla 
prosecutors are anticipating that noriega will claim that his 
alleged drug activities were sanctioned by the us government 
because he was a cia informant 
but the government is prepared to offer evidence that none of 
the drugtrafficking activity was approved by the us government 
said one source speaking on condition of anonymity prosecutors 
will argue that just because noriega may have been an informant for 
the cia or the drug enforcement administration he is not immune 
from criminal prosecution the source said 
the secrecy issues involving noriegas case were among the items 
discussed at a meeting about the case dec 15 attended by 
prosecutors top officials of the justice departments criminal 
division and other law enforcement agents said spokesman david 
runkel 
officials decided at that meeting to try noriega first on 
charges filed in miami that he took a 46 million bribe from 
colombias medellin cartel to protect cocainesmuggling and 
moneylaundering operations in panama 
runkel said last weeks meeting had been scheduled for several 
weeks and was not convened in anticipation of the us invasion of 
panama 
the secrecy problems in noriegas case were termed 
manageable by one official who spoke on condition of 
anonymity but the official quickly conceded that irancontra 
prosecutors probably thought the same thing about their case 
against former white house aide north 
walsh was forced to drop major charges that north conspired to 
divert usiran arms sale proceeds to the nicaraguan rebels 
because the government wouldnt release information deemed relevant 
to the defense the classified information procedures act empowers 
judges to dismiss criminal charges if the government refuses to 
allow the disclosure of secrets needed for a trial 
north was convicted of charges that he tried to cover up his 
involvement in the irancontra affair but all irancontra charges 
against a former cia agent joseph fernandez were dismissed 
recently when the bush administration blocked disclosure of 
classified information 
in noriegas case there is certainly going to be a cipa 
problem said victoria toensing a former senior justice 
department official who now practices law in washington 
when people are saying he was on the cia payroll then you are 
going to have the more complicated level that some of these things 
regarding sources and methods are classified she said 
before noriega was indicted in 1988 prosecutors consulted with 
the cia and other intelligence agencies said a government source 
who spoke on condition of anonymity the agencies posed no 
objections to proceeding with the case the source said 
between the miami and tampa cases noriega is charged with 
pocketing some 10 million in bribes and commissions for protecting 
moneylaundering and smuggling operations in panama 
runkel said the justice department decided that noriega would be 
tried first on the charges in miami because prosecutors there have 
a stronger case 
if convicted of all the charges against him noriega faces a 
possible sentence of 145 years in prison and more than 11 million 
in fines

a former police official accused of defrauding 
investors and of stealing from the department was ordered jailed to 
keep him from fleeing before his next court appearance 
kenneth weiner former deputy chief of the detroit police 
department was arrested early thursday at detroit metropolitan 
airport 
he was carrying dozens of charge cards airline flight coupons 
a passport and 3100 in canadian money fbi agents testified at 
weiners us district court bond hearing 
magistrate virginia m morgan sent weiner 43 to jail without 
bond on a federal fraud charge until his pretrial hearing jan 2 
the charge which carries a possible sentence of five years in 
prison and a 250000 fine stems from his alleged involvement in a 
scheme to defraud investors of 20 million 
morgan said weiner has an ability to manipulate the system to 
appear or disappear whenever it was in his interest to do so 
weiners attorney robert harrison said an appeal will be filed 
immediately but acknowledged weiner likely will be held until after 
christmas 
hes very unhappy right now obviously harrison said outside 
the courtroom he feels the truth did not come out 
harrison said the flood of media reports on the mystery of 
weiners whereabouts in the past few weeks tainted the case making 
weiner appear evasive 
hes a man who travels in his own name all over the country 
harrison said 
he said weiner was flying to detroit from los angeles to meet 
with his attorneys regarding an internal revenue service 
investigation 
police chief william hart recently accused weiner of stealing 
from a 14 million detroit police secret service fund used for 
undercover operations weiner had access to the fund from 1980 to 
1986 
fbi agent thomas cannistra who has been investigating weiner 
since may 1986 testified thursday that weiner sent 13 million 
from the secret service fund to dummy corporations in california 
federal investigators have said that two of the corporations 
named by cannistra paid a 3000 monthly rent bill for a house in 
beverly hills calif occupied for two years by harts daughter 
and soninlaw hart has denied knowing about the rent payments 
cannistra said the fraud charge is unrelated to the police 
investigation but is from a pyramid investment scheme involving the 
sale of gold and silver he said between 5 million and 10 million 
remains missing from the scheme 
weiners court troubles began in 1986 when caine steel co of 
detroit filed a civil suit against him charging that he defrauded 
the company of 379000 he was accused of duping as many as 90 
investors out of about 20 million in a scheme that involved 
trading of gold and silver 
the alleged investment scheme used new investors cash to 
provide large returns to previous investors such plans collapse 
when new investors cant be found

mayor tom bradley may have broken the law in 
his method of reporting tens of thousands of dollars in campaign 
funds from a series of innercity carnivals it was reported today 
the fund raisers apparently were held on cityowned land without

the city charter prohibits anonymous contributions totaling more 
than 200 for any one campaign any surplus must go to the city 
treasury assistant city attorney anthony alperin said 
bradley said in a statement thursday that he would take 
whatever steps are necessary to correct any mistakes if any were 
made 
i relied on the campaign attorneys and accountants to decide 
how the carnival contributions should be reported said the 
mayor whose financial dealings have come under city and federal 
scrutiny 
the carnivals were held in 1987 and 1988 as bradley was gearing 
up for a campaign fight against city councilman zev yaroslavsky 
during that period the mayors reelection campaign received 
164000 in anonymous and unattributed donations of under 100 an 
unusually large figure campaign experts told the times

thousands of jubilant berliners surged 
through new openings in the berlin wall at the brandenburg gate 
today for the first time in 28 years 
the celebrants braved an intermittent rain as they filled the 
square in front of the towering symbol of the postwar division of 
germany that is becoming a monument to the rapprochement of east 
germany and west germany 
east german premier hans modrow met west germany chancellor 
helmut kohl at the border for the 3 pm 9 am est ceremony 
then they walked together into east germany they were nearly 
mobbed by the crowd as they walked to a platform in front of the 
gate to address the exulting berliners 
kohl called the occasion a fantastic thing 
thousands drenched by the rain uncorked champagne and danced 
atop the berlin wall the once impregnable concrete barrier that is 
quickly crumbling 
the opening was televised live in both countries this is 
where the heart of berlin pounds said a commentator for west 
germanys zdf network 
two banners were unfurled near the new crossings to protest the 
killings of demonstrators in romania 
the last time i was here was as a kid when i used to play on 
this very spot i never thought id come here again its really 
wonderful said peter rebachmann 42 of east berlin 
what a beautiful christmas present i am so elated that i can 
experience this said a middleaged woman 
the crowd cheered and set off firecrackers when east german 
workers started dismantling the wall thursday night the workers 
used a crane to remove the rounded top of the wall 
this is an experience that will go down in history the gate 
was a symbol of division of germany said jozef polak a west 
berlin mechanic 
more than 10000 people had jammed the western side for the two 
sections of the wall to fall down some climbed on trees to get a 
better view more people kept arriving throughout the night 
a loud cheer sounded through the night air as the east german 
crane lifted a 3footwide segment of the concrete to make the 
first hole in that part of the wall shortly after midnight 
the two new crossing points are 15 feet wide each one is for 
westerners going into east berlin the other for east germans going 
to west berlin 
although more than 20 border crossings have been made at the 
wall since east germany opened its borders to the west on nov 9 
the brandenburg gate has the most symbolic meaning for berliners 
the 200yearold gate berlins most famous landmark remained 
on the eastern side when east germanys communist authorities built 
the berlin wall in 1961 
graffiti on the western side at one of the segments to be 
removed said one day every wall must fall down 
friedhelm brinkman a salesman from dortmund west germany said 
he drove 360 miles to see the event 
this was the central place in berlin where everything happened 
before the war i always thought this place would be opened again 
and thats why i came tonight he said late thursday 
some people in the crowd shouted germany united 
fatherland the rallying call of east german supporters of 
german unification 
 
the crowd was kept well away from the wall by barricades and 
cordons of west berlin police to prevent them from possibly trying 
to cross the wall 
after east germanys dramatic opening of the borders thousands 
of people danced on the section of the berlin wall at brandenburg 
gate 
crowds pulled down one segment of the wall in unforgettable 
scenes seen on television worldwide thousands of people had waited 
in vain for the gate to be opened in the first few days after the 
berlin wall started crumbling down in the wake of east germanys 
peaceful revolution 
kohl and modrow announced the agreement to open the two 
crossings when kohl visited dresden on wednesday 
the gate the size of a fivestory building on top of which is a 
bronze chariot with the goddess victoria was the backdrop for 
hitlers rise to power and his last stand it was also where east 
german workers began a 1953 uprising that was crushed by soviet 
tanks 
in east berlin the famous unter den linden boulevard ends at 
the gate on the western side the sprawling avenue that leads to 
the gate was renamed june 17 street after the date of the uprising 
nazi brown shirts staged a triumphant torch parade through the 
gate when adolf hitler was named chancellor on jan 30 1933 
in the final days of world war ii the sixcolumn sandstone gate 
was heavily damaged as soviet tanks closed in on hitlers bunker in 
the chancellory it marked the border between the soviet and 
british sectors when the victorious allies divided conquered berlin 
into four sectors

financial records found in manuel antonio 
noriegas offices may help investigators trace money the deposed 
panamanian leader earned from drug trafficking the justice 
department said today 
department spokesman david runkel said us investigators are 
reviewing the records seized in noriegas offices at the panamanian 
defense forces headquarters 
we believe there are assets and we are checking records to 
determine where those assets are currently located runkel said 
we have been in contact with foreign governments and financial 
institutions as well as people here to trace the cash and other 
holdings that noriega is believed to have amassed from his 
involvement in drug trafficking runkel said 
runkel said he had no information to specifically identify any 
assets either in this country or abroad 
but the spokesman said two foreign governments which he would 
not name are currently assisting the justice departments efforts 
to trace and freeze noriegas holdings 
the treasury department also was participating in the effort to 
trace the assets runkel said 
the records seized during the us invasion might contain 
evidence that noriega looted the panamanian treasury too he said 
the records will be studied in panama by officials of the new 
panamanian government installed after the us invasion he said 
if useful the records would be turned over to federal 
prosecutors in miami and tampa fla where noriega faces drug 
trafficking charges he is accused of pocketing 10 million by 
allowing colombian drug lords to smuggle cocaine and marijuana 
through panama to the united states 
the search for noriegas assets was stepped up as the white 
house announced that us troops in panama had found about 110 
pounds of cocaine worth 125 million in the panama city building 
where noriega had an office 
the cocaine was found during a floorbyfloor search of the 
building at fort amador said white house spokesman marlin 
fitzwater

if gen manuel antonio noriega manages to make his way to a 
foreign embassy in panama city he could be there a long time 
us troops have put the nicaraguan and cuban embassies in the 
panamanian capital under tight surveillance in case the ousted 
leader attempts to seek sanctuary there so far us officials 
say there is no sign noriega is inside either embassy 
under international law embassies are sacrosanct ground an 
embassys territory belongs to the country it represents not to 
the country where it is situated forces from the outside cannot 
legally enter embassy territory to seize a person the embassy wants 
to shelter 
but an embassys right to grant sanctuary to someone does not 
mean that person has a right to free passage out of the country a 
refugee may have to wait inside the embassy for years until 
political conditions permit his departure 
in june chinese dissident fang lizhi took refuge inside the 
us embassy in beijing although talks since then between us and 
chinese officials have reportedly touched on fangs case he 
remains holed up in the embassy liable to arrest if he comes out 
perhaps the longest instance of political refuge in an embassy 
involved hungarian cardinal josef mindszenty who hid out for 15 
years at the us embassy in budapest he was arrested by hungarys 
communist rulers in 1948 as an enemy of communism and sentenced to 
life in prison 
hungarian revolutionaries freed him during the 1956 uprising 
but mindszenty took refuge in the us mission in budapest after 
warsaw pact forces crushed the revolt he lived there until the 
vatican arranged for his release to the west in 1971 
elsewhere in the east bloc seven pentecostalists claiming 
religious persecution lived for five years in a cramped room at the 
us embassy in moscow leaving in 1983 
the largest number of people to seek refuge at a foreign embassy 
at once may have been in cuba in april 1980 when 10000 cubans 
entered the grounds of the peruvian embassy seeking to emigrate 
cuban authorities finally persuaded the crowd to go home and 
eventually almost all of them received exit visas 
in 1973 after salvador allende was overthrown as president of 
chile and died in a battle in the presidential palace his widow 
and her children received refuge in the mexican embassy in 
santiago the mexican government then flew them out of the country 
in south africa some 20 prisoners and antiapartheid activists 
have taken refuge in the us british west german and dutch 
diplomatic missions in recent years most were eventually allowed 
to go free with south african government assurances that they 
would not be punished

federal health officials have a grim holiday 
message for the nation 1770 americans are going to die in highway 
crashes in the next 11 days half in wrecks where somebody was 
drinking 
alcoholrelated highway deaths seem to be declining slightly 
the national centers for disease control said thursday but 
statistics show a higher rate of highway deaths and a higher rate 
of drunkendriving wrecks during the yearend holiday period 
this is not to say dont travel said dr terence l chorba 
a cdc researcher this is to say dont travel drunk particularly 
if youre the one behind the wheel 
the national highway traffic and safety administration projects 
that 1770 highway deaths and 48000 injuries will occur on the 
roads over the hanukkahchristmasnew years holiday travel season 
which began thursday and extends to jan 2 
statisticians at the national safety council in chicago came up 
with a lower projection of as many as 770 lives deaths over the 
long christmas and new years weekends the estimate was based on 
data compiled during the holidays in previous years seasonal 
weather factors and national driving safety trends 
the worst day of the season is expected to be saturday when the 
highway administration predicts 235 traffic deaths friday is 
second with 197 followed by sunday christmas eve with 176 and 
new years day with 165 
over the holidays we see more miles traveled and you have 
an increase in the number of fatalities but you also have an 
increase in the number involving drunk driving chorba said 
last year 50 percent of the deaths on christmas involved 
drunken driving compared to 39 percent on nonholiday days for 
the day of new years eve it was 36 percent but for new years 
day including the hours after midnight it was 58 percent 
in 1988 overall 47093 deaths were reported in us 
motorvehicle crashes 18503 or 39 percent involved drunken 
driving someone with a bloodalcohol count of 010 or more 
legally drunk in most states 
that percentage is down somewhat from 1987 when 18529 drunken 
driving crashes were reported 40 percent of the 46386 traffic 
deaths the figure was 46 percent in 1982 
chorba noted however that fully half of the fatal crashes 
still involve someone who has been drinking even if the person is 
not legally drunk 
fifty percent of the fatalities on the roads have some alcohol 
component to them whether its a driver or a bicyclist or a 
pedestrian he said

actor daniel daylewis says that confining 
himself to a wheelchair for the six weeks of filming my left 
foot was necessary in portraying disabled irish artist christy 
brown 
i took the liberty of thinking that it was imperative to do it 
this way and did not think about any inconvenience i might have 
caused because in the end it was beneficial to show the people on 
the set what we were trying to do he said 
daylewis remained in the wheelchair even during breaks 
communicating only with grunts and requiring aides to feed and 
carry him 
brown who died in 1981 was written off by doctors as a mental 
defective but later rose to prominence as a writer and painter the 
cerebral palsy victim used his left foot his only controllable 
limb 
in researching browns life daylewis said he learned that 
brown never considered himself handicapped and wanted desperately 
to be considered normal 
he has unwillingly become a spokesman for the disabled 
daylewis said and he probably is the worst person in the world 
to be a spokesman he had an overwhelming sense of his own 
disabilities i dont think he ever came to terms with it

two public officials who defied the 
supreme court by leading a prayer before a high school football 
game in august have decided not to fight the case in court 
mayor emory folmar and montgomery county commission chairman 
william joseph agreed not to conduct prayers before high school 
football games saying the school board has control over pregame 
activities at the cityowned stadium 
the reponse wednesday by folmar and joseph to civil libertarians 
who filed a lawsuit over the pregame prayers leaves only a slim 
chance that the case will go to trial as scheduled jan 4 
attorneys said 
i think theyve done the responsible thing david schoen a 
montgomery attorney who filed the suit said thursday 
a federal judge last month dismissed the montgomery county board 
of education from the case because it agreed not to sanction or 
permit prayers before schoolsponsored events folmar and joseph 
said they would honor that agreement 
its not a question of saying we were wrong or they were wrong 
or the world is wrong said folmar we in effect were stopped 
from doing it by the school board

ethiopia has asked local aid 
agencies to determine how to supply food to hundreds of thousands 
of drought victims facing starvation in rebelheld northern zones 
a government official said friday 
if it comes about it would be the first time president mengistu 
haile mariams 15yearold marxist government has taken part in the 
distribution of relief supplies to rebel areas 
foreign minister tesfaye dinka in describing his governments 
plans to ambassadors and relief officials said the drought was 
affecting the northern provinces of eritrea tigre wello and 
gondar as well as parts of harrar in the east and omo in the south 
only tigre which is controlled by the rebel tigre peoples 
liberation front posed a problem he said 
the front which has been fighting since 1975 for increased 
autonomy and mengistus ouster took control of tigre in an 
offensive this year the province has an estimated population of 3 
million 
because of the security situation tesfaye said the government 
had asked its relief organization the relief and rehabilitation 
commission to study how emergency food can be supplied to the area 
the commission is expected to have an anser within a month he said 
other agencies to be involved are the ethiopia red cross the 
ethiopian orthodox church the mekane yesus evangelical church and 
the catholic church he said 
the united nations has estimated crop failures in northern 
ethiopia could threaten as many as 4 million people with starvation 
and has appealed for 600000 tons of emergency food the 
governments preliminary estimate of the number under the threat of 
starvation was 18 million 
tesfaye did not mention the possibility of establishing safety 
corridors through which food and supplies could move unhindered 
into the embattled areas president daniel arap moi of kenya said 
10 days ago that mengistu had agreed to such a plan ethiopia has 
not acknowledged mois announcement

the government said friday 
that jailed black nationalist leader nelson mandela wont be freed 
before the end of the year 
speculation remains strong however that mandela will be freed 
in january or early february 
a broad range of black leaders say mandela must be released 
before they can accept president fw de klerks invitation to 
negotiate a new constitution that would extend political rights to 
blacks 
rumors that mandela would be freed before christmas spread 
earlier this week following unsubstantiated reports that british 
prime minister margaret thatcher asked south african authorities to 
take this step mrs thatchers office denied that any time frame 
had been added to her standing request that mandela be freed as 
soon as possible 
south africas bureau for information said friday in response 
to numerous press inquiries concerning the possible release of mr 
nelson mandela the bureau would like to make it clear that there 
will be no developments in this regard during the festive season 
the bureau said that meant mandela would not be freed before 
jan 1 
mandela 71 is south africas bestknown black leader he has 
been imprisoned since 1962 and is serving a life sentence for 
plotting an antigovernment sabotage campaign to be carried out by 
his african national congress guerrilla movement 
mandela lives at a staff house on a prison farm outside cape 
town and has been meeting frequently with antiapartheid leaders 
and government officials including talks last week with de klerk 
mandela met for six hours friday with a fiveman delegation from 
the congress of south african trade unions the countrys largest 
and most militant labor federation 
mr mandela said he wants to be released into an environment 
where he would be able to move freely amongst his people said 
one of the union leaders john ernstzen he would like to see the 
cessation of all hangings treason trials and other methods the 
state is using 
the mayor of cape town gordon oliver friday released the text

the allwhite city council would like mandelas advice on how to 
carry out its goals of creating a city free of discrimination

allowed the use of a telephone to confer with two of the african 
national congresss top exiled leaders col ray gamble a prison

the christmas menu at the county jail of 
turkey dressing and cranberry sauce started some inmates thinking 
that they may be eating better than some people on the outside 
len singleton who is serving time for disorderly conduct and 
resisting arrest wrote a letter to sheriff simon leis jr asking 
permission to organize a collection among the inmates 
some 500 inmates at the hamilton county justice center and 
cincinnatis community correctional institution responded by giving 
up cigarettes and snacks and singleton on thursday presented a 
check for 36141 to the freestorefoodbank 
a lot of inmates who will be incarcerated are members of the 
community they still have their hearts there and they wanted the 
community to know that singleton said 
one of the inmates said to me i can remember one time when i 
was on the streets and the freestore helped me out they said they 
can always get cigarettes but this is more important he said 
prisoners are allowed money accounts usually a few dollars left 
by relatives to buy incidentals singleton said some inmates 
donated their entire allowance 
weve never been involved with anything like this said 
steve gibbs the freestores executive director who accepted the 
inmates check thursday at a jailhouse news conference we 
appreciate what theyve done 
gibbs said the private operation has a daily budget of 10000 
and will feed about 3000 families during the holidays 
some of us will not be going home for christmas to be with our 
loved ones but that doesnt mean we cant be involved in the 
spirit of giving singleton said in his letter to leis 
leis said he was skeptical and almost threw the letter away 
on further reflection i thought it was a very good idea 
leis said going along with it was one of the smartest things 
ive ever done as sheriff of hamilton county

bowing to opposition led by the widow of the 
rev martin luther king jr the board of education has reversed 
itself and decided to keep rotc out of the high school named for 
the late civil rights leader 
the board voted to cancel the threeyear program of the air 
force junior reserve officers training corps that was to have begun 
in february robert f wagner jr board president said thursday 
the board had approved the program in june two months after the 
faculty voted 10259 against it 
wagner said a letter from mrs king to the board on nov 15 was 
decisive it said my late husband dr king believed in the 
principles of nonviolence and worked tirelessly to pass this 
message on to the youth of america while i understand the need for 
rotc programs in other high schools i believe that a military 
program has no place in a school named in his honor 
three city high schools have rotc programs which afford 
students who complete the course a chance for scholarships and 
possible admission to service academies 
air force officials have said that if the program scheduled for 
king high were not instituted there it would be moved to another 
city possibly rochester

theres something of a role reversal and it 
seems a rule reversal as well in the way the kremlin and the white 
house are dealing with each other on the american intervention in 
panama 
their words and contacts point to an effort on both sides to 
keep the episode from intruding on the thaw in eastwest relations 
the soviet union denounced the us military move calling it an 
invasion and an act of aggression but adding to that predictable 
response the observation that it will not necessarily become a 
problem issue between moscow and washington 
president bush sent a personal message to soviet president 
mikhail s gorbachev on the military action he ordered early 
wednesday against the panamanian regime of gen manuel antonio 
noriega 
he told a news conference thursday that he needs to explain the 
operation to gorbachev more fully 
its not altogether surprising that he doesnt understand some 
of the special arrangements the united states has in panama the 
president said 
bush said he had responded to provocations that included the 
killing of an unarmed american marine the brutalizing of american 
citizens the denial of office to a freely elected leader 
given all that he said his message would be 
then mr gorbachev please understand this president is 
going to do something about it 
so we have to explain he said 
secretary of state james a baker iii said the critical soviet 
statements were not unexpected and that the initial comments may 
have been issued before the first bush message reached gorbachev 
not that it would have made much difference american 
intervention whatever the cause or justification is guaranteed to 
produce critical reaction from moscow just as the united states 
has assailed soviet moves in afghanistan and elsewhere 
furthermore noriega has close ties with cuba the soviets western 
ally and with the marxist government of nicaragua 
the united states must immediately stop its armed intervention 
in panama said vadim p perfiliev spokesman for the foreign 
ministry in moscow a tass commentary said the us action 
encroaches on the progress attained elsewhere in world affairs 
but those comments were tempered by perfilievs observation that 
superpower relations have moved beyond the point at which any such 
episode anywhere in the world was deemed a matter of eastwest 
confrontation 
the us intervention comes as the soviet union watches barriers 
fall and governments turn from communist dominance toward democracy 
and free market economic systems moscow once proclaimed a doctrine 
of limited sovereignty for the satellite states insisting on its 
right to intervene against threats to their communist regimes 
intervention to keep the satellites in line was a moscow habit 
during the height of the cold war it happened then in east 
germany in hungary in czechoslovakia in poland 
gorbachev turned away from that posture indeed while the 
romanian government was trying to put down protests with force the 
soviet president said wednesday that changes in eastern europe 
should come peacefully without violating public order and the 
rights of citizens 
moscow has not resisted the freedom movements that have changed 
the face of eastern europe most dramatically with the dismantling 
of the berlin wall and on friday with the overthrow of the 
hardline communist government in romania 
sen sam nunn dga chairman of the senate armed services 
committee noted the possible connection saying it was unfortunate 
that the united states was required to take these steps in panama 
at a time when we are urging restraint on the part of the soviet 
union toward other nations and on the part of china toward the 
democratic aspirations of its own people 
baker said the soviet union is supporting democracy through its 
forbearance and argued the united states is doing so by doing the 
opposite in panama by intervening 
let me say that i think both the united states and the soviet 
union today are supporting democracy baker said at a firstday 
briefing on us intervention in panama 
the difference is that the soviet union supports democracy by 
staying out of countries and thus permitting democracy to proceed 
in this one and very unique instance the united states did it by 
going in to assist a democratically elected government against a 
dictator 
the panama operation drew protests from most latin american 
capitals even from governments hostile to noriega he may be 
detested but so is yankee intervention 
mexico for example said panamanian problems must be resolved 
by the panamanian people 
but they tried and noriega wouldnt let it happen which is the 
baker argument 
noriega reneged on this years elections because he was losing 
and installed his proxies to govern the organization of american 
states tried to talk him into yielding power to an elected 
government five times its emissaries went to panama city on that 
futile mission 
latin american states voted at the oas on friday for a 
resolution assailing the military intervention in panama a 
measure that gained something in the translation 
the english language version expressed regret the spanish 
translation deplored the operation 
the oas urged an immediate end to the fighting and said american 
troops should be withdrawn the vote was 20 to 1 only the us 
delegate voted no 
the latin protests were inevitable and despite the easing of 
eastwest tensions soviet officials and commentators werent about 
to let washington off the hook easily 
georgi arbatov a soviet expert on us affairs called the 
operation a return to gunboat diplomacy and said it could 
strengthen hardliners opposed to arms reductions 
he also said in an abctv interview that noriega is a problem 
the united states created for itself by training him and once 
having him on the cia payroll 
for all of that there remains the possibility that the panama 
precedent could be argued in connection with future soviet 
intervention if it comes to that in a place like lithuania that 
baltic state has been part of the soviet union since 1940 an 
independence movement there is strong and gaining despite kremlin 
warnings that it will come to grief and great trouble

the bush administration plans to lift a 
congressional ban of government loans to iraq a move likely to 
antagonize lawmakers who are critical of iraqs human rights abuses 
and credit problems 
officials say president bush will exercise his right to lift the 
ban imposed by congress several months ago on grounds of us 
national interests the officials who spoke on condition of 
anonymity said the move is expected within several weeks 
us oil companies and other businesses have exerted heavy 
pressure on the administration to broaden trade ties with iraq 
since the 1988 end of its ruinous eightyear war with iran the 
administration wants to increase its influence over the government 
of iraqi strongman sadam hussein who commands one of the middle 
easts strongest and most proven armies as well as the worlds 
secondlargest proven oil reserves 
however the move may anger lawmakers who are expected to take 
up debate over reports of recent iraqi testing of two longrange 
missiles when congress returns of the holiday recess next month 
iraq announced the testing earlier this month saying it had 
also testfired a rocket able to carry satellites into space the 
pentagon confirmed the testfirings but has declined to discuss it 
further 
us officials say they are concerned by the implications of 
such a missile program for the arms race in the middle east and 
have raised their concerns with the iraqis 
critics also say the administration failed to act against iraq 
for attacking its kurdish minority with nerve and mustard gas last 
year 
congress voted to suspend 200 million in annual shortterm 
credits to iraq by the exportimport bank a us government 
institution that promotes the export of american goods to head off 
a presidential veto and respond to pressure from us businesses 
congress agreed to incorporate the executive branchs right to a 
waiver 
but there were many up here who didnt like it and wanted a 
flatout prohibition on iraq said a congressional source who 
spoke on condition he not be named 
we couldnt do that iraq is a major untapped market for the 
us in the middle east said one official also speaking on 
condition of anonymity 
even with the credit problems us exports to iraq nearly 
doubled from 1987 to 1988 reaching 12 billion for the first 
nine months of 1989 exports totaled 909 million mostly 
agricultural commodities according to commerce department 
statistics 
american oil imports from iraq have risen sharply from a daily 
average of 83000 barrels in 1987 to 345000 barrels in 1988 
according to energy department figures the yearend figures for 
1989 are expected to show about a 40 percent increase over 1988 
iraq has run up a debt to foreign governments and banks 
estimated at between 30 billion and 70 billion 
in the longrun iraqs past performance and future oil capacity 
make it a worthy credit risk the government plans to increase its 
daily oil output from 25 million barrels to 4 million once its oil 
terminals damaged in the war are repaired 
the baghdad government is eager to attract us business so it 
can profit from american technology and build up its 
exportoriented industries

a jury today recommended a 16year prison 
sentence for the man convicted of causing a fiery crash that killed 
27 people on a church bus in the nations worst drunkendriving 
accident 
under kentucky law larry mahoney would have to spend eight 
years in prison before he could be considered for parole he was 
tried on 27 counts of murder which carried a life sentence but 
the jury convicted him thursday of 27 counts of seconddegree 
manslaughter lesser charge 
mahoney 36 was composed as he stood to hear judge charles 
satterwhite read each of the sentence recommendations but he 
appeared to have tears welling in his eyes by the time the judge 
concluded 
satterwhite must schedule a formal sentencing he could give 
mahoney a lighter sentence than the jury recommended but cannot 
exceed the jurys recommendation 
the jury recommended 16 years of a possible 20year sentence on 
each of 12 counts of firstdegree assault it recommended maximum 
prison terms of 10 years on each of 27 counts of seconddegree 
manslaughter five years on each of 27 counts of firstdegree 
wanton endangerment and one year on each of 14 counts of 
seconddegree wanton endangerment a misdemeanor 
the jury then exercised its option of recommending that the 
sentences run concurrently the jury could have recommended 
consecutive sentences in any possible combination 
the recommendation was a big letdown for families of the 
victims said bill nichols whose only child 17yearold william 
joseph nichols jr was killed 
those people dont know what were going through and i hope to 
god they never have to nichols said ive forgiven larry 
mahoney but hes got to pay for his crime and eight years is not 
enough 
at a sentencing hearing thursday mahoney had pleaded for a 
chance to atone saying he could warn schoolchildren of the dangers 
of drinking and driving 
the prosecutor during the sentencing hearing said mahoney 
should draw a long prison sentence because his victims 24 of them 
children will never get the opportunity to talk to other 
children 
mahoney a chemical plant worker was driving on the wrong side 
of interstate 71 near carrollton on may 14 1988 when his pickup 
collided with the bus autopsies showed the resulting fire not the 
crash killed the victims 
mahoney also was convicted on 12 counts of firstdegree assault 
for the children who were badly burned in the fire on 27 counts of 
firstdegree wanton endangerment representing others who escaped 
the bus and 14 counts of seconddegree wanton endangerment for 
motorists who had to dodge his truck 
he was acquitted of a 42nd wantonendangerment charge 
the penalty for firstdegree assault is 10 to 20 years in 
prison wanton endangerment in the first degree is a felony 
punishable by one to five years in prison and a misdemeanor in the 
second degree punishable by up to a year in jail and a 500 fine 
the final conviction was for drunken driving and the jury set 
mahoneys punishment at 30 days in jail and a 500 fine 
defense attorneys had acknowledged that mahoney was drinking on 
the day of the accident but they argued that a defective bus 
design was the primary cause of the deaths and that he had been 
tricked into drunkenness 
the bus was a 1977 model former school bus bought by the 
radcliff first assembly of god church in radcliff ky 
in the sentencing hearing after the verdict mahoney took the 
witness stand and told the jury he intended after prison to visit 
schools to tell students never to drink and drive 
i know god kept me alive for a reason he said 
if i just save one life mahoney said beginning to lose his 
composure at least that will be one life saved 
mahoney later sobbed as did his parents sisters and other 
relatives and some on the jury as russell baldani one of mahoneys 
lawyers pleaded for leniency 
baldani asked the jury to recommend 10year sentences on the 
assault charges and to exercise its option of ordering all 
sentences to run concurrently mahoney would be eligible for parole 
consideration after five years 
special prosecutor paul richwalsky visibly disappointed by the 
jurys refusal to convict mahoney of murder scoffed at the plea 
for crime there must be punishment richwalsky said i am 
sorry mahoney is sorry but there are 27 people dead 24 of them 
children they will never get the opportunity to go around and talk 
to other children they will never get the opportunity to 
repent and atone 
the victims lives were worth more than five to 10 years in 
prison richwalsky said 
neither time nor mahoneys conviction has healed the victims 
families wounds said one parent who attended a radcliff first 
assembly of god board meeting thursday night 
i think some of us have put our lives together and can cope 
with it now but its never over said jacob pearman whose 
brother john drove the bus struck by mahoneys pickup and was 
killed

orders to us factories for durable goods 
posted the sharpest gain in a year last month the government said 
friday in a report that analysts said suggests the economy can 
avoid a recession 
its merry christmas to the economy said robert brusca 
chief financial economist at nikko securities co intl in new 
york this report suggests theres more life in the economy than 
a lot of people thought 
the commerce department report of a 51 percent jump in durable 
goods orders shows that reports of an economic demise are 
premature added william k macreynolds forecasting director for 
the us chamber of commerce 
orders for durable goods bigticket items expected to last 
more than three years increased to a seasonally adjusted 1307 
billion last month after dropping 07 percent in october and 12 
percent in september 
the gain in orders was spread through all categories and was the 
largest since a 74 percent jump last december it averted the 
first threemonth decline since 1986 
brusca said there still are weak spots in the economy but 
added i think we have to really distinguish between saying the 
economy is weak and saying it is weakening i think we can say the 
economy is weak but those who say it is still weakening are 
holding on too long to an old forecast 
he said the economy apparently hit a trough in late summer 
brought down by high interest rates initiated by the federal 
reserve to fight inflation as inflation moderated the central 
bank has gradually permitted shortterm rates to drop including a 
quarter percentage point this week 
macreynolds said the new orders will lead to increased 
production in the manufacturing sector of the economy which has 
been particularly hard hit by the credit pinch 
the closely watched nondefense capital goods sector rose 83 
percent last month to 39 billion the largest gain since a 101 
percent increase last december economists use this category as a 
barometer of business investment plans 
transportation orders posted the largest gain in the civilian 
category 105 percent to 367 billion after rising 21 percent in 
october both aircraft and motor vehicles showed large increases 
the department said surprising some in view of plummeting 
automobile sales since the new models were introduced in october 
excluding transportation durable goods orders would have risen 
31 percent last month 
orders for electrical machinery jumped 79 percent to 217 
billion virtually all in communications equipment 
nonelectrical machinery orders including computers and a wide 
variety of industrial equipment rose 66 percent to 229 billion 
after a 47 decline in october 
orders for primary metals were up 17 percent to 221 billion 
after a 34 percent decrease in october 
defense orders rose 156 percent to 112 billion after a 91 
percent decline the previous month excluding this volatile 
category orders would have gained 42 percent in november 
shipments of durable goods in november rose 15 percent to 
1237 billion after a 31 decline in october

panicked over finding a christmas gift for 
somebody whos got everything why not pick up a russianlanguage 
version of monopoly where glasnosthappy capitalists can build 
hotels on gorky street and pay 200 rubles to get sprung from jail 
the trendy tribute to gorbachevstyle openness is available for 
2950 at the suburban rockville md headquarters of victor 
kamkin inc the largest russian bookstore in the western world 
the monopoly game follows the format of the longpopular us 
version and both are published by parker brothers inc but the 
board names are russian and the play money is rubles 
the most expensive property is not boardwalk but the arbat a 
fashionable historic district of moscow which sells for 400 rubles 
about 75 
the game is bought mostly by our american customers who speak 
russian and is very popular among students said anatoly 
zabavsky the bookstores vice president and general manager 
russian emigrees are not familiar with monopoly they consider it 
more a purely capitalist invention 
nestled among the samovars lacquered wooden dolls and 
balalaikas at the kamkin gift counter the monopoly game is a 
symbolic reminder of the way that soviet leader mikhail s 
gorbachev has turned eastwest relations upside down 
not to mention the glasnosts impact on the kamkin bookstore 
where business is booming 
the store was founded by russian emigre victor kamkin and his 
wife elena in 1953 zabavsky who was born in poland of russian 
parents moved to the united states from germany in 1951 and after 
becoming an electrical engineer joined kamkin nearly 20 years 
later 
since kamkin died in 1974 zabavsky has shared daytoday 
supervision of the business with elena kamkin 
the bookstore boasts about 25 million volumes and an estimated 
250000 separate titles as well as numerous russian magazines and 
newspapers it had 25 million in sales last year its biggest 
customers are us government agencies the academic community 
corporations and soviet emigrees 
i see grandmothers babushkas coming in here and spending 
their pension money on russian childrens books to make sure their 
grandchildren will learn their mother tongue he said 
by all accounts those figures make kamkin the biggest russian 
bookstore outside the soviet union in moscow the fourstory dom 
knigi house of books a mile from the kremlin stocks more 
volumes many of them obscure unread political documents but 
students of soviet affairs say kamkin offers a much wider selection 
of titles 
glasnost has meant the end of kamkins role as a clandestine 
rendezvous point for cold war adversaries zabavsky said in an 
interview 
nowadays he said us intelligence agents and kgb officers 
from the soviet embassy no longer appear regularly to roam kamkins 
aisles spying on each other in the hope of learning what the other 
side is reading 
moreover zabavsky says hes astounded by the abundance of 
russian books flooding the export market many of them once 
suppressed or banned by soviet authorities 
we publish a weekly catalog of books for our 18000 mailorder 
subscribers and we offer about 1000 new titles every month 
zabavsky said in the past a halfdozen of those titles might be 
bestsellers now we have a problem deciding because everything is a 
bestseller many of them never been published before 
he shakes his head as he mentions soviet exports of works by 
oncedisgraced authors alexander solzhenitsyn vasily aksenov roy 
medvedev vasily grossman and vladimir voinovich even vladimir 
nabokovs erotic lolita is now published by the soviets he 
says 
never in my wildest dreams did i think i would ever see them 
in print he said this glasnost its really overwhelming

president bush appealed today to americans 
to demonstrate compassion for victims of aids saying that a 
misplaced fear of the deadly disease was preventing some people 
from helping 
bush underscored his point by touring the clinical wards of the 
national institutes of health meeting children ranging in age from 
less than a year to early teens who are being treated with 
experimental aids drugs he was accompanied by his wife barbara 
later addressing health professionals involved in fighting 
aids bush said he wanted to educate americans who dont want to 
help dont want to become involved because of a misplaced fear 
theyre afraid of holding an aids patient because theyre 
frightened of getting aids the president said 
barbara and i want to say and we hope we can continue to 
demonstrate this they are wrong they are simply uninformed they 
are wrong about that 
he praised the courage of doctors and nurses and parents and 
counselors who are working against aids 
bush said that after being in a room full of kids with aids 
i thought of how there is no reason to fear for your health 
just their health the president said 
and i want to thank those who are not afraid especially 
foster parents who have opened their homes and their hearts and 
those of you here today who do so much for so many 
bush said only together can we wage allout war against this 
terrible killer 
there are about 30 children in the nih aids wards now they are 
all being treated experimentally with a variety of doses and types 
of drugs designed to fight the human immunodeficiency virus or 
hiv that causes aids or acquired immune deficiency syndrome 
i think the visit is to cheer up the troops who work with aids 
patients said spokeswoman ann thomas 
health and human services secretary louis d sullivan and his 
wife ginger were accompanying the president and mrs bush on the 
45minute nih tour 
an hhs source said bush asked sullivan to arrange the visit to 
say think you to the nih staff 
he really wants to acknowledge the hard work and dedication of 
these people the source said 
sullivan told reporters that bush is making the tour to 
demonstrate his personal support for biomedical research and nih 
no personnel announcements were expected during the presidential 
visit the directorship of nih has been vacant since james 
wyngaarten resigned last july 
the children infected with the aids received the virus from 
their mothers at birth or from blood transfusions 
they are being treated with zidovudine commonly called azt and 
with a new experimental aids drug called ddi 
all of the patients are here as voluntary research subjects 
said ms haske 
it was research of this type that led sullivan in october to 
approve distribution of azt for treatment of children with aids 
azt which now is the only approved aids drug formerly was 
reserved only for adult patients because there was concern that 
side effects from the drug would be more severe among children 
ddi is now in advanced clinical trials but has not been 
approved for general prescription use

us troops think they almost got 
gen manuel antonio noriega on the first day of the intervention 
when they broke into a fortified house finding signs of panicky 
flight and by one account vats of blood and animal entrails 
the abandoned office and house on the seacoast near here and 
close to several us military bases was stormed by us soldiers 
on tuesday about six hours after the us invasion began 
the cigarettes were still smoking in the ashtray and the women 
left their purses which no woman would ever usually do a 
soldier familiar with the house said thursday 
but noriega was not to be found in the retreat that had been 
specially built for him and soldiers continued scouring the 
countryside friday for the deposed leader wanted in the united 
states on drug charges 
the american soldier who would not give his name said troops 
who saw the house spread the word that one room was apparently 
devoted to the occult with blood and entrails 
military officials could not immediately confirm the soldiers 
account 
saying the house might have been boobytrapped officers would 
not allow reporters and photographers inside gen john huston said 
another soldier sgt 1st class joseph torregrossa said there 
were bizarre trappings in another of noriegas quarters his 
private office in panamas military barracks at fort amadar 
when we went inside there were all of these expensive prints 
but he also had a portrait of adolf hitler and a lot of expensive 
weapons mostly automatic torregrossa said he had german 
lugers israeli uzis all sorts of real sophisticated stuff 
travel restrictions including a nighttime curfew were still in 
effect friday and new fighting was reported with men loyal to 
noriega attacking the headquarters of the us southern command 
a twohour tour through a bombedout shopping district that once 
was a noriega stronghold showed scenes of near chaos as thousands 
of looters seized refrigerators microwaves automobile tires 
gasoline and other goods 
they cheerfully stopped however to shout viva bush viva 
bush or bush bush bush as they waved to soldiers and 
journalists one held up a knife sharpener and joked its a 
present from bush 
noriegas ninebuilding headquarters was a smouldering hulk its 
windows blown out by tank and artillery fire it was closely 
guarded by dozens of us troops 
less than a mile away the body of a man face down and 
shirtless lay trapped in the crushed wreckage of a sedan a us 
infantry sergeant said an armored personnel carrier rolled over the 
car after the driver was seen passing out ak47 rifles 
an old section of the city around noriega headquarters contained 
many of panama citys poor and homeless but they had largely 
abandoned it taking refuge in quarters provided by us military 
at the americanowned balboa high school in the suburbs us

six people convicted of drug 
smuggling were beheaded in public friday in the northeastern city 
of arar the government said 
the six three saudi arabians a syrian a jordanian and a turk 
were convicted by islamic courts of smuggling hashish into the 
kingdom the interior ministry said 
capital punishment for drug importing was introduced by the 
kingdom in recent years in an attempt to curb drug smuggling which 
has been spreading rapidly since the oil bonanza years in saudi 
arabia and the rest of the region 
the theocratic kingdom rules by the koran which prescribes 
beheading for murder stoning for adultery and hand cutting for 
theft 
moslem theologians ruled that capital punishment was applicable 
to drug smugglers because beheading covered those who spread 
corruption on the face of the earth 
about a dozen other drug smugglers have been beheaded this year 
most of them pakistani nationals 
beheadings are usually carried out in public squares opposite 
mosques following the friday prayers and sometimes the bodies are 
hung on crossed beams to act as a deterrent

a lithuanian lawmaker friday challenged the 
kremlin in front of the entire soviet parliament to begin talks 
leading to full independence for his baltic republic 
lithuania was forcibly included in the soviet union said 
deputy kazimeras motieka if the kremlin is serious about reform 
he said it should move to eliminate the results of the crimes of 
dictator josef stalin who annexed the baltic region 
as a person empowered by the voters of lithuania i call upon 
the government of the ussr to begin official negotiations in 
the near future with fully empowered representatives of lithuania 
on the liquidation of stalinist crimes and on the restoration of 
the independence of the lithuanian state motieka told the 
congress of peoples deputies or parliament 
drawing a parallel with romania where president nicolae 
ceausescu was overthrown friday motieka said we also have a 
dictator moscow if the soviet union is building a government of 
laws well legality and occupation dont go together 
the challenge by motieka a lawyer came two days after the 
lithuanian communist party voted to declare itself independent from 
its mother party in moscow 
it was the first time a delegate from one of the restive baltic 
republics used the national parliament to advance demands for full 
independence and it marked the latest step in the baltic 
progression from calls for sovereignty to outright secession 
after motiekas speech lithuanian deputy vytautas landsbergis 
said the lithuanian parliament had already created a commission 
that is working on the steps necessary for the baltic state to 
achieve independence motiekas appeal stemmed from that 
commissions work said landsbergis head of the lithuanian 
peoples front known as sajudis 
president mikhail s gorbachev responded sharply to the 
lithuanian communist partys decision wednesday to separate from 
the soviet communist party 
gorbachev sent a message to lithuanian communists on thursday 
saying their decision could only be assessed as a step aimed at 
the split of the lithuanian communist party from the soviet 
communist party 
his message said the ruling politburo would convene an emergency 
meeting soon to address the move 
landsbergis said he thought the lithuanian communist partys 
decision to secede was a normal step in perestroika 
delegates from the baltic republics have been struggling for the 
last two days over congress plans to create a committee to rule on 
conflicts between local laws passed in the republics and national 
soviet law 
baltic deputies object that because they were unlawfully 
incorporated into the soviet union they should not be forced to 
comply with moscows laws baltic deputies say it makes no sense to 
establish a committee to oversee a constitution that is being 
rewritten as the country reforms 
a committee that developed the legislation offered a compromise 
that would limit the constitutional oversight commissions right to 
review certain ethnic issues but baltic republics said the wording 
of the compromise was too vague it was sent back to the committee

khmer rouge guerrillas friday claimed 
to have captured the third district capital since vietnams troop 
withdrawal from cambodia three months ago according to the 
guerrilla radio 
the voice of the national army of democratic kampuchea said the 
guerrillas had been besieging the area around the town of anlung 
veng since midnovember 
on the 19th and 20th of december our cambodian national 
resistance forces launched an offensive to destroy and completely 
liberate the strategic anlung veng position said a transcript of 
the radio report seen in bangkok 
if true the seizure of anlung veng would one of the most 
important khmer rouge victories since their seizure of the western 
town and district capital of pailin oct 22 
the khmer rouge also say they have taken the district seat of 
samlot 
the radio said anlung veng had protected the entire government 
defense network along the dangrek mountain range which marks the 
border between cambodia and thailand 
the attack and liberation of this position has basically 
dismantled the networks defending the positions of the vietnamese 
enemies and their puppets along the dangrek mountain range it 
said 
the guerrillas also claimed they had attacked and swept 
other positions along route 69 and to the south and east of anlung 
veng 
the communist khmer rouge is the strongest of the guerrilla 
factions fighting the government vietnam installed in phnom penh 
after its late1978 invasion 
the invasion ended a 3year reign of terror by the khmer rouge 
in which hundreds of thousands of cambodians were killed 
since hanois avowed lateseptember troop withdrawal the 
guerrillas have launched big attacks and seized several towns in 
the northwestern part of the country the khmer rouge maintain that 
hanois withdrawal was a trick and that tens of thousands of 
disguised vietnamese soliders remain in the country 
the radio report said the area around anlung veng was defended 
by the vietnamese 302nd division and government soldiers from the 
4th military region

a prosecutor calls it witchcraft and a 
psychologist says its as reliable as a coin toss 
after years of debate court rulings and federal legislation 
use of the polygraph has dropped sharply despite supporters who 
insist the test is a good indicator of whether someone is telling a 
lie 
they have been useless and give misleading information said 
leonard saxe a visiting professor of psychology at brandeis 
university and a leading opponent of polygraph testing they 
suggest whether youre guilty or innocent you might as well flip a 
coin 
last week the state supreme court banned lie detector tests 
from being introduced as evidence in criminal trials massachusetts 
had been one of the last remaining states that gave defendants the 
right to use polygraphs to support their alibis 
the court noting polygraph studies have shown success rates 
varying from 95 percent to just above 50 percent said there 
remains no consensus among experts as to the accuracy of polygraph 
testing to detect deceit 
the court was not alone in deciding against polygraphs which 
attempt to determine someones honesty by their physiological 
response to certain questions 
last year congress prohibited most private sector employers 
from using lie dectectors to screen job applicants or randomly test 
workers 
exempted from the rules were federal state and local 
governments firms that do sensitive work for agencies like the cia 
and fbi companies that provide security services and those that 
make or distribute controlled substances 
i think its appropriate to seek if someone is lying and the 
most appropriate way is to seek evidence said judy crockett who 
fought on behalf of the federal law for the american civil 
liberties union polygraphs tend to be an attempt to shortcut 
investigations 
the federal law which took effect a year ago has taken a big 
bite out of the polygraph business 
theres been a definite decline in the private sector said 
chris fausett product manager for lafayette instrument co based 
in lafayette ind one of the countrys largest makers of 
polygraph machines 
he declined to give specific numbers but he said the drop was 
about as sharp as you can get 
no doubt businesses have had to abandon 7580 percent of 
polygraph tests said joseph buckley a spokesman for the 
american polygraph association a trade group based in chattanooga 
tenn 
buckley said his group had about 3000 members a year ago but 
the number has dropped by a third a lot of them had to change 
careers he said 
however these trends do not mean polygraph testing is dead 
law enforcement agencies use lie detectors to interview 
witnesses when investigating crimes 
the department of defense uses polygraph testing to search for 
spies and also to screen job applicants if something suspicious 
arises in background checks said spokesman jim turner 
reading from a defense department statement regarding the use of 
polygraphs turner said 
in all instances the polygraph exam process produced data of 
important security or criminal significance which was not otherwise 
obtainable it was also invaluable in establishing the innocence of 
people confronted with serious accusations 
many states allow polygraph evidence to be introduced if both 
the prosecution and defense agree 
new mexico is the one state where either party can introduce a 
polygraph examination as evidence with the trial judge deciding 
whether the tests meet certain standards but not everyone in the 
state supports it 
timothy cornish a prosecutor in the new mexico attorney 
generals office called polygraph exams witchcraft 
it can if used in an unbridled way change the entire 
truthseeking process he said it replaces the jury 
david raskin a university of utah psychologist often called 
upon to support polygraphs in the courtroom said he favored the 
federal law because lie detectors were being misused to predict 
future performance in the workplace but he said they are reliable 
tools in determining someones past actions 
every piece of evidence has a dose of uncertainty raskin 
said jurors are very cautious with polygraph evidence they are 
overly skeptical they do not ignore other evidence and concentrate 
on the polygraph

failure of us troops to achieve complete 
surprise in their attack in panama resulted in the disappearance of 
substantial forces loyal to ousted leader gen manuel antonio 
noriega sen sam nunn dga said today 
reporting on a threehour briefing by pentagon officials nunn 
and sen john warner rva said substantial amount of cocaine and 
cash were seized in noriegas personal headquarters in panama city 
noriega faces drugtrafficking charges in the united states 
nunn and warner the chairman and ranking republican member 
respectively of the senate armed services committee noted that 
noriega last year had been given the opportunity to leave panama 
and go to a country from which he could not be extradited to the 
united states 
he was given the opportunity to shove off and go to another 
nation and spend his dollars and not come back warner said 
warner said noriegas refusal of the offer to leave the country 
was evidence of irrationality 
his psychology his neurotic tendencies were beginning to 
overcome him and destabilize him to the extent that he pushed 
those options aside hunkered down and determined to cross that 
line which he had adhered to in the past of not seeking americans 
as targets of opportunity warner said 
the diplomatic initiative came not just from the united states 
but from other countries as well warner said 
because of that downturn and noriegas increased 
irrationality and attacks against americans president bush 
had every reason to believe violence was going to escalate if he 
did not act nunn said 
he said an exhaustive search is continuing but we did not 
have noriega pegged down and he is still at large 
nunn said that while there was some surprise in the us attacks 
that began at 1 am wednesday it was not complete and that at 
least two companies of panamanian troops are entirely unaccounted 
for 
he said some troops and members of noriegas paramilitary force 
known as the dignity battalions have dispersed into the 
countryside where he said thuggery and violence are going on 
he described the forces as armed and certainly very dangerous 
nunn said it is obvious that american military police will have 
to be used in panama to stop looting and restore order if that 
kind of chaos and looting goes on i think americans will be looked 
at by the panamanian people with increased distaste he said 
nunn said the administration intends to speed economic aid to 
panama adding that it is important that we get food in there 
very quickly 
army lt gen tom kelly director of operations for the joint 
chiefs of staff and other defense officials conducted the 
congressional briefing 
nunn said the briefing which lasted more than three hours 
reinforced his earlier view that bush was fully justified in 
ordering the invasion he cited noriegas increasing 
irrationality and said more american lives might have been lost 
had bush not acted 
nunn was critical however of the reagan administrations 
indictment of noriega on drug charges last year saying he thought 
the move was illconsidered and had led to unnecessary trouble 
looking at lessons learned when the justice department 
indicts someone they ought to know what they are going to do 
next nunn said i hope the justice department will learn a 
lesson out of this

federal investigators are conducting an 
international search for assets they say manuel antonio noriega 
amassed from drug trafficking the justice department said friday 
financial documents among records seized by us troops in 
noriegas offices at the panamanian defense forces compound may 
help authorities trace assets and bank holdings stashed in foreign 
countries said spokesman david runkel 
we believe there are assets and we are checking records to 
determine where those assets are currently located runkel said 
our concern is for assets resulting from illegal drug trading by 
noriega whom runkel described an international thug 
the panamanian government would be interested in assets of mr 
noriega which resulted from the looting of the public treasury 
he said adding the records may contain such evidence 
we have been in contact with foreign governments and financial 
institutions as well as people here to trace bank accounts and 
other holdings runkel said 
so far two foreign governments which runkel would not 
identify are cooperating if the documents are useful as evidence 
they will be turned over to federal prosecutors runkel said 
noriega is accused in two separate us federal indictments of 
pocketing 10 million in bribes and drug profits he received in 
return for allowing colombian drug lords to use panama as a base 
for smuggling and money laundering 
justice department officials said the us invasion has 
eliminated panama as a base of operations for the colombian cartels 
the cartels mobility is obviously narrowed said frank 
shults a spokesman for the drug enforcement administration the 
flexibility they have to move large and vast sums of money has been 
restricted 
also seized at the compound was 110 pounds of cocaine with an 
estimated street value of 125 million the white house said 
friday 
meanwhile officials familiar with the noriega case say that if 
he is captured he will use his dealings as a cia informant to try 
to scuttle us drug charges against him however sources say that 
justice department prosecutors are confident that the threatened 
exposure of intelligence secrets in open court wont hobble the 
cases 
prosecutors expect noriega would try to use the same 
graymail tactics successfully employed by lawyers for former 
white house aide oliver l north and other irancontra defendants 
said the sources who spoke on condition of anonymity 
defense lawyers in the irancontra cases won court rulings 
requiring the disclosure of secrets the government was unwilling to 
release that resulted in the dismissal of major irancontra 
conspiracy charges against north and others 
the justice department has decided noriega would be prosecuted 
first in miami on charges of helping colombias medellin drug 
cartel smuggle cocaine through this country he also faces federal 
charges in tampa fla of conspiring to smuggle marijuana through 
panama 
the secrecy issues surrounding noriegas case were discussed 
last week at a meeting held at the justice department by 
prosecutors and senior officials in the criminal division 
one official termed the secrecy problems in noriegas case 
manageable but quickly conceded that irancontra prosecutor 
lawrence e walsh probably took the same view of the north case 
before noriega was indicted in 1988 prosecutors consulted with 
the cia and other intelligence agencies said one government 
source those agencies posed no objections to proceeding with the 
case 
the government is prepared to offer evidence to refute an 
expected claim by noriega that his alleged drug activities were 
sanctioned by the us government because he was a cia informant 
the source said 
prosecutors will argue that just because noriega may have been 
an informant for the cia or the dea he is not immune from criminal 
prosecution the source said 
if convicted of all the charges noriega faces a possible 
sentence of 145 years in prison and more than 11 million in fines

turner jr who suffered a concussion when a bullet grazed his 
helmet 
he saw one of his friends killed mrs turner said he 
cried quite a bit 
her sons injury failed to shake mrs turners support for the 
invasion though 
i definitely think that noriega is one of the main runners 
of drugs the mother said because of this awful man the drugs 
are so heavy in our country 
military officials said medical procedures were running 
smoothly the soldiers were in good spirits and many of them may be 
cleared to return to their units today 
theyre taking it very well if theres a predominant feeling 
that these men have its that they wish that they were back there

surgery at wilford hall

nicolae ceausescu imposed sacrifice on 
all romanians except his chosen few and established a personality 
cult the like of which has not been seen in eastern europe since 
josef stalin 
his severity earned him the nickname draculescu for bram 
stokers bloodthirsty count of transylvania 
absolute power and the cult were his twin props as he pursued 
nationalist policies strayed from the soviet line in foreign 
dealings and ultimately deprived his oppressed people of even 
lifes basic necessities 
he invested billions of dollars in a crash industrialization 
program and rigidly followed a policy of domestic austerity to pay 
off romanias entire foreign debt of 11 billion 
food and energy shortages were pervasive despair spread among 
the nations 23 million people as hardships became more severe 
through the 1980s and in the end not even the ubiquitous secret 
police or the army could keep them down 
as his 24 years of autocratic rule ground along increasing 
opposition arose to ceausescu the customary star of the daily two 
hours of romanian television and his crackdowns on dissent grew 
harsher 
about 30000 coal miners in the jiu valley struck in 1977 
a decade later in brasov at least 10000 workers demonstrated 
demanding freedom better living conditions and ceasuescus 
dismissal police arrested hundreds of the protesters and their 
leaders disappeared in mysterious circumstances 
on dec 17 his security forces opened fire on thousands of 
demonstrators in timisoara who demanded freedom and a better life 
beginning the chain of events that brought him down reports 
indicated thousands of unarmed civilians may have been killed in 
the transylvanian city 
as democratic reform spread through the soviet bloc ceausescu 
71 stuck to rigid communist orthodoxy 
the triumph of the revolution requires unity severe 
discipline and a spirit of sacrifice he told a bucharest mass 
meeting this year a firm organization is needed as well as a 
tested political leader who knows how to unite and lead the 
masses 
his firm organization was the romanian communist party 
which he had turned into a personal instrument since taking over in 
1965 and a vast network of security forces 
he had gradually pushed aside all leaders who opposed his 
policies and installed loyalists on the ruling 23member politburo 
they included his wife elena who became the second most powerful 
person in romania 
ceausescu began building his personality cult in earnest after 
1974 when he made himself the first president in romanias history 
his pictures and sayings lined the streets of bucharest and 
other cities bookstores were filled with works attributed to him 
when he became president in march 1974 an official picture 
showed him holding a silver scepter as the symbol of authority the 
propaganda line was the golden era of ceausescu even when the 
country that had been known as europes breadbasket became one of 
its poorest 
secret police kept a strict rein on religion and political 
expression ceausescu said warsaw pact allies that pursued reform 
were abandoning communism and romania became isolated in the east 
as well as the west 
the united states and other western powers originally had 
encouraged ceausescus relatively independent stand within the 
soviet bloc two us presidents visited bucharest richard m 
nixon in 1969 and gerald r ford in 1975 
britain made him an honorary knight and norway gave ceausescu 
and his wife the honorary grand cross of st olav the awards were 
withdrawn friday 
ceausescu continued diplomatic relations with israel when the 
rest of the soviet bloc broke them in in 1967 he denounced the 
sovietled invasion that crushed czecholsovakias reforms of 1968 
his was the only east bloc country to send athletes to the 1984 
summer olympics in los angeles breaking the soviet boycott 
he also looked to the west commercially and the united states 
was for a time romanias biggest western trade partner largely 
because it granted most favored nation trading status 
criticism of ceausescus human rights abuses grew however and 
relations with the west deteriorated 
at home ceausescu exhorted romanians to work hard and imposed 
a sixday work week on nearly everybody despite shortages of food 
medicine and heat in winter 
he was worse than hitler who for all his crimes at least 
sincerely wished the welfare of germany said mircea stoica a 
law professor at bucharest university who fled to hungary 
ceausescu hates his people and his wife elena has often referred 
to romanians as worms 
he also took care of his family mrs ceausescu was vice premier 
and their son nicu was a regional party chief valentin an 
adopted son zoiaelena their daughter and ceausescu brothers 
marin ilie ion and nicolae andruta were given important jobs as 
were several inlaws 
romanian and western sources say about 40 relatives were in the 
party and government state hierarchy 
ceausescu was born jan 26 1918 in scornicesti the third son 
of a large peasant family he did not finish elementary school and 
was apprenticed as a shoemaker 
he later worked in a factory and joined the illegal communist 
party youth organization at age 15 becoming a full party member 
three years later in 1936 
communist activities landed ceausescu in jail several times 
before and during world war ii he became a protege of communist 
party chief gheorghe gheorghiudej rose quickly through the ranks 
and succeeded to the party leadership after gheorghiudejs death

tens of thousands of people surged through 
two new berlin wall openings friday and celebrated at the 
brandenburg gate a monument to german unity that became a symbol 
of division when the wall went up in 1961 
the new passages immediately north and south of the towering 
gate were opened at 3 pm in a ceremony attended by chancellor 
helmut kohl of west germany and the east german premier hans 
modrow 
berliners rushed through them back and forth then uncorked of 
champagne and drank to the famous landmark that was sealed inside 
east berlin for 28 years 
security on both sides collapsed as the vast crowd broke through 
metal barriers and rushed to the gate filling the vast paris 
square where people hugged each other and danced together 
a sea of people who had waited patiently for hours in 
intermittent rain surrounded the 200yearold sandstone monument 
west berlin police said about 30000 people gathered on the 
western side before the gate was opened the crowd on the eastern 
side appeared much larger but there were no official estimates of 
its size 
more than 20 crossings have been cut through the wall since east 
germany opened its borders nov 9 but the freeing of the 
brandenburg gate was the emotional climax of the coming together of 
a people divided since the end of world war ii 
in addition to being cut off from west berliners the gate also 
was inaccessible to east berliners until friday because it lay in 
the offlimits east german border zone 
flags of berlin west germany and east germany flew above the 
huge crowd several people who climbed the wall held up a sign 
saying come together 
hundreds of people climbed atop the thick section of wall that 
remains directly in front of the gate dancing and hugging in 
chaotic scenes reminiscent of november 
kohl called the opening of the gate a fantastic thing 
he and modrow met at 3 pm on the border shook hands and 
walked together to a platform to address the crowd they were 
nearly mobbed by the exultant crowd 
national television of both countries broadcast the event 
this is where the heart of berlin pounds said a commentator 
for the zdf network of west germany 
modrow said the historic brandenburg gates new function should 
be to serve the peace 
the speeches were drowned out by the mass of people many with 
tears in their eyes shouting with joy 
peter rebachmann a 42yearold east berliner said the last 
time i was here was as a kid when i used to play on this very 
spot i never thought id come here again its really wonderful 
its great but its too bad my father didnt live to see 
it said hans achtzehnig another resident of east berlin 
what a beautiful christmas present said a middleaged woman 
who did not give her name 
several signs carried by the crowd called for german unity a 
demand made by a growing number of participants in east german 
demonstrations 
berlin one city one nation said one sign 
people on the eastern side of the wall greeted kohl with shouts 
of helmut helmut he and modrow announced the agreement to 
open the gate during a visit kohl made to east germany on tuesday 
and wednesday 
thousands of people cheered and set off firecrackers earlier 
when east german workers began knocking the new holes in the wall 
the brandenburg gate its battlescarred columns are topped with 
a bronze chariot of the goddess victory in a chariot was the 
backdrop for adolf hitlers rise to power and his last stand it 
also was where east german workers began an uprising in 1953 that 
was crushed by soviet tanks 
in east berlin the unter den linden boulevard ends at the gate 
on the western side the avenue that leads to the gate was renamed 
june 17 for the date of the uprising 
nazi brown shirts made a triumphant torchlit parade through 
the gate when hitler was named chancellor on jan 30 1933 
in the final days of world war ii the sixcolumn gate five 
stories high was badly damaged when soviet tanks closed in on 
hitlers bunker in the chancellery it marked the border between 
the soviet and british sectors when the victorious allies divided 
berlin into four sectors

us helicopters rescued an 11member 
smithsonian institution research team friday morning from a jungle 
where they had been taken by troops loyal to gen manuel antonio 
noriega 
the group including a 4yearold girl was taken from an island 
laboratory and put on a forced march into the jungle by 30 infantry 
soldiers who then abandoned them without food or shoes 
the worst part was walking down the main landing strip off to 
the side and into the woods everybody thought they were going to 
shoot us said steve travers a marine biologist with the 
smithsonian group 
nancy knowlton another scientist said the group expected 
trouble because of the us invasion when it saw a panamanian 
patrol boat heading for the laboratory wednesday morning 
the research team talked the soldiers into letting them grab a 
few belongings before they were hurriedly taken ashore they 
managed to sneak out three twoway radios with which they would 
later guide us armed forces to their location for rescue 
greg summers another member of the group said they were taken 
by boat to the airfield and then into the jungle they walked from 
11 am wednesday until 1 am thursday he said 
we really didnt know we were going to be walking halfway 
across panama knowlton said at one point it appeared to the 
hostages that their captors feared that they themselves were 
isolated when word reached them that americans were in control of 
panama city they asked their captives to tell the american troops 
that the researchers had been taken into protective custody then 
the group was abandoned on thursday 
using the radios they had hidden the group contacted 
smithsonian officials in panama city 
lt col joseph umbarger who coordinated the rescue said at 
first the us military thought the situation might be a potential 
trap but then sent three helicopters on a dangerous nighttime 
search over the jungle about 20 to 25 miles north of panama city 
although the pilots scoured the area for hours the initial aerial 
search team was forced to return without the hostages when their 
fuel ran low 
the group received help from a school teacher who on friday 
morning started taking them in a flatbed truck to the town of 
chepo a second flight of helicopters which took off at dawn from 
fort clayton spotted them in transit when they jumped off the 
truck and waved their clothing in a prearranged pattern to tip off 
the soldiers 
that was a fantastic moment seeing the helicopters come 
said travers

westinghouse electric corp is considering 
appealing for an increase in the 39 million bonus it won for 
running the savannah river nuclear weapons plant despite safety 
lapses such as workers sleeping on the job an energy department 
official said friday 
westinghouse officials at the south carolina plant however 
said there were no plans to appeal 
stephen a wakefield the departments general counsel said 
westinghouse president paul e lego told energy secretary james d 
watkins in a meeting earlier this week that the company was 
considering contesting the amount of the award 
i know theyre considering it wakefield said in an 
interview in his office adding that lego gave no indication that a 
firm decision had been made 
at the savannah river plant near aiken sc westinghouse 
spokesman jack herman said james moore president of the 
westinghouse subsidiary that operates the facility told him 
friday theres no intention to appeal 
we view this as a fait accompli herman said in reference to 
the departments decision announced earlier this week to give the 
company 39 million out of a maximum possible award fee of 75 
million for its first six months as operator 
wakefield said westinghouse was unhappy that it had been docked 
so heavily for not meeting the energy departments expectations for 
improving the plants performance 
westinghouse which runs all or parts of five other energy 
department weapons plants took over from ei du pont de nemours amp 
co at savannah river last april amid rising public criticism of 
environmental health and safety problems in the weapons complex 
savannah rivers three nuclear reactors which are the nations 
only source of tritium needed to make nuclear warheads have been 
closed down for more than a year for safety reasons westinghouse 
has been conducting a massive overhaul of the plant in preparation 
for restarting the reactors next year 
in a letter dec 13 pw kaspar does manager of the savannah 
river operations office told moore that although westinghouse had 
made some important improvements its overall approach to 
instilling more discipline in plant operations was too narrow and 
not yet effective 
kaspar said the company had not adequately reacted to 
anomalies throughout the site among the anomalies cited were 
employees found asleep when they were supposed to have been 
monitoring the testing of cooling pipes at one of the reactors 
westinghouse said unspecified disciplinary action was taken 
against the two workers found asleep they were not fired 
another problem cited by kaspar was that westinghouse employees 
had intentionally disabled alarms meant to detect excessive 
radiation the company said two employees recently were fired for 
tampering with alarms one in a reactor area 
wakefield said westinghouses displeasure with the amount of its 
bonus payment did not indicate that the contract relationship was 
deteriorating he said savannah river operations had improved 
greatly since westinghouse took over last april and that no one 
was aware then of how bad the problems there were 
westinghouse found a much more difficult situation there than 
they expected or than we expected said wakefield du pont had 
really let the place run down

american military leaders today called on 
panamanian police to join with them in restoring order in the 
beleagured country urging officers once loyal to gen manuel 
antonio noriega to return to work for the new government 
lt gen tom kelly said he hoped local police would work side by 
side with us military police the primary endeavor of the 
movement is to clear panama city and assist the government in 
restoring law and order he said 
kelly director of operations for the joint chiefs of staff 
spoke at a pentagon briefing at which he also said it might take 
five to 10 days for the us troops to restore aide and raised the 
possibility that even more american troops might be sent to panama 
the comments by kelly and others suggested that what us 
officials repeatedly have referred to as a mopping up operation 
was far from over 
in an interview thursday defense secretary dick cheney said the 
bush administration intends to maintain a signficant military 
presence in panama to restore a condition of normalcy even if 
some us troops are withdrawn relatively quickly after this weeks 
massive strike 
cheney said us troops in panama city were not trying to hold 
every street corner were moving to areas where there 
continues to be resistance or where there is a need for presence 
were not attempting to occupy the entire city because we 
dont have that many troops down there he said 
gen colin powell chairman of the joint chiefs of staff said 
the principal goal for the us military forces is to restore a 
semblance of civic order i still think were in the moppingup 
phase with respect to resistance from forces loyal to deposed 
dictator manuel antonio noriega he said 
cheney acknowledged that us troops were still involved in 
conflict and firefights in panama city well into the second day 
of the american intervention 
as of this morning the us military casualty count stood at 20 
killed in action 202 wounded and two missing in addition two 
civilian american women were reported killed the pentagon said 122 
members of the panamanian defense forces were killed and 45 were 
wounded 
cheney said the operation was enormously successful during 
its first 36 hours even though noriega had eluded capture both 
the defense secretary and powell appeared somewhat weary but spent 
more than 30 minutes answering reporters questions 
president bush said us troops would pursue noriega as long 
as it takes and said the nations commitment to the operation in 
panama was openended 
neither the secretary nor the fourstar general would provide 
any details of the manhunt for noriega except to say they believed 
he still was in panama us officials have offered a 1 million 
bounty for the deposed leader 
powell said that while there still appeared to be resistance by 
noriega loyalists in panama city for the most part it is 
disorganized resistance it will dry up over time the 
fourstar general said he did not believe the resistance was 
under the direction of a central command 
the defense secretary pledged to get us forces in panama home 
as quickly as we can but he also said the date would stay open 
as long as noriega remained at large and civil unrest continued 
the secretary said that over time as the government of 
guillermo endara demonstrates it is there to stay all the 
violence will cease and well get back to a condition of 
normalcy 
the secretary noted that the 9500 military personnel sent into 
panama was a supplemental force to the 13000 who are permanently 
based there 
when we went in we did not know precisely how long we would 
have to stay and we still dont know that cheney said noting 
that the us military has a right to be in the country under the 
panama canal treaties 
so even after we bring out those forces that were sent in 
there will still be a significant military presence in panama he 
said 
cheney acknowledged the possibility of individual terrorist 
strikes and the taking of us hostages 
clearly we havent resolved all the potential situations 
where there may be americans being held cheney said we are 
aggressively working every one of those cases 
both men argued that nabbing noriega was not the primary 
objective of the mission the nations largest military endeavor 
since the vietnam war 
our purpose was not to snatch noriega our purpose was to 
safeguard american lives safeguard american interests under the 
panama canal treaty help restore democracy in panama cheney 
said adding wed love to get mr noriega were going to 
continue to work on that and we may in fact be able to do that 
too

one exiled romanian dissident said friday that 
nicolae ceausescu had lost touch with reality while another 
said he was ready to return to help shape his countrys future 
i am ready to assume my responsibility and to save my 
people mihai botez said in an interview from new york city 
botez a mathematician and economic planner exiled by ceausescu 
in 1987 said all political scenarios are open for romanias 
future but one model is over and thats stalinism 
a former economic adviser to the romanian government before he 
fell out of favor 10 years before his exile botez said he would 
like to see the country develop a strong private sector although 
some socialist nationalized enterprises will remain at first 
vladimir tismaneanu a resident scholar at the foreign policy 
research institute in philadelphia said that when ceausescu 
ordered troops to fire on antigovernment protesters last week it 
was a clear indication that ceausescu had completely lost touch 
with reality 
ceausescus cult of personality and megalomania during his 
24year reign were compounded by his wife elenas 
idiosyncracies tismaneanu said 
corneliu manescu the 73yearold former foreign minister who 
assumed leadership of a provisional government in romania after 
ceausescu fled is ill and will probably only serve as a 
transitional leader until free elections are held tismaneanu said 
but ion iliescu a former central committee secretary ousted by 
ceausescu in 1971 would likely play a major role in the new order 
in romania he said 
iliescu who announced friday that a national salvation 
front had been set up to rule the country was a classmate of 
soviet leader mikhail gorbachev at moscow state university in the 
1950s tismaneanu said 
botez who has been a guest scholar at several us think tanks 
and universities since his departure from romania was achieved with 
the help of the state department says he has not been able to 
contact his wife since he left romania 
his wife also a prominent dissident has been under house 
arrest as he was for several months before leaving romania 
the first priority botez said is to supply food and clothing 
to romanians and stop the desperate suffering 
the foreign ministers of the european community pledged 
immediate aid to romania on friday and the international committee 
for the red cross dispatched two planes carrying 4 tons of medical 
supplies to bucharest

the organization of american states in a rare 
move closed ranks formally against the united states on friday for 
invading panama a state department spokesman said we are 
outraged 
a predawn oas vote followed a marathon emergency session that 
began wednesday hours after thousands of us troops assaulted 
panama and attempted to capture dictator manuel antonio noriega 
oas members cast aside nicaraguan and panamanian calls for 
condemnation approving instead a resolution to deeply regret the 
military intervention in panama and call for the withdrawal of 
troops used in the us action it did not specify a timetable 
the written resolution was considerably milder than the oral 
debates in which even staunch us allies spoke out against the 
invasion but it was the first time since the socalled tuna wars 
along south americas pacific coast in early 1970s that the oas 
issued such a strong document against an american action 
the united states however said it opposed any type of rebuff 
we are outraged state department spokesman richard boucher 
said it is unacceptable 
a prepared state department statement said we are 
disappointed that the oas missed an historic opportunity to get 
beyond its traditional narrow concern over nonintervention the 
resolution is unbalanced it does not cite the root problem 
noriega it also fails to recognize the threat to americans in 
noriegas state of war declaration our panama canal treaty 
rights and our sovereign right to selfdefense 
the state department statement noted that the language of the 
resolution was to regret rather than condemn the spanish 
version of the resolution however translates closer to deeply 
deplore 
thats how they sold it to the caribbean nations said a 
state department official who asked not to be identified 
shastri ali the no 2 at the trinidad and tobago embassy said 
friday what we voted in favor of was to deeply regret it seems 
we agreed to different things 
john maisto the us deputy permanent representative to the 
oas earlier called the final resolution a mixed bag were a 
little disappointed it certainly wasnt an extreme resolution but 
its a little detached from what is really happening in panama 
the oas approved the resolution on a 201 vote abstentions came 
from el salvador honduras venezuela antigua and barbuda costa 
rica and guatemala 
the resolution noted the serious events in panama 
especially the armed clashes resulting from the military 
intervention by the united states and the deplorable loss of lives 
and property 
the state department statement said part of the explanation 
for the resolution was that the rightful representative of the 
new panamanian government was not at the meeting 
the oas members rebuffed a request by panamas newly installed 
president guillermo endara to seat his appointed representative 
noriega loyalist jose maria cabrera spoke out repeatedly against 
the criminal abuse by the united states 
us ambassador luigi einaudi cast the only negative vote on the 
motion outlined by peru brazil mexico colombia uruguay and 
argentina 
he failed on an 114 vote with two abstentions to add to the 
resolution a mention that the oas charter itself allows each nation 
the right of selfdefense 
einaudi said that once noriega declared a state of war against 
the united states us officials clearly have the legitimate 
right of selfdefense 
the ambassador also said the united states has tried to work out 
a peacefully solution of the panamanian situation through the oas 
but it is impossible to reason with a dictator at the end 
noriega has got what he deserved 
a us attempt to label the invasion a military action 
failed with only three votes among the 26 delegates who attended 
the 17hour debate and negotiation only honduras and costa rica 
supported the united states

200 dead bodies in the basement and he heard from a colleague of 
about 60 more in gorgas hospital run by the us southern command 
among the bodies was that of spanish photographer juan 
rodriguez who was killed by us troops near the marriott hotel 
and a peruvian military attache officials said 
miranda said the hospitals 21 wards were so full that some of 
the lessseriously wounded were sleeping on the floors 
all 21 wards of the hospital were full and one official 
estimated there were 1000 wounded in the hospital they said that 
while many of noriegas troops wear civilian clothes they believed 
most of the victims they had seen were civilians 
they said most of the injuries were caused by flying glass and 
bullets 
us troops visited the hospital during the morning saying they 
were just checking according to two nurses 
doctors and nurses were working on 16 and even 24hour shifts 
and the hospital was very short of food they are all very tense 
besides everything not only is there no transportation but the 
staff is scared to go outside he added

president bush hugged a group of children with 
aids assuring one youngster that a cure will be found and then 
handed out christmas candy during a tour of aids wards friday at 
the national institutes of health 
i hope they find a cure for aids brett lykins a 9yearold 
who suffers from the disease told bush as the president and mrs 
bush sat in a circle with six young aids patients 
ill bet it happens bush said 
both the president and his wife wished each child a merry 
christmas and twice bush embraced a youngster in a grandfatherly 
hug mrs bush also held several of the children 
has there been a change toward a more compassionate view 
toward aids in the communities bush asked at one point 
vonzella johnson sitting beside the president and holding her 
2yearold daughter said that she hadnt experienced that 
compassion in her hometown of painesville ohio 
she said shes received little help or support at home 
im going to move because i have other kids she said 
mrs johnson said that both she and her daughter mary 
catherine are infected and that the nih clinics offered their 
only hope 
this place is a blessing she said 
kevin charles porter an 11yearold from jacksonville fla 
said he had been on a new aids drug called ddi for four months 
how do you feel the president asked like when you wake 
up in the morning or does it just depend 
the boy ducked his head and his father charles porter spoke up 
our son has shown great improvement he said what wed 
like is a strong committment from you to help not just these kids 
but lots of kids with aids everywhere 
we certainly want to do that bush said good luck to 
you 
the children presented the bushes with sweatshirts decorated 
with a drawing of a rising sun 
dr phil pizzo who is in charge of the pediatric clinic said 
the drawing was by a child who had died of aids 
we offer it in his memory pizzo said 
bush took a goldwrapped package from an aide and said it could 
be opened after he left then he changed his mind and removed the 
wrapping to reveal a sealed box of candy 
he started to open the box but mrs bush shaking her head 
spoke up 
i dont think the doctors will like that she said 
george this is very dangerous 
the president opened the box anyway and then grinned like a 
happy santa as he handed the children small white boxes each 
printed with an american flag and the presidential seal the small 
boxes were filled with mampm candies 
bush and his party earlier visited a ward of adult aids patients 
later during a brief speech in a packed auditorium bush told 
nih doctors nurses and other aids workers that only together can 
we wage an allout war against this terrible killer 
he praised the healthcare workers and said i am with you and 
extraordinarily grateful for what you are doing 
bush called for educating americans who dont want to help 
dont want to become involved because of a misplaced fear 
theyre afraid of holding an aids patient because theyre 
frightened of getting aids he said barbara and i want to say 
and we hope we can continue to demonstrate this they are wrong 
theyre simply uninformed they are wrong about that 
bush mrs bush health and human services secretary louis 
sullivan and his wife along with george bush jr flew by 
helicopter to bethesda naval hospital and were taken across a 
street by motorcade for the 90minute visit to nih 
just before the presidential party arrived a military unit of 
about 30 men in camouflage combat uniforms deployed around the 
helipad spacing themselves in a protective formation facing a 
wooded area a parking lot and the street 
they remained there in the bitter cold until the presidents 
helicopter lifted off taking the presidential party toward camp

folks in the midwest and east got more snow 
and cold than they wanted but at least it was free in sunny 
southern california residents can buy artificial snow for their 
yard but it sets em back 100 a ton plus labor and delivery 
charges 
maurice gonzalez 32 of suburban canoga park was one of more 
than two dozen customers who paid an ice company to pretend they 
were having a white christmas for a couple of days this season his 
5inch snowfall really pulverized ice was put down wednesday 
we had a lot of people stopping by with kids gonzalez said 
thursday they play with it grab a little bit to show their 
parents its fun just watching them with daytime temperatures 
around 70 the snow was down to a few patches by late thursday 
gonzales said the fun factor made it worth the cost which came 
out to about 100 per inch on his size yard the family also has 
put up such decorations as a santa claus with reindeer a nativity 
scene and figures of a boy and girl sledding 
i didnt really plan to do all this this year it just kind 
of happens gonzalez said if you have kids you just start 
doing things and you get in the spirit of christmas 
jeff lucas a driver for north hollywood ice co said the 
company uses mobile ice crushers to pulverize 300pound blocks of 
ice and blowers to spray the fine particles across the yard 
its the same grade as snow said lucas we lay it on so 
thick itll last a while even in the sun 
the company has delivered yuletide snowondemand since the 
1970s and got more than 25 residential orders this year manager

a listing in the local telephone 
book for rudolph reindeer is actually an unlisted phone number at 
nearby fort carson an apparent christmas prank that has gone 
little noticed for seven years 
the telephone number complete with nonexistent address was 
assigned to rudolph on dec 16 1982 said abel chavez a spokesman 
for u s west communications the number is one of thousands 
assigned to fort carson 
it was a humorous stunt i would guess chavez said its 
kind of amazing that its lasted this long and was not brought to 
our attention 
it was also kind of amazing to fort carson officials who said 
few people called the number asking for rudolph until a news 
story about it was published friday 
it was supposed to be unlisted said spokeswoman ann smith 
how it got in the phone book we dont know i think theres 
somebody with a silly sense of humor 
the base has nearly 6000 telephone numbers assigned to 
different departments as needed smith said rudolphs number 
has been assigned to a weather station in a trailer on the base 
since 1987 smith said she was not sure which department had the 
number in 1982 
a newspaper story about the listing friday prompted a flurry of 
calls to the weather trailer said sgt mike howard base spokesman 
they have received about 100 calls from children to 
grandparents the people who work in the trailer provide 
meteorological information for fort carson units this morning 
they spent their morning answering the telephone 
chavez said its too late to get it out of the 1990 phone book 
but it will be pulled from future editions

exiled king michael of romania said friday hes 
ready to return to his country as head of a constitutional monarchy 
if the people want me to come back 
i have been waiting for this for 40 years he told a news 
conference convened hastily after the reported overthrow of 
president nicolae ceausescu if people want me to come back of 
course i will come back 
romania has had a constitutional monarchy before the war and 
it proved itself he said if things turn the right way i dont 
see why this could not happen again 
michael 68 left his country in the first days of 1948 after 
signing an act of abdication but he repeated friday that he did so 
under duress 
therefore i consider that i have remained king of romania and 
the head of state for the past 40 years he said it has never 
stopped 
he said he was flooded with telephone calls and messages telling 
him of the rapid developments in romania but that he has had no 
direct contact with his native country up to now 
when asked about his feelings he replied overwhelmed 
you cannot find the right words to express it he said it 
has been a great relief and sadness at the same time because of 
this terrible bloodshed 
before the questionandanswer session which was mostly in 
english he read a statement in french in which he paid homage to 
my courageous compatriots men and women 
he urged legalization of all democratic organizations and 
parties free elections in six months release of all political 
prisoiners and absolute respect for the transitional government 
michael renewed an appeal for an end to violence and urged 
romanians to adopt a spirit of reconciliation despite the 
humiliations and the cruel living conditions imposed on you 
we have too much to do to rebuild our country than to lose our 
time for personal revenge he said later 
asked what he would suggest should be done with ceausescu he 
said maybe i have some ideas drawing laughter from the 
journalists 
then he continued that it is up to the people at home to 
decide adding that he thought it only right that those who 
have been leading the country for the past 20 or more years should 
get the just answer that they should be tried 
he was flanked by his wife queen anne a princess of 
bourbonparma and his oldest daughter princess margarita who 
would be the first in line to succeed him

an outraged nation today drove romanian 
president nicolae ceausescu from power but forces loyal to the 
communist hardliner staged a counterattack and battled for control 
of the country 
there were conflicting reports about ceausescus whereabouts 
one report said he was arrested while fleeing the country another 
said he had escaped and a third said he was holed up in a town 
northeast of bucharest 
ceausescus son nicu former communist party chief in the south 
transylvanian town of sibiu was captured and shown on romanian 
television 
a uniformed man and a civilian held his arms and said he would 
be brought to trial nicu had a little swelling and traces of blood 
above his left eye he was being pushed around as he was led away 
the uniformed man said nicu had left sibiu giving orders to 
security forces loyal to his father not to shoot 
in bucharest the presidential palace was on fire and 
demonstrators waved romanian flags in front of the burning building 
as gunfire rang out reporters in the city said the central 
committee building also was damaged 
yugoslav television reported hundreds killed it did not cite 
sources 
the counterattack began after rallies by hundreds of thousands 
of people in the streets of bucharest and other cities to celebrate 
ceausescus ouster after 24 years of hardline rule 
romanian television said about 2000 proceausescu forces moved 
into the capital and radio reports said loyalists were also 
fighting for control in brasov a city 90 miles to the north 
romanian radio which was taken over by protesters earlier 
today reported fierce battles between army troops and 
proceausescu forces that it branded terrorists 
eventually the terrorists surrendered but there are other 
attempts to crush our revolution in other parts of the city an 
unidentified man said on the radio 
ceausescu was toppled by a popular revolt that lasted less than 
a week but that is believed to have claimed the lives of thousands 
of antigovernment demonstrators 
the upheaval in romania comes at the close of a remarkable year 
during which the hardline leaderships of poland hungary 
czechoslovakia east germany and bulgaria were ousted by massive 
protests and replaced by reformers 
by early evening anticeausescu appeared to have gained the 
upper hand with radio reporting that security forces had laid down 
their arms criminal elements were neutralized or arrested the 
radio reported tersely 
but shortly after 7 pm noon est news media said 
proceausescu forces were attacking bucharest dead and wounded 
are reported from all parts of city the czechoslovak news agency 
ctk said 
the soviet news agency tass said there was heavy shooting in 
bucharest 
television said bucharest jails had been opened by the 
anticeausescu supporters engineer nicu stefanescu one of those 
released said that thousands of people had been arrested thursday 
night during the huge unrest that forced ceausescu to flee 
even children were detained he said reporting that there were 
so many wounded in the jail that blood was seen in the corridors 
news reports said ceausescu 71 and his wife and secondin 
command elena fled their palace by helicopter romanian 
television urging everybody in the country to stop the ruler 
fleeing said they landed at the titu military airport outside 
bucharest then fled by car 
television reported first that they had been seized near the 
town of tirgoviste 45 miles northwest of bucharest minutes later 
television cast doubt on its report saying ceausescu apparently 
fled again 
the romanian news agency agerpres said ceausescu had been 
arrested but it appeared to be referring the first outdated tv 
report 
a later report from the yugoslav news agency tanjug said he was 
holed up at the town of trgoviste then in the evening romanian 
television announced without further detail that ceausescu and his 
wife elena had left the country 
earlier reports described fierce fighting between army troops 
and paramilitary police in sibiu where ceausescus son had ruled 
a massacre is going on an unidentified general said on 
statecontrolled media 
later an unidentified general who may have been the same 
officer claimed that fighting had ceased throughout the country 
corneliu manescu a 73yearold former foreign minister said on 
romanian television that he was head of a provisional government 
that would stay in power until free elections could be held the 
east german news agency said 
manescu has for many months been under house arrest in an 
agroindustrial complex in the vicinity of bucharest informed 
sources said in march he and five other senior officials sharply 
criticized the ceausescu leadership 
the romanian state news agency agerpres which announced the end 
of censorship and promised truthful reporting in the future said 
ion iliescu a former central committee secretary ousted by 
ceausescu in 1971 had announced on television that a national 
salvation front had been set up 
speaking from a balcony of the central committee building in 
bucharest iliescu told a jubilant crowd there were reports the 
ousted ruler had been arrested near tirgoviste 
if these reports are confirmed he will be arrested and 
submitted to public justice iliescu said 
hundreds of thousands of people were in the streets of bucharest 
and in the streets of timisoara the west romanian city where 
troops fired on protesters last weekend igniting the week of the 
nationwide revolt against ceausescus autocratic rule 
an associated press reporter said from timisoara that the entire 
city appeared to be on the streets 
this is something we never expected to happen the dictator is 
gone ingeborg kziraska said in front of a cathedral where she 
said more than 30 children were gunned down sunday during protests 
reports from timisoara put the deaths during the week of 
protests in the city at between 2000 and 4500 
the two other countries in east europe that are not part of the 
soviet bloc are albania which remains a hardline socialist state 
and yugoslavia which has been torn by ethnic unrest that has 
overshadowed reform proposals 
ceausescu was the last hardline soviet alliance leader with 
his family he strictly controlled the spartan society he had built 
and refused to adopt reforms despite chronic shortages of food and 
energy that made life miserable for most romanians 
he apparently felt so secure with the dominance of his cult of 
personality that he traveled to iran earlier this week during the 
growing protests and held a progovernment rally on thursday that 
turned into a huge chorus of denunciations of his rule 
ceausescu tried one more time to address crowds before fleeing 
from his palace the bulgarian news agency bta reported he was 
shouted down with cries of death death the agency said 
while still in ceausescus hands romanian radio reported early 
today that defense minister vasile milea had committed suicide and 
blamed him for the national unrest but a later radio report denied 
that 
the uprising began on dec 15 with a few hundred people 
defending an ethnic hungarian pastor threatened with arrest in 
timisoara the protests swelled last weekend with thousands of 
protesters chanting for more food and the overthrow of ceausescu 
security forces massacred hundreds possibly thousands of 
unarmed civilians in timisoara last sunday the hungarian news 
agency mti reported today that two mass graves containing 632 
bodies had been found outside timisoara while czechoslovak media 
gave the latest death toll as 4700 
other romanian cities learning of the reported massacre also 
staged anticeausescu protests during the last week

with panama in chaos us officials said 
friday that military police trained to restore and enforce law and 
order will play a large role in the country possibly staying as 
long as a year 
gen maxwell thurman head of the us southern command told 
reporters at a new conference in panama that a top us priority 
was to raise the panamanian police force and get it back in 
operation 
in washington gen tom kelly director of operations for the 
joint chiefs of staff stressed the importance of the military 
police 
the role we will play is assisting the panamanians in 
maintaining order and recapturing and controlling of their 
institutions like the police he said 
weve got to reestablish law and order throughout panama 
city said lt col bill bennett a top military planner 
military experts said the military police might work with 
panamanian defense forces loyal to new president guillermo endara 
training them and incorporating them on patrols 
us officials spoke while mobs some devoted to ousted gen 
manuel noriega roamed panama city breaking windows entering 
private homes looting at will according to jan edmonson the 
us embassy spokesman in panama city 
by friday the third day of the us intervention the 
military police numbered 3000 bennett said some 1500 
reinforcements from fort bragg nc were brought in to help all 
told us troops number about 24000 
us military officials refused to say how long they would keep 
combat troops in panama but rep les aspin dwis chairman of 
the house armed services committee predicted the military police 
might be in for a long haul 
i would not be surprised to see them there on christmas eve a 
year from now he said 
military police or mps have a number of specific tasks 
including security and law enforcement at us bases the support 
of combat forces and protection of prisoners of war in panama 
some 1400 pronoriega loyalists are being held prisoner thurman 
said 
american mps are not too much unlike a civilian police 
force said michael abrams a spokesman at fort mcclellan near 
anniston ala home of the us army military police school 
mps were recently in the headlines when they were sent to the 
virgin islands to restore calm after hurricane hugo but abrams 
said the situation in the virgin islands differed substantially 
from that in panama 
in the islands mps worked in concert with local law enforcement 
officers letting the civil authorities play the lead role in 
making arrests and controlling disorderly conduct 
but in panama it seems like the whole country has been turned 
upside down he said i havent the faintest idea how they are 
operate 
richard armitage a former defense department official 
suggested the new government in panama temporarily might empower 
the mps with authority to make arrests and handle other problems 
mps often the most visible servicemen because of their public 
function are trained to handle scores of tasks from criminal 
investigations to traffic on bases they commonly patrol housing 
areas set up speed traps and make arrests 
they also protect convoys set up perimeter security and quell 
disturbances

the energy department is dropping its appeal 
of a 78 million judgment in a classaction lawsuit filed by 
neighbors of an ohio nuclear weapons plant but doesnt know how it 
will pay the 14000 plaintiffs the departments top lawyer said 
friday 
were not going to pursue our appeal stephen a wakefield 
said adding that the bad news is that the department 
discovered earlier this week it cannot pay the judgment from a fund 
it planned to use 
the historic settlement came when the government for the first 
time acknowledged that a nuclear weapons plant might have harmed 
people living near it 
the fernald ohio plant has spread uncounted tons of powdered 
uranium dust into the surrounding area operations were suspended 
earlier this year to intensify efforts to clean up the 
contamination 
wakefield said verbal notice of the decision was given to the 
plaintiffs lawyers thursday but he would not say specifically why 
the department changed its mind about the appeal 
the government had never contested the amount of the judgment 
but appealed because it disagreed with a judicial interpretation of 
the terms of the settlement 
we think its really past time said lisa crawford one of 
the plaintiffs who contended in a 1985 lawsuit that releases of 
radioactive material from the plant had damaged their property 
values and caused them emotional distress 
my question is when are they going to put the money in the 
bank she said 
in an interview wakefield said the justice department told him 
earlier this week that he could not pay the 78 million from a 
federal contingency fund as planned because the lawsuit was brought 
not against the government but against national lead of ohio inc 
which ran the plant under federal contract until 1985 
the energy department was required under terms of the operating 
contract to shield national lead against liability in the case 
wakefield said the department would have to ask congress for a 
special appropriation to cover the settlement and that payments 
probably would be made in installments 
thats terrible said paul nemann one of three 
courtappointed trustees overseeing the settlement 
he said the departments lawyers had said in no uncertain 
terms at the time of the settlement last summer that the money 
would be available by october the department filed a notice of 
appeal oct 17 
stanley chesley the lead lawyer for fernald residents 
applauded the energy departments decision to abandon its appeal 
thats encouraging wed like to work with them and get the 
money he said 
the settlement clears the way for federal funds to pay for 
longterm medical monitoring of the health of people living within 
five miles of the feed materials production center at fernald 
which processes uranium for the weapons program 
the purpose of the medical study is to determine whether there 
was an excess of cancers or other health problems that could be 
traced to radiation released from the plant which has operated for 
38 years it is 18 miles from cincinnati 
the department appealed the settlement to the 6th us circuit 
court of appeals in cincinnati because us district judge s 
arthur spiegel ruled in september that the deal did not prevent two 
companies near the site from suing the department for environmental 
damage to their property caused by the weapons plant

a member of a smithsonian institution 
research team rescued friday by us troops said it was a fantastic 
moment when the group saw us helicopters arriving 
the 11member research team had been abducted wednesday from an 
island research center and forced to march into the jungle by about 
30 soldiers loyal to gen manuel antonio noriega 
the smithsonian group including a 4yearold girl eventually 
was abandoned without food by the soldiers us military forces 
after a fruitless search for the researchers on thursday located 
them on friday as they were being taken by a friendly schoolteacher 
to a nearby town 
that was a fantastic moment seeing the helicopters come 
said steve travers a marine biologist with the smithsonian group 
mary knowlton another scientist said the group expected 
trouble because of the us invasion on wednesday those fears were 
realized when a panamanian patrol boat arrived at the research 
center she said 
the research team talked the soldiers into letting them grab a 
few belongings before they were hurriedly taken ashore they 
managed to sneak out three twoway radios with which they would 
later guide us armed forces to their location for rescue 
greg summers another member of the group said they were taken 
by boat to an airfield and then into the jungle they walked from 
11 am wednesday until 1 am thursday he said 
the worst part was walking down the main landing strip off to 
the side and into the woods everybody thought they were going to 
shoot us said travers 
we really didnt know we were going to be walking halfway 
across panama knowlton said at one point it appeared to the 
hostages that their captors feared that they themselves were 
isolated when word reached them that americans were in control of 
panama city they asked their captives to tell the american troops 
that the researchers had been taken into protective custody then 
the group was abandoned on thursday 
using the radios they had hidden the group contacted 
smithsonian officials in panama city 
lt col joseph umbarger who coordinated the rescue said at 
first the us military thought the situation might be a potential 
trap but then sent three helicopters on a dangerous nighttime 
search over the jungle about 20 to 25 miles north of panama city 
although the pilots scoured the area for hours the initial aerial 
search team was forced to return without the hostages when their 
fuel ran low 
the group received help from the school teacher friday morning 
the teacher was taking them in a flatbed truck to the town of chepo 
when a second flight of helicopters from fort clayton spotted them 
in transit 
the researchers said they jumped off the truck and waved pieces 
of clothing in a prearranged pattern to tip off the soldiers

western governments have stepped up 
intelligence gathering in east germany to get a grip on the new 
political situation the official adn news agency said friday

acquiring information from political economic and military 
sources the agency said citing the agency for protection of the 
constitution as the countrys counterintelligence service is known 
the new service which bears the same name as its west german 
equivalent was created when the stasi the hated secret police 
was dissolved and reorganized 
western intelligence agencies are seeking to get a fix on the 
new leaders who have emerged since the collapse of the communist 
party to be able formulate a new german policy the agency said 
the agencies have concluded that german reunification is on the 
poltical agenda but have yet to decide whether german unity is a 
military danger to european stability or if western governments 
should support the rapprochement adn said 
the ouster of former communist party leader erich honecker on 
oct 18 as well as his successor egon krenz on dec 3 has pushed 
littleknown groups into the political limelight 
the future role of the newly renamed communist party remains 
unclear to the western agencies adn reported 
as a result of political fragmentation and the emergence of new 
political groups western intelligence services are trying to 
recruit new sources on a wider political basis 
the creation of a new pool of agents in strategic positions in 
the government economy military and security service is of key 
importance to the west adn reported

president mikhail s gorbachev and soviet 
lawmakers on friday threw their support to the romanian people who 
overthrew the 24year regime of nicolae ceausescu 
members of the parliament broke into applause when gorbachev 
announced that romanian radio had reported ceausescus arrest 
then on gorbachevs suggestion they adopted a resolution offering 
decisive support for the just cause of the people of romania 
the evening news show vremya showed stunning footage of 
hundreds of thousands of romanians packed into vast squares in 
downtown bucharest demonstrating to topple ceausescus regime 
jubilant romanians dumped books from the balcony of the 
communist party building rode armored personnel carriers through 
the streets and waved tricolor national flags with gaping holes 
where the emblem of socialist romania had been cut out 
at this very moment the capital of romania is swept away with 
happiness reported sergei zheleznyak from bucharest 
however later reports from east bloc media said that 
proceausescu forces attacked the city and that fierce battles 
raged between army units sympathetic to the protesters and security 
forces loyal to their fallen leader 
the official news agency tass formerly a mouthpiece of 
communist orthodoxy graphically chronicled ceausescus ouster 
hundreds of people have climbed up on tanks and apcs armored 
personnel carriers and unfurled slogans such as we are for 
freedom we want democracy and away with the dictatorship 
it said 
at the parliament the congress of peoples deputies about 200 
deputies crowded around a tass news monitor in the lobby when it 
flashed the first report of ceausescus flight 
its a holiday said deputy roald z sagdeyev 
another deputy was heard to comment we are the only two 
dictatorships left albania and the soviet union a more 
conservative colleague muttered they are surrounding us from all 
sides 
soviet officials refrained from condemning the violent 
confrontations between the government and demonstrators this past 
week until it was reported that ceausescu was trying to flee 
on thursday government spokesman vadim perfiliev would say only 
that we will be very sorry for them if reports of casualties 
were correct even friday morning gorbachev supported a mild 
resolution that merely called for a peaceful solution 
at midday gorbachev announced the latest news to a hushed 
session 500000 people were marching in the streets the army had 
gone over to the people the defense minister had committed suicide 
and helicopters were hovering over ceausescus home 
left hanging with that tantalizing report the deputies broke 
for lunch 
at the close of the session friday night gorbachev announced 
that romanian radio was reporting that ceausescu had been arrested 
and the majority of the congress broke into applause gorbachev 
then proposed the resolution and it passed on a show of hands 
vremya said thousands of people responding to an overnight 
call for a strike moved to the center of bucharest on friday and 
soldiers fraternized instead of shooting as they had on thursday 
when students captured the romanian government tv station 
vremya said it broadcast speeches by the best people of the 
country writers actors poets who declared the end of the 
tyranny and called for army transport to bring representatives from 
around the country to form a democratic government 
vremya also kept up with electrifying new developments 
interrupting the news moments after its first report to announce 
unconfirmed reports that ceausescu had been arrested 
in soviet moldavia which was once part of romania about 8000 
people demonstrated in downtown kishinev on friday evening 
sporting signs that congratulated their romanian brothers and 
calling ceausescu a fascist according to moldavian peoples 
front activist serjiu burke 
other slogans called for the border fence to be ripped down 
portending possible further ethnic trouble for the soviet union 
some moldavian activists have said they would like to reunite with 
romania if it were not ruled by ceausescu

the ruling party friday ignored calls to 
heed the collapse of communism in eastern europe and pledged to 
create a oneparty marxistleninist state 
the decision on the final day of the fourday patriotic front 
congress was contained in a document approved by 4200 delegates 
it restated the dream of president robert mugabe to transform 
one of africas few westernstyle democracies into a singleparty 
nation which he may do next year 
the partys aim is to establish and sustain a socialist 
society guided by marxistleninist principles but firmly based on 
our historical cultural and social experience and to create 
conditions for economic independence increased productivity and 
equitable distribution of the wealth of the nation it said 
mugabe who led the former whiteruled british colony of 
rhodesia to independence as blackgoverned zimbabwe on april 18 
1980 strenuously urged delegates to reject calls to abandon this 
goal in favor of multiparty democracy and a free enterprise economy 
the debate behind closed doors was heated but healthy said 
party spokesman nathan shamuyarira who is also minister of foreign 
affairs 
prodemocracy groups had hoped zimbabwe would follow some other 
african states that abandoned radical leftist policies in line with 
events in eastern europe 
in benin a former french territory in west africa the 
leadership early this month denounced communism and promised 
constitutional reforms 
in ethiopia africas most rigid marxist state president 
mengistu haile mariam has been forced to hold peace talks with 
guerrilla chieftains since the soviet union began reducing military 
supplies to fight secessionist wars this has raised the prospect 
he might pursue political liberalization 
more and more african countries also are jettisoning outdated 
economic policies in favor of reforms proposed by the world bank 
and the international monetary fund 
in recent months as prodemocratic movements have swept eastern 
europe mugabe has come under pressure to abandon the aim of a 
oneparty state 
mugabes patriotic front has been avowedly marxistleninist 
since independence former opposition leader joshua nkomo was more 
centrist 
but the two decided two years ago to merge forces a move that 
was formalized by their first joint congress this week 
the ruling party can pass laws and rewrite sections of the 
britishdrafted constitution a document signed by all parties 10 
years ago 
those constitutional talks ended nine decades of white minority 
rule halted a sevenyear war waged by guerrillas loyal to nkomo 
and mugabe and steered zimbabwe to independence 
the constitution guaranteed zimbabwe would be a multiparty 
democracy for the first 10 years of independence 
after the 10th anniversary mugabe may ban opposition and 
establish a singleparty state with twothirds of the votes in 
parliament

us soldiers who stormed one of gen 
manuel antonio noriegas guest houses here narrowly missed 
capturing four brazilian voodoo witches who performed rituals for 
his protection officials said friday 
the socalled witch house a fortified structure specially 
built for noriega contained an estimated 50 pounds of cocaine a 
bucket of blood voodoo artifacts and a brewery for making 
concoctions and potions col mike snell the officer in charge of 
the area said 
snell said it was not known whether the blood was human or 
animal or for what the potions were used officers said some of the 
cocaine had been wrapped in a banana leaf and placed in the freezer 
gen maxwell thurmand commander of the panamabased southern 
command said at a press briefing that noriegas voodoo 
practitioners practiced rituals for noriegas protection 
lt curtis vinyard said the house had apparently been occupied 
until shortly before it was stormed by us troops 
other military officers said the house was where noriega kept 
his brazilian withces 
there was still a candle burning he said 
some of the soldiers who stormed the house said there were 
smoldering cigarettes in ashtrays and women had left their purses 
and they believed they might have come close to capturing noriega 
himself 
in any event noriega was still at large 
the house on the seacoast near here and close to several us 
military bases was stormed by us soldiers on tuesday about six 
hours after the us invasion began 
an american soldier who would not give his name but was familiar 
with the incident said troops who saw the house spread the word 
that one room was apparently devoted to the occult with blood and 
entrails 
reporters were also shown odd trappings in two offices used by 
noriega his office in panamas military barracks at fort amador 
had two display cases full of plastic frogs framed pictures of 
adolf hitler mother theresa and moammar ghadafi and dozens of 
electronic toys such as a video wristwatch us officials showed 
reporters christmas trees more electronics and more frogs at his 
former headquarters office downtown 
snell said collections of pornography wre found in both offices 
and the fort amador house was stocked with noriegas private brands 
of cigars and champagne 
us intelligence officials scoured the offices in the hope of 
finding records would help trace noriegas assets 
sgt 1st class joseph torregrossa said the fort amador office 
also contained expensive prints and a lot of expensive weapons 
mostly automatic he had german lugers israeli uzis all sorts of 
real sophisticated stuff 
thurmand told reporters he was clearly dedicated to 
outfitting a substantial force outfitting dignity battalions 
which in the long run would have given us a tremendous challenge in 
this area 
travel restrictions including a nighttime curfew were still in 
effect friday and new fighting was reported with men loyal to 
noriega attacking the headquarters of the us southern command 
a twohour tour through a bombedout shopping district that once 
was a noriega stronghold showed scenes of near chaos as thousands 
of looters seized refrigerators microwaves automobile tires 
gasoline and other goods 
they cheerfully stopped however to shout viva bush viva 
bush or bush bush bush as they waved to soldiers and 
journalists one held up a knife sharpener and joked its a 
present from bush 
noriegas ninebuilding headquarters was a smouldering hulk its 
windows blown out by tank and artillery fire it was closely 
guarded by dozens of us troops 
less than a mile away the body of a man face down and 
shirtless lay trapped in the crushed wreckage of a sedan a us 
infantry sergeant said an armored personnel carrier rolled over the 
car after the driver was seen passing out ak47 rifles

for the roman catholic church 
crippled and corrupted by the communist state christmas will be a 
joyous reawakening of hope after more than four decades of 
persecution 
it will be a christmas in freedom said cardinal frantisek 
tomasek who will say mass in pragues gothic st vitus cathedral 
on christmas day it is now possible for our priests to speak 
freely 
mass was said in churches last christmas but only by priests 
licensed by the state authorities discouraged attendance by the 
nations estimated 93 million catholics 60 percent of the 
population 
many believers stayed away while an unknown number of others met 
secretly in cramped apartments for christmas mass performed by 
banned priests 
now everything is different the peaceful revolution that began 
in november bringing an end to communist domination has opened 
unlimited possiblities for the church 
on sunday mass will be said in virtually every church to 
hundreds of thousands of faithful millions more will watch it 
broadcast live on state tv an event unimaginable a year ago 
last christmas the rev vaclav maly was shunned as a dissident 
ducking secret police he said mass for about a dozen people who 
gathered around him at great risk 
this year maly will stand before hundreds on the altar of 
strahovsky klaster a 13th century monastery overlooking to vltava 
river 
jailed for joining the human rights group charter 77 maly 
worked between stints in jail as a night watchman and coal stoaker 
while ministering secretly on jan 1 he will begin leading his own 
church 
the 11 years i could not work in public were not in vain i 
met all levels of society and learned to talk to atheists as well 
as believers i was thrown into life with my faith as my only 
support said maly 39 whose name is being mentioned to replace 
tomasek as primate of czechoslovakia 
tomasek 90 said he plans to discuss his retirement with pope 
john paul ii when he visits czechoslovakia possibly next year 
tomasek himself spent three years in jail in the 1950s for being 
named a bishop without state approval dozens of others shared his 
fate 
monastic orders were dissolved religious associations banned 
an estimated 8000 of the countrys 12000 monks disappeared into 
labor camps 
clergy became employees of the state receiving their salaries 
from the government who had veto power over all church appointments 
as a result of this power bishoprics fell vacant while the 
vatican and communist state argued over who should fill them as 
recently as a year ago 10 of the nations 13 bishoprics were empty 
on thursday three of these were filled by the end of next 
month tomasek hopes they will all be full 
weve waited 30 years for this tomasek said in an 
interview now it seems the freedom of the church is certain and 
will be fully respected 
the reform government announced last week that freedom of 
religion will no longer be limited the 1949 law requiring the 
licensing of priest will be stricken from the books 
but forbidden fruit is sweetest and some fear that after the 
first flush of religious freedom believers may stray 
before it was a simple the powerful against the powerless 
maly said the church was attractive because it embodied values 
denied or oppressed by marxist ideology 
but in the pluralistic society being built the church will have 
to compete 
there will be a richness of values and the churchs role is 
an open question maly said but i believe the church will 
succeed in attracting more people than ever if it has the internal 
strength to preach tolerance and help society remember forgotten 
values like forgiveness trust love faithfulness respect for the 
individual 
the church has an excellent chance people are spiritually 
hungry after such a long time

black leaders in miami have asked gov bob martinez 
to send in the national guard for fear their communities may be 
ignored by police loyal to a convicted hispanic officer 
martinez took no action in response to the request received 
friday in a letter from the naacp but said he has faith in the 
local police department said his press secretary jon peck 
the governor has been fully briefed about security 
arrangements in miami and around the state peck said hes 
comfortable that everything that can be done is being done at this 
point 
johnnie mcmillian president of the miamidade chapter of the 
national association for the advancement of colored people wrote 
the governor thursday asking the state to assume responsibilty for 
law enforcement in dade county 
there is an immediate crisis in the ability of the police 
department in dade county to provide protection for their 
citzenry her letter said 
the letter was approved by the naacps regional office in 
atlanta and received support from other miami black leaders 
including two prominent ministers but the black leaders said they 
knew of no specific incidents of lapses in police protection in 
black neighborhoods 
police chief perry anderson mayor xavier suarez and spokesmen 
for the citys police union and hispanic officers association all 
said the letter was unwarranted 
there isnt any reason for any kind of alarm anderson said 
at a news conference well continue to perform our duties in a 
professional manner 
he emphasized that no unprofessional behavior would be 
tolerated but added i think the emotion pro con favorable 
unfavorable reaction to the verdict is somewhat understandable 
officer william lozano was found guilty of two counts of 
manslaughter dec 7 in the deaths of two black men motorcyclist 
clement lloyd died after being shot by lozano and his passenger 
allan blanchard died from injuries when the vehicle crashed 
their deaths jan 16 sparked three nights of racial riots 
lozanos conviction was applauded in the black community but 
police officers viewed the verdict as a restriction of their right 
to protect themselves in the line of duty 
several officers have worn black bands on their badges or black 
wristbands normally a symbol of mourning to protest the 
conviction 
mcmillian said she wants the national guard to serve as the 
local police until the department can prove it isnt divided and 
can act impartially 
the police chief denied that there was significant discord among 
officers within the department noting however we must all 
attempt to work togther to solve our differences 
suarez said the letter shows a lack of confidence in anderson 
who is black the mayor held a meeting last week with the leaders 
of the citys police union and black and hispanic associations to 
discuss reports of police neglect 
the one thing that came out of the meeting is a commitment 
that there would be absolute professionalism suarez said i am 
convinced of that now more than ever because there is more 
communication between the groups 
mcmillian said she decided to send the letter after hearing 
about a possible work slowdown and an unsubstantiated report of a 
hispanic officer hesitating before responding to a backup call 
if i needed police protection i would not feel comfortable 
calling the police because of the attitude of some of the 
officers she said

one of the bodies matched witnesses descriptions of a man who 
drove a bus bomb into the secret police headquarters in bogota on

dynamite exploded moments later killing 63 people and injuring

from the capital to the resort town of melgar 55 miles to the 
south el espectador newspaper citing police sources reported 
friday that the deaths were the result of battles between feuding 
criminals groups 
a police spokesman told the associated press by telephone that 
he could not say whether the victims had worked for rodriguez gacha 
five men died tuesday when two bands of prisoners battled with 
knives at a bogota jail police said rodriguez gachas men attacked 
a group of prisoners of a rival group that had been fighting with 
the drug trafficker for control of emerald mines in central 
colombia

justice william j brennan jr cleared the way 
friday for a jewish group to erect a menorah on the steps of the 
citycounty building in pittsburgh for the start of hanukkah 
brennan vacated a ruling made just hours before by a panel of 
the 3rd circuit us court of appeals that would have prevented the 
display court spokeswoman kathy arberg said 
the eightday jewish festival of lights began at sundown friday 
brennans action reinstated a preliminary injunction issued 
wednesday against the city by a us district court judge arberg 
said 
city officials had refused to allow the jewish group chabad to 
set up an 18foot menorah next to a christman tree city officials 
said they had not authorized the area outside the building to be 
used as a public forum 
a federal judge thursday denied a request from the city to delay 
the lower courts decision the city immediately appealed and 
judge joseph weis of the 3rd circuit court temporarily stopped the 
federal judges order until three members of his court could review 
it 
chabad and three jewish residents sued the city a week ago 
alleging their civil rights were violated by the exclusion of the 
menorah from the holiday display the menorah was part of the 
display for most of the 1980s 
in a hearing before senior us district judge barron mccune 
chabad lawyer nathan lewin argued that the area in front of the 
building is a public forum where free speech including display of 
religious symbols cannot be denied 
mccune agreed ordering the city to allow chabad to erect the 
menorah in the same place it had been in 1986 that was the year 
the city was sued by the american civil liberties union over the 
menorah and a nativity scene at the citycounty building 
the supreme court ruled in july that the menorah placed next to 
the christmas tree was constitutional but that the nativity scene 
was unconstitutional because it was not part of a general holiday 
display 
pittsburgh deputy solicitor george specter told weis the area in 
front of the building was not a public forum simply because city 
officials did not stop demonstrations from taking place 
there is no evidence in this area at all that the city of 
pittsburgh even openly and intentionally authorized the use of the 
building as a public forum specter said 
another chabad lawyer elliot katz argued the city created the 
public forum by allowing the menorah to be displayed in past years

a paid state holiday honoring slain civil rights 
leader martin luther king jr a political quagmire in arizona for 
years again has become a dream deferred 
a bill trading in the columbus day holiday for king day cleared 
the legislature earlier this year and was signed by gov rose 
mofford but opponents of the king holiday and fans of christopher 
columbus formed an uneasy alliance to hold up the law pending a 
possible statewide referendum 
secretary of state jim shumway declared the holiday suspended 
and said he believed the groups had filed enough signatures to 
force a referendum next november 
state rep sandra kennedy a backer of the holiday called an 
opponent president pat quaranta of the arizona american italian 
club a bigot and said she feared a statewide vote on the 
holiday because this state is almost mississippi 
tempe architect julian sanders a king opponent who started the 
referendum drive said he didnt accept the argument that were 
going to be embarrassed by having arizonans express themselves at 
the polls 
sanders and his backers gathered about 40000 signatures on the 
referendum petitions while quaranta and his allies gathered about 
45000 it only takes 43500 valid voter signatures to force a 
referendum 
supporters of the bill said they would campaign for the holiday 
if the measure gets on the ballot they also said they were still 
considering a legal challenge to the petitions or introduction of a 
new bill in the legislature 
controversy over a king holiday has dogged the states 
politicians for years democratic gov bruce babbitt declared a 
holiday by executive proclamation as he was about to start a 
presidential bid in 1986 but republican attorney general bob 
corbin called it an illegal usurpation of the legislatures role 
and republican gov evan mecham rescinded it days before it would 
have taken effect 
the furor fueled a recall drive against mecham but a senate 
court of impeachment ousted him on other grounds before the recall 
vote could be held and the battle over king shifted back to the 
republicancontrolled legislature 
gop lawmakers offered to put the king day issue on the ballot 
supporters refused to go along saying privately that they feared 
such a bill would be defeated and publicly that they believed it 
would be divisive and harm the states image 
democratic gov rose mofford who succeeded mecham upped the 
ante during a special session this year when she got business 
leaders to say that a king holiday was needed to help arizonas 
chances of landing a super bowl 
lawmakers then agreed to king holiday but only if it supplanted 
columbus day so that state and local governments would not have any 
additional expense 
that angered two groups of voters those who didnt believe the 
civil rights leader deserved a holiday in the first place and 
those who wanted a holiday for king but did not want columbus day 
downgraded 
quaranta said his faction favored a federalstyle holiday that 
would combine the states separate lincoln and washington holidays 
into a single presidents day to make room for a king day without 
affecting columbus day sanders said his faction opposed the 
federalstyle holiday 
supporters of the king day bill meanwhile remain split over 
whether to challenge the petitions in court return to the 
legislature for a new bill that would effectively wipe out all the 
petition signatures or dig in for a campaign next year 
im afraid of a vote said the bills sponsor sen carolyn 
walker 
babbitt announcing the formation of a group to support king 
day said he was ready to fight it out at the voting booth instead 
of in the courthouse 
ultimately people have the right to decide he said 
echoing others who have said it would be hypocritical to deny 
people a vote on the issue when king struggled for years to expand 
voting rights

colleagues of a federal appellate judge who 
was killed by a parcel bomb similar to one that fatally injured a 
civil rights lawyer have since received threatening letters 
sources said friday 
the justice department meanwhile said four threatening letters 
delivered this week bore physical evidence linking them to the 
bombs 
the letters to the judges were among those that surfaced after 
parcel bombs killed 11th circuit court of appeals judge robert s 
vance on dec 16 and savannah ga alderman and attorney robert e 
robinson two days later said the sources 
a letter addressed to vance was also among those delivered said 
the sources who spoke on condition of anonymity 
justice department spokesman david runkel said he was unaware 
that letters had been delivered to judges on the 11th circuit 
but he said there was solid evidence on four threatening 
letters delivered this week linking them to the parcel bombs that 
killed vance and robinson as well as two others found this week 
parcel bombs were also found at the the jacksonville fla 
chapter of the naacp and the 11th circuit courthouse in atlanta 
both were defused without incident 
runkel declined to describe the common characteristics of the 
letters and the parcel bombs 
but stamps typing or other markings on the packages and letter 
envelopes may give fbi crime lab specialists important clues 
comparing the typing on the letters and packages may enable the 
fbi to determine if the same typewriter was used to address the 
parcels and write the letters 
runkel said the physical evidence may also provide a link to 
four other letters sent in august that declared war on the 11th 
circuit 
the earlier letters sent from atlanta threatened poison gas 
attacks on population centers until widespread terror forces 
the 11th circuit to adopt the impartial and equitable treatment 
of all 
before vances death the 11th circuit had 10 active judges the 
atlantabased court considers appeals from federal district courts 
in florida georgia and alabama 
while the fbi continued its investigation of the bombings in the 
deep south a state judge was seriously injured by a parcel bomb in 
his apartment in hagerstown md 
the fbi sent agents to assist local police and the bureau of 
alcohol tobacco and firearms to investigate the blast that injured 
circuit judge john corderman 
the fbiled investigation has been concentrating on possible 
racial motivations for the killings in georgia and alabama 
agents have been combing vances docket to determine if any of 
his decisions particularly in civil rights cases may have 
motivated the slaying 
in september vance wrote an opinion in a jacksonville school 
desegregation case that was a victory for the naacp a threejudge 
panel of the 11th circuit unanimously reversed a lower courts 
ruling that jacksonville could stop busing students because the 
school system was racially integrated 
robinson had represented the naacp on an unrelated school 
desegregation case involving savannah schools 
investigators have found physical evidence linking the bombs 
which were made with nails and explosive material the bomb parcels 
all were mailed from towns in georgia 
vance was killed in his suburban birmingham ala home after 
opening a package robinson was fatally injured by a bomb that 
exploded when he opened a similar package sent to his law office 
meanwhile savannah police said that security would be tight for 
robinsons funeral saturday 
benjamin hooks director of the national association for the 
advancement of colored people is expected to speak at the service 
the justice department said deputy attorney general donald b 
ayer james p turner acting head of the civil rights division

it was the death of her 15yearold 
son that gave wendy stanek the will and guts to infiltrate the drug 
menace corrupting crystal falls but when she did it hit closer to 
home than she thought 
the mother of six gathered enough evidence to bring cocaine and 
marijuana trafficking charges against 23 people this week among 
those arrested was a counselor at a group home for troubled youth 
one of the guys i busted was my lifelong friend and he came to 
me and i said oh my god i dont want to hear that said 
stanek still she turned him in 
the 35yearold woman who made more than 20 drug buys during a 
year of working for a narcotics team added i want people to 
know they can do it anybody can do it 
the suspects were arraigned tuesday in a marathon session in 
iron county district court michigan state police who headed the 
sting declined to talk about staneks role in dealing with what 
they say was a problem commonly known in the upper peninsulas 
crystal falls and nearby iron river 
they said however that community support and tips are 
important to their work 
during the year she spent undercover stanek was amazed at how 
easily cocaine flowed in crystal falls an oldfashioned logging 
town 
a local health worker tried two years ago to start a drug 
awareness group there he was encouraged to stop people just 
didnt want to admit we had a problem jerry schoup said 
after stanek made her first covert drug buy dealers pestered 
her with more offers than police could handle it was a piece of 
cake in and out and just like buying groceries she said 
she was shocked at who was doing the selling friends and 
childhood acquaintances 
its scum like you that sell it to the kids stanek said she 
told a suspect who called her after tuesdays arrests 
the road that led stanek to the upper peninsula substance 
enforcement team began with the death of her son ryan he would 
have turned 16 on june 30 1987 but died days earlier a passenger 
in a car that crashed when a friend grabbed at the steering wheel 
tucked in a shoe of one of the passengers stanek said she 
found a marijuana pipe police filed no charges 
the next day stanek began a log of the drug traffic she saw in 
crystal falls a year later a friend in the iron county sheriffs 
department put her in touch with the newly formed upset she began 
the undercover buys 
the biggest threat to the operation came from staneks own 
children who were unaware their mother was working undercover her 
eldest son 15yearold jamey was upset at her consorting with 
drug dealers 
he said keep your druggy buddies out of our house stanek 
said they were getting angry with me 
that and the suicide two weeks ago of one of staneks daughters 
friends ended the undercover work the 14yearold girls death was 
the second teen suicide in crystal falls this year for stanek who 
believes the communitys drug problem plays a role in the suicides 
it was just too much 
staneks kids now know about their mother the drug buys and the 
arrests 
i feel good about what my mom did 8yearold joey said 
i think its good because i know theres been a lot of drugs 
going on around here for a long time said jared 11 some 
people arent happy because they think drugs are cool i think 
theyre stupid 
and it makes his brothers death easier he said 
stanek had two notable receptions to her work one was a death 
threat big deal she said 
the other was a box of chocolates delivered at her door the 
greeting said thank you wendy for saving our kids

adequately but they expressed hope that lebanese shiite militias 
would agree to a prisoner exchange with israel

to tape in the stark prison to show conditions are acceptable and 
to increase pressure on the lebanons shiite amal and hezbollah 
militias to agree to a prisoner exchange with israel

television network but gave no other details 
the television said an estimated 300 prisoners mainly shiites

hundreds of people friday were digging 
up mass graves discovered in the forest district of timisoara 
trying to find the remains of their friends and relatives killed in 
last weekends crackdown 
three such mass graves are believed to be holding as many as 
4500 corpses of people massacred by the dreaded security forces on 
saturday sunday and monday there was no independent confirmation 
of the number of dead 
timisoara 500 miles from bucharest near the yugoslav and 
hungarian border was the center of protests that were brutally 
suppressed by the regime of president ceausescu who was reported 
overthrown thursday 
west german television apparently showing footage provided by 
romanian tv showed muddied naked corpses being dug out and placed 
on white sheets one after the other 
all had their feet tied together with wire a dead boy about 
three or four years old was shown lying on the ground 
not even hitler killed his own children and here they used 
automatic machine gun bursts to strafe them down said slavomir 
gvozdenovic editor of a literary review in timisoara 
the situation in this city of 350000 people was chaotic and 
there did not seem any authority at all beyond the downtown opera 
square 
vasile todorescu an electrician said he was trying to find his 
20yearold son who disappeared during the unrest 
he said the corpses had been transported by garbage trucks to 
the area and the drivers were later shot by the police so no 
witnesses whould be left 
sorin oprea head of the democratic front of romania which 
seems to be at least in partial control of timisoara said his 
group does not recognize the new national leadership being set up 
in bucharest 
we want all romanian citizens to elect the countrys new 
leadership said oprea a mechanic in bucharest they only 
fought for two days while our struggle was much longer 
oprea 37 was interviewed at the downtown opera house which is 
currently being used as the headquarters of the provisional 
municipal leadership 
he was wounded in the leg during clashes with the police and has 
not slept for three days he said 
our struggle is not yet over oprea said 
people approaching the opera house were being searched by 
plainclothes volunteers some of whom were armed with automatic 
rifles 
the peoples militia as the volunteers call themselves 
captured their weapons from troops during the weekend fighting 
they said 
about 1000 activists were occupying the opera building friday 
night in front of which more than 20000 people were still 
rejoicing over the ouster of ceausescu

the security council began considering a 
resolution friday that would condemn the us invasion of panama 
and demand the immediate withdrawal of american troops 
nearly all nations on the council have denounced the united 
states for its military action in panama the united states 
possibly joined by britain was considered certain to veto a 
resolution condemning the invasion 
the council scheduled a vote for saturday afternoon on the 
resolution introduced by the group of nations that profess 
nonalignment 
council members wrestled with another dilemma friday after 
inviting panama to speak on the invasion but disagreeing over which 
of the rival ambassadors should be given the floor 
on thursday night the council voted 140 with the united 
states abstaining to hear panamas views but did not decide who 
was the legitimate ambassador the council then met in private 
friday to continue arguing the issue 
the united states attacked to oust gen manuel antonio noriega 
as panamas leader 
his supporters have demanded that mirla bellavita noriegas 
choice for ambassador be allowed to speak for panama president 
guillermo endara installed during the us assault appointed 
eduardo vallarino ambassador and asked that he speak for the 
country 
the council will confer a degree of legitimacy on the government 
of whichever representative it allows to speak 
panama had no un ambassador when the invasion occurred 
leonardo kam who had held the position was promoted to foreign 
minister in september and no replacement had been accredited 
vallarino attempted a peaceful takeover of panamas un mission 
on friday but mrs bellavita told him her group will continue to 
be the sole occupants of the office just north of un headquarters 
in new york 
vallarino left after the polite discussion with mrs bellavita 
but said he would pursue his claim 
we intend to take possession of these offices we will do it 
in a very orderly process he said however we will not do 
anything rash or violent 
during discussion thursday us ambassador thomas r pickering 
said there is only one legal representative of panama and that 
representative is here meaning vallarino 
soviet ambassador alexander m belonogov said i have quite an 
opposite opinion on who exactly should represent panama on the 
security council 
we cannot be a party to any exercise which will add legality 
any legality in the united nations at this moment to the 
government which has been installed by the united states in 
panama

issue until endaras government was firmly in control of panama

presidential elections may 7 but the balloting was rejected and 
nullified by noriega 
of the 15 security council members only britain has 
wholeheartedly endorsed the us action 
canada criticized the invasion but said noriega provoked it

the government suspended joint operations with 
us drug agents in the cocagrowing huallaga valley the us 
embassy said friday apparently to protest the us invasion of 
panama 
foreign minister guillermo larco cox said peru was opening its 
embassy in panama city to people seeking political asylum 
in lima police used tear gas to break up a protest outside the 
us embassy and arrested 10 people the demonstrators were members 
of the governing aprista partys youth wing 
the announcement of the suspension of antidrug operations came 
one day after president alan garcia said he would not attend the 
feb 15 drug summit with president bush and the leaders of colombia 
and bolivia 
i cannot meet with the leader of an invading nation garcia 
said thursday 
the summit was to be held in cartagena colombia and include 
presidents virgilio barco of colombia and jaime paz zamora of 
bolivia 
in an interview published friday in a lima newspaper us 
ambassador anthony quainton criticized garcias reaction to the 
us decision to send troops to panama 
garcia said thursday that the united states could seek to do 
the same in peru if it should think the peruvian government isnt 
doing enough to fight drug trafficking in the huallaga valley 
the huallaga valley is the worlds single largest source of the 
coca leaf the raw material for making cocaine the valley is the 
focus of the ussponsored antinarcotics campaign in peru 
us drug agents have been carrying out operations since 
september with peruvian police from a usbuilt base at santa 
lucia in the huallaga valley the agents accompany polie on daily 
raids against clandestine airstrips and cocaprocessing 
laboratories 
between 20 and 40 americans including agents pilots and 
mechanics operate from the 3 million base which is located in 
the jungle about 200 miles northeast of lima eight us 
helicopters are based at santa lucia for use in interdiction 
operations 
bush has proposed spending 22 billion in the next four years 
to combat the drug trade in colombia bolivia and peru about 73 
million has been earmarked for peru this year in mostly police and 
military assistance 
analysts estimate about 1 billion a year comes into peru from 
the drug trade garcia recently praised the bush administration for 
offering economic assistance to the andean nations to offset losses 
caused by the cutoff of drug dollars 
garcia has been highly critical of the us actions in panama 
and wednesday recalled perus ambassador in washington in protest 
he said the intervention was motivated by the united states 
intention to break the panama canal treaties of 1977 which call 
for panama to take control of the waterway at the end of the 
century 
in an interview with the newspaper expreso quainton said i 
cannot accept the peruvian governments argument that says we have 
acted in order to break the treaties we recognize the treaties and 
understand that they carry great importance for the whole 
hemisphere 
quainton called on latin american countries to support the 
usinstalled government of guillermo endara who was elected in 
may but was blocked from taking power by noriega 
he criticized garcias decision to recall his ambassador 
saying if there are differences at this moment concerning 
panama and obviously garcia is not very happy this shouldnt make 
us lose sight of the common interests that we have

officials from the northeast meet 
saturday in washington to discuss heating fuel shortages amid a 
backdrop of record freezing cold and dwindling energy supplies 
the meeting will bring together representatives of the regions 
utilities pipeline companies propane distributors transportation 
officials and state energy regulators 
assistant us energy secretary john easton said he hopes to 
find out where they shortages exist and how serious they are 
we have been receiving a lot of anecdotal data and our 
interest is to determine how real the situation is from the 
perspective of suppliers and consumers said easton who called 
the weekend meeting 
new england is experiencing its coldest december on record 
along with other parts of the country on friday the arctic 
temperatures snapped records in more than 125 cities from the 
rockies to the east coast making it one of the worst cold spells 
on record the national weather service said 
forecasters predict moderating weather following the weekend 
but this months supercold has already drained energy sources 
weve already used as much fuel as we normally would by the 
middle of january said robert gladden a spokesman for bay state 
gas co with 250000 customers in massachusetts new hampshire and 
maine 
the energy department meeting will also include representatives 
from the plains states and as far south as virginia all areas 
which are also beginning to feel a fuel pinch due to unseasonably 
cold weather 
but officials said the focus of the meeting will generally 
remain on new england where the problem is considered more serious 
a severe shortage of propane has prompted some companies to 
impose restrictions on deliveries vermont gov madeleine kunin and 
propane operators announced this week that deliveries would not be 
made until tanks drop to 10 percent capacity and that fillups 
would be limited to 50 percent of capacity 
easton said some help is expected for propane users the 
department has already taken steps to locate additional sources of 
the fuel including contacting the operators of the major propane 
gas pipeline that supplies the northeast 
texas eastern whose pipeline ends near albany ny has 
increased the flow of propane through the line by onethird easton 
said 
in addition the high demand for the home heating oil has sent 
prices soaring oil that was selling for 95 cents a gallon last 
week in the region was selling for 114 this week 
we are beginning to have some concerns about the supply of 
heating oil if this weather continues said ned tudi vice 
president of energy relations for agway energy products in 
syracuse ny 
electric utilities were also concerned about the cold a 
regionwide appeal was made to cut back usage as utilities predicted 
record demand for the weekend 
on friday rhode island gov edward diprete sent a letter to 
admiral james d watkins the us secretary of energy urging him 
to facilitate the transportation of energy supplies to the 
northeast 
new hampshire gov judd gregg released a letter friday afternoon 
telling the us customs service in washington an emergency 
situation now exists in that propane supplies to both gas 
distribution companies and retail propane dealers in my state are 
critically short 
the situation makes it imperative that all transportation 
equipment be used to bring added supplies of propane to my state 
and the region gregg wrote 
he asked for a waiver to allow the bay state gas co to charter 
a danish and an italian ship to transport propane from the gulf 
coast to terminals in new hampshire rhode island new jersey and 
pennsylvania

romanian journalists pledged friday to 
break the bonds of censorship that kept them tightly muzzled for 
decades under the harsh regime of nicolae ceausescu 
in the streets of bucharest jubilant romanians lifted the car 
of a bulgarian reporter in gratitude for his honest reporting 
demonstrators marched to the state tv and radio where they took 
over the michrophones and announced we have won 
for hours there were continuous live tv broadcasts as people 
took turns at the microphones in the jammed studios it also showed 
scenes of hundreds of thousands of people on the streets 
previously staterun tv had broadcast only two hours a day 
most of that time was filled with footage of ceausescu who built a 
personality cult in the media 
only hours after a popular uprising toppled ceausescu the state 
news agency agerpres issued a statement pledging to report honestly 
on events at home and abroad 
as the media in the rest of eastern europe became more open in 
the wake of democratic reforms sweeping their countries the 
romanian media remained staunchly loyal to ceausescus hardline 
regime eulogizing him and keeping silent on the changes in the 
rest of the soviet bloc 
the romanian news agency agerpres no longer needs the 
censorships special approval to issue fake positions that have 
no basis agerpres said 
in the streets of the capital jubilant romanians thanked 
reporters from neighboring east bloc countries who had filed vivid 
extensive accounts of what was happening in romania this past week 
and were nearly the sole source of information from that country 
after ceausescu sealed the borders sunday 
many romanians are able to pick up radio and tv broadcasts from 
neighboring bulgaria yugoslavia and romania or listen to western 
radio stations beaming programs into romania which also relied 
heavily on the east european news agency accounts for their 
information 
the correspondent for the bulgarian news agency bta peyto 
petkov reported that grateful demonstrators lifted his car and 
thanked him for informing the world of what had happened in their 
country 
the correspondent for the yugoslav news agency tanjug said 
reporters pushing through the crowd were greeted with cries of 
thank you neighbors 
the news agencys correspondent petar tomic said a romanian 
security agent had visited him friday after the fall of the 
ceausescu regime and apologized for monitoring his telephone calls 
tanjug reports out of bucharest were more detailed than those 
from other east bloc countries even before the reforms that swept 
eastern europe its previous correspondent dragan markovic was 
expelled last year for his reporting after having reported from 
there for more than four years 
the agerpres statement said 
along with the entire central and local press the radio and 
television all the mass media agerpres will do its duty and 
inform faithfully honestly and in a civilized manner the home and 
international public opinion about all the events in romania and 
the world the statement said 
we will give a full and honest image of all romanian 
events it said 
the statement was issued by the romanian news agency 
journalists who never lost their professional conscience those who 
until yesterday were compelled to systematically disinform 
the romanian and foreign public 
only hours after the people took over the radio and television 
stations agerpres also began giving detailed accounts of the 
events in the streets

a small group of soviet 
teenagers occupied the us air forces nuclear command center on 
friday as the invited guests of the strategic air command 
the tour marked the first time soviets have been allowed in 
sacs new 88 million underground command post air force officials 
could recall only one other time in sac history that soviets have 
been allowed in its inner sanctum 
it was all very interesting said andrei berezin i cant 
see this in my country 
lt gen donald aldridge sac vice commander in chief welcomed 
the soviet students in russian as the teens sat in the hardened 
underground bunker that is used to direct us nuclear forces 
the recent thaw in eastwest relations was evident as brig gen 
kenneth keller briefed the students on the command posts 
capabilities there was no reference to nuclear weapons or their 
potential targets in the soviet union 
the briefing instead focused on the design of the command 
center air force weather forecasting and sacs communications 
system 
the students spoke by radio with the looking glass aircraft an 
alternate command post that is kept airborne roundtheclock they 
also got a weather briefing in english and russian from eielson air 
force base alaska the closest sac installation to the soviet 
union 
these systems are in place to ensure that we preserve peace in 
the world and we work very hard at that job keller told the 
students 
peace was on the mind of marina ovechkina who wore a peace sign 
button on the tour miss ovechkina said she always wears the button 
and did not consider that it could attract attention at sac 
headquarters 
air force officials cited time constraints and the spirit of 
good will in deviating from their standard tour program which 
includes briefings on us and soviet military capability 
this is a tour where the youths understand and we understand 
that this is something that is in the best interest of all of us to 
work these peace issues through said col larry greer a sac 
spokesman 
the strategic air command is the air forces longrange strike 
force of manned bombers and intercontinental ballistic missiles 
since 1961 it has maintained the airborne looking glass which 
would take control of us nuclear forces if the president and 
other leaders were killed 
the students aged 1517 said they were impressed by the tour 
which also included a look at ec135 looking glass aircraft offutt 
dormitories and the base gymnasium 
this is very interesting and when i come back home i will tell 
my friends and parents about this said natalya gudkova 
but tatjana zabortseva said she was more impressed by the 
manners of nebraskans in omaha people say excuse me and 
thank you that i like miss zabortseva said 
the students have been in the united states since nov 27 in an 
exchange program with omahas westside high school they are 
scheduled to leave wednesday and a group of westside students is 
to visit the soviet union in late march

the pentagon ordered 2000 additional army 
soldiers airlifted to stillchaotic panama late friday a source 
said as president bush shrugged off a latin american appeal to end 
the us intervention and declared the troops would stay to do 
what is necessary 
the decision has been made to bolster roughly 24000 us 
troops already on the ground trying to quell the resistance being 
offered by forces loyal to deposed dictator manuel antonio noriega 
said the pentagon source speaking on condition of anonymity 
the movement will be taking place in the near future he 
added 
renewed resistance in panama city also prompted the pentagon to 
give a new estimate of up to 10 more days for american forces to 
seize complete control of panamas capital city 
earlier lt gen tom kelly director of operations for the 
joint chiefs of staff said we are looking to bring more troops 
in we are also looking at reestablishing the police force 
meanwhile in an indication the army was settling in military 
officials also convened their first press briefing at the southern 
command in panama 
in washington bush told congress in a formal notification 
abiding by the war powers act that it was impossible to predict the 
scope and duration of the us intervention 
he underscored his support for the new government of guillermo 
endara by welcoming endaras ambassador carlos rodriguez in the 
oval office 
the administration also offered what it said was new evidence of 
drug dealings by including a 110 pound stash of cocaine found 
near noriegas private office at a military barracks 
also uncovered at other locations were an arsenal of more than 
5000 weapons a picture of adolf hitler and a bizarre assortment 
of occult and witchcraft paraphernalia according to us officials

the administration dismissed a vote by the organization of 
american states deploring the us invasion and calling for an 
immediate withdrawal the oas vote was 201 with the united states 
casting the lone no vote six nations abstained 
i dont think were surprised that the oas would take this 
position fitzwater said adding that the administration thinks 
that eventually the countries of latin america will recognize and 
support the new government 
privately he suggested some latin american leaders have been 
more supportive 
bush mentioned the continuing chaos in panama during a speech on 
aids at the national institutes of health saying we sorrow at 
the casualties in panama but we know nothing is more crucial to 
peace on earth than freedom and democracy

forget our brave soldiers down there and their families

ordering the military assault 
while asserting that the worst fighting had ended bush told 
congress it is not possible at this time to predict the precise 
scope and duration of the military operations or how long the 
temporary increase of us forces in panama will be required 
bushs notice to congress complied with the war powers act 
which requires formal notification any time us military forces 
are sent into action the administration contends the act is 
unconstitutional but follows it anyway 
in his written message bush accused noriega of directing 
vicious and brutal acts against americans and asserted that the 
lives and welfare of us citizens had been increasingly at 
risk 
he also said that noriegas action had threatened the operation 
of the panama canal which the united states is under treaty 
obligation to turn over to panama in the year 2000 
at the southern command headquarters in panama city gen 
maxwell thurman delivered a lengthy denunciation of noriega 
depicting him as a drug trafficker who had a picture hitler in his 
closet and pornography in his desk 
thurman said noriega had been organizing a terrorist force with 
the possible goal of taking over the panama canal

the thoughts and prayers of people across the 
country have been answered on behalf of a tiny medical pioneer who 
received part of her mothers liver in a precedentsetting 
operation the girls mother said friday 
doctors tell the family that 22month old alyssa smith likely 
will spend christmas with her family and may leave the hospital by 
the new year 
we have really been blessed by the people and their generosity 
and thoughtfulness in expressing their concern alyssas mother 
teri said friday as she sat by her daughters bedside 
cards and many many teddy bears have come from around the 
country when we get home were going to get a map out and mark 
each town weve gotten something from she said 
late last month doctors transplanted part of mrs smiths liver 
to her daughter in the nations first liver transplant from a 
living donor 
a second child who underwent the same operation a few days after 
alyssa sarina jones also is doing remarkably well said john 
easton a spokesman for the university of chicago medical center 
both children were in critical condition but stable friday 
easton said 
like alyssa 16monthold sarina of millington tenn suffers 
from biliary atresia a usually fatal congenital defect that is the 
leading cause of liver transplants in children 
doctors have said previously that the livingdonor organ 
segments the children received have performed much better than the 
cadaver donors previously used in such operations use of a living 
donor also offers a possible solution to the chronic shortage of 
available cadaver organs for infants 
alyssa who comes from schertz texas near san antonio likely 
will be given a day pass to spend christmas day with her family 
at a chicago home for relatives of ailing children mrs smith said 
shell be able to eat lunch with us and open her gifts away 
from the hospital said mrs smith who was released from the 
hospital two weeks ago were going to be together as a family 
thats a plus 
mrs smith a fourth grade teacher who has been on television 
and in newspaper pictures since the historic operation went 
christmas shopping thursday and returned with more than her 
purchases easton said 
wherever they went people would stop and recognize her 
people would figure out who she was and say take this back for 
your little girl he said 
sarina was much sicker than alyssa at the time of her operation 
which makes her recovery slower easton said 
a biopsy detected some minor rejection wednesday and theyre 
watching thateceived part of the liver of her father robert during 
the operation the transplanted liver has performed well and 
easton said doctors are optimistic 
i think everyone is real pleased he said her liver began 
functioning immediately and is for all intents and purposes a 
normally functioning liver 
and while sarina and alyssa are not completely out of the woods 
their families say they trust 1990 will be a better year than 1989 
for the young transplant recipients 
we feel very strongly that gods hand has been over us mrs 
smith said the thoughts and prayers of the people who responded 
have definitely been answered

pentagon officials said friday that american 
troops had seized 10000 weapons in three separate caches in their 
sweep through panama city and were trying to move out looting 
sniping remnants of manuel antonio noriegas forces 
the primary endeavor of the movement is to clear panama city 
and assist the government in restoring law and order said lt 
gen tom kelly the director of operations for the joint chiefs of 
staff 
meanwhile a pentagon source said friday night an additional 
2000 army soldiers were being flown to panama in the near 
future 
earlier kelly was asked about reports of a mortar round being 
fired at us military headquarters at quarry heights 
things like that can happen he said popping off a mortar 
round is a fairly easy thing to do 
kelly called the weapons discovery little short of 
astonishing 
one wonders what the intentions of noriega were the general 
said adding that the arms cache was composed primarily of eastern 
bloc weapons 
kelly who raised the prospect that additional us troops might 
be brought to panama acknowledged that noriegas defense forces 
had put up a tougher battle than expected and that the mopping 
up process would take longer than first thought 
its simply a difficult operation there are a lot of 
places to hide in panama city kelly said he said military 
commanders estimates for clearing the city range from five to 10 
days 
the general also suggested a new direction for the us troops 
saying we plan to move out to the west of panama city but he 
declined to discuss what the target of the operation might be 
while officials said noriega remained at large kelly said i 
dont think he has a very long halflife he sure is out of 
power 
kelly said that us forces were encountering the remnants of 
noriegas armed civilian battalions 
they are looting sniping they are lawless he said but he 
said us forces have been able to make some progress including 
taking the legislative building the presidential palace central 
bank and several ministries 
im satisfied its under control kelly said of the 
militarys urban operation were not getting anything we cant 
handle 
in a pincer movement kelly said the 193rd infantry which is 
permanently based in panama and the forces of the 82nd airborne 
were moving through the city from opposite points and hoped to link 
up 
late friday the pentagon updated its report of us soldiers 
killed in action saying that 21 had been killed and 221 wounded 
with two missing in addition two civilian us dependents were 
killed 
the pentagon added that 127 members of the panamanian defense 
forces had been killed 66 wounded and 1663 were being detained 
rear adm ted sheafer who joined kelly at the briefing said 
there were still reports of three hostages cases that were not 
resolved there may be others he said 
the admiral the intelligence chief for the joint chiefs said 
the administration was sending a team of experts to panama from the 
various intelligence agencies and departments to go through a 
treasure trove of documents that had been discovered in 
noriegas military headquarters 
kelly asked whether he had enough military force to keep peace 
in the city said we are looking to bring more troops in we are 
also looking at reestablishing the police force 
the general said that since the new government was offering to 
pay the police that may be an incentive for them to come back 
we would like to be able to put panamanian police and us 
military police out in pairs one panamanian one us military 
and in that way begin to restore law and order he said 
later the general said that two companies of us military 
police had been brought into panama on thursday and that they are 
the ones we want in the street with the police because they have 
the training to do it 
pentagon spokeswoman maj kathy wood said that panamanian police 
and us military police have performed security duties at all us 
military installations in panama since the inception of the panama 
canal treaties so the concept of dual patrols is not a new one to 
the area 
she pointed out that the panamanian police while part of the

the general assembly on friday unanimously 
called for an end to driftnet fishing in the south pacific in 1991 
and a global ban on use of the huge nets a year later 
the resolution adopted by consensus denounces driftnet fishing 
as a highly indiscriminate and wasteful fishing method which is 
widely considered to threaten the effective conservation of living 
marine resources 
driftnets stretch up to 30 miles scooping up all fish and other 
marine life dolphins porpoises sea birds and unwanted fish are 
killed along with the desired catch 
japan taiwan and south korea have made extensive use of the 
nets in the pacific ocean to catch squid more than 1000 ships 
from many nations including france spain and italy use the nets 
worldwide 
the un resolution recommends driftnet fishing be scaled down 
immediately in the south pacific and ended there by july 1 1991 
it says a worldwide ban should go into effect on june 30 1992 
while not binding the resolution will probably gain wide 
compliance diplomats say japan considered the biggest user of 
drift nets has already announced it will stop 
the ban the resolution added could be waived in a region 
should effective conservation and management measures be taken 
smallscale use of driftnets in coastal waters would be 
excluded the resolution said such fishing is important to the 
economies of developing countries

fighters loyal to gen manuel antonio 
noriega launched a bold daylight attack friday on the headquarters 
of us military forces and tried to assassinate the vice president 
installed by the united states 
on the third day of the us occupation panama city was near 
anarchy refugees pleaded for food and medicine as waves of looters 
ransacked stores 
us troops searched residential areas of the capital and other 
parts of this west virginiasized nation for noriega but found no 
trace of the ousted dictator they were sent in to capture 
panamanians seemed to greet the us troops with some 
enthusiasm but many residents of this city wracked by savage 
looting and littered with debris were too frightened to go out on 
the streets 
some said they had set up their own defense patrols to protect 
themselves and their neighbors amid the chaos which reigned in 
both lower and middleclass neighborhoods 
in washington pentagon officials said us troops had seized 
10000 weapons mostly made in the east bloc in three separate 
caches in the city lt gen tom kelly director of operations for 
the joint chiefs of staff called the discoveries little short of 
astonishing and said they led to questions about what noriegas 
plans may have been 
a pentagon source said 2000 more soldiers would be airlifted to 
panama bolstering the force of 24000 already there and president 
bush said the troops would stay to do what is necessary 
the usinstalled first vice president ricardo arias calderon 
was leaving the national assembly when members of pronoriega 
dignity battalions shot at his car arias was uninjured but 
two of his aides were wounded said arias aide teni de obaldia 
the fighting around the us southern command in quarry heights 
on the western edge of panama city started about 1125 am and 
lasted an hour with mortar blasts shaking the us headquarters as 
dozens of noriega supporters attacked buildings nearby 
military officials at rodman naval station just across the 
panama canal said they had no information on casualties 
the supreme court about a mile to the southeast was in flames 
and sporadic fighting swirled through parts of the chaotic city 
once a major international financial center but now a shell of 
itself 
only several blocks away from southern command stands the panama 
canal commission headquarters the headquarters itself was not hit 
but surrounding buildings including a warehouse were 
plumes of brown and black smoke could be seen from rodman at 
midafternoon and us army helicopters flew over the area 
apparently searching for the attackers 
later friday us troops fired shells and threw tear gas at a 
residence adjacent to the spanish news agency efe where a friend of 
noriega reportedly lived in a wealthy neighborhood 
seven efe journalists darted to the floor during the 20minute 
attack which shook the office with three loud explosions and could 
be seen from the associated press office 150 yards away 
after the assault neighbors with sledgehammers broke into the 
residence and looted the house which was apparently empty 
late friday the pentagon updated its count of soldiers killed 
in the assault so far to 21 along with two female dependents it 
said 221 were wounded and two were missing since the invasion 
began an american civilian cbs news producer jon meyersohn also 
was missing after being abducted wednesday from the marriott hotel 
us officials said 122 panamanian soldiers were killed and 45 
wounded 
but dr elmer miranda deputy director of santo tomas hospital 
in panama city said there were 200 dead bodies in the basement and 
that he heard from a colleague of 60 more in gorgas hospital run 
by the us southern command 
miranda appealed to latin american nations and europe to send 
medical equipment because the united states is only giving us 
bullets 
thousands of refugees fleeing the fighting took cover in soccer 
stadiums churches and schools 
they had water but were very short of food said a red 
cross worker who like others refused to give his name for fear of 
reprisals 
he said us army units were handing out rations but that it was 
not enough 
noriega supporters in one district said they were running out of 
ammunition and hope several pronoriega bands surrendered in 
western panama on friday 
but the dramatic attack on the very center of the us military 
area and the effort to kill arias showed that us efforts to 
achieve control were falling short 
about 200 reporters who arrived at howard air force base 
overnight were not allowed into the city because military officials 
said they could not guarantee their security an indication us 
military forces are not in as much control of panama city as they 
have been claiming

bulldozers even bakery trolleys testifying to the impromptu 
nature of the uprising 
army units supporting the popular revolt that forced ceausescu 
from power battled on after midnight against proceausescu security 
forces 
just after 230 am 730 pm est friday heavy gunfire broke 
out around the television station where occupants ducked below 
windows as shots rained toward the building lights went out as the 
gunfire pounded in 
minutes before the shooting began crowds still were outside the 
tv building chanting slogans in support of the popular revolt 
against ceausescu 
gunfire also was heard echoing through the streets around the 
radio station about two miles away from the tv building 
on arrival at the airport friday night a guard smiled at this 
correspondent and said welcome to romania

a pipe bomb delivered to a county judges 
apartment exploded and injured him friday but appeared to be 
unrelated to four other bomb attacks in four states since saturday 
authorities said 
washington county circuit judge john corderman 47 was in 
stable condition after undergoing surgery to remove shrapnel in his 
abdomen and right hand said washington county hospital spokeswoman 
diana donegan 
corderman also lost the tip of his right middle finger and 
suffered severe damage to both eardrums but he never lost 
consciousness and his life was in no immediate danger hospital 
officials said 
a neighbor said the bomb exploded in cordermans thirdfloor 
downtown apartment about 10 minutes after a delivery man left a 
package in the building the judge apparently was alone at the 
time police said 
apparently the device was situated outside when he arrived 
home he retrieved it entered the apartment and a short time later 
it exploded we dont know whether it was opened or not said 
chuck jackson maryland state police spokesman 
corderman made his way outside his apartment used a fire alarm 
to call for help and went back inside where he collapsed jackson 
said 
this was a lifethreatening bomb it was not of small 
proportion the injuries however did not threaten him said dr 
charles chaney a surgeon at washington county hospital based on 
the injuries chaney said he believed corderman was holding the 
parcel in his lap when it exploded 
a second unexploded pipe bomb was found in the same package as 
the device that exploded and was designed to detonate when the 
first one did said deputy fire marshal faron taylor the second 
device was disarmed by two bomb specialists he said the building 
was evacuated 
george hopgood an assistant special agent in charge for the 
federal bureau of alcohol tobacco and firearms said the explosion 
appeared to be unrelated to four package bombs in the past week 
that exploded or were defused 
it is not similar to the ones that have been found in the 
southeast at this time there doesnt appear to be any 
connection hopgood said 
hagerstown police chief paul wood said investigators had not yet 
identified a motive 
earlier police lt robert frick said the blast had some 
similarities to the bombs that killed a federal judge in alabama on 
dec 16 and two days later a city councilman who was also an 
naacp attorney in savannah ga 
however weve got a lot of leads to follow up he said 
parcel bombs were also found this week at the jacksonville 
fla chapter of the naacp and the 11th circuit courthouse in 
atlanta both were defused without incident 
colleagues of the us appellate judge who was killed robert s 
vance have since received threatening letters sources told the 
associated press on friday 
in washington justice department spokesman david runkel said he 
was unaware that letters had been delivered to judges on the 11th 
circuit 
but runkel said four threatening letters delivered this week 
bore physical evidence linking them to the bombs that killed vance 
and the attorney robert e robinson he would not say to whom they 
were delivered 
following the hagerstown explosion agents of the bureau of 
alcohol tobacco and firearms arrived from the baltimore office 
about 65 miles southeast of here fbi agents were also on the scene 
a neighbor of corderman steven keyes 30 said he saw a 
delivery man bring a package to the building about 20 minutes 
before the 230 pm explosion 
it looked like a normal person to me a normal delivery 
keyes said the delivery man stayed inside five to 10 minutes and 
the explosion occurred about 10 minutes after he left keyes said 
i thought maybe it was a neighbor who had dropped something on 
the floor it sounded like a muffledtype bomb my brotherinlaw 
thought the truck had backfired keyes said 
corderman known as one of the toughest judges in the county 
was not at work friday because the courthouse was closed for the 
christmas holiday 
hes a judge hes put a lot of people away frick said 
corderman obtained a gun permit several years ago because of 
death threats 
according to baltimore attorney chris brown hes the kind of 
gentleman who you like him or dont like him he has rubbed people 
the wrong way 
brown said the judge takes unusual stances and gives lawyers a 
hard time hes a very colorful outspoken controversial judge 
hagerstown attorney edward button called corderman a legal 
scholar and an extremely competent judge he knows the law very 
very well 
the explosion blew holes in both cordermans eardrums and he 
lost 75 percent hearing in his right ear and 50 percent in the 
left chaney said reconstructive surgery could restore some of 
cordermans hearing he said 
he said the judge was under guard and would probably stay in the 
hospital for three days 
his only concern was that the other judges be made aware of 
the incident and take precautions chaney said 
an fbiled investigation has been concentrating on possible 
racial motivations for the killings in georgia and alabama 
brown said corderman is unlikely to have handled racially 
sensitive cases because few of them arise in washington county 
which has a relatively small black population however inmates at 
two state prisons in washington county often go before circuit 
judges in hagerstown 
a democrat corderman gave up his state senate seat in 1977 at 
age 35 to fill a vacancy on the bench and was elected to a 15year 
term as judge the next year he was elected in 1983 as president of 
the maryland state bar association the first judge in decades to 
hold the post

hospital said detective john mckenna 
rodriguez a 40yearold mother of four was charged with 
aggravated kidnapping as was carmen calderon 20 said detective

a jury on friday recommended 16 years in 
prison for the man who caused the nations worst drunkendriving 
accident but some families of larry mahoneys 27 victims said it 
wasnt enough 
mahoney 36 who had been free on bond prior to his conviction 
was led in handcuffs out of the carroll county courthouse and taken 
to the local jail after circuit judge charles satterwhite 
discontinued his bail 
satterwhite is to sentence mahoney formally in february the 
judge can give mahoney a lighter sentence but cannot exceed the 
jurys recommendation 
it came one day after mahoney was convicted on 27 counts each of 
seconddegree manslaughter and firstdegree wanton endangerment 12 
of firstdegree assault 14 of seconddegree wanton endangerment 
and one of drunken driving 
the recommended sentences totaled 611 years but the jury opted 
to have them run concurrently that effectively gave mahoney 16 
years of a possible 20year sentence for assault the most serious 
offense and he would be eligible for parole consideration in eight 
years under kentucky law 
the jury determined that mahoney caused the crash of a 
churchowned school bus on may 14 1988 as he drove on the wrong 
side of interstate 71 while intoxicated 
the crash five miles south of carrollton caused a fire that 
killed 24 children and three adults who were returning to the 
radcliff first assembly of god church 
forty people escaped but 12 children suffered severe burns 
they were represented by the 12 assault charges 
lawyers on both sides noted the irony of mahoneys being 
convicted of a more serious offense for the burn injuries than for 
the deaths the maximum sentence for seconddegree manslaughter is 
10 years which the jury recommended on each of the 27 counts but 
that was made moot by the recommendation that the prison terms be 
concurrent not consecutive 
the jurys verdict and sentence recommendations were a big 
letdown for the victims families since the state had charged 
mahoney with murder in each of the deaths said william nichols 
whose only child 17yearold william joseph nichols jr died in 
the bus fire 
ive forgiven larry mahoney but hes got to pay for his crime 
and eight years is not enough said nichols 
i really dont think he understands what hes done to all of 
our lives said nichols wife madeline 
it was not manslaughter it was murder said janet kytta 
whose husband charles burned to death on the bus i cant say 
chucks life was worth five years or 10 years or 20 years but it 
was worth the word murder 
the leader of a group fighting drunken driving said the jury 
missed a chance to send a sobering message nationwide 
it sends out a message thats been sent out thousands of times 
before said ken nathanson president of citizens for safe 
drivers against drunk drivers and other chronic offenders it 
just indicates that american society isnt that serious about drunk 
driving 
assistant attorney general paul richwalsky who prosecuted 
mahoney said he was disappointed both by the jurys refusal to 
convict the chemical plant worker of murder and by the recommended 
sentence 
i asked for consecutive sentences but they gave 
concurrent richwalsky said i thought all the carnage was 
worth more than eight years 
william summers lead attorney on mahoneys threeman defense 
team said he was basically pleased with the verdict 
we beat 27 murder counts summers said at least mahoney 
can hold his head up hes not a mass murderer 
mahoney is remorseful regardless of the length of his prison 
sentence summers said if putting him away for life would take 
away some of the hurt hed do it summers said 
 
one of mahoneys last requests while waiting for the jurys 
verdict on thursday was to meet with kentucky state police trooper 
henry sonny cease who was the cases lead investigator 
cease had to remove the victims burned bodies the day after the 
crash when the bus was hauled to a temporary morgue at 
carrolltons national guard armory 
in their brief meeting mahoney just said he holds no grudges 
against me cease said i told him i feel the same way he does 
i wish we werent here

friday how hotel employees helped them hide from belligerent 
panamanian soldiers 
most of the passengers many disheveled and tired were from the 
caribbean and latin america and had been guests at the besieged 
marriott hotel in panama city 
several said the panamanian soldiers questioned them and 
separated them from american citizens who were at the hotel 
eastern airlines flight 8302 with 57 passengers and eight crew 
members was the first commercial flight from panama to arrive at 
this international air travel hub airline spokesman robin mattel 
said hes not aware of any earlier commercial flights from panama 
to this country 
those on the flight said they either were aided by marriott 
employees to hide from panamanian soldiers or were liberated when 
american soldiers retook the hotel 
the flight back was completely euphoric said colin cleary 
who lives in colombia with his wife and 18monthold child we 
were so grateful to eastern to get us back we had been stuck at 
howard air force base since 1 thursday afternoon 
we were happy and relieved he said of the passengers a 
lot of us were sleeping on the plane because we havent had much 
sleep

china on saturday denied giving sanctuary to 
ousted romanian president nicolae ceausescu 
the notion that ceausescu has fled to china is utterly 
groundless the foreign ministry said in a statement 
the 71yearold ceausescu was variously reported to have fled 
bucharest after being overthrown friday but his whereabouts remain 
unknown 
beijing has long been a staunch supporter of ceausescus 
hardline government and there was speculation he might seek 
refuge in china 
ceausescu backed chinas bloody suppression of the studentled 
prodemocracy movement last spring and chinas communist party 
chief jiang zemin spoke recently of the sincere and profound 
friendship between the two countries 
the foreign ministry declined comment on ceausescus demise and 
there were no reports of events in romania in either the official 
xinhua news agency or the communist partys peoples daily 
ceausescu has visited china at least six times during his 
24year reign his last official trip was in october 1988

north korea launched a campaign friday to promote 
socialism warning that it could be destroyed by political reform 
and a multiparty system 
radio press a private japanese news agency that monitors 
communist news reports said the campaign suggests that north korea 
is watching the recent reforms in east europe with a strong sense 
of crisis 
if political pluralism and the multiparty system were allowed 
in socialist society they would bring grave consequences 
antisocialist forces may come to the fore and destroy the 
political unity of the popular masses and fundamentally demolish 
the socialist system ruling communist officials of north korea 
said 
official radio pyongyang broadcast news of the campaign in a 
50minute report from the communists workers party organ rodong 
sinmun the korean central news agency carried a full text of the 
rodong sinmun article as well as eight other related stories 
north korean media have remained silent on the dramatic changes 
in eastern europe and the reports friday did not mention them 
however an article carried by the korean central news agencys 
english service said socialism is facing a grave challenge 
the article asserted that the socialist system was bound to win 
out socialism tomorrow which withstood challenge of the 
imperialists today is sure to be crowned with the honor of final 
victory it said 
north korea one of the most isolated countries in the world 
has been making a timid attempt to emulate the policies of openness 
and economic reform undertaken by china and the soviet union 
however the hardline state remains firmly under the grip of 
president kim il sung who has been ruling it since 1945 neither 
he nor his heirdesignate son kim jong il has shown signs of a 
desire for major reform 
the party article said the capitalists not only oppose the 
socialist communist idea a great ideology which indicates the 
path of a worthy life of man but also spread reactionary 
bourgeois ideology and culture 
the article went on to say if there is a crisis in socialist 
countries it is not a crisis resulting from lack of commodities 
but a crisis resulting from lack of communist ideology 
the only effective prescription to cure the fatal disease of 
the capitalist society and achieve world peace and common 
prosperity of mankind is to liquidate the capitalist exploiting 
system and advance toward socialism it said

we made a big discovery during the 1980s that ranks right up 
there with the discovery of the virus and the modes of spread 
mann said by telephone from geneva and that discovery is that to 
fight this global epidemic of infectious disease you must also

it doesnt compare with his 
stiller or other works that won worldwide attention but at 78 
novelistplaywright max frisch has broken eight years of literary 
silence and has returned to swiss bestseller lists 
the subject of his new book is switzerlands militia army which 
has not fought a foreign war in five centuries the army has 
fascinated him since he boarded a train on sept 1 1939 to join an 
artillery unit based in the alps at that time he was convinced he 
would help defend the neutral country against an invasion by the 
nazis his concern focused on a german jewish resident of basel 
who was then his girlfriend 
two of his books published in 1940 and 1974 deal with his 
wartime experience marking his conversion to increasingly radical 
pacificism the third was jotted down in barely two months last 
spring 
it was timed to add fuel to a nationwide debate on a recent 
proposal that sought the abolition of the 625000man swiss army 
frischs new switzerland without an army features a 
sparsely worded dialogue between a grandfather easily 
identifiable as the author himself and his grandson jonas 
subtitled a palaver it is actually a collection of pros and 
cons in the debate though frisch makes no secret of his opinion 
we need the army seriously the grandfather at one point 
tells a doubting jonas who is thinking of possibly emigrating to 
the united states the grandfather lists the wellworn whys 
school of life school of men school of the nation before 
adding what to him is the principal reason the bodyguard of the 
reign of the wealthy 
once more frisch shows himself as a disillusioned critic of the 
swiss system 
their misery is the purchasing power without any great hope 
the grandfather says of his compatriots they spend their 
vacations in the service of economic growth 
the army is not our army jonas is told but an army that 
is maneuvering on our territory as the army of the swiss society of 
finance and officers 
the book went into its fifth edition three months after 
publication and has been translated into four languages 
a dramatized version jonas and his veteran premiered at 
zurichs prestigious schauspielhaus theater oct 20 directed by 
benno besson a swiss disciple of bertolt brecht a french language 
version went on stage one day later at lausanne the performances 
drew rounds of applause but reviewers were mixed 
it is a convincing text said the zurich weekly 
sonntagszeitung praising frischs subtle argumentation and 
his stylistic elegance the reasons presented are of such 
cogent logic that the question ought to be on the mind of 
everyone leaving the theater how could one ever believe in the 
institution of the army 
for the berner zeitung of bern the play showed that the idea of 
a switzerland without an army can be the subject of a spirited 
discussion 
another bern newspaper der bund said the play lacked the 
stylistic power the poetic weight and dramaturgic logic of 
triptych the last work frisch wrote exclusively for the stage 
in 1978 
frischs grandfather is sure the swiss army is sure to stay 
if the swiss army is ever be disbanded it will not be by a 
referendum but by a war

the south lebanon army created by israel 
to help guard its border has honed its fighting skills and 
expanded in size but there is no sign israel is ready to withdraw 
from southern lebanon and leave the fighting to its allies 
with israeli advisers and reporters watching the sla recently 
showed off its gunnery prowess in a livefire exercise with a dozen 
soviet t55 tanks captured by the israelis from the palestine 
liberation organization 
gun barrels flashed and the aging tanks painted gray knocked 
out rusty trucks on a hillside nearly a halfmile away 
the lebanese crews silhouetted on a ridgeline could be seen 
jumping and waving their arms with delight 
the exercise israeli advisers stressed marked a significant 
improvement in the military capabilities of the militia that helps 
israeli troops patrol a security zone that is 25 to 12 miles deep 
just north of israels border 
however some observers see a major problem with the militias 
reliability and discipline 
the sla has caused israel political embarrassment by getting 
involved in shooting incidents with the ninenation 5700member 
united nations peackeeping force that patrols north of the security 
zone 
it also has stirred up antiisraeli sentiment with 
indiscriminate shellings of shiite moslem villages 
the sla commander antoine lahad 62 a retired lebanese army 
general told reporters his force made a lot of improvement 
since israel withdrew the bulk of its troops from lebanon in 1985 
the sla was more like a militia now it has developed into a 
small regular army he said adding the force numbered 3000 men 
up from 2000 a year ago and may expand further 
lahad who survived a communistinspired assassination attempt 
in november 1988 said an israeli presence was needed until syria 
withdrew its 40000 troops from lebanon 
the day we face lebanese opponents only we can do without the 
backing of the israeli army said lahad a christian whose 
militia controls an area with a predominantly shiite moslem 
population of 200000 
israel has stationed troops in lebanon since shortly after 
lebanons civil war began in 1975 
col renaan gissin deputy spokesman for the israeli army said 
israel had no plans to leave but also had no interest in lebanon 
beyond protecting its 60mile border 
he added that the zone had proved a success because life in 
northern israel was normal and no israeli civilian had died in an 
attack from lebanon since 1985 
the slas reliability remains a major question mark however 
in recent years the christianled force was riddled with 
defections by shiites had its positions overrun by iranianbacked 
hezbollah guerrillas and proved unable to stop palestinian 
infiltrations into the security zone 
the sla has also borne the brunt of shiite and palestinian 
attacks suffering 188 killed and 600 wounded in the past four 
years so far this year the sla came under 350 guerrilla attacks 
about half the level of the previous year 
despite the improvements some experts are less confident of the 
slas ability to restrain its militiamen from exacting revenge and 
say the force is incapable of standing up to guerrilla attacks 
without israeli troops estimated by foreign reports to number at 
least 1000 
the sla will hold on as long as israeli army is the backbone 
discipline is good as long as israeli officers are there said 
yoram hamizrachi a retired colonel who was in charge of training 
the sla from 1977 to 1980 
they are improving in military skills they can read maps and 
coordinate their actions but they have a tendency to lose their 
tempers i wouldnt trust them in anything major 
in early december for example sla gunners retaliated for the 
ambush killing of three sla militiamen by firing sporadic barrages 
at civilian areas north of the security zone lebanese reports said 
nine civilians were killed in the shiite town of nabatiyeh 
the shiite leader nabih berri responded with a warning that 
his amal militiamen would shell israeli settlements if the sla 
attacks persisted 
maj gen yossi peled israels northern front commander 
conceded in a recent interview that he had frequent arguments with 
sla commanders about the use of force 
he said that it was normal for lebanese militias to fire 100 to 
300 shells into a small village 
peled said it was quite difficult to get the sla to 
understand israels objections but during the past two or three 
years we succeeded to change their behavior i dont know if it 
will go back the way it was but there has been a tremendous 
change

this is another in an occasional series of 
articles on the proliferation of moviemaking outside hollywood 
tempted by friendly officials eager to please filmmakers are 
flocking to outofstate locations spending billions of dollars 
that once would have stayed in california 
</TEXT>

only a handful of bystanders watched as actor 
james spader strode out of eds sandwich shop tossed his scarf 
over his right shoulder and turned around to do it over again and 
again and again 
hollywood comes to midtown st louis 
if it werent for the fact that the street was blocked off for 
the cameras the sight hardly would have stopped traffic 
its not like were setting houses on fire said spooky 
stevens the publicist for the movie white palace starring 
spader and susan sarandon after 20 minutes of standing out here 
and freezing to death theyll go home sure enough most people 
didnt stay long but then st louisans have gotten used to having 
the white palace crew around town 
in fact moviemaking has become more and more routine all 
across missouri in recent years thanks in part to the efforts of 
the missouri film commission and the st louis film partnership 
both just a few years old 
the commission was formed in 1985 as a program of the states 
department of economic development the partnership was started two 
years later it is funded by the st louis county economic council 
the city of st louis the st louis convention and visitors 
commission the regional commerce and growth association and the 
regional cultural and performing arts development commission 
the two groups have jumped headfirst into a worldwide tussle for 
movie dollars competing with more established film commissions in 
other states cities and even foreign countries all try to woo 
filmmakers with slick catalogs location scouting and expert 
technical help 
still even though 42 states have film offices and actively 
compete for business california remains the film leader of the 
united states with new york close at its heels 
though not always cheaper its easier to make a movie outside 
california onestop statecontrolled film offices are preferred 
to californias patchwork approach where local governments issue 
permits with fluctuating fees and have requirements that are 70 
years old 
 
and the longheld belief that hollywood could recreate anything 
from the tara plantation in gone with the wind to the las vegas 
strip in one from the heart has been abandoned by filmmakers 
who want greater realism 
its very stale to shoot in the same place said kate 
arnold production coordinator for the missouri film commission 
authenticity is important these days 
its important for the cities and states that land the films 
too during the first year of its existence the film commission 
helped bring in 41 million to the states economy last year the 
film industry meant 165 million to missouri 
onlocation filming is a growing industry that brings dollars 
and jobs to the state said gary gonder manager of the 
commission these major projects also put the spotlight on 
missouri which helps our state industrial recruitment efforts 
too 
since may four features have been filmed in the state 
white palace based on st louisan glenn savans first 
novel about a yuppie st louis advertising executive who after the 
death of his young wife becomes obsessed with a lusty older woman 
who works in a fastfood restaurant all but three days are being 
filmed in and around st louis and the movie is expected to be 
released in the fall of 1990 
mr and mrs bridge starring paul newman and joanne 
woodward and filmed around kansas city based on two novels mrs 
bridge and mr bridge by evan s connell the story spans 40 
years in the lives of a quintessential american couple in kansas 
city shooting is completed and the movie is expected to be 
released next summer arnold said that while newman was filming in 
kansas city the makers of cordon negro champagne spent more than 
1 million there to film a commercial with him 
miss missouri a french production filmed in kansas city 
and surrounding communities the story is about a former miss 
missouri who travels to europe and falls in love with a frenchman 
afraid he will discover that she had been married before and has a 
child she flees and returns to her home the shooting is 
completed and the movie is scheduled to premiere at the cannes 
film festival next spring 
detour an independent production directed by kansas 
citian wade williams and filmed mostly in kansas city its a new 
version of a 1945 movie about a man who picks up a hitchhiker and 
gets involved in murder the shooting is scheduled to be completed 
in december 
what sold the movie moguls on missouri 
in the case of white palace a big reason was the desire to 
capture the real flavor of st louis where the story takes place 
why try to import natural flavor when you have it right here 
said stevens 
the efforts of the two film commissions paid off too she said 
but sometimes winning the hearts of a movie producer doesnt go 
so smoothly 
the makers of parenthood a story supposedly set in st 
louis opted to forfeit realism for warm weather and shoot in 
orlando fla but then again escape from new york was shot in 
st louis not new york 
janis rockwellstrong executive director of the st louis film 
partnership set about luring the producers of white palace to 
st louis months before their cameras rolled into town when she 
heard that the movie rights to the book had been bought she 
started firing off letters 
i said im from st louis this is a book from st louis and i 
want you to know were interested rockwellstrong said 
over the following months rockwellstrong took dozens of 
pictures of various st louis neighborhoods and sent them off to 
the producers then she took them around town when they came to 
look for themselves 
i rented the van and we showed them st louis 
rockwellstrong said we showed them the various looks 
it worked filming began oct 25

are striking for longer weekends without cuts in pay 
among those targeted have been rollsroyce plc a maker of 
aviation engines and british aerospace plc which makes harrier 
verticaltakeoff jump jets 
the confederation of shipbuilding and engineering unions has 
brought 10000 workers out on strike since midoctober in a 
selective campaign to shorten britains basic 39hour work week for 
its 2 million members nearly all in engineering industries 
if you give people the opportunity they would opt for a 
longer weekend or an extra holiday rather than a pay raise said 
its general secretary alex ferry 
the hours of relaxation have become more and more important 
the 17union confederation targeted four companies and has 
already reached agreement on a 37hour week by 1992 with three of 
them including rollsroyce aviation subsidiary smiths industries 
plc of cheltenham in southwest england and neiparsons ltd an 
engineering company in newcastle in the northeast 
some 2000 manual workers at rollsroyce in glasgow scotland 
voted dec 16 to end a sixweek strike after being offered a 
37hour week by november 1991 
in return local unions have agreed to greater flexibility on 
working practices and on job training to enable workers to become 
more adept and more productive 
a monthold strike of 7100 manual workers at british aerospace 
plants in preston chester and kingstonuponthames is expected to 
last into the new year 
the confederation has threatened to hit more of britains 5000 
engineering companies with walkouts in 1990 if they do not reduce 
their basic hours without cutting pay 
the engineering employers federation on nov 16 suspended 
nationwide bargaining with unions over the 35hour dispute and 
left each company to hammer out individual deals 
for years labor unions have argued that a shorter work week 
will create new jobs and curb high unemployment 
the 35hour goal was at the heart of a key west german metal 
workers strike in 1984 
the campaign which also surfaced periodically in countries such 
as denmark france and italy in the 1980s has lowered the average 
basic work week for manual workers to between 37 hours and 39 
hours in at least 10 west european countries according to the 
international labor organization in geneva 
that compares with the standard us work week of 40 hours 
which has remained unchanged since world war ii 
in recent years average annual paid vacations also have 
lengthened to at least five weeks in france spain denmark 
finland austria luxembourg britain italy the netherlands and 
west germany 
in the united states manual workers get an average of 12 days 
annual leave 
at british aerospaces military aircraft division in 
kingstonuponthames near london 1200 manual workers have been on 
strike since midnovember 
british aerospace is insisting on a return to work as a 
precondition of negotiations 
deryck gomez a 21year company veteran says british aerospace 
already presses workers to work an extra six hours a week on 
average to meet its production schedule of 24 harriers for the us 
marine corps and 20 for britains royal air force 
the leisure is more important to me than working overtime 
gomez said you spend more time with the wife and kids 
people who work here they get so uptight theres been more 
work on the harrier than ever before its more detailed work 
skilled assemblyline workers at british aerospace earn the 
equivalent of about 340 a week in basic pay and get five weeks 
vacation 
engineering unions favor the shorter week as an inflationproof 
pay rise and argue they have earned it because productivity has 
risen 43 percent since 1979 when the work week slipped from 40 to 
39 hours across most of western europe 
the unions claim a shorter work week also will recover some of 
the 1 million engineering jobs lost to recession and technological 
advances in britain in the last decade 
but employers fear that without flexibility a 35hour week 
could blunt further britains competitive edge against overseas 
rivals 
what companies have to ensure when they make these agreements 
is their productivity doesnt suffer said brian balcomb 
spokesman for the employers federation 
he said trade union statistics show productivity in british 
engineering lags that of france and west germany by 55 percent and 
japan and the united states by more than 100 percent

the entries for the 62nd academy awards have 
all made their appearances and the race shapes up as a contest 
between the little people and the giants 
critics awards have already appeared and although they tend to 
be more esoteric than the oscars the choices indicate a trend 
toward more modest films 
spike lees do the right thing was named best picture by the 
los angeles critics edging out drugstore cowboy the new york 
film critics circle chose my left foot and the national board 
of review selected driving miss daisy 
observers believe that academy voters will nominate many of the 
independent and minorbudget films and pay little heed to the 
multimilliondollar grossers of 1989 such as batman indiana 
jones and the last crusade honey i shrunk the kids look 
whos talking and ghostbusters ii 
victory for the independents would mirror the 1985 awards when 
two lowbudget films won acting honors geraldine page in the 
trip to bountiful and william hurt in kiss of the spider 
woman 
heres how the oscar race appears to this onlooker 
best picture the question is will academy voters remember 
wellpraised films released earlier in the year if they do such 
pictures as sex lies and videotape do the right thing 
when harry met sally and field of dreams might be 
recognized but the voters have notoriously short memories and 
they may select such recent arrivals as enemies a love story 
glory driving miss daisy and born on the fourth of 
july two imports my left foot and henry v also stand a 
chance 
best actor morgan freeman seems a certain nominee for his 
role as the devoted chauffeur in driving miss daisy rather 
than his supporting role as a union soldier in glory daniel 
daylewis is a favorite as the cerebral palsy victim in my left 
foot 
however oldline academy members may want to reward the 
veterans gregory peck as the iconoclastic ambrose bierce in old 
gringo jack lemmon as the befuddled oldster in dad jack 
nicholson as the joker in batman paul newman as roistering 
earl long in blaze then there are the noteworthy newcomers 
tom cruise the vietnam veteran in born on the fourth of july 
kenneth brannagh as the ruler henry v ron silver as the 
muchmarried holocaust survivor in enemies a love story 
best actress the leaders present a marked contrast jessica 
tandy the cantankerous widow in driving miss daisy and 
michelle pfeiffer the sexpot chanteuse in the fabulous baker 
boys other favorites are andie macdowell the betrayed wife in 
sex lies and videotape pauline collins the liberated 
housewife in shirley valentine and meg ryan the career woman 
looking for love in when harry met sally 
kathleen turner could attract votes for her battling wife in 
the war of the roses as well as sally field for her grieving 
mother in steel magnolias other contenders could very well be 
jessica lange the lawyer defending her father in music box 
and perennial nominee meryl streep the romance novelist of 
shedevil 
best supporting actor denzel washington and morgan freeman 
could both be contending as the union soldiers in glory martin 
landau and alan alda might compete for their roles in crimes and 
misdemeanors 
other possibilities include james earl jones field of 
dreams danny aiello do the right thing armin 
muehllerstahl music box robert loggia triumph of the 
spirit and the late ray mcanally my left foot 
best supporting actress theres a mixed field including julie 
roberts steel magnolias laura san giacomo sex lies and 
videotape anjelica huston and lena olin enemies a love 
story diane wiest parenthood mary stuart masteron 
immediate family olympia dukakis dad and brenda fricker 
my left foot 
best director this category is usually dictated by the 
choices for best picture the leading candidates are neophyte 
steven soderbergh sex lies and videotape paul mazursky 
enemies a love story oliver stone born on the fourth of 
july bruce beresford driving miss daisy costagavras

one of the more successful books of the 
christmas selling season is a work of art in the west a bound 
portfolio of some of artist georgia okeeffes best work it costs 
100 
while that in itself is a story since book publishing has had 
its woes the saga behind the book is a rare one of 
entrepreneurship involving a young publisher guided by heart and 
soul rather than a business degree 
nicholas callaway was a harvard classics student in 1973 when 
the artist came to the school to receive an honorary degree i 
wanted to see the person i had admired in the photographs by her 
husband alfred stieglitz he said 
a junior callaway wasnt involved in the ceremony so he had to 
improvise okeeffe loved flowers i went to a florist in harvard 
square and bought a peony he said and then worked his way 
through the crowd in the yard 
there she was he said the woman in the photographs as 
she passed in procession he held out the peony saying this is 
for you mrs okeeffe she took it instinctively it seemed and 
held it throughout the ceremony 
okeeffe then 85 seldom corresponded with admirers but 
callaway had been mesmerized he wrote to her the following year 
she replied saying she had always wondered who gave her the peony 
she invited him for a visit 
callaway spent a day with okeeffe at ghost ranch her studio 
near abiquiu nm it intensified his feelings at the time he had 
no thought of publishing but the classics scholar felt drawn more 
intensely toward studio arts 
he recalled the flower episode a few days ago and briefly dwelt 
on its meaning in his life and perhaps in the lives of wouldbe 
entrepreneurs 
when you are drawn to something you must seize the 
opportunity there is no reason to hesitate in pursuing an 
intuition attraction or interest he said 
had i not handed her the flower he reflected a lot of 
other things might not have happened 
callaway experimented with photography before he left harvard 
traveled to europe on a fellowship studied art apprenticed 
himself to a fine printer in paris and then was asked by a friend 
to run an art gallery there 
the experiences were revealing callaway 23 found he could 
combine art and business that in fact he was a good 
businessman the elements were coming together he said and 
convinced him to have his own operation 
back in america his brother like his father an entrepreneur 
lent him money to publish his first book brancusi the sculptor 
as photographer he sold 3000 copies at 1995 
he went to see okeeffe again found she wanted to publish a 
book of her husbands photographs couldnt resist the challenge 
and daringly won the right to copublish the work with the national 
gallery of art he had four employees 
the book was a huge success critically and commercially he was 
on his way working from a greenwich village studio but printing in 
kyoto japan 
callaway editions inc still has only eight people but 
smallness is its strength big upfront costs typical in book 
publishing are not easily met by small companies so callaway 
restructured and focused his efforts 
that restructuring seems to have defined the way fine books are 
published in the future callaway and similarly small companies now 
often copublish with large established houses combining the 
strengths of each 
the small company specializes in concepts editorial matter and 
production we concentrate on making the book and they bigger 
publishers do what they do best financing marketing sales and 
distribution he says 
the callaway staff is intense perfectionist dedicated 
creative and enterprising they must for instance develop leads 
from decadesold telephone books to find owners of paintings and 
then seek permission to photograph 
in the west is the second of four okeeffe volumes scheduled 
for copublishing with the esteemed house of alfred knopf part of 
random house and edited by callaway and doris bry an okeeffe 
associate and scholar 
the first one hundred flowers in two years sold nearly 
75000 hardbound copies at 100 and more than 100000 in a 2995 
softcover edition previously no 100 trade art book had sold more 
than about 15000 copies 
thats just part of the commercial success callaway and knopf 
have found that okeeffe an american icon is a world industry 
about 150000 one hundred flowers calendars sold at 1295 
with another edition out for 1990 
parts of in the west also will take multiple forms a wall 
calendar to be sure a 1695 engagement desk book 75000 copies 
a 995 post card book with two images of 12 paintings 30000 
and an 1895 address book 35000 
the works will be published in canada the united kingdom 
france germany italy japan and scandinavia again with partners 
in each country we could not do what we do without larger 
companies says callaway 
but what they do is what they love to do eight intense people 
in a small greenwich village studio it makes a difference

for financial analysts seeking an audience there 
is an almost sure formula forecast that the housing market is 
going to be reduced to rubble 
anything about housing has a wide audience more than 60 percent 
of households own their homes and many renters would like to own 
homeowners have big investments they worry about their money 
and they are alert to anything said or done that might affect it 
that includes forecasts and helps explain why forecasts of housing 
debacles never cease 
several years ago in fact a book was written about the coming 
collapse of housing prices the event was never recorded by any 
economic statistic or seismograph but it didnt deter the 
forecaster 
similar warnings have been issued throughout 1989 and the surest 
bet you can make is that the outpouring of doom much of it from 
financial people who tend to measure housing as an investment only 
will continue in 1990 
at the moment in fact there exists a popular notion that 
singlefamily home sales and prices have declined sharply in much 
of the country especially in the northeast specific collapses 
always available are used to illustrate 
the specifics however dont always make a generalization 
national data show that the median price of existing 
singlefamily homes in october 1988 was 88900 one year later in 
october of this year it was 92100 thats a gain of 36 percent 
data for the northeast compiled by the national association of 
realtors shows the price of typical new singlefamily homes in 
october 1988 was 144400 and in october 1989 143300 thats a 
decline of 08 percent hardly a disaster and one barely worth 
mentioning in the stock market 
at that the significance might be overdone oddly that decline 
in the price of new houses tiny as it is might indicate strength 
rather than weakness to wit 
falling interest rates in 1989 encouraged buyers who earlier had 
been priced out of the market clearly these people wouldnt seek 
the most expensive homes they would buy in the middle ranges 
creating a lower median 
in spite of warnings and forecasts home prices have been 
remarkably stable or strong year after year industrial and 
commercial real estate might not have done well but singlefamily 
housing is distinct from them 
what has changed is the fortunes of banks that made bad loans 
and in this way a banking problem becomes a socalled crisis in 
real estate 
since 1972 census bureau figures show not one year in which 
prices of new and existing homes have failed to rise nationally 
although there have indeed been been regional or local declines 
but while bad news in one stock unless it is ibm or general 
motors rarely is used to suggest a general market decline that 
reasoning isnt always applied to housing 
housing is in fact an even better investment than shown on 
some popular wall street charts of relative values most charts of 
comparative investments relate the percentage gains in housing to 
the total price however most americans put down but a fraction of 
the price when buying homes they take loans instead 
when ordinary folks buy stock they usually pay full price rather 
than go on margin or borrow from the broker to borrow may be 
unwise because of volatility so if a 10 stock rises 1 they 
usually have a 10 percent gain 
when a 50000 house bought with 5000 down rises in value to 
55000 the apparent gain is also 10 percent but since it was 
purchased with only 5000 down the real return to the homeowner is 
100 percent 
the homeowner pays interest on the mortgage and real estate 
taxes insurance and upkeep but he or she also receives big income 
tax deductions not available to shareowners and gets to sleep in 
the homeinvestment 
remember it the next time financial experts proclaim the end 
of the world in housing and remember some of these are the same 
ones who created a brokerage house recession and billions in bad 
loans for banks

dorian harewood is a hardnosed army major 
who meets the hardhearted kc on china beach and sees himself 
as her henry higgins 
he knows shes a prostitute but he thinks he can be her 
savior said harewood who makes guest appearances on three 
episodes of the abc series 
he wants to take this hardasnails prostitute and mold her 
into a great human being he falls for her and she for him but 
they have a communication problem and their flaws get in the way 
harewood made one earlier appearance as maj melvin p otis the 
new commander of the vietnam medical and recreation center that is 
the focus of the series he returns wednesday in the first of two 
more episodes 
kc played by marg helgenberger is a prostitute who is 
sometimes referred to as an entrepreneur since shes out to 
make money off the war kc doesnt want to be changed in one 
scene where she tries on a dress otis bought her she looks in a 
mirror and says donna reed an obvious reference to reeds 
prostitute role in from here to eternity 
little is made of the interracial aspect of the romance there 
is one scene where someone of limited thinking i wont call him a 
redneck doesnt like to see a romance between a black man and a 
white woman harewood said whats great is that they dont 
make that much over the fact that were different colors 
it focuses on the relationship these characters have flaws 
they have personality problems but neither is concerned about 
their relationship being interracial 
harewood said that in 1977 he was cast as a doctor in a pilot 
after the female love interest had already been set she was 
white and the producer said why change it it got great reviews 
but the network was too gutless to put on a series about a black 
doctor 
harewood talked about his china beach stint while wearing a 
blue hospital robe his head swathed in bandages for a role in a 
new feature film solar crisis he costars with charlton 
heston tim matheson and peter boyle in the science fiction 
thriller set in the 21st century interior sets for a spaceship 
filled an old warehouse near downtown los angeles 
the story is that the earths burning up and were trying to 
return the atmosphere to a good condition he said one man 
with a multinational corporation is making money off peoples 
misery and tries to stop us 
im an astronaut whos tough but nice hes similar to my 
character on china beach although maj otis is more of a bad 
guy 
early next year harewood and perry king begin work on a new 
pilot for abc called the knife amp gun club based on a book 
about emergency room surgeons 
its the second pilot for harewood and king who first 
collaborated in the 1975 tv movie foster amp laurie they were 
police partners who were killed in an ambush in the true story 
in another pilot created by harewood wife ann mccurry we 
played brothers who had the same mother and met for the first time 
at her funeral we teamed up as investigative reporters for a 
magazine it was a great idea that wasnt translated to film abc 
said it didnt work but liked the chemistry between perry and 
myself and asked us to try again 
in the knife amp gun club slang for an emergency room they 
play two longtime friends who give up their practices to contract 
with a hospital to run the emergency services 
harewood also is negotiating for a new movie and is developing a 
broadway musical based on to sir with love

dr sherif awadallah came two years ago 
to set up a program in reproductive endocrinology at charleston 
area medical center 
last summer awadallah pulled up stakes and went back to ohio 
joining an exodus of doctors who say an indifferent legislature and 
a hostile insurance industry make west virginia a grim place to 
practice medicine 
its complicated he said there was a lot for me to do 
there if i wasnt married with children i probably would have 
stayed but concerns about the regional economy plus problems with 
insurance thats a double whammy 
a decline in doctors a national trend has been worse in west 
virginia in recent years threatening gains in medical care made 
since the 1960s 
since the beginning of the year more than 80 doctors have 
stopped practicing in west virginia according to a legislative 
task force and fewer are settling here the state medical board 
licensed 318 new doctors in 1989 down from 346 last year and 414 
in 1987 
the charleston area medical center had three applicants for 
every opening in its residency program a decade ago today 22 of 
118 slots are unfilled and while 23 percent of the students at 
west virginias three medical schools come from out of state 
nearly 35 percent wont stay once theyve graduated 
those trends have left the state with 152 doctors per 100000 
residents 37th among the states and well below the national 
average of 189 according to the american medical association some 
counties have no doctors at all 
some of the good people that you want standing over you in 
surgery are leaving said dr phil branson an orthopedic surgeon 
in princeton at this point i am watching how things go 
many of west virginias 3000 doctors blame the states 
political leadership which they say traditionally has lagged in 
controlling medical costs and protecting doctors from excessive 
malpractice awards the legislature this year moved to control 
runaway medical costs lawmakers say those measures may drive 
doctors away temporarily but ultimately will make going to the 
doctor less painful for everyone most doctors say the law only 
deepened the crisis 
the state has never maintained good control of its health care 
costs said dr richard capito of thomas memorial hospital in 
south charleston and a member of the legislative task force on 
uncompensated health care 
when corporate america was forming hmos and ppos and holding 
down costs west virginia was an open book you charge us and 
well pay it said capito a native of weirton who graduated from 
west virginia university medical school 
health maintenance organizations and preferred provider 
organizations are groups aimed at reducing health care costs 
through an agreement with a captive group of doctors or hospitals 
guaranteeing income in return for discounts 
doctors and lawmakers also blame federal programs in the 1960s 
that brought care to isolated areas where people were too poor to 
pay for it onethird more doctors practice here than in the 
mid1970s and the infant death rate has been halved since 1960 
according to the department of health and human services 
but many doctors say they arent paid enough and most say they 
sometimes arent paid at all a west virginia state medical 
association report said that doctors write off 142 million in 
health care each year 
high malpractice rates also scare away young doctors said 
capito who belongs to a group of emergency care doctors that 
contracts services to thomas memorial each doctor pays 20000 in 
annual malpractice premiums one who left and moved to south 
carolina now pays 2000 a year for similar coverage because that 
state has set up a joint underwriting association for doctors 
the omnibus health care act which went into effect in july 
averted a 100 million financial crisis by controlling how much the 
state spends on care 
but many doctor say the main features fee caps and requiring 
doctors and hospitals who see stateinsured patients to see 15 
percent covered by medicaid will only make things worse 
lawmakers argue that the state had act to head off a fiscal crisis 
that would have jeopardized the entire budget 
its a piece of the answer a step in the right direction 
said del pat white the administrator of a clinic and a leader of 
two legislative health care committees who has been meeting with 
doctors to discuss possible changes in the bill in the coming 
session 
in the past there wasnt that dialogue said george rider 
the west virginia medical associations executive director 
advocates for the poor occupy a middle ground between doctors 
and legislators so they havent been key players in making health 
care policy said charles tindley coordinator of the mountain 
state health care campaign 
to me its a real attitude of selfishness said tindley 
the doctors have become so hostile that they think anyone on the 
socalled other side is their enemy the enemy is poor health 
care 
rider applauded the governor for appointing the associations 
chief to a task force studying how medical schools can help keep 
doctors in the state 
not all riders 2300 members are so optimistic task force 
recommendations arent due until august long after the end of the 
legislative session and even then doctors dont pull much weight 
in the legislature rider said 
in dealing with the legislature in the last three or four 
years theres been little openmindedness to listen to the medical 
community capito said the health care act affects onequarter 
of the states population but there was not a single practicing 
physician consulted 
the consensus among doctors is that lasting solutions wont come 
easy 
the omnibus act is a problem but as an isolated problem it 
wouldnt be such a big deal said awadallah who now practices in 
cincinnati its gratifying to practice where people really need 
you but for physicians its a longterm economic picture 
universal health care would save the state money and help with 
the problem of uncompensated health care analysts say but doctors 
say such a plan would likely drive them away by imposing caps on 
the price of procedures 
insurance reform will mean making lawmakers face up to one of 
the states most powerful industries doctors also face the 
possibility of changing the way they practice doing fewer tests 
for example to lower fees 
a realistic solution is politically unpopular branson said 
it involves a lot of sacred cows

severin schurger spends weeks perfecting a violin 
days just carving and eyeing the scroll of his creation to ensure 
its curves are even 
something i would like to achieve would be to make a nice 
scroll quickly says schurger who studied playing and making 
violins in japan where his mentors could carve two perfectly 
shaped spruce scrolls a day 
so carefully does he work that he carves just two or three 
violins a year out of spruce and maple making about 25 violins 
six violas and three cellos in 18 years the instruments sell for 
about 6000 each 
i just sort of stopped practicing and i wanted to devote my 
life to repairing and making violins so other people can play i 
had a passion for it its something i really enjoy 
in addition to that passion schurger brought to the craft his 
experience as a cabinetmaker on sailboats theres a big 
similarity between a sailboat and a violin he says likening a 
violins bridge to a sailboats mast its scroll to the sailboats 
decorative stem 
watching a violin take form is enjoyable he says but when i 
put the varnish on thats when it comes alive thats a real big 
turnon 
for fun schurger spends his free time with voice lessons and 
singing in a miami opera company but violins are his first love 
and he equates each of his finished instruments to a child thats 
ready to leave home 
i dont really get attached to one you cant this thing 
you are making is going out on the world stage its like a part of 
yourself

after a binge of corporate buyouts and takeovers 
for much of the 1980s wall street investors have gone on a spartan 
diet in recent months 
along with shrinking profits and payrolls at many securities 
firms the results have produced a slower pace of turnover in the 
ranks of companies holding a dominant position in the stock market 
to reach that conclusion thomas doerflinger an analyst at 
painewebber inc examined changes in the roster of names that make 
up standard amp poors 500stock composite index the yardstick most 
commonly used by professionals to measure market trends 
in 1988 doerflinger found deals were announced for 26 of the 
sampp 500 with an aggregate market value of 447 billion before the 
bids were made 
over the first 11 months of this year by contrast only 14 
with a total value of 269 billion attracted offers to buy 
the most commonly cited cause of the slowdown has been a 
prolonged slump in the market for highyielding junk bonds 
which rose to prominence in the mid1980s as a primary means of 
financing takeovers and buyouts 
lenders shied away from further deals that might go the way of 
campeau corps troubled retailing empire or the 
employeemanagement group that wouldbutcouldnt buy ual corp 
though that did indeed play a prominent part doerflinger 
observes it wasnt the only wilting influence on the takeover boom 
in 1988 he noted us companies were on the 
international bargain counter 
in the wake of the 1987 market crash stock prices were 
depressed even though corporate cash flow was very strong us 
equities looked even cheaper to foreigners because the us dollar 
was depressed 
this process reversed in 1989 as stock prices rose cash 
flows weakened the dollar appreciated and turmoil in the junk 
bond market slowed deal acitivity 
although it has tapered off the takeover wave promises to have 
some lasting effects in the 1990s 
for one thing doerflinger points out it has significantly 
altered the personality of the sampp 500 which is used as a sort of 
role model by many managers at investing institutions 
pension assets of millions of americans these days are invested 
in funds set up to duplicate the ups and downs of the 500 
index funds or in porftolios that play off the 500 with 
computer models in the hopes of beating its performance 
from january 1984 through november 1988 doerflinger says 121 
stocks were displaced from the index and so were 16 of the names 
that replaced them 
it is very important to remember that sampp does not attempt to 
replace a deleted company with another company in the same 
industry he said 
as a result the structure of the sampp 500 has changed over 
time as large companies in mature industries have been replaced by 
fastgrowing midsized companies which tend to be in the consumer 
financial technology and service sectors 
instead of oldline industrial america doerflinger says the 
index looks more and more like a highly diversified growth stock 
portfolio 
it remains to be seen whether that might help or hurt the 
results turned in by the sampp 500 in the 1990s 
but it is already evident that the takeovers and buyouts of the 
80s forced a modernization of the 500 even as it did many 
areas of the corporate world the index represents

the wind blew and the earth shook and the wall came down 
there it is 1989 in review a year of disasters that rivaled 
old testament plagues of triumphs that challenged credulity a 
year that led people again and again to the same words i never 
thought id see the day 
for a while it seemed that this would be the year of the oil 
spill then the year of the hurricane then the year of the 
earthquake 
but the last turbulent year of the decade will be remembered 
finally as the year the iron curtain lifted 
twentysix years earlier john f kennedy had stood before the 
berlin wall and said of free citizens everywhere let them come 
to berlin in 1989 they came and from the least imaginable 
direction they came from the east 
what joy a west berliner exclaimed and people from east 
and west berlin danced and laughed and hugged atop a wall that no 
longer divided them 
we live in exciting times president bush observed the 
rapidity of change is mindboggling 
indeed it was 
in poland the solidarity trade union was illegal at the 
beginning of the year it had ousted the communist government by 
the end then came hungary east germany czechoslovakia one by 
one eastern europes ruling communist parties followed polands 
lead and agreed to step aside and allow democratic multiparty 
elections 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev had loosed the shackles 
that once bound eastern europe and after a seasick summit with 
bush in the tempestuous mediterranean he declared that the cold 
war was over 
even romania among the most stalwart of the oldline communist 
states was overwhelmed by democratic fervor that ultimately drove 
president nicolae ceausescu from his palace 
images of eastern europes peaceful revolution will stick in the 
memory for a long time but so will a sadder picture a lone man 
standing before a phalanx of tanks near beijings tiananmen square

thousands of students demonstrated daily to demand democratic 
change military officers at first balked at suppressing the 
protesters 100 officers signed a statement saying the army will 
never shoot the people but on june 3 the army began shooting 
the people 
the death toll may never be known estimates ranged from 300 to 
3000 
brute force blocked democracy in china but us troops 
forcefully imposed it in panama where an invasion just before 
christmas ousted the dictatorship of gen manuel antonio noriega 
and installed an elected president 
on a smaller scale too it was a year of tumultuous transition

the cold snap gripping much of the nation has 
drained heating oil supplies causing temporary shortages in some 
areas and driving the price of the fuel sharply higher industry 
officials said 
oil companies said thursday theyre taking steps to ensure there 
is enough heating oil for all their customers but the increased 
demand has sent the price consumers pay for oil as high as 1 a 
gallon 
exxon usa mobil corp and star enterprise a texaco inc 
affiliate reported that some of their northeastern terminals 
suffered temporary oil depletions and that customers have been sent 
to other facilities or forced to wait for new supplies to arrive 
these outages have been maybe for a few hours said 
exxon spokesman jim davis who said customers at the companys 
everett mass terminal were directed to nearby waltham where 
supplies were more plentiful 
at mobil spokesman john lord estimated that some customers in 
the northeast were kept waiting an hour for heating oil to arrive 
by barge or pipeline but that is not the norm the norm is no 
outages 
the wait was longer at star enterprises east hartford conn 
terminal which ran out of oil thursday and was hoping for a 
delivery today or saturday said texaco spokesman top ingram 
the companies placed the blame for the shortages squarely on the 
weather as customers burned more oil or tried to stock up on extra 
fuel bad weather has also made it hard for oil barges to unload 
their cargoes in some east coast harbors 
a series of arctic air blasts has chilled the eastern half of 
the united states for 10 days and cold weather in europe has 
placed a further strain on inventories 
because of the increased demand amoco corp is producing about 
1 million barrels of oil a month above its usual 8 million said 
spokesman richard judy amoco has not reported any shortages at its 
terminals 
exxon is limiting its customers to the amounts of oil specified 
in their purchase contracts davis said adding we believe that 
our heating oil inventories should be adequate to meet our monthly 
contract volume 
at star enterprise where heating oil sales are running 50 
percent above projections for december the company also is 
trying to figure out a way to distribute it on an equitable 
basis ingram said 
oil prices have climbed steadily as temperatures have dropped 
on the new york mercantile exchange a gallon of home heating oil 
for delivery in january cost 7981 cents thursday compared with 
6271 cents on nov 30 
heating oil prices normally rise and fall by fractions of a 
cent but thursdays price was up more than 4 cents a gallon from 
wednesday a further reflection of the increased demand 
mobils lord said prices the oil company has paid on the open 
market have shot up 25 cents over the last three weeks and 
distributors in new jersey reported a similar increase 
homeowners and businesses are already paying higher prices 
platts oilgram news an oil industry newsletter said some 
consumers are paying 1 a gallon in the new york city area where 
heating costs are the highest in the nation and about 10 cents 
less in the midwest 
the national weather service was predicting some relief might 
arrive by christmas the oil companies said that as long as the 
cold abates they should have enough supplies

talented con artists wont be stopping at 
forged checks and stolen credit cards this holiday season 
retailers and security experts say gift certificates have become a 
hot new tool of the trade 
the economic criminals are getting away from buying hard 
merchandise and theyre buying gift certificates said jack 
scott director of loss prevention for jbs associates of ringwood 
one of the countrys largest check guarantee companies 
they realize its a weakness in the merchants system he 
said 
the thieves use stolen credit cards or bogus checks to buy the 
certificates because they are more difficult to trace more 
flexible and can be resold 
once they get the gift certificate its like money in their 
pocket said ray watson a loss prevention detective for sears 
roebuck and co inc 
some certificates are redeemed for merchandise which also can 
later be resold thieves may also buy an item with the certificate 
and later take it back asking for a cash refund 
scott whose company guarantees the creditworthiness of checks 
for merchants estimates the going rate for gift certificates on 
the street is 70 to 75 cents on the dollar compared to 35 cents on 
the dollar for merchandise 
in one case scott said a con artist was able to pass more than 
50000 in counterfeit gift certificates in less than two weeks 
before he was caught 
gift certificates are easy targets because few merchants keep 
track of them by serializing them or recording numbers of documents 
that have been redeemed he said gift certificate purchases are 
often rung up as cash making it difficult to later trace them 
in addition they often are printed on regular paper instead of 
on paper with watermarks or other means of preventing reproduction 
by increasingly sophisticated laser copiers he said 
lewis shealy vice president of loss prevention for the 
chicagobased marshall fields department stores said his companys 
25 stores had giftcertificate losses of about 10000 last year 
even though they serialized their certificates 
they were using photocopy machines to counterfeit them and 
they looked very very good he said during a busy christmas 
season your chances of passing them are 100 percent 
this year the store hired a company that designs federal bank 
notes to create a system under which the word void appears on 
photocopies of gift certificates he said 
officials from federal and state agencies and the national 
retail merchants association said they had no figures on gift 
certificate fraud 
thats not an area weve been called into at all said 
association spokesman john gary 
richard adams a spokesman for the us secret service in 
washington dc said the agency does not keep statistics to 
distinguish certificate fraud from other fraud like credit card 
misuse 
scott estimated the use of stolen checks or credit cards to buy 
gift certificates is up by about 20 percent this year 
scott said the extent of the problem was brought home to him 
this summer through interviews with the arrested heads of a 
national ring estimated to have cashed more than 35 million worth 
of stolen checks in the last three years 
they predicted there is going to be a major loss to retailers 
this holiday season because of the popularity of gift certificate 
fraud among economic criminals scott said 
not all stores are victims of gift certificate fraud 
i dont have any known fraud in my gift certificate areas 
said ed barclay director of loss prevention for saks fifth 
avenues 46 stores which serialize their certificates

us government attorneys are hard at work on a plan to free 
about 375 million in panamanian assets held in the united states 
a move that is sure to be a big boost for panamas ailing economy 
a spokesman for the treasury department said thursday he did not 
know when a plan would be completed that would unblock panamanian 
bank accounts and allow the latin american country to collect back 
taxes from the us corporations that operate there 
president bush called for the orderly unblocking of panamanian 
government assets held in the united states after the swearingin 
of the democratically elected guillermo endara as president earlier 
this week 
the sanctions were imposed by the reagan administration to 
pressure gen manuel noriega the panamanian dictator who has been 
indicted in the united states on drug trafficking charges 
the united states cut off all military and economic aid in july 
1987 further sanctions sharply restricted us companies that do 
business in panama froze panamanian assets held in the united 
states held payments relating to operating the panama canal in 
escrow and forbade american companies from paying taxes and fees to 
the noriega regime 
companies were allowed either to put money due the panamanian 
government into escrow accounts overseen by the federal reserve 
bank or establish reserve accounts on their own books 
the treasury spokesman said the government must develop a plan 
that ensures the assets go to the legitimate goverment and that 
us residents and corporations that made escrow payments to cover 
fees and taxes owed to panama be given proper credit 
an official of a large us company operating in panama 
speaking on condition of anonymity said there has been no 
signal at this point from the administration as to those taxes 
going to this particular government 
economists have estimated that the sanctions cost panama about 
225 million last year when the nations gross domestic product 
fell 17 percent 
for panama gaining access to 375 million will mark the first 
step in getting its economy in order 
its not big money to us but its certainly big money to 
them said robert brusca chief economist at nikko securities co 
international inc 
as relations warm us banks will be more inclined to lend to 
panama where loan availability has been off sharply 
noriegas access to the us banking system was being 
impeded to the greatest extent that we could and its very hard to 
run a modern economy that way brusca said 
panama owes the rest of the world about 53 billion though the 
figure pales in comparison to other developing countries it is 
extremely high on a percapita basis panamas debt equals about 
2200 per capita while brazils debt is roughly 790 per capita 
according to figures provided by the world bank 
panama first missed a payment to banks in mid1987 and since has 
faced increasing difficulties servicing its debt said luis r 
luis director of the latin america department of the institute for 
international finance 
luis said the money due panama from the lifting of us 
sanctions could be used to pay back the arrears it would be a 
very good use of funds as far as banks are concerned 
experts said the lifting of sanctions would certainly improve 
panamanian citizens view of america 
this can really help to pull more of the people onto the us 
side if we can kick out the rat noriega and lift sanctions it 
would improve the economic lot of a lot people brusca said 
in addition to lifting sanctions the us government said it 
would not proceed with an order which would have gone into effect 
at the end of january barring ships bearing panamas flag from 
us ports 
it was unclear whether a ban on the import of panamanian sugar 
would be lifted but experts said the amount is insignificant and 
that sugar is a minor factor in panamas economy

the securities and exchange commission is 
seeking public comment on proposed new rules that would require 
mutual funds to simplify and expand the information they are 
required to supply investors 
the sec agreed to submit the proposals to public scrutiny on 
thursday 
one proposals seeks to clarify descriptions of funds to 
investors a second would provide better measures of fund 
performance and a third would require disclosure of who is making 
fund investment decisions 
at least one of the proposals requiring funds to identify those 
managing their stock portfolios is expected to meet with the 
stiffest industry opposition sec staffers acknowledged 
i would say the majority of the industry people that weve 
heard from think its a bad idea said kathryn mcgrath of the sec 
ms mcgrath head of the secs division of investment 
management conceded that previous attempts to implement a fund 
manager disclosure rule were blown out of the water by a wave of 
criticism 
the investment company institute a mutal fund industry group 
opposes portfolio manager disclosure claiming it would be an 
additional burden for the funds and create a superstar system 
of fund managers 
we did not agree with the fund manager disclosure which 
places undue emphasis on the cult of personality it ignores the 
actual basis on which funds hire advisers said betty k hart a 
spokeswoman for the trade group 
in 1972 1982 and 1984 this issue has come up and we have 
always opposed it we still oppose it there are some very 
succesful funds that run by committee she added 
ms hart said the ici was willing to go along with the 
disclosure rule in just two instances where a fund promotes an 
individual to the press and the investment public or if the 
individual is of such critical importance to the advisory 
organization that it would cease to exist in the same manner if 
they left 
the two other proposals are less controversial to simply 
information in a mutual funds prospectus the sec staff suggested 
shortening tables listing a funds total return per share 
to provide investors with more information to easily evaluate a 
fund the staff proposed following one of two alternatives a 
funds managers would be required either to discuss and analyze its 
fiscal year performance in relation to its investment objectives or 
compare its total returns over one five and 10year periods to 
the performance of a securities index 
the commission which regulates investment companies as well as 
the securities industry voted to submit the proposed rules for a 
60day public comment period 
following that period ms mcgrath said her staff will review 
comments both pro and con make any changes deemed necessary and 
submit the proposed rule changes to the commissioners and they 
will vote it up or down 
she said the staff hoped to submit the proposals to the 
commission by late spring or early summer

bargainhunting christmas shoppers have had a field day this 
year with sale signs competing with holiday decorations for 
attention at many of the nations department stores as troubled 
retailers scrap to pay their debts 
but some industry analysts say the lower prices may have hurt 
the traditional lastminute buying spree 
i think that were seeing a moderate increase in retail 
momentum in the last week morgan stanley amp co inc analyst 
walter loeb said thursday sales of coats sweaters and other warm 
clothing have been better than expected because of bitterly cold 
weather around the country he said 
however loeb said some of the excitement of the lastminute 
shopping was undermined 
as the days tick down toward christmas retailers are counting 
on downtothewire buyers to boost business and bolster profits at 
this crucial time of year 
several store executives said thursday said they noticed a 
pickup in sales heading into a final weekend that could decide if 
this is a hohum or hohoho holiday season 
bargain hunters have been enjoying a jolly time since 
thanksgiving finding plenty of prices marked down particularly 
at department stores owned by cashstarved campeau corp and their 
competitors 
in the dogeatdog new york market campeauowned bloomingdales 
as well as rivals macys and lord amp taylor have been advertising 
price cuts of 20 percent or more on dresses sweaters and other 
apparel bloomingdales which is being sold by campeau is under 
extra pressure to pump up sales so that it will fetch the best 
possible bid 
the price competition isnt as fierce in all metropolitan areas 
as it is in new york but analysts say that this year generally has 
been more promotional than normal 
retailers offering enhanced services such as personal shoppers 
and prewrapped presents say the effort is paying off many 
retailers are pleased with their results so far 
john buller senior vice president of marketing at the bon 
marche said the seattlebased department store chain owned by 
campeau is having one of its best years ever 
sales at the bon marches 43 stores mostly in the pacific 
northwest have been running in the high single digits above 
last year spurred by numerous merchandising ideas buller said 
every floor of each store has displays of gifts wrapped and ready 
to be put under christmas trees 
luxury gifts and accommodating service have pulled in customers 
kenneth watson chairman and chief executive officer of gumps 
said that in addition to providing personal shoppers staff who 
act as elves for customers gumps is offering free delivery in 
the san francisco bay area and direct telephone lines to make it 
easier for shoppers to place orders 
watson said holiday business at the upscale specialty chain is 
about 12 percent ahead of year ago i would say in our case its 
much better than expected or anticipated he said 
crystal watches pens travelers clocks and leather bags have 
been fast sellers at the tony cartier jewelry stores said thierry 
chaunu vice president of marketing 
in addition to discounted apparel and accessories moderately 
priced home furnishings appear to be selling well store executives 
and analysts said 
clark a johnson chairman and chief executive officer of pier i 
imports inc a specialty furnishings chain of 511 stores said 
christmas sales are running about 20 percent above 1988 the 
strongest regions have been florida northern california and the 
pacific northwest while texas and the boston area have been the 
weakest 
spending on consumer electronics seems to have held up despite 
overall sluggish sales of expensive durable merchandise such as 
home appliances 
the 90plus franchisees of software city have reported pretty 
brisk business since thanksgiving president shep altshuler said 
maria cirino marketing vice president for the new jerseybased 
discounter said sophisticated computer systems previously 
associated with businesses are being bought for home use 
programs that help people organize budgets or tax information 
and educate children are hot sellers she said broder bunds 
software including where in the world is carmen sandiego or 
where in time is carmen sandiego intended to teach geography 
and history are two soughtafter programs 
many retailers were reluctant to assess their performance 
knowing that the next few days could be crucial a late rally last 
year salvaged the holiday season which typically accounts for half 
or more of a retailers annual profits 
the question is what happened this week said rosalind 
wells chief economist of the national retail merchants association 
even if it meets retailers most optimistic dreams there will 
be stores stuck with slowmoving merchandise that will have to 
slash prices to unload seasonal goods 
said loeb of morgan stanley there will be heavy clearance 
markdowns youve got to get rid of seasonal merchandise

general motors corp is eliminating one of two 
shifts at a new jersey car assembly plant adding to the production 
woes of the nations auto industry 
on thursday gm spokesman phil workman in lansing said the 
second shift at the automakers linden plant would stop production 
feb 26 and about 1600 workers would be laid off indefinitely the 
first shift will continue producing chevrolet corsica and beretta 
automobiles 
also on thursday gm and chrysler corp added to their lists of 
factories temporarily suspending production in january that brings 
to 42 of the big threes 53 us assembly plants which will be down 
for at least one week each next month 
more than 127000 workers will be affected 
in addition to state unemployment benefits laidoff workers can 
draw on special funds that can boost their pay during factory 
shutdowns to as much as 95 percent of their straighttime wages 
the effect of the shutdowns on the countrys auto industry 
supply community is difficult to measure and its likely that 
thousands of other workers could face temporary layoffs next month 
all the assembly plant closings are caused by slumping sales and 
high newvehicle inventories 
demand for corsica and beretta cars which are also produced in 
wilmington del has been slipping sales this year through dec 
10 were 127 percent behind last years pace gms domestic car 
sales meantime were off 83 percent for the same time 
combined inventory of the two cars essentially the same except 
beretta has two doors and corsica has four stood at 123 days at 
the end of november based on the current selling pace according to 
wards automotive reports a weekly industry newsletter 
inventory for the eight major us automakers stood at 88 days 
wards said 
news of the linden shutdown hit workers hard 
its no merry christmas when a person has been trying to dig 
in with the company working twice as hard working with the 
management trying to sell the cars ourselves putting our heart 
into it said united auto workers union local 595 president 
charlie marshall 
to hear theres only one shift is a big letdown for 
everybody he added we all feel like weve been had

sears roebuck and co is giving its employees a 
bigger stake in the company and is fighting accusations that its 
new everyday low pricing policy is a fraud 
the chicagobased retailing and financialservices conglomerate 
announced an 800 million employee stock ownership plan thursday 
that will increase its workers share of sears common stock to 21 
percent from 15 percent and save the company money 
but even as sears trumpeted the benefits of the esop its 
retailing division was forced to defend its claims of lower retail 
prices against the new york state attorney generals contention 
that prices at sears stores are the same or higher than under old 
pricing policies 
we have a valuable reputation for trust and integrity with 
american consumers and we intend to prove these malicious charges 
are false said michael bozic chairman and chief executive 
officer of the sears merchandise group 
the employee stock ownership plan will provide sears with a 
cheaper way to fund its profitsharing program since it can deduct 
from its taxes dividends paid on the esop shares said sears 
spokesman douglas fairweather 
the esop will buy the shares totaling about 22 million at the 
current stock price on the open market over the next several 
months with money loaned by the company 
the loan will be repaid from dividends on the esop shares and 
future contributions to the profitsharing plan fairweather said 
sears stock was up 25 cents at 3687 at midday in new york 
stock exchange trading 
in a prepared statement sears chairman edward brennan said the 
increased ownership of sears shares reinforces our employees 
commitment to sears success 
about 280000 of sears 520000 employees will participate in 
the esop fairweather said 
sears was one of the first us companies to establish a 
profitsharing plan for employees in 1916 under that plan the 
company buys stock and distributes it to employees 
fairweather said that with the esop were buying 15 years 
worth of stock in one fell swoop and putting it in a trust it 
doesnt really affect the employees participating in the 
profitsharing plan its just a different way to fund it 
with the esop sears joins a growing list of companies that have 
created such plans for a variety of reasons 
employers hope that employees who are also shareholders will 
work harder to make the company grow and increase the value of 
their investment 
in addition some companies have created esops as a takeover 
defense believing that employees would be less likely than other 
shareholders to sell their stock to an uninvited suitor 
fairweather said the sears esop is not a takeover defense 
although there has been speculation the company could become a 
takeover target because its value if broken up and sold is higher 
than its stock price indicates according to stock analysts 
in addition to its retailing operation sears owns the dean 
witter reynolds brokerage house allstate insurance and the 
coldwell banker realestate company 
the lawsuit filed in new york state supreme court in buffalo 
attacks sears new retailing strategy which the company 
implemented with much fanfare last spring in a bid to win back the 
market share sears has been steadily losing to discounters such as 
k mart and walmart 
sears began a 90 million advertising campaign in march touting 
its new pricing policy which said customers would receive 
substantial savings over sears old prices new york state attorney 
general robert abrams said 
sears contended in a statement that abrams charges were 
distorted untrue and based on a skimpy investigation that sampled 
only a few of the more than 100000 items sold by the chain 
the state asked the court to fine sears stop it from engaging 
in such practices in the future and order restitution for consumers 
who were induced to buy items because of the fraudulent 
advertising and sales practices

general electric co says it has won 
a 500 million contract to build fighter plane engines for the 
government of south korea 
the koreans plan to buy about 250 f404ge402 engines to power 
120 fa18 fighters a plane built by mcdonnell douglas ge 
announced thursday the governments of kuwait and switzerland have 
purchased smaller numbers of the engine 
these foreign sales are important because they help offset 
potential reductions in the us defense budget said robert 
turnbull ges vice president of military engines 
turnbull estimated that the plant in lynn mass which will 
handle the south korean order would be building 200 f404 engines a 
year for the next 10 years he said it was likely the us navy 
would scale back its purchases in the early 1990s 
ge was once sole supplier of the f404 engines then in 1984 navy 
secretary john lehman brought in pratt amp whitney a united 
technologies corp unit as a second source 
that decision was recently reversed however and ge is once 
again the only firm building the engine

boeing co plans to lay off about 1200 employees 
in the first half of 1990 with most of the cuts to be made among 
production workers at everett chairman frank shrontz said 
shrontzs comment in interviews with the seattle times and the 
morning news tribune of tacoma confirmed recent speculation that 
jobs would be cut 
the exact size of the layoffs or where they might occur has not 
yet been determined but it will likely be in the general range of 
1200 employees shrontz said 
the company is studying how it can transfer rather than lay off 
workers he said that study should be completed by early next year 
the continued impact of the defense budget on some of our 
programs has made it now look like we cant hold the decline to 
just attirition and there will be layoffs in the first half of 
next year he said ain the early 1970s as many as 60000 workers 
lost their jobs in a twoyear period 
boeing employs about 165000 people worldwide 
shrontz said the company anticipated a reduction in production 
workers who were needed for startup work on the 747400 jetliner 
but had not thought layoffs would be necessary 
increased experience and productivity on the assembly lines is 
lessening the need for more workers shrontz said even though the 
company is experiencing a record surge in orders 888 jets worth 
467 billion this year there is also an 85 billion backlog of 
more than 1700 planes 
shrontz said he had hoped excess workers could have been 
transferred to work on the b2 stealth bomber but b2 work was 
slowed as part of defensebudget cutbacks leaving the extra 
commercial jet workers nowhere to go boeing a subcontractor to 
the northrop corp on the new bomber has had nearly 10000 working 
on the b2 
layoffs here will most affect production workers shrontz said 
but some engineers in wichita kan may also lose their jobs 
a 48day machinists strike that ended last month clearly hurt 
our profitability shrontz said but he declined to be specific 
boeing had been expected to deliver 94 jets during the fourth 
quarter but now may deliver less than half that number 
we hope to get the factories back up to speed in the first 
quarter he said 
boeing clearly has been hurt in image but a flurry of 
federal investigations and charges filed this year he conceded 
the defense business is very difficult he said there is 
still a significant resentment against defense contractors by the 
public and i foresee this climate will continue 
richard fowler a former boeing aerospace employee was recently 
convicted of 39 counts of document trafficking and fraud in federal 
court in alexandria va boeing agreed to pay a 52 million fine 
and pleaded guilty to two counts of illegally receiving secret 
government documents in the case 
whats so frustrating about this is that it occurred in the 
early 1980s said shrontz i think weve gained substantially 
in ethics since then 
he said the company has found no further evidence of fraud or 
misconduct in federal investigations of project billings the 
government continues to investigate the overbilling allegations 
on other topics shrontz said while boeing is reorganizing its 
defense business divisions the company will stay in defense work 
well find our niche he said

orders to us factories for durable goods 
jumped 51 percent in november posting the biggest increase in a 
year and averting the first threemonth drop since mid1986 the 
government reported today 
the commerce department said orders for durable goods 
bigticket items expected to last more than three years 
increased to a seasonally adjusted 1307 billion last month after 
dropping 07 percent in october 
durablegoods orders also fell 12 percent in september orders 
had not fallen for three straight months since 1986 
the november gain the largest since a 74 percent jump in 
december 1988 was an exception to recent evidence that the us 
manufacturing sector is in a severe slowdown many economists are 
forecasting a growth rate of 1 percent or less in the current 
quarter and some fear the economys unprecedented seven years of 
peacetime expansion may end 
much of the softness has been concentrated in the auto industry 
where weak sales have prompted layoffs and production cutbacks but 
the softness has been spreading recently to the computer and 
defenserelated industries 
as a result economists and government officials have been 
calling for a further relaxation of the federal reserves grip on 
credit which the central bank had applied early this year in 
efforts to cool the economy and reduce inflation 
the fed began loosening its grip gradually last june as 
inflation moderated and it apparently acted earlier this week to 
permit shortterm interest rates to fall further for the first time 
since late november 
a surprise in todays report was an increase in the closely 
watched nondefense capital goods sector which rose 83 percent 
last month to 39 billion the largest gain since a 101 percent 
increease in december 1988 economists use this category as a 
barometer of business investment plans 
the commerce department reported thursday that a survey 
completed in november indicated that businesses plan to increase 
their plant and equipment spending only 49 percent next year a 
rate nearly half the 85 percent increase this year 
defense orders rose 156 percent excluding the volatile defense 
category orders would have gained 42 percent in november after 
increasing 18 percent in october 
transportation orders rose a sharp 105 percent to 367 billion 
in november after a 21 percent gain in october the november 
advance came from increased demand for both aircraft and motor 
vehicles aircraft represented 40 percent of the gain 
excluding the transportation category durablegoods orders were 
up 31 percent last month 
orders for nonelectrical machinery including computers and a 
wide variety of industrial equipment rose 66 percent to 229 
billion after a 47 decline in october 
electricalmachinery orders jumped 79 percent to 217 billion 
virtually all in communications equipment 
primary metals were up 17 percent to 221 billion 
shipments of durable goods in november rose 15 percent to 
1237 billion after a 31 decline in october

local telephone companies will lose their 
guaranteed profit margins on interstate revenues in 1991 under a 
regulatory plan for better service at lower costs the chairman of 
the federal communications commission said 
new fcc chairman alfred sikes fulfilling the promises of his 
predecessor dennis patrick said thursday that beginning jan 1 
1991 many local phone companies will switch from the current 
rateofreturn pricing system to an incentivebased regulation 
known as price caps 
in the meantime these companies will continue under the 
rateofreturn formula that allows them to earn 12 percent above 
their investments the fcc decided in a 40 vote 
price caps will apply to the revenues local phone companies 
collect from connecting their callers with longdistance companies 
local phone companies with more than 100 million in annual 
revenues will fall under price caps which the fcc says is designed 
to lower phone rates 
when the fcc imposed price caps on the american telephone amp 
telegraph co this year after two decades of rateofreturn 
regulation it said consumers would reap 900 million in savings 
over the next four years as atampt raised or lowered rates within 
certain inflationbased price bands 
rate of return for the local companies which was due to expire 
dec 31 will continue into next year pending completion of a more 
comprehensive study of the process 
sikes said the price cap is the best available means of 
ensuring the united states the kind of efficient and effective 
telecommunications system that it needs 
local phone companies have been earning 12 percent since 1986 
which a consumer advocate said was too high under current market 
conditions 
the record clearly shows the rate of return should be 
reduced gene kimmelman of the consumer federation of america 
said following the commissions vote consumers ought to be 
seeing rates coming down because the companies earnings are 
excessive here was a chance to cut out the fat 
but the commission said the 12 percent rate was still just and 
reasonable 
patrick the former fcc chairman had said earlier this year he 
wanted price caps for the local phone companies but his aggressive 
deregulatory approach ruffled many feathers in congress 
richard firestone chief of the fccs common carrier bureau 
said thursday he had every expectation of being able to work 
successfully with congress 
sikes made clear he was unsatisfied with the amount of 
investment the local phone companies have been making in new 
facilities and equipment under the current rateofreturn process 
this past fall when i addressed the us telephone 
association convention in san francisco i questioned the level of 
industry investment in new plant and facilities sikes said 
since then many companies have assured me that their plans for 
1990 and beyond involve steppedup modernization programs 
sikes noting his previous experience as overseer of the 
missouri public service commission said the costplus approach to 
pricing used there illserved the consumer 
firestone said the fcc expected to adopt a price cap scheme by 
the fall of next year while also completing its rateofreturn 
study at about the same time 
local phone companies must file comments on the present 
rateofreturn scheme by feb 16

starting jan 1 investors should have more 
information available to make an informed decision when dabbling in 
the municipal bond market 
thats when federal disclosure rules for municipal bonds take 
effect the rules released earlier this year by the securities and 
exchange commission are designed to prevent such debacles as the 
1983 bond default by the washington public power supply system 
the 225 billion worth of bad wppss bonds the largest default 
in municipal bond history led to these firstever disclosure 
rules for municipal bonds many brokerages that underwrote wppss 
bonds later said they never were told by the utility consortium of 
its financial problems 
muni bonds were exempt from the disclosure requirements placed 
on other securities when the sec was established in 1934 
the new rules require brokerages underwriting municipal bond 
issues of more than 1 million in value to obtain extensive 
information about the projects financed by the bonds 
brokerages also must obtain information on the credit history of 
the state or local government or agency issuing the bonds and any 
foreseeble risks to investors 
brokerages must release this information to all potential buyers 
in the form of official statements which resemble the prospectuses 
that companies are required to issue before they sell shares of 
stock 
most muni bond issuers have been putting out official statements 
for years but the sec rules make them mandatory and also tighten 
the time frame in which they must be issued 
under the rules a muni bond underwriter must make sure an 
official statement is available within seven business days of a 
bond issues first selling day 
currently it is common for a 30day lag before an official 
statement is released said christopher taylor executive director 
of the municipal securities rulemaking board the industrys 
selfregulatory body established by congress 
we found that the problem with disclosure documentation was it 
was produced but it wasnt disseminated in a timely fashion 
added george brakatselos a vice president of the public securities 
association a trade group for the municipal bond industry 
since the rules require brokers to describe potential risks of 
bond issues they could make it easier for investors to sue 
investment houses in the event of a default 
however the rules dont apply to the billions of dollars in 
municipal bonds now in investors hands 
the sec rules also promote the creation of a central repository 
to store and update the official statements 
under the rules a brokerage must make official statements 
available for 90 days after the end of a bonds underwriting 
period but if the statements are filed with a central repository 
the brokerage only has to make them available for 25 days after the 
end of the underwriting period 
the creation of a central repository could mark a turning point 
in the municipal bond industry 
the hope is that municipal bond issuers take it upon themselves 
to update their disclosure forms periodically so that the 
repository is viewed as the source of current information on 
municipal issues that have been on the market for some time 
if such a system develops official statements could begin to 
resemble the quarterly financial reports that corporations are 
required to issue for their stock and bondholders 
issuers have long said gee id like to let the world know 
how im doing but i have nowhere to send the information taylor 
said last week 
four companies have said they want to set up a central 
repository in addition the municipal securities rulemaking board 
which originated the idea is devising plans for a computerized 
repository of its own the sec has yet to select which group or 
groups will be designated as official repositories 
under the rulemaking boards plans it would make the statements 
available to anyone for a nominal fee 
taylor said he envisions private companies repackaging 
information from the rulemaking boards library and reselling it in 
a form that may be more useful to bond traders brokers and 
investors 
the public securities association says its pleased with the 
governments new rules especially those encouraging a central 
repository 
i think it will benefit everybody because right now there is 
no single place you can go to get an official statement 
brakatselos said

like nomads at a desert oasis investors here and 
abroad are gulping shares of britains newly privatized water 
industry lifting prices to unexpected highs but raising fears of 
foreign control over a necessity of life 
the government sold 10 water utilities in england and wales for 
84 billion earlier this month it was the latest in a series of 
privatizations and surprisingly successful in an otherwise sluggish 
stock market 
the government offered 2183 million shares at the equivalent of 
384 each the shares which began trading dec 12 quickly rose 
in price and by friday were worth about 50 percent more on the 
london stock exchange 
they have done fairly well said stephen doe a water 
industry analyst at the london investment firm smith new court plc 
british investors werent the only ones to perceive the water 
industry as an opportunity foreigners including a french water 
company also were aggressive buyers of the stock 
within less than a week of the trading launch the french group 
lyonnaise des eaux announced it acquired stakes in three water 
companies 9 percent in anglian water 6 percent in wessex water 
and 2 percent of severn trent 
frances two other big water companies generale des eaux and 
societe damenagement urbain et rural also are expected to be big 
buyers of the british shares 
theres no immediate takeover threat to the big water utilities 
because the government retained golden shares limiting holdings 
in them to 15 percent for five years 
however trade secretary nicholas ridley recently has expressed 
reservations about this limitation suggesting it might be lifted 
the french water companies are keen to invest because they 
believe the british water companies are undervalued and offer good 
prospects for earnings growth analysts said 
the french companies have the expertise and technology to 
capitalize on the opportunities which arent available in other 
european countries where the water industries are mostly 
statecontrolled 
but some britons oppose foreign control on their sources of 
water particularly if the owners are french an historical british 
rival 
the resentment has been suggested in britains financial press 
which has quoted critics of the water privatization as portraying 
the french water companies as raiding opportunists 
but the times of london wrote in an editorial while the 
government might have preferred to see british rather than french 
predators it can hardly object when it is committed to a level 
playing field in the takeover game in europe we are all good 
europeans now 
the water shares are popular with other investors for other 
reasons they are considered recession proof because water is a 
vital commodity builtin price increases in the form of rate hikes 
virtually guarantee good profits for at least the next few years 
nigel hawkins water industry analyst for security pacifichoare 
govett ltd said the water shares average yield is attractive at 
7 percent a 50 percent premium on the average market yield 
the shares have been boosted by speculation about the french 
companies buying intentions 
there had been concerns that the water sale would fail because 
it followed the sharp drop in world stock markets a few months ago 
but demand for the shares greatly exceeded the supply 
we have proved our critics wrong environment minister 
michael howard said 
the water sale is the first privitization since the governments 
divestment of its onethird stake in british petroleum co plc 
which was a failure because it coincided with the october 1987 
stock market crash many brokers suffered severe losses from the bp 
fiasco 
the water privatization also faced stiff opposition from critics 
who believed such a vital utility should remain in state hands for 
reasons of security and water quality 
prime minister margaret thatchers critics said she was becoming 
too extreme during her third term taking a privatization program 
too far but she is proceeding 
the government also plans to sell the countrys electricity 
industry by mid1992 that sale could raise more than 32 billion 
dwarfing the other privatizations 
mrs thatchers conservative government has sold 53 billion 
worth of stateowned companies in the past decade as part of a 
broader economic policy of encouraging private enterprise and 
investment by british citizens

smithkline beecham plc a major international 
pharmaceutical company said friday it has agreed to sell its us 
and canadian household products businesses to a west germany 
company for 107 million in cash 
smithkline said the sale to joh a benckiser gmbh is consistent 
with its strategy of focusing on international healthcare following 
the merger of smithkline beckman corp with beecham group plc 
earlier this year 
household products included in the sale are calgon a leading 
us bath additive cling free a fabric softener used in driers 
and delicare a detergent for delicate products 
smithkline said most of the products are made at a plant in

the products were acquired in 1977 from merck amp co which 
retains the right to use the calgon name for industrial products 
benckiser previously marketed calgon household products in 
europe and the purchase will give it the right to sell them in 
north america and other countries

bond prices fell friday in abbreviated 
preholiday trading on a lower dollar overseas concerns over 
japanese interest rates and a buoyant report on us durable goods 
orders 
the treasurys benchmark 30year bond declined 516 point or 
313 per 1000 in face amount its yield which rises when prices 
fall jumped to 788 percent from 785 percent late thursday 
the credit markets shut down at 1 pm est in advance of the 
christmas and hanukkah holidays 
william v sullivan director of moneymarket research for dean 
witter reynolds inc said dealers sold bonds in an effort to 
reduce their portfolios before the end of the year 
he said a drop in the dollar in overseas trading also spurred 
some selling as did concern that japan may raise its key lending 
rate by half a percentage point over the long holiday weekend 
the us financial markets are closed monday for christmas 
economists said fridays report showing orders for durable goods 
costly items expected to last more than three years up 51 
percent in november caused an immediate selloff the increase was 
the biggest in a year and averted the first threemonth drop since 
mid1986 
the november durable goods gain was an exception to recent 
evidence that the us manufacturing sector is in a severe slowdown 
it seemed to suggest that although there are pockets of 
weakness in the economy were not in a position that would 
indicate that a recession is at hand sullivan said 
an economic slowdown generally boosts demand for longterm 
fixedincome investments such as bonds which are seen as a hedge 
against hard times 
kathleen camilli a moneymarket economist with drexel burnham 
lambert inc said the increase in durable goods orders was sharply 
higher than economists projections ranging from no increase to up 
05 percent 
in the secondary market for treasury securities prices of 
shortterm government issues fell 732 point to point 
intermediate maturities were down 516 point to 1332 point and 
longterm issues were 932 point lower according to telerate inc 
a financial information service 
the movement of a point is equivalent to a change of 10 in the 
price of a bond with a 1000 face value 
the shearson lehman hutton daily treasury bond index which 
measures price movements on all outstanding treasury issues with 
maturities of a year or longer fell 336 to 119416 
yields on threemonth treasury bills rose to 782 percent as the 
discount gained 3 basis points to 758 percent yields on sixmonth 
bills rose to 783 percent as the discount increased 7 basis points 
to 744 percent yields on oneyear bills jumped to 769 percent as 
the discount rose 5 basis points to 716 percent 
a basis point is onehundredth of a percentage point the yield 
is the annualized return on an investment in a treasury bill the 
discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face 
value which is paid at maturity

banks was quoted at 8 316 percent down from 8 percent late

the tokyo stock exchange is heading for the 40000 
barrier that bullish japanese analysts hope will make it a 
bellwether for the worlds financial markets 
while american markets have been battered by recession fears and 
volatile swings japanese stocks have risen ever higher buoyed in 
part by the nations growing sense of itself as a global economic 
leader 
until a couple of years ago the first thing in the morning 
brokers used to do was to check how the dow jones did overnight 
said kenji maeda of yamaichi securities co referring to the 
widely watched new york stock exchange barometer 
now he said its not just wall street but something else 
political economic news or disaster that affects us here and 
elsewhere too 
tokyo is certainly not immume from the jitters that plague 
investors in other markets just this past week worries about 
rising interest rates in japan and the implications of the us 
attack in panama knocked stock prices off their recordsetting pace 
but over the course of the last several weeks the tokyo market 
has set a string of new highs since wall streets oct 13th 
debacle when the dow jones industrial average lost more than 190 
points the 225issue nikkei stock average has gained more than 
3800 points or about 10 percent 
it took only six trading days for the nikkei to jump from 36000 
to 37000 and 10 more trading days to surpass the 38000point 
mark recently 
the index has risen more than 8000 points or nearly 30 
percent in the course of the past year hitting its current record 
of 3858618 last monday analysts predict it will hit 40000 early 
next year 
the dow jones average by comparison is up about 500 points 
over the year or a little less than 25 percent 
the nikkei closed out the week friday at 3804037 dragged down 
by the concerns over interest rates and panama 
not everyone reads the years numbers as good news many foreign 
economists say the tokyo market is overpriced and they play down 
its worldwide importance they say european markets still follow 
new york as they did during the october drop though tokyo is 
admired for its resilience 
analysts credit affluent investors a shortage of traded shares 
due to japans interlocking companies fairly stable foreign 
exchange and interest rates and widely used indexlinked buying 
for tokyos steady rise 
political events such as the opening of the berlin wall also 
have fueled optimism in japan whose economic power could be 
further enhanced by the growth of consumer economies in eastern 
europe in addition the tokyo market tends to rise at the end of 
every year as dealers create momentum to get the new year off on 
the right foot 
participants are reacting in anticipation of future trends in 
the world instead of trading restlessly watching economic 
fundamentals and indicators on a daytoday basis said masahiro 
umemori an analyst with normura securities co 
added maeda the recent quick rises in share prices made 
investors impatient and feel obliged to buy so that they wont miss 
the bus 
kazuyuki suzuki a dealer with daiwa securities co said the 
nikkei picked up speed when the berlin wall was opened in early 
november 
the index has been rising overwhelmingly fast since then 
although nothing in the economy has changed except for investors 
expectations for more business opportunities in eastern europe 
he said 
others said recent statements in washington that the united 
states may cut defense spending because of easing eastwest 
tensions has boosted the nikkei 
in tokyo only about 25 percent of the total number of stocks 
are traded on the market while the rest are held by business 
alliances among companies and never offered for sale 
rinichi kozaki chairman of toyo trust investment management 
co said the practice magnifies shareprice rises because a lot of 
money is chasing the small number of shares that actually change 
hands 
dealers said indexlinked buying which has been blamed for 
causing turmoil in the us stock market has enabled a few rich 
institutional investors to push up the japan markets direction 
individual investors accounted for 316 percent of trading in 
november while corporate investors had the rest according to 
tokyo stock exchange statistics 
thanks in part to the increased value of the yen since 1985 the 
tokyo exchange has become the worlds largest in terms of the value 
of listed companies the total value is about 4 trillion compared 
with about 3 trillion for new york stock exchangelisted companies

nearly 20 years ago linda higson was working as 
a teenage nanny in italy when she was talked into playing a 
featured role in a cocacola commercial that showed dozens of young 
people singing on a hilltop 
id like to buy the world a home and furnish it with love 
the 19yearold blondehaired briton sang to open the 1971 coke 
commercial that became an industry classic 
the ad led to some minor modeling jobs for miss higson but she 
eventually went home to a catering business in england got married 
and had four children 
early next year television viewers are going to see her again 
this time with her 10yearold daughter kelly in prominent roles 
in a new version of the ad that reunites about 25 original cast 
members and includes dozens of children 
cocacola has been revving up the publicity machinery in recent 
weeks to stoke interest in the reunion ad that debuts jan 28 on 
the cbs telecast of the super bowl the national football leagues 
championship game that usually draws a huge audience 
the company recently flew the former miss higson now 38 years 
old and known as mrs neary and stephanie roos another original 
cast member now living in indianapolis to new york to talk with 
reporters about the commercial 
in one illustration of how much has changed since the first ad 
was shot the two women said they had each rejected an offer of a 
flat fee for the new commercial and chose a compensation plan tied 
to how often the commercial runs 
they each declined to say how much the onetime buyout offer was 
worth and noted they were gambling that the new commercial would 
be a hit in deciding to take a pay plan linked to air time 
for the original ad they had each been happy to get the flat 
fee of about 50 and did not get any residuals based on how often 
it ran 
the first one was shown so much i said i wish i had a penny 
for every time it was shown mrs roos said 
the atlantabased cocacola and its ad agency mccannerickson 
had to do some detective work to locate original cast members for 
the new commercial which was shot on the same hill near rome as 
the original ad 
mccann got a break when a box was found in its new york office 
full of photos and ids for some of the original cast but many of 
them had long since moved from rome and several women had new last 
names by marriage 
the search for the former miss higson was complicated by the 
fact that her name had been listed as hipson a detective 
agency was hired to search great britain for a woman with that last 
name to no avail 
as the shooting date approached last fall the agency took out a 
classified ad in several widelycirculated english language 
newspapers in europe 
linda hipson where are you if youre the linda hipson who 
was in a cocacola commercial 20 years ago please call a 
mccannerickson telephone number in new york wed love to hear 
you sing again the ad said 
the former miss higson mrs neary missed the ad but a 
friend spotted it while reading the international herald tribune in 
the stockholm airport he contacted mrs neary who called the ad 
agency and agreed to go to rome for the reunion 
altogether about 25 of the 40 principals in the original ad 
appear in the new version said mccannerickson executive paul 
cappelli 
mrs neary said teaching the world to sing again in perfect 
harmony this time with her daughter was an interesting 
diversion from her routine 
its like being picked up out of your life and if you are a 
housewife its a little like cinderella dont you think mrs 
neary said

tis the season to be traditional but silly 
santas laughing reindeer and teddy bears are arriving in mailboxes 
nationwide this year as christmas card makers appeal to a trend in 
card buying that transcends race religion and sex humor 
those who like the offbeat can send a card showing cow udders 
singing a christmas carol or santa kicking a football through the 
antlers of a laughing reindeer 
while the majority of the 23 billion christmas cards sent this 
year will reflect more customary symbols of the holiday humor is 
where the growth is said terry carney spokeswoman for american 
greetings corp the largest publicly owned greeting card company 
with 12 billion in annual sales 
but its not usually the kind of humor that is nasty rude or 
sarcastic said ms carney 
about 500 members of the creative staff at american based in 
suburban cleveland produce about 2300 designs a year of which 
about onethird are christmas cards ms carney said 
in addition to laughs specialty cards with a regional flavor 
cactus for the southwest for instance or messages aimed at 
particular occupations are popular 
as with most consumer tastes the explanation is demographic 
the bulk of the cards purchased are by people between 35 and 
59 said e gray glass iii a new york stock market analyst with 
prudentialbache inc glass these are people that move around a 
lot and they want to keep in contact with their friends 
barbara miller spokeswoman for hallmark cards inc agreed that 
humor is in this year but she said tradition dies hard 
wreaths holly trees bells fireplace and sleigh scenes 
these are the symbols people see as christmas she said 
that doesnt mean the giant hallmark hasnt cultivated a yuppie 
sense of humor one hallmark offering shows a dazed cat with a 
stocking cap swinging on an ornament attached to christmas tree 
lights inside the caption reads in the air theres a feline of 
christmas 
among the specialty cards designed to suit distinctive tastes 
are ones for the barber the teacher bus driver or the 
mailman ms miller said 
with annual sales of more than 35 billion the privately held 
hallmark based in kansas city mo has the biggest single share 
of the greeting card market producing 2700 card designs for 
overthecounter sales and another 400 different boxed sets of 
multiple cards ms miller said 
glass said hallmark produces about 44 percent of us christmas 
cards followed by american with 32 percent and cincinnatibased 
gibson greetings inc about 10 percent 
another 700 to 800 us companies produce the remainder of us 
christmas cards with a negligible portion coming from foreign 
manufacturers glass said 
among the strangest if not funniest cards to emerge are 
pettopet missives 
from our cat to your cat from our dog to your dog people 
consider their pets part of the family ms miller said they 
are cute cards not drippy or sentimental

one bluechip stock multiplied your money to 
nearly 10 times its former value another turned your dollar into 
less than a dime 
that in microcosm was the story of the 1980s on wall street 
a decade in which many fortunes were made and more than a few were 
lost in a roaring bull market 
to pick the biggest winner among the 30 stocks that now make up 
the dow jones industrial average you had to ignore a gathering 
storm over the tobacco industry 
the company in question was philip morris whose shares 
increased almost 850 percent in value from the beginning of the 
80s through middecember according to calculations by william 
lefevre at the investment firm of advest inc adjusted for splits 
philip morris stock soared from 450 to 40plus 
philip morris widely known as the producer of marlboro and 
several other cigarette brands began a diversification program 
many years ago with miller brewing co 
in the 80s it claimed the status of worlds largest 
manufacturer of consumer products with the acquisitions of general 
foods and kraft inc gaining such familiar product lines as 
maxwell house coffee and post cereals 
meanwhile it strengthened its hold as the dominant force in the 
tobacco industry 
at the other end of the standings navistar international was 
the biggest loser among the dow 30 falling from 3912 at the 
start of the 80s to less than 4 recently 
navistar known a decade ago as international harvester left 
the farm and constructionmachinery businesses to concentrate on 
making trucks and dieselpowered equipment it suffered through a 
sevenyear spell of losses before recently returning to 
profitability 
among the winners philip morris wasnt alone in benefiting from 
the ravenous consumer appetites of the 80s 
close behind it in the dow performance ranking stood mcdonalds 
corp up nearly 700 percent cocacola up nearly 600 percent and 
merck the health care giant up more than 500 percent 
like navistar bethlehem steel which was down more than 20 
percent and international business machines up less than 50 
percent reflected the many problems of the economys industrial 
sector 
what did all this mean for a diversified portfolio of stocks 
once the big winners and losers are balanced out the dow jones 
industrial average has more than tripled all in all not a bad 
10 years lefevre observed 
in the past week the average suffered something of a setback 
beset by fears that softening real estate markets might increase 
the odds of a recession in 1990 it closed friday at 271139 down 
2816 from the week before 
the new york stock exchange composite index dropped 150 to 
19195 the nasdaq composite index for the overthecounter market 
rose 73 to 44457 and the american stock exchange market value 
index was down 150 at 19195 
volume on the big board averaged 16870 million shares a day 
against 18554 million the week before 
just how the experience of the 80s might translate into good 
decisions for the 90s remains to be seen 
some say the new decade like the old one may begin with a 
recession especially since the great prosperity of the past 
several years has left a lot of debts to be paid 
others contend that the pessimists and the skeptics who missed 
many an opportunity in the 80s may just wind up repeating the 
same mistake 
whatever happens however people in the stocks and bonds 
business say the story of the 80s big winners and losers provides 
a dramatic demonstration of the virtues of a diversified investment 
program 
anyone who owned 10000 each of the best and worst blue chips 
through the 80s would have an 80000plus philip morris profit as 
consolation and then some for a 9000 navistar loss

orange juice futures prices fell sharply friday on the new york 
cotton exchange as skittish players took preweekend profits in a 
wild session that featured a onehour trading halt to prevent 
mixups in the flood of orders 
we had a really crazy market here said celeste georkakis 
an analyst with cargill investor services inc 
on other commodity markets heating oil futures posted fresh 
gains as the nations recordsetting cold spell continued precious 
metals advanced livestock and meat futures were mixed and grains 
and soybeans were mixed 
most commodity exchanges held abbreviated trading sessions to 
give traders and employees an early start on the long holiday 
weekend 
after rising sharply in the four previous sessions frozen 
concentrated orange juice futures fell 1 cent to 47 cents friday 
with the contract for january delivery settling at 137 a pound 
the runup earlier in the week had been fueled by forecasts for a 
damaging freeze this weekend in the central florida citrus belt 
and those forecasts remained in effect on friday 
but many traders fearful of carrying their positions through the 
threeday weekend opted to take profits rather than risk a market 
dive when trading resumes on tuesday 
the lowest temperatures were expected to reach florida on 
saturday and sunday so the threat of damage to florida fruit will 
be long past when the orange juice futures market reopens 
the market opened with a surge and quickly rose the permitted 
5centsapound limit for daily trading on heavy speculative 
buying but trade selling emerged at midmorning and speculators 
joined in pushing prices nearly limitdown before the exchange 
called a trading halt at 11 am est heavy selling continued when 
trading resumed at noon 
heating oil for nearterm delivery rose sharply for the sixth 
straight day and the 17th time in the last 18 trading sessions on 
the new york mercantile exchange the buying again was linked to 
weatherdriven demand for shrinking supplies of home heating oil 
dealers have reported spot shortages of fuel oil in the heavily 
populated northeast where temperatures have been below normal 
since late november 
heating oil futures settled 83 cent lower to 193 cents higher 
with january at 8174 cents a gallon west texas intermediate crude 
oil was 23 cents to 27 cents lower with february at 2129 a 
barrel unleaded gasoline was 18 cent to 65 cent lower with 
january at 5545 cents a gallon 
gold and silver futures rose modestly on new yorks commodity 
exchange reflecting expectations of lower interest rates and a 
weaker dollar 
the commmerce departments report of a 51 percent rise in 
factory orders for durable goods last month also was a supportive 
factor analysts said 
gold futures finished 120 to 130 higher with december at 
41320 a troy ounce silver was 16 cents to 19 cents higher with 
silver at 556 a troy ounce 
most live cattle and hog futures retreated on the chicago 
mercantile exchange on expectations that warmer temperatures next 
week in the great plains and midwest will lead to increased 
livestock marketings 
live cattle settled 25 cent lower to 07 cent higher with 
february at 7680 cents a pound feeder cattle were 08 cent lower 
to 13 cent higher wiith january at 8482 cents a pound live hogs 
were 60 cent lower to 02 cent higher with february at 4887 cents 
a pound frozen pork bellies were 42 cent lower to 17 cent higher 
with february at 4977 cents a pound 
soybean futures settled moderately lower on the chicago board of 
trade in quiet sporadic trading the grain markets finished nearly 
unchanged 
analysts said soybeans were pressured by perceptions of improved 
growing conditions in soybeangrowing areas of south america and 
slack export demand 
wheat futures settled cent to 1 cents lower with the contract

speculators in orange juice and heating oil futures are having 
an especially merry christmas because of a recordbusting cold 
front that prompted fears of a florida freeze and created spot 
shortages of fuel 
most other commodity markets were fairly quiet ahead of the long 
holiday weekend 
frozen concentrated orange juice for delivery in january settled 
at 137 a pound friday on the new york cotton exchange about a 9 
percent increase from 126 a pound a week earlier the contract 
traded as high as 14225 on friday but finished the day with a 
steep loss as traders took preweekend profits 
on the new york mercantile exchange heating oil for january 
delivery rose 16 percent to 8174 cents a gallon from 7042 cents 
the dramatic rise in both markets was almost entirely due to the 
relentless southerly advance of a cold air mass that meteorologists 
rated as one of the most intense of this decade 
the leading edge of the chill that hit north florida early 
friday was expected to bring nearrecord lows to the entire state 
including the citrusgrowing region in the middle of the florida 
peninsula 
about 85 percent of floridas 1 billionplus citrus crop is 
still on the trees the last major killing frost on christmas day 
1983 damaged at least 30 percent of the orange crop 
citrus specialists estimated less than 5 percent of the states 
700000 acres of trees were protected by costly heaters or wind 
blowers 
but the 1983 freeze and another in 1985 prompted citrus growers 
to shift production further south so while the projected lows of 
15 to 29 degrees in the citrus belt would be enough to damage 
fruit analysts said the damage would probably be less severe than 
six years ago 
the situation was quite different in 1983 said celeste 
georkakis an analyst with cargill investor services inc if the 
groves were where they were then wed have the same effect but 
they arent 
this years florida orange crop is projected at 133 million 
boxes vs 170 million in 1983 but brazil has since become a major 
producer of orange juice and is expected to harvest a record large 
crop this year 
therefore ms georkakis said any frostdamage shortfall in 
us production can be made up with brazilian imports reducing 
excess supplies on the world market 
some heating oil suppliers in the northeast reported temporary 
outages in the past week as the region counted its 24th straight 
day friday of belownormal temperatures 
star enterprise a texaco inc affiliate said sales of home 
heating oil were running 50 percent above projections for the month 
of december exxon usa said it had limited oil customers to amounts 
specified in purchase contracts 
the extraordinary domestic demand extended to six weeks a 
heatingoil price rally that ran its first leg on concerns about 
supplies of fuel oil in europe

a federal judge friday unsealed confidential 
corporate documents in a lawsuit against mobil oil corp but 
withheld the order when lawyers for the oil giant said they would 
appeal 
the company is fighting to prevent the disclosure of the 
documents reports on environmental conditions at its chemical 
division plants because it says they are selfcritical 
evaluations 
disclosing such reports would have a chilling effect on a 
companys efforts to be candid about its operations mobil argued 
but us district judge harold a ackerman ruling in favor of 
the associated press and a former mobil employee suing over his 
firing said the publics right to know was paramount 
public access to civil judicial proceedings is of vast 
importance ackerman said such access ensures justice and 
contributes to the publics understanding of government and the 
legal system he said 
ackerman dismissed the companys argument that its candor would 
be chilled if the public were able to see selfcriticism he also 
noted that mobil didnt object to disclosure of the documents until 
ackerman ruled dec 11 that the case should be heard by a jury 
mobil said it would appeal ackermans order to the 3rd us 
circuit court of appeals in philadelphia 
the judge also said he was baffled by mobil attorney richard 
reibsteins efforts to keep the documents from coming to light and 
to keep the news media from covering the case 
ackerman on friday admitted the ap into the courtroom over 
mobils objections 
valcar bowman jr claims he was fired as mobil chemical cos 
environmental affairs manager for refusing to go along with changes 
ordered by company lawyers in the reports 
he claims revisions were imposed to minimize pollution problems 
mobil says the changes were innocuous and that it was committed 
to environmentally sound practices mobil says that bowman 47 of

overextended consumers and a slowing economy 
could combine like cheapspiked eggnog to give many retailers a 
hangover from the last christmas season of an extravagant decade 
from the swank gauntlet of perfume counters at cashstarved 
bloomingdales to the kiddie departments at k mart retailers this 
past week were hoping that the most crucial days of the year would 
not leave them holding vast quantities of unsold merchandise 
storeowners will take awhile to assess the final days before 
christmas historically they have been the busiest and in many 
cases have helped merchants finish the year profitably a few store 
chains already say theyve done well 
but the general tone of this shopping season has been troubling 
with some big retailers trying to fend off bankruptcy and most 
struggling to eke out slim sales increases over last year 
similar spirits were haunting other sectors of the economy 
during the week the big automakers said they would have to lay off 
thousands of workers next month because of slow sales 
northeast banks were taking urgent steps to protect themselves 
from a rapidly weakening real estate market into which theyve 
loaned billions of dollars 
the real estate woes even touched off a sudden drop in the stock 
market on monday 
the pressure on the retailers has been starkly evident on the 
streets of new york in the racks of sale items at b altman amp 
co the once classy manhattan department store that is going out 
of business because parent company lj hooker is in bankruptcy 
court overwhelmed by creditor claims 
its been evident in the heavy discounting at bloomingdales and 
other department stores owned by another retailing company bobbing 
in debts campeau corp which warned that its stores might default 
on their loans and might run to bankruptcy court as well 
the pressure on campeau intensified earlier in the week when a 
leading apparel supplier and two key lenders in the retailing 
industry curbed business dealings with the company for fear they 
wouldnt get paid 
to a large extent campeaus problems are rooted in one of the 
leading causes of economic growth and consumer spending of the 
1980s the rapid accumulation of debt 
campeau relied on debt for its 66 billion purchase of 
bloomingdales parent federated department stores in 1988 
consumers wooed by the enticements of buying with borrowed money 
nearly doubled the number of credit cards in in the 1980s and 
racked up a total debt of more than 700 billion 
debt wasnt the only deterrent to hitting the malls this past 
week nature was a coconspirator in the retailing industrys 
troubled season plunging much of the country into record cold that 
discouraged shoppers from leaving home 
perhaps the largest lump of coal lobbed at a retailer came from 
new york states consumeractivist attorney general robert abrams 
who sued sears roebuck amp co for what he called its phony policy of 
low prices 
the nations leading department store chain which has been 
struggling in recent months to find the right recipe to compete 
with aggressive lowerpriced rivals like k mart and walmart 
stores said it was shocked by abrams accusations of false 
advertising and would fight to clear its name in court 
in other business and economic news this past week 
the commerce department said thirdquarter economic growth was 
revised upward to 3 percent from 27 percent a commerce survey 
showed businesses plan to increase capital spending next year 
despite forecasts of a slowdown and orders for durable goods 
increased sharply in november 
eastern airlines shrank and american airlines swelled in 
another repositioning that reflected the consolidation of their 
industry american bought latin american routes and other assets 
from easterns parent texas air corp for 471 million 
a wellknown takeover speculator convicted of stock 
manipulation was sentenced to three years probation and a 250000 
fine the lightest punishment doled out so far in the series of 
prosecutions stemming from the ivan boesky insider trading scandal 
salim b lewis who had pleaded guilty to stock manipulation was 
ordered to spend the probation helping drug addicts

liz claiborne inc a top womens apparel maker 
was the most profitable public firm in the united states during the 
1980s according to a survey by forbes magazine 
liz claiborne had an average 518 percent return on equity 
during the nine years since it went public placing it ahead of the 
second most profitable firm rollins inc a pest control and alarm 
system firm which had an average return on equity of 472 percent 
forbes said in its jan 8 issue 
in compiling its rankings forbes said it considered only firms 
for which at least eight years worth of financial data was 
available the magazine said it evaluated 1150 us companies in 
20 industries 
to be considered for forbes rankings a company must have 
revenue of at least 400 million or in the case of banks and 
electric utilities 800 million biotechnology firms do not have 
to meet the minimum revenue requirement 
return on equity is a measure of corporate profitability 
expressed as a percentage of a companys net worth 
forbes ranked the wholesaler price co third with an average 
return of 405 percent while the apparel retailer limited inc was 
no 4 with an average return of 399 percent and the publisher 
commerce clearing house inc ranked fifth with a 397 percent 
return 
cereal maker kellogg co was no 6 was a return of 389 percent 
general motors corps eds subsidiary ranked seventh with a return 
of 379 percent highland superstores inc was eighth with 373 
percent student loan marketing association was listed ninth with 
371 percent and apple computer inc ranked 10th with 366 percent 
the median return on equity for the entire survey was 143 
percent forbes said 
forbes noted that a companys average return on equity during 
the decade may not necessarily be a good indicator of how well the 
company has fared most recently for example apple computer had a 
366 percent average return during the decade but in the past 12 
months has enjoyed a return of 432 percent 
the magazine also pointed out that special dividends paid out 
during a corporate restructuring could distort a firms results 
the most profitable industry group during the 1980s was the 
health industry forbes said the 39 companies that comprise the 
industry according to the magazines rankings had a median average 
return on equity of 187 percent 
the food drink and tobacco industry was second with a median 
average return of 184 percent no 3 was entertainment and 
information with a return of 173 percent business services and 
supplies was fourth with 167 percent and retailing ranked fifth 
with 167 percent 
the no 6 industry was aerospace and defense with a return of 
157 percent consumer nondurables ranked seventh with 152 
percent no 8 was chemicals with 15 percent insurance was ninth 
with 144 percent and financial services was 10th with 143 
percent 
no 1 liz claiborne is based in new york the home city for the 
most industry group leaders in the forbes rankings other industry 
group leaders included exxon corp among international oil firms 
bankers trust co among multinational banking companies cbs inc 
in the broadcasting industry walmart stores inc among retailers 
and lockheed corp among aerospace and defense firms 
while looking back over the 1980s forbes also looked ahead to 
the 1990s and selected 20 firms that it said were best positioned 
for the coming decade they included boeing co kelly services

federal reserve policy makers decided not to 
change monetary policy at their late fall meeting but left open the 
possibility of lower interest rates if economic events dictated 
according to minutes released friday 
while current indicators of economic activity suggested a 
somewhat weaker expansion most of the members agreed that a steady 
policy course was desirable at this point especially in light of 
the stimulus provided by recent easing actions said the minutes 
of the nov 14 meeting of the federal open market committee 
most of the policy makers agreed however some further easing 
might be needed if the incoming information on business activity 
suggested more softening than most members currently expected 
the fed permitted shortterm interest rates to drop a quarter of 
a percentage point earlier this week to 825 percent it was the 
first decrease since nov 7 when the central bank also permitted 
the federal funds rate to decline a quarter of a percentage point 
manipulation of this rate the interest rate that banks charge 
each other for overnight loans is the primary lever the fed uses 
to control shortterm interest rates it has used this lever 
several times since last june when it began relaxing its grip on 
credit to slow inflation 
the initial decision to keep policy unchanged was reached on a 
101 vote of the open market committee composed of fed governors 
in washington and five of the 12 fed regional bank presidents 
gov martha seeger cast the dissenting vote contending a 
further easing was needed in view of persisting weakness in the 
manufacturing sector particularly automobiles and a likely 
softening in construction and capital expenditures 
the committee met again monday and tuesday but minutes of that 
meeting will not be released until next month the committee 
gathers in secret eight times a year to formulate monetary policy 
and confers by telephone as needed 
in its review of economic conditions last month it found that 
the economy continued to expand though unevenly and at a 
somewhat slower pace than earlier in the year 
while the serviceproducing sector appeared to be growing 
moderately manufacturing had been weak owing to sluggish demand 
and to strikes and other disruptions to production the minutes 
said price increases had been smaller since midyear but there 
had been no abatement of wage inflation 
nonfarm employment grew appreciably in october it said but 
slower than in previous months 
widespread job gains were apparent in the serviceproducing 
sector but manufacturing payrolls declined further as a result of 
continued weakness in motor vehicles and other durable goods 
industries the report said 
the minutes also showed the fed staff expected the economy was 
likely to grow at a slower pace over the next several quarters

columbia pictures entertainment inc said friday 
that it had decided to put mccannerickson worldwide in charge of 
placing domestic advertising for both its columbia pictures and 
tristar pictures movies 
the decision could mean an extra 70 million to 75 million in 
annual billings for the giant new yorkbased agency which had 
previously held the assignment only for columbia pictures ads 
the loser is acampr advertising a unit of saatchi amp saatchi co 
plc which had been responsible for placing the tristate pictures 
advertising 
among tristars recent films have been steel magnolias and 
look whos talking while columbias recent films have included 
when harry met sally and ghostbusters ii 
calls were placed to both agencies but went unanswered friday 
afternoon many businesses closed early friday in advance of the 
threeday christmas holiday weekend 
the move comes a month after columbia pictures entertainment was 
acquired by japans sony corp in a 34 billion buyout but a 
columbia spokesman who asked not to be identified said the decision 
was unrelated to the buyout 
the columbia and tristar studios merged their marketing 
departments last march and had reportedly been reviewing ad agency 
assignments for several months 
in response to inquiries the columbia pictures spokesman in 
burbank calif said the decision to consolidate north american 
media placement for the two studios was the next step in the merger 
of the marketing departments 
the spokesman declined to disclose how much the studios spend on 
advertising their films 
but industry sources said that annual spending came to between 
140 million and 150 million this year evenly divided between the 
two studios 
mccannerickson whose total us billings amounted to 13 
billion in 1988 has handled media placement for columbia pictures 
for about two years 
among its other clients are cocacola cos soft drinks general 
motors corps buick division american telephone amp telegraph cos 
businesstobusiness advertising and exxon corps gasoline and 
motor oil products 
it recently won a 25 million assignment for tasters choice 
coffee from nestle a 25 million job for unspecified new products 
from rjr nabisco and a 10 million account for fidelity investments 
acampr advertising had us billings of 3556 million in 1988 
its clients include austin rover of north america fosters lager 
beer and regency cruises

bank of new england corp which expects heavy 
losses due to bad real estate loans on friday rescinded a common 
stock dividend it had declared last month 
the announcement came one week after bank of new england said it 
would boost its loan reserves above 1 billion and that it expected 
a substantial loss for the year 
at the time the bank also said it was exploring the sale or 
merger of its assets and was considering rescinding a 34 cents per 
share dividend for the fourth quarter ending dec 31 
in a brief statement late friday the bank said its board of 
directors had agreed to rescind the dividend 
analysts said such action is highly unusual but reflects the 
serious trouble bank of new england faces due to a real estate 
slump that has battered many of the regions banks 
were looking at a real estate market that is deteriorating 
very rapidly and very dramatically and bank of new england is a 
major real estate player said james moynihan senior vice 
president of advest inc in boston 
while 28 banks in new england have eliminated or cut dividends 
since april moynihan said ive never seen a cash dividend 
declared then rescinded 
bank of new england the regions second largest bank has come 
under increased scrutiny by regulators and analysts predict 
changes could be forthcoming in the companys management the bank 
last week reassigned a senior executive overseeing its real estate 
group 
moynihan also said the possibility is growing the bank could be 
acquired by an another bank or outside investor 
one of the things you have to address is customer 
confidence he said noting the bank could have trouble restoring 
credibility without outside help

rr donnelley amp sons co the leading 
commercial printer in north america agreed friday to buy the 
meredithburda printing business jointly owned by meredith corp 
and the burda family of west germany in a deal valued at about 570 
million 
meredith a fortune 500 company that publishes better homes and 
gardens magazine and also has interests in television stations and 
real estate said it would use its share of the proceeds to 
strengthen and expand its core businesses 
its a continuation of a trend thats been going on for some 
time the industry is consolidating said robert a dunlap who 
follows donnelley for the new york securities firm of brown 
brothers harriman amp co 
analysts said the deal should benefit both companies 
on the new york stock exchange friday donnelley rose 87 cents 
to finish at 4875 a share and meredith jumped 337 to 3525 a 
share 
donnelley said it would pay 4875 million in cash to be 
divided between meredith and franz and frieder burda of west 
germany it also agreed to assume 80 million in meredithburda 
debt 
the deal subject to government antitrust review is expected to 
be closed early in 1990 the companies said jack rehm the 
president of meredith said he anticipated no objections on grounds 
of restraint of trade 
donnelley based in chicago accounts for an estimated 64 
percent of the 50 billion us commercial printing market and 
should expand its share to about 7 percent through the acquisition 
dunlap said 
donnelley prints and binds many national publications including 
time newsweek tv guide and business week it also prints 
telephone books encyclopedias and school and religious books and 
has about 25000 employees at nearly 100 factories and offices in 
the united states britain ireland the caribbean and asia 
in 1988 donnelley earned 2053 million on sales of almost 29 
billion 
meredithburda formed in 1969 generated 4567 million in the 
fiscal year ended june 30 and employs 3205 people nationwide 
including about 1100 in des moines it has printing plants in des 
moines newton nc lynchburg va and casa grande ariz its 
photo preparation centers are in lynchburg and at hickory and 
greensboro nc 
meredithburda also owns 40 percent of plants in lynchburg and 
at greenfield iowa where siegwerk inc manufactures ink 
donnelley spokesman james ratcliffe said there are no immediate 
plans for cutbacks although some sales and administrative 
positions at meredithburda may be eliminated in the future if they 
overlap with donnelley operations 
we did not buy this to dismantle anything ratcliffe said in 
a telephone interview 
meredith which earned 332 million on revenue of 792 million 
in the latest fiscal year already had a working relationship with 
donnelley which prints merediths ladies home journal and sail 
magazines and several meredith books rehm said donnelley would be 
printing other meredith publications the bulk of them at the des 
moines plant 
rehm said meredith officials began considering the sale of the 
capitalintensive printing business early in 1989 and soon began 
discussions with donnelley 
its a solid financial decision for our stockholders 
employees customers and communities rehm said our longterm 
goal and our vision for meredith corporation is to create growth 
through acquisitions and new product development with this 
decision we can focus our energy our skills and our capital 
resources on our core businesses 
rehm said meredith was receiving about twice the amount it had 
been carrying on its books as the value of the operation 
he told reporters that no decisions had been made on how to 
spend the money which will be divided about evenly between 
meredith and the burdas but he noted that acquisition 
opportunities in the media business tended to surface at a moments 
notice 
if a television station came up in the foreseeable future and 
if we thought it was a good fit at the right price wed probably 
look at it rehm said 
he also said the company was exploring launching new magazines 
as well as acquiring existing publications 
i think everybody makes out on this deal dunlap said 
dunlap said meredith gets out of a business that has had a low 
return on investment and gets some needed cash for its other 
operations he said donnelley gets plants that fill voids in its 
operations 
john walter chairman and president of donnelley said the 
acquisition of meredithburda by donnelley is an outstanding 
opportunity for both parties meredithburda is a strong 
highquality printer with an excellent customer base and a leading 
market reputation the fit with donnelleys existing facilities is 
remarkably good 
cornelius sewell who follows the printing business for argus 
research in new york called donnelley a consistent performer 
sewell said donnelley is so broadbased that it can avoid the 
damage that cyclical swings cause smaller printing operations 
theyre pretty smart guys he said

a federal judge friday rejected a request 
by georgiapacific corp to move up a meeting of great northern 
nekoosa corp shareholders to consider a 38 billion takeover 
offer 
us district judge gene carter said he did not want to cut off 
debate prematurely in the merger battle and rejected 
georgiapacifics motion for a temporary restraining order and 
preliminary injunction 
this discussion is of great concern to the public and the 
publics interest as well as that of the shareholders is served by 
letting the discussion mature carter said 
harm may accrue to great northern and the public if the 
deal is rushed to completion and it is then determined that the 
newly formed corporation is in violation of the antitrust laws 
the judge said 
atlantabased georgiapacific asked carter on thursday to move 
the great northern shareholders meeting from march 20 to within 30 
days saying it wants shareholders to have a quick say in the rival 
paper makers merger offer 
georgiapacific also sought to force norwalk connbased great 
northern to provide it and the court with 72 hours notice of any 
financial restructuring that could make the 63ashare tender 
offer less attractive 
great northern already has agreed to provide georgiapacific 
with information on any changes it makes and georgiapacific could 
challenge any changes if it thinks they are improper carters 
ruling said 
georgiapacific on friday extended its offer through jan 5 and 
said 73 percent of great northerns shares had been tendered it 
said it was disappointed with the ruling 
great northern spokesman stephen hill called ruling 
wonderful

great northerns bylaws intended to thwart a hostile takeover 
hill said the deal would violate antitrust laws an issue to be 
decided in a federal trial scheduled to begin wednesday in 
bridgeport conn in a lawsuit brought by great northern 
the ruling friday came in motions filed in a separate lawsuit 
challenging great northerns poison pill and maines antitakeover 
law 
the federal trade commission in washington had faced a thursday 
deadline for deciding whether it believed the proposed merger would 
run afoul of antitrust laws but an ftc spokeswoman said no 
announcement was planned 
georgiapacific said the deadline passed without any action by 
the ftc satisfying one of the material conditions to 
georgiapacifics offer

federated department stores inc and allied 
stores corp said friday they have received notices that the 
companies failed to comply with reporting requirements under their 
bank credit agreements 
the notices which were dated thursday said reports must be 
made within 10 days or the loans would be considered to be in 
default the two campeau corp divisions said 
federated and allied said they reported in quarterly filings on 
oct 28 that they were unable to determine whether they were 
solvent although they also could not determine if they were 
insolvent 
in separate but identical statements federated and allied said 
the company believes it is in full compliance with its reporting 
obligations under its credit agreement and it has advised the 
lender that it believes the lenders assertion of a default on such 
basis is wholly without merit 
trading in campeau stock was halted friday at the toronto stock 
exchange campeau has been publicly foundering in financial 
difficulties since september when it announced that its cash flow 
might not be adequate to meet its cash needs in the coming months 
at that time it received 250 million in new financing from 
olympia amp york developments ltd bloomingdales campeaus prize 
retail chain was put up for sale and robert campeau was forced to 
give up control of the company he founded 
about a half dozen bidders reportedly are considering buying the

interest are jmb realty corp a shopping mall developer japans 
tokyu department store co real estate developer donald trump a 
group led by joseph brooks chairman of the ann taylor store chain 
and a group led by bloomingdales chairman marvin traub 
a sixth bidder possibly japanese also is expected to take part

campeau has said it hopes to complete the sale by february 
negotiations have been under way for the past week between 
campeaus restructuring committee chaired by olympia amp york 
representative lionel dodd and the companys creditors to 
restructure much of its 10 billion debt 
after campeaus thirdquarter results were released last week 
the company said its us retail operations might be forced to file 
for protection from creditors under us bankruptcy law because 
cash flow doesnt appear adequate to cover debt payments 
retail analyst karen sach at standard amp poors corp in new york 
said there was speculation that campeau would soon announce that it 
wants to sell other retailers besides bloomingdales or that it had 
decided not to sell bloomingdales 
campeaus stores around the united states include abraham amp 
straus burdines lazarus richs the bon marche jordan marsh 
maas brothers and sterns 
although sales and operating profits are up from last year 
financing costs have increased so much that campeau lost 390

braniff inc asked a federal bankruptcy 
judge friday to install an interim chief executive officer only a 
day after the struggling carriers top two executives resigned 
david murchison 41 who himself stepped down last month as 
braniffs vice president general counsel and secretary was 
recommended for the top job by both creditors and management said 
braniff spokeswoman ann cook 
us bankruptcy judge c timothy corcoran in orlando will review 
the recommendation and make the final decision he has not set a 
date to consider the motion 
braniff has a very strong midlevel management that is capable 
of running the company until the judge makes his decision ms 
cook said 
murchison was a vice president with piedmont aviation for three 
years before joining braniff in 1988 the plan is for him initally 
to serve as an interim chief executive and he may take over the job 
permanently ms cook said 
the management changes come at a time when the carrier is 
struggling through bankruptcy proceedings and both creditors and 
employees are calling for new management 
orlandobased braniff which filed for chapter 11 protection 
sept 28 has only 275 of its 4800 prefiling workers and has 
trimmed its schedule to just charter flights 
we dont want liquidation said tom burnette chairman of 
the teamsters unions braniff committee we want to preserve some 
jobs if theres a possibility at all 
william mcgee braniffs chief executive officer and w howard 
mackinnon chief financial officer submitted their resignations 
thursday of their own accord ms cook said 
they simply feel the company has reached the point where their 
services are no longer needed and they left to pursue other 
interests ms cook said 
the resignations came the same day braniff announced a drop in 
earnings for the third quarter ended oct 31 braniff showed a net 
loss of 1349 million compared with a loss of 78 million for 
the same period in 1988 
braniff also announced its giving up its rights to five leased 
airbus jets rather than go to court over the aircraft 
irelands gpa group ltd had sued braniff for the five jets 
because the airline owed 3 million in lease payments braniff said 
the airbuses are being returned as a gesture of good faith 
scott hamilton editor of the commercial aviation report in 
dallas said braniff had little hope of keeping the planes once gpa 
sued 
yes braniff could have fought tooth and nail but to what 
end he said they would have lost the airplanes and meanwhile 
they would have lost the legal fees 
the return of five airbuses does not affect braniffs agreement 
to lease and purchase another 45 jets according to a statement 
issued jointly by braniff and gpa the undelivered airbuses are the 
airlines chief asset 
braniff whch has been sustaining itself recently by selling off 
assets is trying to find a customer for the lease agreements and 
purchase options 
braniff lost 1757 million in the first nine months of its 
fiscal year on revenue of 3918 million the 1349 million 
quarterly loss is equivalent to 915 a share and includes a 64 
million writeoff for intangible value the company lost when it 
filed for bankruptcy protection plus 224 million related to the 
bankruptcy filing

resorts international filed a 
reorganization plan in bankruptcy court friday that seeks to shed 
about twothirds of its 912 million in debt 
analysts said the plan which formalizes a bankruptcy petition 
filed nov 13 in us bankruptcy court in camden nj will buy 
the company badly needed time to get its finances in order 
the plan seeks the courts approval of company owner merv 
griffins proposal to swap 78 percent of his resorts stock for 
about 600 million of the outstanding debt said company spokesman 
rob shepardson 
in addition to the approval of the bankruptcy court the plan 
requires the approval of half the resorts bondholders new jerseys 
casino contol commission and the government of the bahamas where 
resorts owns a casino 
shephardson said the companies would likely mail proxies in late 
january to bondholders 
resorts casinos in atlantic city and the bahamas will not be 
affected by the plan shepardson said 
in august resorts suspended interest payments on its 
outstanding bonds which shepardson estimated at 912 million in 
september the company announced a restructuring plan aimed at 
preventing a bankruptcy filing 
bondholders attacked the plan and split into two groups one 
holding subordinated unsecured debt and the other with senior 
secured debt 
the plan filed friday would give senior secured bondholders 
1875 million in new notes with a 4year term bearing interest of 
6 percent in the first year 9 percent in the second 12 percent in 
the third and 15 percent in the fourth those bondholders also 
would receive 25 percent of griffins shares 
holders of resorts highest paying bonds 16 percent would 
receive 324 percent of the shares the remaining bondholders would 
get 431 percent of the company stock 
the deal would leave griffin as chairman of a newly constituted 
sixperson board of directors 
the plan also would require griffin to invest a total of 30 
million in the company and fund a 5 million kitty for any legal 
action against billionaire developer donald j trump 
trump had been resorts chairman and controlling shareholder 
before griffin bought the company in november 1988 as part of the 
deal between the two trump received the unfinished taj mahal 
casino in atlantic city for 230 million less than half the 500 
million resorts poured into construction 
attorneys for some bondholder groups say they may sue trump for 
fraudulent conveyance trump has said griffin bears 
responsibility for the deal 
analysts have said griffin paid too much for the casino and 
weighed down his purchase with too much debt which shepardson 
estimated at 912 million 
but analysts said friday that griffins plan may yet save the 
company 
i think its the only alternative said john uphoff a 
casino analyst for raymond james amp associates in st petersburg 
fla 
he said the scheduled spring opening of the massive taj mahal 
next door may bring in new customers for resorts 
the opening of the taj will give them some extra business that 
they desperately need uphoff said 
daniel r lee an analyst for drexel burnham lambert inc which 
issued 325 million in bonds for the transaction said the taj 
mahal is a plus and a minus 
it will be a big competitor sitting on resorts doorstep he 
said but its also going to bring in a lot of business 
the casinos most recent financial results showed a 349 
million net loss for the third quarter 
resorts which was the first casino to open on atlantic citys 
boardwalk in may 1978 posted a win total for november of 171 
million an 81 percent decrease from the 184 million of november 
1988 
yearly figures show a win of 2149 million 94 percent lower 
than the 2285 million for the first 11 months of 1988

up for the holidays

a chapter in the turbulent financial saga of the 
hunt brothers once among the richest men in the world drew to a 
close this week as william herbert hunt relinquished his estate to 
a liquidating trustee 
hunts resolution of one of the biggest personal bankruptcies in 
history came on the heels of his brother nelson bunker hunts 
settlement last week 
it brings an end to the more than 3 billion fortune received 
from their father famed oil wildcatter hl hunt 
both brothers will formally emerge from bankruptcy in early 
january 
i dont plan to sit on my fanny herbert hunt said when 
asked about his plans 
on thursday us bankruptcy judge harold abramson signed the 
order that will transfer the fallen oilmans estate to a 
liquidating trust within 10 days herbert hunts 169 million 
estate will be liquidated to pay creditors over the next six years 
absolving him of nearly 1 billion in debt 
missing from thursdays hearing were the television cameras 
crowds or fanfare that dominated the end of bunker hunts 
bankruptcy case 
bunker got much more attention because he is much more 
interesting but this was the harder of the two cases to resolve 
said hugh ray attorney for manufacturers hanover trust co a 
creditor in both bankruptcies he noted that herberts assets are 
less liquid 
bunker had a lot more cash he said 
ray said it was miraculous to have two such sizable 
bankruptcy cases resolved within 15 months 
under the plan confirmed thursday herbert will be stripped of 
his assets which are concentrated heavily in depressed texas and 
arizona real estate his largest holding is a 505 million 
interest in a 4000acre phoenix housing development 
herbert will lose his 400000 salary but he will keep his 
cadillac 12 million dallas mansion personal effects totaling 
50000 and a 50 percent interest in nonproducing oil and natural 
gas properties 
in addition if hunt can enhance the selling price of his 
byzantine coins and bronze statues he will receive a portion of 
those proceeds herberts children will be given a chance to buy 
his onehalf interest in his vail colo home as well as his wife 
nancys english pottery collection 
seventy percent of herberts holdings will go to the internal 
revenue service and the other 30 percent will be divided among the 
remaining creditors including manufacturers hanover and minpeco 
sa a peruvian mining company 
in addition the irs will be paid 75 million out of future 
gifts income and inheritances 
herberts financial problems began in 1980 when he and his 
brother lost 15 billion speculating in the silver futures 
markets the silver losses were compounded by falling real estate 
prices and the collapse of the oil market 
the brothers filed for bankruptcy protection in september 1988 
shortly after a new york jury found the hunts had conspired to 
corner the silver market

ivan boesky gets three years in prison for 
masterminding an unprecedented insider trading swindle fraudmate 
boyd jefferies squeals on others and is freed in appreciation 
admitted stock manipulator salim b lewis will work as an 
executive in a drug rehabilitation clinic after pleading guilty 
stock parker paul a bilzerian will go to prison after a jury 
conviction 
as the number of cases resolved in the governments wall street 
fraud investigation grows one thing is clear disparity not 
clarity has been the main characteristic of punishments 
whether ordering prison time or probation federal judges in 
manhattan who have meted out sentences in the crackdown have 
decried financial swindling and said they were sending a 
message to wall street 
but the message has varied and judges defense lawyers and 
legal experts appear troubled over whether securities professionals 
who plead guilty or are found guilty by juries should go to prison 
at all 
you are a perfect example of the serious burdens placed upon a 
court in trying to deal with this kind of conduct us district 
judge mary johnson lowe told lewis a respected trader and former 
securities and exchange commission adviser before sparing him 
prison time last week 
you should be sentenced in a way so that your talents will not 
be wasted she said warehousing your body will be a deterrent 
but it will do little to benefit society 
lowes comments were cheered by lawyers who said the punishment 
fit the crime an isolated incident of scheming to boost a stock 
price 
but it was the first time a securities felon received only 
probation without cooperating with the government a wide majority 
of those who have come before the bench in the last three years 
have gone to prison 
judges will deny it but theres no doubt that if you plead 
guilty the sentence will be lighter than if you go to trial said 
elkan abramowitz whose client stockbroker robert chestman is 
serving a twoyear term after an insider trading conviction 
jefferies who collaborated with boesky was placed on probation 
and fined 250000 he provided information that led to successful 
prosecutions of bilzerian lewis gaf corp and its vice chairman 
james t sherwin 
bilzerian a florida investor got four years after he was 
convicted of making millions by illegally concealing ownership of 
stock in takeover targets by temporarily parking it with 
stockbroker jefferies among stockrelated offenses bilzerians 
term has been the longest 
the longest overall has been eight years for david bloom a 
24yearold aspiring financial adviser who was convicted of mail 
and securities fraud for bilking investors of 15 million he spent 
on art fast cars and luxury homes 
manhattan us attorneys office records show that of 43 
individuals prosecuted for securitiesrelated offenses since 1986 
23 have been sentenced to prison against six placed on probation 
the remaining either were acquitted or are awaiting trial or 
sentencing 
you see more sentences of imprisonment now than you did 10 or 
15 years ago in whitecollar fraud cases said criminal defense 
lawyer alan kaufman who has represented several wall street 
professionals 
many defense lawyers believe the benchmark for securities 
offenses should be the three years for boesky who was accused of 
rampant insider trading and cooperated with prosecutors in the case 
that has embodied wall streets scandals 
others say that for firsttime violators straight probation and 
community service should be the standard along with hefty fines 
and expulsion from the profession punishments they say hurt 
financial executives most while replenishing federal coffers 
whitecollar criminals should be treated differently 
abramowitz said they do not pose a physical threat to society 
financial crime does not grip the city with fear 
it does affect the ethical quality of our society and to that 
extent it is important and should be prosecuted but the punishment 
should be comparable with the crime in that framework 
while judges more and more send a message via prison sentences 
that whitecollar criminals shouldnt get preferential treatment 
just because they are predominantly white male and wealthy 
warehousing a stock manipulator costs taxpayers 
according to the us bureau of prisons it cost 2660 a day 
or about 9700 a year in fiscal 1988 to keep an inmate at a 
minimumsecurity prison camp where most wall street felons are 
sent 
the number of inmates at such facilities the lowest security 
level in the federal prison system was 12623 as of dec 5 up 
61 percent from 11898 at end of fiscal 1988 and 18 percent from 
10686 the previous year 
off wall street financial scammers increasingly are getting 
lengthy prison terms hotel queen leona helmsleys four years for 
tax evasion and televangelist jim bakkers 45 years for fraud have 
been the most publicized 
new federal criminal sentencing guidelines threaten to increase 
the use of prison even more 
the guidelines which apply to crimes committed after nov 1 
1987 and as such havent been used in most of the wall street 
cases provide strict sentences for each offense in whitecollar 
cases the length of the term often is determined by the dollar 
amount of the fraud 
judges have little room to apply discretion based on other 
elements such as whether community service might be more effective 
for defendant and society lewis for instance whose crime 
occurred in 1986 would have received a mandatory prison sentence 
under the guidelines 
they do not take into consideration the differences in conduct 
and people said securities lawyer gerald lefcourt they 
attempt to make things uniform where it is impossible to do that 
according to a us sentencing commission study 57 percent of 
criminal taxlaw convicts in 1985 received only probation under 
the guidelines the figure would have been 3 percent in fraud 
cases 59 percent got probation under the guidelines it would 
have been 24 percent 
the guidelines made a deliberate effort to increase the 
severity of whitecollar sentences and will greatly increase the 
frequency of prison sentences said university of chicago 
criminal law professor albert alschuler 
you really ought to think about taking the whitecollar 
offender and reducing him to bankruptcy before you start piling on 
prison sentences he said 
defense lawyers generally agree incarceration is necessary in 
some whitecollar cases but say its counterproductive and 
wasteful to send nonviolent felons into a prison system already 
overflowing with hard criminals 
lefcourt said the attitude of the country is somehow you can 
solve complicated problems in peoples condition by just throwing 
the book at everybody i think thats very unfortunate

the copacabana palace hotel a rio 
landmark that once hosted european royalty and hollywood movie 
stars but fell on hard times has been taken over by the american 
businessman who restored europes orient express train 
the copa on rios famous copacabana beach on the south 
atlantic coast has been declining for more than 20 years but 
james sherwood has pledged to restore the hotels glory 
the new general manager philip carruthers would not say how 
much sherwood paid in september to buy a controlling interest in 
the hotel local press estimates ran from 70 million to 100 
million but he said no expense would be spared to modernize and 
improve the hotel 
the hotel is considered to be part of the countrys heritage 
so the facade wont be touched but the inside will be completely 
modernized so we can make the place successful again 
carruthers a brazilreared englishman said 
sherwood is chairman of the londonbased 2 billion sea 
containers ltd a leading producer of shipping containers 
sea containers owns 42 percent of orient express hotels inc 
which will run the copa the purchase of the hotel is the first 
tourism investment in south america by sherwood whose firms 
already run hotels in the united states the bahamas italy 
scotland england and portugal 
orient express hotels refurbished the famous train of the same 
name which during its heyday in the 1920s ran from istanbul 
turkey to london crossing the english channel by ferryboat 
the train which suspended service in the early 1970s resumed 
operations in 1983 and now makes a twiceweekly run between london 
and venice 
the orient express has been reestablished as a luxury form of 
transport fully restored in 1920s style said carruthers adding 
that sherwood hopes to do the same with the copa once considered 
one of the worlds 20 best hotels 
mr sherwood has always been keen on the hotel its an 
imposing building on an extraordinary site with wonderful black 
and white pavement said sea containers ltd spokeswoman naida 
stancioff in london she was referring to the wide mosaic sidewalk 
that lines the 2mile long copacabana beach 
the copa inaugurated in 1923 was the creation of brazils 
thenpresident epitacio pessoa who lamented rios lack of a 
firstclass luxury hotel to accommodate prominent visitors with the 
same pomp with which he was received in europe 
businessman octavio guinle whose family controlled the copa 
until it was bought by sherwood told pessoa he would construct a 
hotel to rival europes finest if he could install a casino at the 
time rio had no large tourist market and guinle felt gambling was 
necesasary to make the hotel profitable 
pessoa agreed guinle imported cement from germany marble from 
italy crystals from czechoslovakia and furniture from france 
the hotel designed by architect joseph gire contains 223 
rooms including a huge presidential suite overlooking the ocean 
14 party rooms a theater and the golden room for special 
attractions the facade inspired by hotels in cannes and nice 
france is a mix of classical styles 
the hotel always was more famous for social significance 
people here say there was a time when coming to rio and not staying 
at the copa was like going to rome and not seeing the pope 
over the years maurice chevalier nat king cole edith piaf and 
ella fitzgerald performed in the golden room 
the hotel has welcomed world leaders ranging from dwight 
eisenhower to eva peron fidel castro to the shah of iran animals 
were prohibited in the copa after magda lupesco paramour of king 
carol i of romania kept eight pekinese in her room and they ate 
the drapes 
the most legendary stories concern movie stars 
orson welles in a drunken stupor threw a bed into the swimming 
pool from his secondfloor window after delores del rio broke off 
their romance 
in 1939 errol flynn pranced naked through the halls nudity 
reared its head again in the early 1960s when jayne mansfield 
nonchalantly sat topless at poolside and made headlines for a week 
other famous guests who have stayed at the copa include brigitte 
bardot joan crawford clark gable and tyrone power 
in 1946 president eurico dutra outlawed gambling and the copa 
casino closed but the hotel continued to reign as queen of rios 
social life until 1960 
in that year the national capital was moved from rio to the 
inland city of brasilia and the hotel lost the glamour of putting 
up visiting vips 
the real crunch came in the 1970s when several international 
firms opened modern fivestar hotels in copacabana by the early 
1980s the number of copa employees had been cut by twothirds and 
the hotel was barely breaking even 
the copa had been resting on its laurels for years the owners 
were so used to being the hotel in rio they felt they no longer had 
to compete said carruthers 
he said current problems range from leaky plumbing to shoddy 
interiors 
but renovations set to begin by next april should be completed 
by mid1991 carruthers said there are even plans to reopen the 
golden room and bring back worldclass performers 
when the work is completed the copa will be the best hotel in 
rio again he said
