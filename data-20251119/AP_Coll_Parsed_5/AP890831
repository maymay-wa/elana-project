tooele army depots aging stockpile of 
nerve and mustard gas 42 percent of the nations chemical arsenal 
will be destroyed onsite in a new 138 million incineration plant 
the pentagon said thursday 
in a report to congress the office of the secretary of the army 
said none of the chemical munitions at the remote western utah 
desert installation would be moved elsewhere for destruction 
while the decision did not address other sites where chemical 
weaponry is stored it was considered a victory for advocates 
onsite disposal at tooele 35 miles southwest of salt lake city 
and seven other us bases 
the army had considered disposing of the weapons at regional 
plants or one national site which would have required potentially 
risky transport by air rail truck and barge 
cindy vaughn spokeswoman for aberdeen md proving ground the 
program manager for the armys chemical demilitarization effort 
said similar announcements are expected for the other sites where 
chemical weapons are stored once environmental studies are 
completed 
the armys decision followed recommendations contained in an 
environmental impact statement released in july 
the new plant will employ a construction work force of about 350 
and once operational in december 1992 will have 400 employees 
vaughn said sitespecific eis studies such as the one conducted 
at tooele also are planned for aberdeen anniston army depot ala 
lexingtonblue grass army depot ky newport army ammunition plant 
ind pine bluff arsenal ark pueblo depot activity colo and 
umatilla depot activity ore 
further onsite disposal decisions are expected to be made down 
the line as each eis is finished she said none of the studies 
has been completed 
tooeles stockpile some of which dates back to world war ii 
includes nerve mustard and other blistering agents contained in 
rockets artillery projectiles mortar rounds and bombs in all the 
depot has nearly 800 such munitions some of which are leaking 
stored in earthcovered igloos 
vaughn said the new plant will use disassembly and incineration 
technology studied at tooeles chemical agent munitions disposal 
system pilot plant and the armys johnston atoll chemical agent 
disposal system facility 
congress has ordered the old chemical arsenal destroyed by 1997

three gunmen apparently using 
silencers opened fire in a medical insurance office thursday 
killing five people and wounding a sixth before fleeing police said 
police spokeswoman maria rivera said the gunmen opened fire 
without warning in the thirdstory medical collection services 
office in suburban rio piedras 
she said police suspected robbery was the motive the office was 
ransacked but it was not immediately known if any money was taken 
an anonymous caller saying he represented the medellin cartel 
group telephoned the associated press late thursday and claimed the 
shooting was retribution for the decision taken by president bush 
and his allies to help the colombian governments war against drug 
lords 
it was impossible to verify the authenticity of the callers 
claims police superintendent ismael betancourt said he never heard 
of the group and did not speculate on whether it could be 
responsible for the shooting 
betancourt said police were investigating 
the five killed were edwin and carmen perez both 36 the couple 
who owned medical collection services and three employees said 
jorge valentin who manages the building where the agency is located 
a fourth employee carlos cerra in his 50s was seriously 
injured by a gunshot wound in the back of the head 
cerra told police and reporters that the gunman knocked at the 
office door and immediately began shooting when he opened it he 
said he was hit and then fell to the ground unconscious he was 
hospitalized at the san juan medical center 
no other people were in the office at the time police said 
since no one else in the building heard the shots police said 
they believed the gunmen used silencers 
ms rivera the police spokeswoman said officials did not know 
whether the gunmen stole any money from the agency which mailed 
clients claims forms to insurance companies and received payment 
through checks 
the anonymous caller said six people jailed in puerto rico and 
allegedly linked to the medellin drug cartel are not alone and we 
are ready to fight to the end because the money we obtain from 
drugs is used exclusively for the proletariat 
the anonymous caller said the shooting constitutes a clear 
precise and final message that we know the government will wisely 
understand 
several weeks ago the superior court of carolina on the east 
side of san juan began hearings for six peopel allegedly linked to 
the medellin drug cartel 
prosecutors claim the six dealt in 10 million worth of cocaine 
every week and were responsible for the march 7 shooting death of a 
man in trujillo alto in northeast puerto rico 
their trial is expected to begin in september

twenty years after a pop festival took 
over this dallas suburb a beer company is sponsoring a rock fest 
that shows the woodstock era is long past 
organizers put together the 1969 texas international pop festival 
in lewisville in seven weeks with a shoestring budget but miller 
brewing co has pushed this weekends concert series for more than a 
year with television ads and other promotions 
at the shows the psychedelic drugs of yesteryear will give way 
to drinking arrangements for designated drivers 
the whole tone of the two shows 20 years apart is remarkably 
different angus wynne who promoted the lewisville festival said 
tuesday 
just three weeks after the woodstock rock festival in new york 
state about 120000 people spent three days on a field outside 
lewisville to hear the chicago transit authority janis joplin 
santana sly and the family stone bb king grand funk railway 
led zeppelin and others 
this weekend miller hopes to draw 500000 people to concerts in 
six texas cities including performances by the who in houston and 
dallas the concerts culminate a 16month campaign by the company 
in addition to the who performances by jerry jeff walker kool 
and the gang natalie cole and many others are planned in dallas 
houston san antonio corpus christi mcallen and midlandodessa 
it took wynne seven weeks and 120000 to line up all 30 acts 
promoters of the lewisville festival said they lost 100000 
miller hasnt disclosed its budget but the who grossed 104 
million at a concert before 47000 fans in st louis three weeks 
ago miller has pledged to give at least 1 million in proceeds to 
the texas special olympics 
the company and promoters have made elaborate security 
arrangements people will need wristbands to gain access to the 
concerts designated drivers will receive different colored bands 
entitling them to free soft drinks and baring them from buying beer 
twenty years ago drugs were common but the crowd behaved there 
were only 36 arrests most for public intoxication 
psychedelics and pot i believe were the prevalent stimulants 
of choice said sam houston a denton judge who was mayor of 
lewisville from 1969 to 1973 
when it was over residents were surprised by the longhaired 
easygoing rock fans some concertgoers mowed lawns and babysat for 
residents during their stay 
that was part of the mindblow thing that went on here wynne 
said people expected all these folks to be real nasty and here 
they were handing them flowers just as polite as they could be it 
disarmed them totally

a recent study of boston harbor found fewer fish 
with bent fins dwarfism or liver abnormalities associated with 
pollution but researchers say the inlet is far from environmentally 
sound 
we dont conclude from the study that in fact things are 
getting better said william e robinson senior scientist at the 
new england aquariums edgerton laboratory 
nearly 200 winter flounder caught one day in midmay showed fewer 
instances of cancerous lesions as well as other defects compared to 
studies in the early 1980s 
however robinson said wednesday defects were markedly higher 
than the numbers found in cleaner environments further out in the 
sea no changes have gone on in boston harbor yet he said 
adding that partially treated sewage still is being dumped there 
the state plans to spend 61 billion to clean up the pollution 
which thencandidate george bush frequently cited in running against

a man who sued his exgirlfriend to prevent 
her from having an abortion dropped his lawsuit wednesday saying he 
believed she wasnt pregnant 
elton k johnson dropped his lawsuit after learning through a 
variety of sources though not from a medical examination that the 
23yearold woman known as jane doe was not pregnant said his 
attorney richard g whiting 
however the womans attorney said johnson knew no more about her 
clients condition wednesday than when he began his court fight last 
week 
theyve dropped the case we take the position that that is 
a victory said attorney victoria eslinger 
the withdrawal nullified a court order barring the woman from 
seeking an abortion canceled a lexington family court hearing on 
the lawsuit scheduled for thursday and left ms eslingers client 
free to do what she wished 
ms eslinger said the woman was extremely relieved by 
johnsons decision the woman still refuses to say whether she is 
pregnant or not her attorney said 
whiting asked the woman to take a pregnancy test but she refused 
johnson and the woman had a threemonth relationship that ended a 
month ago but johnson had wanted her to carry the fetus to term if 
she was pregnant ms eslinger said 
on aug 23 johnson won the temporary restraining order which 
had been set to expire next monday 
ms eslinger said the withdrawal of the lawsuit vindicated her 
belief that the family court did not have jurisdiction in the case 
and affirmed what she said was a womans right to terminate a 
pregnancy in the first three months 
whiting countered that the case did not need to proceed once 
johnson became convinced the woman was not pregnant i dont think 
this particular case ended up being a test on any issue because it 
was stopped he said 
steven bates executive director of the south carolina chapter of 
the american civil liberties union said the lawsuit appeared to be 
part of a concerted effort by antiabortion activists to alter the 
law 
this is guerilla warfare by the righttolifers bates said 
there is no legal basis for bringing these actions 
whiting said johnsons motives were sincere this case was not 
brought for publicity reasons he said predicting the us 
supreme courts july decision expanding the states right to limit 
abortion could spark similar cases

for men who think fumbling with a tie each 
morning is a pain in the neck here comes a new wrinkle in the quest 
for a firm symmetrical knot its an insideout style called the 
shelby 
touted as the first new knot for men in over 50 years by a 
midwest clothier the knot was introduced to a minneapolis tv 
anchorman by a viewer who chafed at his lumpy twisted neckwear 
i got sick and tired of looking at his tie every night he 
always had a big knot in it said jerry pratt 92 a retired 
manager for the us chamber of commerce who lives in minnesota 
so in 1986 pratt collared don shelby in the lobby of wcco and 
quick as you can say clipon shared a formula he had used for at 
least 40 years 
the secret is to start with the seams out with a bit of 
sartorial sleightofhand the knot forms securely and the broad 
part flows down the shirt finished side out 
the shorter blade underneath still has the seams and the label 
facing out although it can be clasped with a pin or twisted so the 
seams will turn in its simple to tie and works best with wider 
collars 
pratt as humble as he is meticulous said he stumbled across the 
knot by accident and never thought of it giving it a name through 
decades of secure wear 
one morning i put my tie on inside out i tied it and it 
worked that was it he said in a telephone interview wednesday 
the beauty of it is the knot wont twist to one side or the other 
a tie sets the whole theme of dress if its twisted thats the 
first thing people notice 
joseph m a custom mens clothier in st paul minn learned of 
the knot refined it and established the tiein with shelby it 
printed a fivestep diagram for customers seeking alternatives to 
the bulbous windsor knot or the tightly tapered fourinhand the 
most common knot among american men 
youre getting a balanced knot but its small and precise not 
big and bulky like the windsor said kingford bavender an 
executive with joseph m i made up the cards because i had so many 
customers ask me why does your tie hang so much better than 
mine 
but because the knotting begins with wrongside out purists may 
not like it 
its not for everybody youll never see one of the kennedys 
wearing it bavender said 
the knots newness apparently is legitimate 
the method of creating the shelby doesnt appear in getting 
knotted 188 knots for necks a reference guide for ties 
scarves ascots and cravats distributed by ratti silk mills of como 
italy and used by the neckwear association of america 
however it does resemble a knot called the nicky invented by a 
milanese restaurateur and said to have been the favorite knot of 
former soviet leader nikita krushchev 
its a variation of the nicky but it was not documented 
anywhere ive seen said jerry anderson of the neckwear 
association who notes that 100 million ties are sold each year in 
the united states and american men own an average of 20 ties 
personally it leaves a little too soft a knot for my taste i 
prefer a knot that has more body to it anderson said 
for his part shelby is a bit redfaced at all the fuss 
i really think people notice the knot in your tie about as much 
as the knot in your shoes shelby said i do it because its 
easy to tie you can do it in your sleep and it puts that little 
dimple in the tie automatically 
now im known for the knot people come up to me and say hi 
don how are you nice knot you got there

here are five steps involved in tying the shelby 
knot 
1 start with the tie seamside out with the wide end under the 
narrow end 
2 loop the wide end over and under the narrow end 
3 tighten to take up slack 
4 take wide end across to the right and under the neck loop 
5 thread wide end down through the knot and tighten

in days past weddings in hamad badrs family 
called for the slaughter of 20 sheep but when a brother got married 
three months ago two were sacrifice enough 
the wedding was a victim of the 20month intefadeh or uprising 
against israeli occupation which has squeezed livelihoods and 
altered lives for palestinians throughout the west bank and gaza 
strip 
repeated strikes by palestinian workers curfews imposed by the 
israeli army and a drop in tourism have slashed incomes 
as the economy has declined the jordanian dinar the key 
currency in the occupied lands has plunged in value by 50 percent 
further ravaging savings and paychecks 
badr whose family has owned a fourtable restaurant in 
jerusalems walled old city for 25 years said his business has been 
devastated 
before if you wanted to get food youd have to wait outside 
for half an hour said badr who now closes for the day at noon to 
comply with the orders of clandestine uprising leaders 
today you see in a half an hour we sold only two cocacolas 
nearly all palestinians insist that the struggle for daily bread 
has not weakened their will to resist israeli occupation but the 
dinars recent plunge coincided with a seeming drop of intensity in 
the uprising and an increase in factional squabbling in palestinian 
ranks 
if you are angry and hungry you have to satisfy your hunger 
first explained tarik said who owns a photo shop near badrs 
restaurant 
but he said that rather than forcing an end to resistance more 
violence is the likely result 
an official of israels military government in the occupied lands 
said economic hardship was beginning to be felt in a widespread way 
for the first time but that it was too early to say it would mean an 
end to the uprising 
samir saleh an economist at the west banks bir zeit university 
said palestinian incomes have fallen and buying power is probably 
half what it was when the uprising began in december 1987 
average incomes per capita declined by 25 percent from a 
preuprising level of 1000 a month 
saleh said the falling value of the dinar has disastrous 
effects the currency has been a major means of payment and 
savings for palestinians since jordan lost the west bank to israel 
in 1967 
here people only believed in god and the dinar said nabil 
feidy a money changer on salah aldin st in east jerusalem 
the dinar was worth 3 early last year but fell to less than 1 
in july before recovering recently to about 150 
hospital workers college teachers islamic preachers and tens of 
thousands of private employees still earn wages in dinars and most 
paychecks have not risen as the dinars purchasing power declined 
sheik hassan ali an islamic preacher who dropped by to visit 
badr said he was forced to move his wife and two children out of 
their apartment and into a single room of his fathers house 
my salary is 160 dinars said ali noting that it used to be 
worth about 480 but now is worth 200 
the impact on people here is devastating said feidy the 
money changer the worst part is that people have their dinars in 
jordanian banks and they cant bring them 
in an effort to stem the flow of orders and money from the 
palestine liberation organization israel sharply curtailed travel 
and financial transfers across the jordan river palestinians can 
now bring in only 200 dinars a person per month 
israel has countered a tax boycott by palestinians with increased 
fees on vehicles 
abu jafaar a teacher who has seen his salary cut in half because 
of the frequent strikes and school closures said fees on his car 
have risen to the equivalent of about 700 a year from 80 
he has opened a small grocery store in his home 
the shop is not a way of living but it helps he said

gao yugui and her seven old aunties preside 
over shady willow street like boarding school headmistresses poking 
their noses into everyones business with government blessing 
did someone park their winter coal supply in front of someone 
elses door is a motherinlaw quarrelling with her 
daughterinlaw is a student playing hookey is anyone marrying 
pregnant or getting divorced 
all this and more the 72yearold mrs gao regards as her 
business 
her eightmember committee of retired women and committees just 
like it in every neighborhood of every city in china are the very 
backbone of the communist governments public control system the 
grassroots link in the chain of supervision the committees 
appointed by local authorities are unpaid 
everyone knows me mrs gao said of her 1085family 
neighborhood made up of one main street and seven small alleys 
when people hear old aunty has come its please come in 
many urban chinese are less warm in their descriptions of the 
lao dama old aunties of the neighborhood committees 
regarding them as nuisances at best and dangerous snoops at worst 
during the spring democracy movement when hundreds of thousands 
of beijing students and ordinary citizens poured into the streets to 
march for reform the committees came into their own 
on many streets the old aunties went door to door urging 
residents not to join the protests their armies of political 
activists in red armbands also all retired stepped up patrols of 
the neighborhoods for unusual activity 
after the army used force to clear away the protesters on june 
34 the committees helped search homes for any weapons stolen from 
the army and reported on residents suspected of 
counterrevolutionary activities 
mrs gao kept such good order in her domain that shady willow 
street has been named a model peoplearmy cooperation street 
a circular issued by the party propaganda department declared the 
neighborhood an example of building socialist spiritual 
civilization and said mrs gaos committee showed a firm 
political stand a high degree of socialist consciousness and a 
lofty patriotism 
mrs gao said she had no sympathy for the protesters not even 
for the students whose weeklong hunger strike brought 1 million 
concerned residents into the streets 
its hard to get into college and the government spends money 
to train them she said if their health is ruined how can they 
make contributions to the country 
not one of the neighborhoods 3750 residents not even its 34 
college students took part in the protests she vowed two students 
went to have a look but just once to see the excitement she 
said then they went back to their books checked on daily by her 
and the other old aunties 
some older residents also went to look she conceded but very 
few very few 
mrs gao has lived here many years and all the students know 
her and love her said fan shuyun an official from the local 
subdistrict office so they listen to what she says 
if they dont love her they might well fear her and her fellow 
aunties each day after getting together to read the official 
newspapers and study the latest government order the eight graying 
women split into pairs and divide up the neighborhood visiting 
stayathomes inquring about their health and other news 
mrs gao said it would be impossible for any fugitive student 
leaders to hide in her domain as soon as a stranger hits the 
neighborhood she said we will know right away questions are 
raised is he a friend where is he from did he register with 
police chinese law requires travelers to notify the local police 
station when staying away from home 
the houses on shady willow street are ancient onestory buildings 
built around small courtyards sometimes with a dozen families per 
unit each courtyard has a chief who knows what the families in his 
unit do where they go and who their friends and relatives are mrs 
gao said 
during the spring turmoil she said the chiefs checked up was 
soandso at home today where did he go when did he get back 
if someone took part in the protests the courtyard chief would 
know right away she said 
we cant guarantee everyone tells what they do said district 
official feng xiaomin gently correcting mrs gao its possible 
someone went out for a stroll and didnt say anything 
but nothing happened or they would have been arrested mrs 
gao shot back

manny looks a bit the 
worse for wear suspended in an army warehouse with his stainless 
steel joints and plastic sensors exposed and a dusty black rubber 
mask on his head 
but us soldiers will someday have the mechanical man to thank 
for the effectiveness of their protective clothing 
what we are hoping to achieve is to give the soldier greater 
confidence in the protective materiel he has available to him 
said lothar salomon scientific director at this remote post in 
utahs western desert 
salomon said he realized in 1985 that static mannequins and 
simulated chemicals werent realistic enough to gauge clothings 
protective capacity 
it just occurred to me through various tests and results that 
we should be able to do a better job in the testing of protective 
gear he said 
the idea was born for manny a 28 million robot salomon calls 
the closest thing to a human being possible 
the army sent its specifications to battelles pacific northwest 
laboratories in richland wash which had devised robotics for the 
department of energy to handle radioactive materials 
last november battelle delivered the 5foot11 187pound robot 
which is attached by a mechanical arm at the small of the back to a 
stainless steel control unit housing hydraulics and electrical 
systems 
later this year battelle will ship a hermetically sealed test 
chamber capable of containing such agents as chemical vapors and 
nerve gas said david w bennett technical group leader for 
mechanical systems and robotics 
manny will operate within the chamber in an undisclosed building 
on the 840000acre base where the army tests defenses against 
chemical warfare in the event it becomes a reality despite treaties 
banning it salomon said 
the base obtained permission for such tests in 1982 said 
spokeswoman kathy whitaker 
tests involving biological agents arent planned for the near 
future but they are within the realm of possibility salomon 
said 
a clear plastic molded on forms sculpted in aluminum gives manny 
human shape and electrical heaters keep a skin temperature at 
an even 986 degrees 
even without the outer skin of butyl rubber manny cuts an eerily 
human figure his 38 joints are powered by rotary and linear 
actuators that enable him to walk at 3 mph crouch wave sit stand 
and crawl as guided by a computer program 
the skin is fitted with sensors that can detect penetration of up 
to onebillionth of an ounce of a chemical or nerve agent 
perspiration is achieved by water coursing through capillary tubes 
on the surface of the rubber and moist air is injected at the nose 
and mouth as air bladders in the chest expand and contract 
such realism is necessary to ensure that the stresses of human 
movement particularly on seams wont compromise protective 
material that might be subtly altered by a soldiers breath said 
program manager chuck dewitt 
while toxic substance protection is mannys prime mission the 
robot also is likely to be used to test the spectrum of military 
garb from firefighting gear and flight suits to field uniforms 
dewitt and computer operator jim barnes have spent well over 500 
hours testing mannys systems and writing movement programs 
including a performance the robot gave during a sixweek display at 
chicagos museum of science and industry last winter 
dewitt said manny drew crowds every time he ran through a 
10minute routine of dropkicking a ball walking crouching 
duckwalking and explaining his actions in a clipped electronic voice 
before folding into the pose of auguste rodins sculpture the 
thinker 
in more than 500 hours of testing manny has been damaged only 
once losing a kneejoint shear pin in a collision of his limbs 
said dewitt replacing the pin took 15 minutes 
the army has no plans for a second robot although dewitt said 
the possibility remains open 
i think a lot of it will be based on his performance dewitt 
said personally i think hell do very well but only time will 
tell

gonzalo rodriguez gacha the drug lord who 
owned this town was generous one day and evil the next he gave 
money to adults and toys to children killed people who displeased 
him and had a gallows in his yard 
few residents of pacho would talk with a reporter about the 
billionaire former pig farmer who would pass out 7500 or so when 
he felt good and when he didnt might kill a motorist who got in 
his way 
last week the crackdown on drug traffickers led the army to his 
hometown of 20000 people 50 miles north of the capital bogota 
jaime uscategui ramirez the army colonel who led the raiding 
soldiers said rodriguez gacha was so feared in pacho that when his 
18yearold son went into a bar the doors were closed to everyone 
else until he left the son freddy was arrested last week but his 
father is still at large 
at the main ranch soldiers found 500 dolls wrapped for next 
christmas inside the house and a wooden gallows outside the 
government has confiscated the ranches and other property belonging 
to rodriguez gacha 
president virgilio barco ordered the raids and arrests after 
colombias cocaine barons killed sen luis carlos galan the leading 
presidential candidate and a foe of the drug trade on aug 18 
leaders of the drug cartels are said to own major office 
buildings and hundreds of ranches and their importance to towns 
like pacho is enormous 
the people here will resent it but in the end they will adapt 
to the new situation we had no alternative uscategui said of the 
raids he was interviewed at his headquarters office in one of the 
houses on a horsebreeding ranch rodriguez gacha owned 
resentment is clear in pacho but whether the townspeople will 
adapt is not they make little effort to disguise their hostility to 
outsiders 
this town boomed on saturday nights and restaurants like this 
one were packed said blanca castro a restaurant manager 
speaking to a reporter and a photographer now look you are my 
only customers this town is dead 
for years pacho was owned almost entirely by rodriguez gacha 
most peoples jobs depended on him directly or indirectly 
his word was the real law here said uscategui of the 13th 
army brigade which seized 20 ranches in the pacho area in less than 
a week he said rodriguez gacha owned 18 of the ranches and at 
least 80 percent of the town was his 
he is barely 41 or 42 but he was pachos master and he 
demanded respect for his status uscategui said if a car got in 
his way and the driver did not apologize he was a dead man nobody 
here had the right to protest without putting his own life at 
stake 
government officials say the property seized in the 
antinarcotics campaign which includes 300 ranches houses and 
apartments is worth more than 200 million newspapers value the 
traffickers total property holdings in colombia at 55 billion 
uscategui said rodriguez gacha once tried to change pachos name 
to chihuahua which he also chose for his main estate or hacienda 
but he couldnt get enough support for it from government 
officials 
rodriguez gachas choice of the name chihuahua a state in 
mexico reflected a passion for mexican culture that led friends to 
call him el mexicano 
pistolacho the hacienda canteen was done in mexican and us 
western decor but former employees said it served more scotch gin 
french champagne chilean wine and german beer than tequila or 
mescal 
beside the canteen is a wooden gallows complete with noose it 
does not seem strong enough for a hanging and the colonel said it 
appeared to be a symbol for the owners bandit culture 
whatever it was for it is macabre he said 
pacho soon may feel the pinch of rodriguez gachas absence 
because he distributed money lavishly uscategui said 
we know he gave away some 3 million pesos 7500 daily the 
colonel said he was seen as a benefactor everybody had a job and 
everybody was happy what he gave let him control the 
population 
el mexicano left pacho as a pig farmer in the 1970s and returned 
as a rich man in 1982 he bought up ranches frequently making 
offers nobody could reasonably refuse which uscategui translated 
as sell or die 
he always paid well the colonel said if somebody was 
working elsewhere for say 40000 pesos a month 100 he doubled 
it 
rodriguez gacha even monopolized bus transportation in the 
region his company and its buses also have been seized and 
people in town will complain about bad transportation uscategui 
said 
soldiers found hundreds of christmas gifts in the main house 
including the 500 dolls and dozens of pairs of usmade jeans and 
sneakers 
uscategui said of freddy rodriguez who was arrested along with 
seven bodyguards the population thought no one would dare capture 
him well we did it

state and local governments face increasingly 
difficult budget choices as the growing aids epidemic siphons more 
of their resources according to a privately financed survey 
most states continue to rely heavily on federal money to support 
aids programs but nine including new york california and florida 
are spending more of their own funds this year than they are 
getting in federal grants 
additionally states further down in the ranking of cumulative 
aids cases are increasing their spending to battle the disease by 
10fold or more said the survey by the aids policy center at the 
george washington university 
aids is going to increase the budgetary tradeoffs the states 
must make said mona j rowe who helped conduct the survey paid 
for by the american foundation for aids research 
in fiscal year 1989 states spent about 495 million in 
nonmedicaid funds on aids education prevention testing care 
research and other related activities 
of the total states contributed 252 million from their own 
resources and received 233 million from the federal government to 
spend through state programs the rest came from private sources 
overall the bulk of federal aids spending is handled directly by 
the federal government or is funneled through the national 
institutes of health to private researchers 
the house of representatives has approved 16 billion for aids 
prevention education and research during the fiscal year that 
begins oct 1 that is the level requested by the bush 
administration 
however there is growing emphasis on money for treatment 
especially now that the expensive drug azt has been recommended for 
hundreds of thousands of people who carry the aids virus but dont 
show symptoms of the disease 
patient care is the next frontier for state spending on aids 
especially with new government recommendations encouraging early 
intervention with expensive drug therapies and patient followup 
the survey said 
currently 64 percent of all nonmedicaid funds for aidsrelated 
patient care come from state coffers the survey said 
in a related development 14 activist organizations wrote 
burroughs wellcome co on wednesday to ask for a reduction in the 
price of azt sold only by the north carolinabased drug 
manufacturer 
the letter said that the 8000 annual cost per patient of azt 
will make it difficult to persuade congress to renew a program that 
subsidizes the cost of the medicine for patients who cannot afford 
it 
kathy bartlett a burroughs wellcome spokeswoman said the letter 
springs from a failure to recognize how pharmaceutical companies 
operate 
it is marketed drugs that help pay for all of your research 
she said costs for development marketing and research she added 
are very very high 
she said burroughs wellcome gave 30 million capsules wholesale 
priced at 150 each to the federal government for the azt trials 
also she said the company continues to conduct studies of the drug 
public health officials believe that up to 15 million people in 
the united states are infected with the aids virus as of july 31 
aids had been diagnosed in 102621 americans of whom 59391 have 
died since june 1 1981 according to the federal centers for 
disease control 
federal officials estimate that by the end of 1992 the number of 
reported aids cases in the united states will total 365000 in that 
year alone more than 80000 new cases are expected to be reported 
and 65000 people with aids are expected to die 
most state funds are spent on education testing and counseling 
and patient care spending this fiscal year in these categories for 
the states overall more than doubled from last year the survey 
found 
besides new york california and florida the states spending 
more than they received in federal funds this year are connecticut 
massachusetts minnesota rhode island south carolina and 
washington 
on the other end of the spectrum eight states are relying solely 
on federal funds for aids activities idaho iowa montana north 
dakota south dakota vermont west virginia and wyoming 
the survey did not include aids spending growth rates for 
individual states because of differences in the data collected from 
year to year but rowe said the general trend shows that states with 
lower prevalence rates are increasing their aids spending the 
fastest 
while new york increased its state aids spending by 35 percent 
and california by 31 percent georgia ranked 8th in prevalence 
boosted its state spending 10fold and pennsylvania ranked 7th 
and no 13 washington state each increased their spending 12fold 
she said

fourteen activist aids organizations are urging 
the company that makes azt to cut the 8000ayear cost of the only 
drug approved for use by aids patients 
in a letter wednesday to burroughs wellcome co the groups said 
lowering the cost not only would benefit those patients and their 
insurers already paying for it but would make it easier to persuade 
congress to come up with the millions of dollars needed to supply 
azt to those who cannot afford it 
without a price reduction it is politically more difficult if 
not impossible to secure reauthorization and new funding to finance 
the program needed to provide treatment for all those who need it 
the letter said 
azt is marketed by burroughs wellcome under the brand name 
retrovir 
company spokeswoman kathy bartlett said the letter reflects a 
failure to recognize how pharmaceutical companies operate 
it is marketed drugs that help pay for all of your research 
she said adding that development marketing and research costs 
are very very high 
she said burroughs wellcome gave 30 million capsules wholesale 
priced at 150 each to the federal government for the azt trials 
and continues to conduct research on the drug 
the activist groups said they were heartened by recent trials 
that suggest hundreds of thousands of people infected with the aids 
virus but not yet showing symptoms can benefit from taking azt 
now that the evidence suggests a vastly expanded need for the 
drug the letter said the problems of finding a way to pay for it 
are greatly amplified 
it maintained that a large portion of the total cost in 
researching developing and producing azt was paid by taxpayers 
in effect we have been asked to pay for this drug three times 
first in its initial development next in financing many of the 
studies needed to permit its marketing and finally to buy it from 
you the letter said 
the 14 groups endorsing the letter identified themselves as 
organizations devoted to the welfare of people with hiv among 
the groups were the american civil liberties union aids project 
the gay mens health crisis the aids action council the national 
gay rights advocates the national gay amp lesbian task force and the 
american association of physicians for human rights 
copies of the letter were distributed to louis sullivan the 
secretary of health and human services and to other hhs officials 
along with some members of congress and to the news media 
burroughs wellcome officials have said the company has had to 
invest heavily to test and manufacture the drug but have declined 
to make their precise costs public 
azt was first synthesized under a national cancer institute grant 
in 1964 in 1984 some burroughs wellcome lab tests showed it to be 
effective against some animal retroviruses and the company offered 
it for testing by federal laboratories 
nci scientists proved in 1985 that it was active against the aids 
virus burroughs wellcome then was granted a license to manufacture 
and test the drug the clinical trials were directed by the national 
institutes of health

tim campbell wants to improve third world 
cities by making them smell better 
not only are odors from bad sanitation and bad fuel for cooking 
and heating offensive to the nose theyre unhealthy says campbell 
a senior urban planner for the world bank 
people in karachi pakistans biggest city burn a lot of dung 
and wood in mexico city its wood and charcoal 
that pollutes indoor air in a way that may be related to a range 
of lung diseases tuberculosis and cancer campbell says the 
pollution comes from poor ventilation regardless of the kind of 
fuel 
campbells study environmental dilemmas and the urban poor 
was made public wednesday as part of a more general report called 
environment and the poor development strategies for a common 
agenda 
women and children who spend more time at home are probably 
affected more than men he said 
the adverse effects of household airborne and watercarried 
wastes on child mortality and female life expectancy are of no less 
global proportions than say the destruction of tropical forests 
and in immediate human terms may be the most urgent of all worldwide 
environmental problems campbell wrote 
the bank is the biggest source of aid loans to third world 
countries lending more than 19 billion a year 
dealing with bad smells human waste and indoor air pollution 
will get you a bigger immediate return in human wellbeing than 
many other things we do said john sewell head of the overseas 
development council which published the report 
the council is a private research group financed by foundations 
campbell reported that new kinds of cooking stoves designed for 
third world use have run into trouble because they arent what 
people are accustomed to but he added that they are a good idea 
because a 10 percent improvement of cooking efficiency could save 
millions of tons of wood a year and help solve the health problem 
contain the heat vent the exhausts he advised 
ventilated pit latrines cut down costs by twothirds and standard 
specifications can be reduced to make them cheaper and to use more 
local labor he said 
he called for more research not only on stoves but also on 
toilets that flush when water is poured into them and small 
maneuverable pumps for latrine systems such things may seem second 
class but the people who use them and the donors who provide them 
will learn to appreciate them he said 
shortterm gains in health may come to be valued by the poor as 
much as or more than the loss of status they perceive for having a 
secondclass that is less than standard system for cooking and 
waste disposal he wrote

the oil industry is intensifying its attack on 
a bush administration plan requiring the use of methanol in some 
cars by 1995 to control the growing smog problem in the nations 
most polluted cities 
the american petroleum institute which represents the major oil 
companies has hired consultant thomas austin to speak against 
replacing gasolineburning engines with those capable of running on 
methanol or wood alcohol 
austin a mechanical engineer and former environmental protection 
agency official told reporters wednesday that his research showed 
methanol is no less environmentally harmful than gasoline he also 
contends it is more costly and less safe 
methanol is not an inherently clean fuel he said it is 
just as dirty as gasoline 
the oil industry has voiced strong doubts about methanol since 
bush proposed in june that 500000 cars capable of burning methanol 
be sold by 1995 in cities with the most serious air pollution 
problems and that 1 million be sold each year starting in 1997 
the administration contends that methanolburning cars will help 
reduce the formation of smog because they emit fewer hydrocarbons 
it also says increased use of methanol will reduce the nations 
growing reliance on foreign oil used to make gasoline 
the oil industry which produces about 100 billion gallons of 
gasoline a year has a powerful interest in keeping it the 
predominant transportation fuel 
austin acknowledged that tests show cars running on methanol emit 
fewer poisonous hydrocarbons than those burning gasoline but he 
said the administration has overlooked or discounted research that 
indicates methanolburning engines emit far more formaldehyde a 
chemical that helps form smog 
the major oil companies say they have been researching possible 
uses of methanol as a transportation fuel for years and will 
continue to do so but through their trade association they have 
strongly criticized the bush proposal as too ambitious 
they say more emphasis should be put on researching cleaner 
formulations of gasoline

an infectious swine disease previously found 
only in europe has been confirmed by the agriculture department and 
is being viewed as a possible contributor to recent losses suffered 
by corn belt hog producers 
the disease is a type of leptospirosis caused by 
corkscrewshaped bacteria called leptospires about 180 types of 
leptospires cause disease in livestock said carole a bolin 
veterinary medical officer with usdas agricultural research service 
in ames iowa 
bolin said in a report released here wednesday that the disease 
caused by an organism called bratislava was found in an iowa herd 
the name resulted after the bacterium was isolated in 1953 from a 
hedgehog in bratislava czechoslovakia 
leptospirosis is transmitted primarily by infected urine but the 
leptospires also can pass through the pregnant females placenta to 
the fetus another probable cause of infection is thought to be 
venereal transmission from infected boars 
humans in contact with infected animals or urine can develop 
leptospirosis the report said 
outbreaks of a mysterious syndrome causing stillbirths abortions 
and preweaning death in pigs that began a year ago throughout the 
midwest have prompted usda scientists to look into several possible 
causes including bacterial and viral infection and moldy corn 
bolin said 
bratislava infection is being studied as one possible 
contributing factor to this syndrome she said 
the study was undertaken five months ago at the agencys animal 
disease center in ames under a technology transfer agreement 
with norden laboratories of lincoln neb 
bolin said the next step is to inoculate pregnant sows with 
bratislava to establish absolute proof that the us version 
causes reproductive disease also laboratory tests must be 
conducted to determine the effectiveness of vaccines in pregnant 
sows 
norden is marketing two vaccines under conditional usda licenses 
and is applying for permanent licensing she said 
company scientist joseph c frantz said vaccination with the 
conditionally licensed vaccine protects the animal against 
clinical signs caused by bratislava through one pregnancy he 
recommended vaccination prior to each breeding 
leptospirosis in both animals and humans can be mild or severe 
and is often misdiagnosed the agency said the disease in humans 
has been confused with influenza hepatitis yellow fever 
pneumonia polio meningitis and encephalitis

a partial list of changes in agriculture 
department regulations affecting the care and handling of animals 
for laboratory experiments and other purposes will go into effect 
oct 30 
among the changes will be a requirement that research facilities 
create special committees to assure humane care and treatment of 
animals 
james w glosser administrator of the departments animal and 
plant health inspection service said wednesday that the revisions 
will partially implement amendments to the federal animal 
welfare act passed by congress almost four years ago 
the amendments provide new and stricter requirements to protect 
laboratory animals from undue pain and stress tighten enforcement 
of rules already on the books and revise the list of definitions 
needed to carry out the law 
current regulations define standards for animal use including 
minimum requirements for handling housing feeding watering 
sanitation ventilation shelter and veterinary care 
glosser said the revisions will make the rules for dogs cats and 
nonhuman primates including monkeys more complete and easier to 
understand 
besides requiring research facilities to create special animal 
care committees the new regulations include provisions for 
veterinary care and holding facilities and handling 
the animal welfare act covers most businesses that buy or sell 
warmblooded animals exhibit them and transport them commercially 
rats mice birds horses and farm animals are not covered by the 
regulations 
an agency spokeswoman pat elhinnawy said there are three parts 
to the package of regulatory changes the final decisions announced 
wednesday affect only the first and second parts 
part one includes a definition of terms used in carrying out the 
1985 amendments she said part two relates to the identification 
methods records licensing requirements and other details 
part three which is still under study by the agency will 
include details of the actual standards for federal regulation of 
animal care the space each must have access to food and water 
and other details that affect their routines 
elhinnawy said she didnt know when usda might decide on final 
rules for part three 
federal animal welfare legislation was passed by congress in 1966 
and covered animal dealers who raised dogs and cats for research and 
laboratories conducting research on these animals 
the coverage was broadened in 1970 to include most other 
warmblooded animals used in research exhibited or sold in the 
wholesale pet trade an amendment in 1976 extended to law to include 
the transportation of live animals

antiabortion activists say the outcome of a 
special florida congressional election is a pivotal victory in 
the wake of last months supreme court ruling on abortion 
a leader of the abortion rights movement however said wednesday 
that ethnic issues not abortion fueled state sen ileana 
roslehtinens victory over democrat gerald richman 
ms roslehtinen a republican and the first cubanamerican 
elected to congress defeated richman on tuesday for the seat left 
vacant by the death of veteran democratic rep claude pepper 
ileana could not have won the vote with just the hispanic 
vote sandra faucher director of the national right to life 
political action committee told reporters there is not a 
majority of hispanics in the district 
there had to be other issues involved and we feel that 
definitely the abortion issue played a major factor in the race 
she said ileana roslehtinens win is a pivotal victory for the 
prolife movement 
the supreme courts 54 ruling july 3 which gave states greater 
power to limit abortions appeared on the courts docket as webster 
vs reproductive health services 
kate michelman executive director of the national abortion 
rights action league said abortion was not the issue in the 
florida race 
nothing was an issue there that could supersede the ethnicity 
issue ms michelman said the fact is that no issue even the 
issue of choice could overwhelm the ethnicity issue 
the district is about 40 percent hispanic and unofficial returns 
showed that predominantly latin precincts had turnouts of more than 
60 percent and gave ms roslehtinen majorities of 80 percent to 90 
percent she carried the entire district by a 53 percent to 47 
percent margin 
during the campaign ms roslehtinen 37 said she favored more 
restrictions on abortion richman said he favored more choice 
however with polls indicating most voters supported abortion 
rights the gop candidate said abortion was more of a state 
legislative issue than a congressional issue 
abortion rights leaders have contended that state legislative 
victories in races in california indiana and south carolina 
indicated movement in their direction in the wake of the court 
ruling 
ms faucher however said antiabortion candidates have won in 
races in missouri alabama mississippi georgia and two florida 
legislative districts 
ms michelman denied that abortion was an important issue in 
those races

to compete with universities and industry for 
the best and the brightest the government should be able to hire 
500 worldclass experts for whatever pay the market demands a 
consulting company says 
the wyatt co of philadelphia in what is described as the most 
comprehensive study of the governments salary system also 
recommends supplemental pay for top federal executives in highcost 
cities los angeles san francisco new york and its environs and 
possibly in boston and washington 
the company offered a third idea wednesday for enabling the 
government to compete with private enterprise it wants to let all 
government agencies pay up to 15 percent above normal salaries to as 
many as 5 percent to 10 percent of their employees 
the proposal to set aside normal pay schedules for the top 500 
career posts in government was intended to address a frequently 
cited problem the difficulty of recruiting and retaining officials 
for jobs requiring rare expertise 
such jobs as running the national cancer institute giving 
scientific direction to the national aeronautics and space 
administration or running federal nuclear facilities often are hard 
to fill the government competes with universities and industry for 
those people 
in calling for geographic differentials the wyatt report didnt 
specify their size but it would restrict the differentials to 
professionals and administrators in a limited number of highpay 
areas the only ones specified were the new york region the two 
california cities and possibly boston and washington 
the study said that if all its recommendations were accepted a 
gap of 14 percent still would exist between what the government pays 
its 14 million whitecollar workers and what they could earn in 
private enterprise 
overall the primary problem is that federal salaries have 
fallen so far behind the pay offered by other employers that it is 
difficult to recruit and retain adequately qualified workers in some 
occupations and locations the report said 
these problems will become progressively more severe over the 
next several years 
as a result of the problem the company noted government 
agencies use back door methods to reward employees 
for example attempts to provide competitive pay can take the 
form of grade creep in which workers are promoted to higher 
classifications to get them more money the report noted 
the study was conducted under contract to the office of personnel 
management the proposals would cost 6 billion to implement and the 
changes would require congressional approval 
earlier this month an interagency group from the labor 
department office of personnel management and office of management 
and budget put the pay gap for all civilian government workers not 
just whitecollar workers at 286 percent opm in a separate 
report wednesday agreed with that figure 
the governments advisory committee on federal pay last week 
recommended a pay increase of 10 percent next year to help narrow 
the gap 
the bottom line on federal pay is that the gap has become a 
canyon chairman martin l duggan said 
but on monday president bush in accord with an agreement worked 
out by congressional leaders and administration officials last 
spring recommended an increase of 36 percent to take effect in 
january 
bush also has asked congress to provide increases of 8 percent to 
25 percent to 7900 top federal and military officials 700 
political appointees and 7200 career executives including top 
foreign service officials and threestar and fourstar admirals and 
generals 
most senior federal officials would get 25 percent raises 
matching the 25 percent increase bush has recommended for judges 
cabinet members would go from 99500 a year to 124400 
bush said the increases were needed to address pay deficiencies 
for employees with exceptional qualifications and to make pay more 
competitive at the senior levels of government 
at the same time the president proposed that all members of the 
senior executive service the top levels of career employees be 
required to undergo recertification every three years to prove 
their worth to keep the higher salaries 
upon taking office bush endorsed a recommendation by president 
reagan for a 51 percent increase for members of congress judges and 
federal officials congress bowing to a public outcry rejected the 
idea

sara lee corp is promising to take steps to 
protect 8000 workers in 31 meatprocessing plants from injuries 
caused by repetitive motion and other industry hazards the 
government says 
the agreement announced wednesday by the labor department 
occupational safety and health administration requires the company 
to implement the plan within three years it will affect plants in 
20 states and is the second such agreement between osha and a major 
meatpacker in a year 
sara lee also agreed to pay 20000 in fines and drop its appeal 
of four osha citations issued in november after an inspection of the 
companys hillshire farm plant in new london wis 
those citations were for willful violations of laws limiting 
exposure to cumulative trauma disorders 
sara lee deserves praise for its willingness to recognize the 
ergonomic hazards in the meat industry and to take positive 
stops to control those illnesses throughout its many meat processing 
plants said acting osha head alan c mcmillan 
attempts to reach sara lee for comment were not successful a 
company spokeswoman did not immediately return a telephone message 
the meatpacking industry is considered to be among the nations 
most dangerous with common ailments suffered by workers including 
loss of digits and carpal tunnel syndrome a degenerative nerve and 
muscle disorder that can render hands and fingers inflexible and 
often is attributed to repetitive motion 
the agreement requires sara lee to employ consultants to review 
the processes used in its meat plants that expose workers to 
repetitive motion and other hazards linked to cumulative trauma 
disorders 
if new equipment and other engineering controls cannot be used to 
reduce the potential hazards sara lee will be required to rotate 
workers and take other steps to prevent physical fatigue of certain 
muscles osha said in some cases tests of workers exposed to 
repetitive motion will be required to determine whether their duties 
cause muscle deterioration 
sara lee also agreed to develop training programs for its 
workers supervisors and plant medical personnel proper knife care 
and usage would be among the topics of training for workers osha 
said 
the agreement is similar to one reached in november between osha 
and ibp inc in which the meatpacker agreed to implement similar 
preventive measures at 15 plants

living donors can ethically give up part of their 
livers for transplants but such donations generally should be 
limited to parents supplying organs for their children according to 
guidelines released today 
the proposed rules were developed at the university of chicago 
where doctors hope to perform the nations first such transplant 
transplants involving whole or partial livers taken from the dead 
are now routine in many large medical centers but because these 
organs are in short supply doctors would like to begin 
transplanting parts of organs taken from the living 
the body has two kidneys and these are routinely donated to 
relatives with kidney failure but because the body has only one 
liver this organ cannot be entirely removed for transplantation 
the new surgery would remove one lobe of a healthy persons liver 
and transplant it into an infant with kidney failure the donors 
missing section of liver eventually grows back and in the baby the 
piece of organ grows along with the child 
we believe that from the perspectives of both recipient and 
donor the benefits outweigh the risks and that it is ethically 
appropriate to proceed with a trial of liver transplantation using a 
parent as a living donor wrote dr peter a singer and colleagues 
the doctors published the guidelines which resulted from a 
yearlong series of seminars and discussions in a report in the new 
england journal of medicine 
a team led by dr christoph broelsch of the university of chicago 
surgeons hopes to perform the operation this fall the operation has 
already been done in brazil 
the doctors proposed that the donor should be the childs parent 
or in rare cases a mature sibling or grandparent they said that 
when the donor is related to the recipient the benefits of saving a 
life are most rewarding such transplants also have the best chance 
of succeeding 
one of the childs parents will be asked to sign a consent form 
that states the operation your child will have has never been 
performed 
doctors say that because of the shortage of organs from cadavers 
up to half of all babies who need new livers die while awaiting 
transplants

lured like other visitors to california 
by the warm climate record numbers of exotic insects are invading 
los angeles county and posing an unprecedented threat to the states 
16 billion a year farm economy 
as of july 1185 potentially harmful pests have appeared in 
california including fruit flies and gypsy moths fire ants 
russian wheat aphids japanese beetles mealy bugs and scales 
we are being literally swamped said rosser w garrison a 
county entomologist who supplied the statistics the variety of 
insects is increasing and the sheer number is increasing 
besides the climate los angeles has become a magnet for imported 
insects because of the ease of international travel more than 37 
million foreigners passed through us customs at los angeles 
international airport last year and at least some presumably 
slipped fresh fruit and vegetables past inspectors officials said 
one of the new pests the ash whitefly already has reached 
epidemic proportions in southern california and is racing for the 
states agricultural heartland the san joaquin valley in central 
california 
the city a hub for commerce with asia and south america boasts 
a burgeoning immigrant population with a taste for fruits and 
vegetables from their native countries 
they have friends and family who are sending them a taste of 
home said robert g atkins a deputy county agricultural 
commissioner 
atkins said that although los angeles countys farm production is 
negligible the county acts as the entry for pests to the rest of 
the state the nations leading agricultural producer 
he noted that californias belated response to a mediterranean 
fruit fly infestation drew widespread publicity nine years ago 
eventually costing the state 100 million to exterminate and farmers 
100 million in losses but similar invasions lately have become 
almost mundane 
i hate to stress that because i dont want people to believe 
that the bug is any less dangerous atkins said 
nevertheless three medfly infestations have occurred in the 
county within the last 12 months each costing roughly 1 million to 
eradicate and each drawing comparatively scant public attention 
the countys budget for plant quarantine last year was more than 
784000 an almost 54 percent increase over fiscal year 197778 
officials said 
treatment methods vary for different types of fruit flies but 
early detection is a fundamental strategy made possible by checking 
more than 160000 baited traps set throughout the state 
its almost like battling forest fires garrison said its 
a lot easier to put it out as soon as it gets started 
discoveries of less notorious pests are charted each month by 
garrison whose microscopic scrutiny detected five new types of 
insects in the county last year and three so far this year 
although agriculture officials have established methods of 
dealing with fruit fly infestations other kinds of insects can be 
neither readily identified nor exterminated 
one of the most ruinous new pests the ash whitefly apparently 
hitchhiked to the suburban san fernando valley from europe or the 
middle east it has no natural enemies in california and its numbers 
are exploding 
it is totally out of control atkins said the only thing 
limiting the population is the number of trees they have to eat it 
is expanding as fast as it can and chemical pesticide control is 
just totally not feasible 
although fruit flies which lay their eggs in hundreds of fruits 
and vegetables are like a cancer atkins said the ash whitefly acts 
more like a lowgrade virus it attaches itself to the underside of 
leaves and slowly sucks the life out of trees 
at first agriculture officials were unconcerned because they 
believed the tiny new invader only attacked ornamental trees like 
the ash atkins said 
but they later discovered the ash whitefly thrives in dozens of 
varieties of trees including olive pear apple and peach trees 
to combat the ash whitefly agriculture officials have dispatched 
an entomologist to france and italy to collect several varieties of 
encarsia pinheadsized wasps that are the insects natural enemy 
if tests prove successful millions of the tiny wasps could be 
released come winter though it probably will be years before the 
wasps can significantly reduce the ash whitefly population

the bush administration responding to a 
challenge from panama is outlining to the organization of american 
states today its allegations that gen manuel noriega is engaged in 
drug trafficking 
deputy secretary of state lawrence eagleburgers presentation to 
the 31nation meeting requested by the united states is designed to 
rally opposition to noriega 
so far the oas has taken a cautious approach 
a bland statement issued at a foreign ministers meeting last week 
expressed concern over the situation in panama it hardly matched 
eagleburgers rhetoric the state department official likened 
noriega to adolf hitler 
while foreign minister jorge ritter walked out in protest 
panamanian ambassador romulo escobar betancourt challenged 
eagleburger to document the drug allegations 
the us response was to request todays special session william 
price the acting permanent us representative said the united 
states wanted to present a summary of the evidence and elaboration 
of the united states position on the critical situation in panama 
two florida grand juries have indicted noriega on drugsmuggling 
charges us officials hinted to reporters this week that there is 
more evidence against him 
meanwhile noriega attorney raymond takiff of miami demanded in a 
letter to the oas the right to crossexamine witnesses who appeared 
before the organization 
the letter asked for the opportunity to prove that the 
indictments against gen noriega are motivated politically 
representing nothing more than indictment diplomacy 
margaret tutwiler the state department spokeswoman confirmed 
wednesday that eagleburger would focus on narcotics but she 
declined to offer any details 
the term of panamas provisional president manuel solis palma 
who was handpicked by noriega expires today the bush 
administration and panamanian opponents of the general are concerned 
noriega will name a puppet government and not hold free elections 
the united states has tried unsuccessfully to oust noriega from 
power for 18 months

a radiocontrolled insulin pump implanted in 
diabetics abdomens can free them from injections and may more 
closely mimic the way nature provides the essential hormone 
according to a study published today 
the pump can be programmed to vary the rate at which it releases 
insulin researchers hope this approach will help diabetics get 
better control of their blood sugar levels and avoid the disabling 
complications of their disease such as blindness and kidney failure 
its a significant advance said dr christopher d saudek of 
johns hopkins university where the pump was developed this is 
in my view the first successful longterm experience with 
variablerate implanted insulin pumps 
other implanted pumps tested in recent years have been hindered 
by problems such as clogged lines 
the new pump was tested on 18 diabetics and doctors said it 
generally worked well although four pumps became blocked when 
tissue grew over the catheter that releases the insulin one 
malfunctioned because of a faulty microchip 
doctors can program the pumps to vary the rate at which they 
release insulin throughout the day patients use a handheld radio 
transmitter to command the pumps to give out an extra burst of 
insulin after meals 
while blood sugar control with the pumps was good the doctors 
said that the best solution eventually may be a pump that senses the 
bodys blood sugar levels and releases insulin as its needed 
an estimated 500000 diabetic americans require frequent insulin 
injections because their bodies fail to make enough of the hormone 
that breaks down sugar 
the new pumps manufactured by minimed technologies of sylmar 
calif were tested by saudek and other doctors at johns hopkins and 
the university of california irvine they described the results in 
a report in the new england journal of medicine 
patients used the pump called a programmable implantable 
medication system or pims for all their insulin needs for periods 
ranging from four months to two years except for two who withdrew 
from the experiment because of blocked catheters the doctors said 
that patients have been uniformly happy with their pumps 
the diskshaped pumps implanted in patients abdomens are 3 
inches in diameter and weigh 7 ounces they hold about 2 teaspoons 
of insulin a twomonth supply and can be refilled with a syringe 
the devices have computer memories that will record an hourly 
history of all insulin released during three weeks 
researchers plan soon to test a slightly modified version of the 
pump on more patients 
the expectation is that if these next trials go well we would 
then apply to have the pump generally available to the diabetic 
population saudek said 
the mechanism was based on the design of a device on the viking 
space probe that delivered culture medium to martian soil to see if 
anything would grow in it

the utility industry says consumers in many 
states should be prepared to pay as much as 10 percent more for 
electricity if legislation to curb acid rain becomes law 
the industry contends such legislation will cost more than 55 
billion a year 
environmentalists and analysts at the environmental protection 
agency said the industry cost estimates provided wednesday are too 
high but concede the emission curbs required to reduce acid rain 
will be expensive 
were heartened that their numbers are coming out so close to 
ours said nancy kete senior analyst in the epas office of air 
radiation when asked about the utility industry figures 
she said the epa has estimated industry costs would be about 4 
billion a year when full compliance with the proposed acid rain 
controls go into effect in 2000 
the acid rain curbs are included in legislation before congress 
tightening federal air pollution laws the bush administration 
proposal calls for cutting annual sulfur dioxide emissions the 
chief source of acid rain by 10 million tons mostly from 
coalburning power plants 
the report by the edison electric institute projects industry 
costs as high as 120 billion over a 20year period as a result of 
having to install pollution control equipment and make other 
adjustments to meet the emission curbs required by the legislation 
under some scenarios costs could jump to as much as 71 billion 
a year after 2000 said the industry report acknowledging that was 
a highcost scenario that envisions failure of the 
administrations proposed emissions credit trading scheme and broad 
reliance by utilities on expensive scrubber technology instead 
of fuel switching 
the epas kete said the agency continues to believe that 
utilities will rely less than the industry believes on expensive 
technology opt more for switching from highsulfur to lowsulfur 
coal and make the emissions credit system work 
all of those factors would bring the industry estimates in line 
with the epa cost estimates she said 
according to the industry study about 85 percent of the 
increased costs of complying with the proposed emission curbs would 
be borne by 15 states in the eastern half of the country where 
utilities rely heavily on highsulfur coal to meet their generating 
needs 
utilities in indiana missouri ohio pennsylvania tennessee and 
alabama together will face 44 percent of the annual costs 
nationwide the industry group said the other states in the group 
of 15 are georgia illinois kentucky west virginia florida 
michigan new york north carolina and wisconsin 
the additional costs will result in rate increases of more than 5 
percent in 19 states with the sharpest increases 108 percent to 
173 percent coming in indiana kentucky missouri ohio 
tennessee and west virginia according to the industry study 
the others states facing rates increases of more than 5 percent 
were given as mississippi alabama georgia south carolina 
virginia delaware maryland pennsylvania new hampshire illinois 
wisconsin all 6 percent to 9 percent increase and south dakota and 
north carolina both 51 percent to 59 percent 
thirtysix of the 100 major utilities will have to impose rate 
increases of at least 10 percent the industry group maintained 
kete said the epa has estimated average rate increases as a 
result of the additional pollution control requirements at about 2 
percent with the highest increases in the 5 percent to 6 percent 
range 
dave swanson the industry groups senior vice president for 
energy and environment said costs could be reduced by as much as 30 
percent if congress eliminates provisions for emission caps for 
individual utilities and changes other restrictions he said are 
unnecessarily expensive 
theyre trying to trash the administrations acid rain 
proposal said daniel dudek an economist for the environmental 
defense fund he maintained the legislation already is flexible 
enough to allow utilities to pick sensible alternatives that 
meet the proposed emission standards and still hold down costs

the lyric opera of chicago stung by another 
cancellation from tenor luciano pavarotti said it is no longer 
interested in doing business with him 
pavarotti who has backed out of 26 of his 41 scheduled 
performances with the company this decade has an inflammed sciatic 
nerve and is unable to move extensively on stage manager herbert 
breslin wrote to the lyric 
i think this is going to be very distressing to the ticket 
holders that hes not coming ardis krainik the lyrics general 
director said wednesday after announcing of the ban 
breslin said in telephone interview from new york that he thinks 
miss krainiks reaction is a little bit irrational particularly 
since pavarotti has raised incredible sums of money for the 
lyric in fundraising appearances 
i think she gets the impression that he is doing this out of 
spite for the lyric opera of chicago which is absolutely wrong 
said breslin 
the lyric has sold nearly all its 3550 seats for the season 
during which its celebrating its 35th anniversary 
pavarotti was under contract to perform in puccinis tosca on 
six dates this fall 
i did everything possible to try to convince him to fulfill his 
commitment with us said miss krainik including a suggestion that 
he sing his role from a chair 
his medical problem while certainly a concern is apparently 
not affecting his voice she said 
the singer rejected the idea said miss krainik 
lyric opera is now unwilling to take the risk of one more 
cancellation by mr pavarotti she said 
im not mad or exasperated she said i didnt have any 
choice 
we have 32000 subscribers who over the years have accosted me 
on the street she said a lot of people have been very mad 
about his cancellations 
pavarottis manager wrote that the singer recently was obliged to 
cancel his engagement at the opera in bilbao spain because of the

the food and drug administration has extended 
for two months its deadline for deciding whether to ban red dye no 
3 as a cancercausing food additive 
the agency in announcing the extension wednesday said it has 
been evaluating research data submitted by the certified color 
manufacturers association on the coloring that gives maraschino 
cherries their bright glow 
the fda had been prepared to act by the earlier deadline which 
was wednesday when the house in july passed legislation calling for 
further study of the dye the senate has not yet acted on the 
legislation 
since 1960 when congress called for a ban on foods that cause 
cancer in laboratory animals red dye no 3 and other additives have 
been on a provisional list that allowed them to stay on the market 
for an additional two years pending further study 
since then the fda has granted dozens of extensions of the 
provisional listing 
the manufacturers association says the dye is not a primary cause 
of cancer and causes tumors only when used in doses higher than 
would ever be consumed through its use as a food coloring

vietnam and cambodia are to blame for the 
failure of a 19nation peace conference on cambodia to forge an 
agreement over how to end the conflict between rival warring 
actions the bush administration says 
a state department officials on wednesday reiterated the 
administrations reluctant support for a khmer rouge role in a 
transitional government 
the collapse of the conference launched in late july in paris by 
secretary of state james a baker iii and other foreign ministers 
could result in intensified fighting between government forces and 
an anticommunist resistance that includes exiled cambodian leader 
prince sihanouk and khmer rouge elements 
when baker flew to paris to kick off the conference it was 
recognized that it could take months to reach a compromise but 
there was guarded optimism the bloodletting might be ended with 
diplomacy 
cambodian prime minister hun sen who hopes to retain power after 
the scheduled withdrawal of 26000 vietnamese troops from cambodia a 
month from now strenuously objected to any role for the khmer 
rouge who were ousted in an invasion by vietnam in 1978 and still 
have chinas support 
the khmer rouge under thenleader pol pot is believed 
responsible for the massacre of at least 1 million cambodians from 
1975 to 1978 
margaret tutwiler the state department spokeswoman registered 
unalterable us opposition to the khmer rouge returning to power 
but she said the united states would continue to support sihanouk if 
he believed that khmer rouge elements along with members of the 
phnom penh government should have an interim role

the cozy relationship between private arms 
sellers and the defense ministry is at the heart of a debate over 
the need for controls on arms merchants and israeli officers who 
reportedly trained hitmen for colombian drug lords 
israel is a small country everybody who was a colonel or 
brigadier general in the army has very intimate contacts with the 
defense establishment said ehud olmert minister of arab affairs 
in the cabinet and a rightwing likud bloc member 
the question is what is the involvement of the defense 
ministry it is one of the questions that will be investigated 
olmert said 
the leftleaning daily davar newspaper in an editorial said it 
was inconceivable that the security establishment didnt know what 
was going on in colombia 
defense minister yitzhak rabin however told reporters the 
ministry did not learn of the training until april when it issued a 
written warning to the company involved 
there are those who are not obeying the law but i believe the 
number of people who have not obeyed the law is very very 
limited israeli mercenaries are basically nonexistent rabin 
said 
prime minister yitzhak shamir once a senior official in the 
mossad intelligence service promised a thorough investigation but 
expressed skepticism about whether israelis knowingly helped drug 
gangs 
i know our officers and i cannot believe that they would have 
been involved in such crimes shamir said 
conservatives in parliaments law committee blocked a move by 
liberals to tighten existing controls that make it a crime 
punishable by six months in jail for a reservist to sell weapons or 
give training without authorization 
urging more control labor party lawmaker david libai said on 
israel radio it cannot be that we train people to kill in the 
army for the sake of our country and that later people use it for 
their own personal profit without any control 
however eli landau mayor of the tel aviv suburb herzlia 
defended the reservists accused of helping drug kingpins with a 
wave of their hands they forgot the 20 years in which you and your 
friends risked your lives for us all he wrote in an ad in israeli 
newspapers 
industry minister ariel sharon former defense minister and 
general criticized the debate over the colombian affair 
there is certainly not one man among us who would want to see 
israelis linked to drug deals but nothing has been proven nobody 
has been tried we with our own hands are turning israel into the 
one responsible for drugs in colombia sharon said today 
we are talking about our army officers we are talking about 
people who risked their lives for years who served the armys best 
units what has been proven about them to this day is that they are 
firstrate fighters nothing else sharon added 
the closeknit nature of the relationship between officialdom and 
private arms merchants shows up in the israel defense sales 
directory the ministrys annual catalogue lists government arms 
makers sidebyside with private companies that arrange sales of 
weapons or services 
among the companies is hod hahanit spearhead which describes 
itself as specializing in fighting terrorism by establishing and 
training antiterror units internal security and intelligence 
forces presidential guard units and vip security 
the company is headed by reserve lt col yair klein who 
associates say was once an instructor in a parachute course headed 
by dan shomron now israels chief of staff 
former commander of an elite antiterror unit klein is the focus 
of a police probe of the colombia affair in which six former 
officers have been questioned so far 
at one point klein threatened to blow the whistle on other 
highranking officers and at least one member of parliament who he 
sugggested were involved in unauthorized arms dealings in latin 
america 
two rightwing members of parliament yehoshua saguy and rehavam 
zeevi said they had been in colombia on armsrelated business but 
only with government authorization 
yoram perry a military historian and journalist said in an 
interview that the colombia affair was an outgrowth of too close a 
relationship between those still in uniform and their retired army 
buddies 
the crux of the issue is the social relationship between those 
who are now in power and those who do a job overseas they are 
friends they say i know this guy hes not going to deal in 
something to do with narcotics so they believe there is no need to 
formalize ways of control perry said 
many israelis especially conservatives argue that israel was 
only marketing skills it had honed in repeated wars with the arabs 
its a central fact that israel has something that people 
want zeev chafets a former government press office director 
said in an interview 
its no more exceptional than people who want to buy saudi oil 
or swiss watches it just happens to be what weve got to export 
israels arms exports have totaled more than 1 billion since the 
mid1980s a reported 350 million in kfir warplanes galil rifles 
communications equipment and other hardware has gone to colombia the 
past decade

leona helmsley the queen of a 5 billion empire 
who stood accused of even billing 8 worth of underwear as a 
business expense showed no emotion upon her conviction of evading 
12 million in federal income taxes 
after wednesdays verdict juror michael clark said the jury 
decided to acquit mrs helmsley of the most serious charge 
conspiracy to commit extortion because they were unclear on what 
constituted extortion 
a lot of the people thought that you had to get your legs 
broken to get extorted and this sounded mild clark said there 
were a number of jurors who felt very uncomfortable with the 
definition 
the charge which carried a 20year sentence alleged that the 
69yearold mrs helmsley and her aide frank turco conspired to 
extort payoffs and goods from vendors doing business with the 
helmsley organization which has farflung real estate holdings 
including some of new yorks most luxurious hotels 
after a twomonth trial and five days of deliberation the jurors 
convicted mrs helmsley of 33 of 41 counts including conspiracy to 
defraud the internal revenue service tax evasion and other tax 
fraud charges 
her codefendants former aides turco and joseph licari were 
convicted of assisting in the taxevasion scheme turco also was 
acquitted of extortion conspiracy all three were acquitted on mail 
fraud charges 
each of the 33 counts against mrs helmsley carry a maximum 
prison term of three or five years she also could be fined nearly 
8 million sentencing before us district judge john walker jr 
was scheduled for nov 14 
interviews of 15 prominent lawyers by manhattan lawyer magazine 
about walkers sentencing reputation indicated that mrs helmsley 
was unlikely to avoid prison 
mrs helmsley described as a persnickety queen in helmsley 
hotel ads was depicted at the trial as arrogant pennypinching and 
meanspirited even her own lawyer described her as a tough 
bitch 
after listening to the litany of guilty verdicts mrs helmsley 
a onetime chesterfield cigarette girl and successful model sat in 
the courtroom and conferred with lawyers and family for an hour 
she then left the courthouse by the front steps where she was 
surrounded by hundreds of photographers camera crews reporters and 
bystanders she got into a limousine and departed without comment 
even as she was taunted by some 
how do you feel leona one shouted inquiring peasants 
want to know 
on abctvs nightline clark called the hoopla surrounding 
the trial sickening after he read newspapers a friend saved for 
him 
the whole thing has been a sickening experience the press 
the television the people on the street he said 
mrs helmsleys lawyer gerald feffer said the conviction would 
be appealed 
us attorney benito romano said the convictions were a deterrent 
to anyone considering cheating on their taxes 
its an opportunity to remind the public and we need reminding 
every now and then that the law applies equally to everyone he 
said 
mrs helmsley and her husband harry still face prosecution on a 
state indictment alleging evasion of state taxes no trial date has 
been set 
helmsley 80 was charged in the april 1988 federal indictment 
but was not tried because the judge found him mentally incompetent 
in finding mrs helmsley guilty the jury decided she had evaded 
12 million in taxes most of it by billing 31 million in 
expenses for the helmsleys greenwich conn mansion to the 
helmsley business 
prosecutors also charged that 320172 in mrs helmsleys 
personal purchases including thousands of dollars in designer 
clothing and 8 for underwear were charged to the park lane hotel 
one of several helmsley hotels in manhattan 
many of the 44 prosecution witnesses added to the harsh personal 
portrait they described how she fired employees at the slightest 
provocation disputed bills and always sought the lowest price 
her former housekeeper testified that mrs helmsley once told 
her we dont pay taxes only the little people pay taxes 
feffer sought to discredit the witnesses as disgruntled 
exemployees he argued that the helmsleys did nothing wrong in 
billing their companies for part of their mansion expenses because 
they used the estate for business

the three denominations that merged last 
year into the evangelical lutheran church in america proved this 
week in their first national legislative assembly that they could 
work well together leaders said 
the predominant spirit by far was one i would characterize as a 
strong mixture of joy and commitment the churchs president 
bishop herbert w chilstrom told reporters at the end of the 
assembly wednesday 
he said the 1041 delegates demonstrated that it was right for 
us to be together 
the 53millionmember denomination was formed by the combination 
of the largely eastern and urban lutheran church in america and the 
largely midwestern and rural american lutheran church and the 
association of evangelical lutheran churches 
the diverse composition resulted in some difficult debates on 
social concerns 
in the final session the assembly adopted resolutions urging 
support for striking appalachian coal miners and charging israel 
with abuse of palestinians the assembly also supported us 
economic sanctions against south africa to pressure it to end 
apartheid 
not everyone was happy about the nations fourthlargest 
protestant denomination entering such political matters 
its a political sideshow sugggesting church people have a 
telephone line to god protested the rev john sorum of portland 
nd its pointless and ineffective he said it abandoned 
faith for a political gospel 
bishop kenneth sauer of columbus ohio defended the apartheid 
resolution saying its clear support for the cause of justice 
bishop william lazareth of new york city said it was demanded by 
the whole word of god 
the lord we proclaim is the word of god he said we do 
have a political law which is part of gods holy word 
the legislative sessions were preceded and followed by worship 
hymns and bible study 
chilstrom said the assemblys overwhelming decisions to be part 
of two major ecumenical bodies the national council of churces and 
world council of churches were signs of maturity 
he also said he was impressed with the diverse makeup of the 
delegates who included blacks hispanics asians and american 
indians although the church is predominantly white 
historically i think we are the first church constructed with a 
mandate to become more inclusive he said 
of the churchs demand that its pension board rapidly get rid of 
an estimated 85 million in stocks in companies doing business in 
south africa chilstrom said 
setting a date to be completely divested could be a problem for 
the board of pensions but he added we are 100 percent agreed 
that apartheid must be dismantled 
in the israelipalestinian matter the church confessed past 
sinful complicity against jews but said peace in the middle 
east demanded an end to abuses against palestinians along with 
selfdetermination for palestinians and security for israel 
a bellevue wash delegate mb kahn unsuccessfully sought 
elaboration of lutheran complicity in 400 years of persecution 
terror and formation of antijewish attitudes 
the added selfcriticism was not included but the rev roger m 
imhoff of mount kisco ny urged sensitivity on that matter in 
church educational material saying some in the past tends to be 
antisemitic 
the lutherans also passed a resolution of concern for about 2000 
coal miners striking against the pittston coal group which has 
sought to impose contract concessions it says it needs to compete 
abroad 
the rev philip huber of wardensville wva called the 
situation a model of colonialism that oppresses its own people 
and urged something to alleviate human suffering

when overweight youngsters switch from highsalt to 
lowsalt diets their blood pressures fall dramatically but the 
change in food has no effect on normalsize youngsters a study 
published today shows 
the work suggests that fat youngsters are more susceptible to the 
damaging effects of a highsalt diet this helps explain why 
overweight people are especially prone to get high blood pressure 
doctors have long known that people who lose weight also lower 
their blood pressure the latest work shows that mild sodium 
restriction also results in a significant drop in blood pressure 
even when people remain overweight 
in this study we found that the blood pressure of obese 
adolescents is sensitive to dietary sodium intake whereas the blood 
pressure of nonobese adolescents is not the researchers wrote 
they theorized that overweight people get high blood pressure 
because their bodies are less efficient at getting rid of salt 
the study was directed by dr albert p rocchini of the 
university of michigan medical center in ann arbor and published in 
the new england journal of medicine 
the researchers studied 60 obese and 18 normal youngsters who 
ranged from age 10 to 16 they spent two weeks on a highsalt diet 
and two weeks on a lowsalt diet 
at the start of the study the overweight youngsters blood 
pressures were 19 points higher than the normal childrens after 
the lowsalt regimen the obese youngsters fell 12 points while 
the normal childrens rose one 
thirtysix of the overweight children went on weightloss diets 
and dropped an average of 17 pounds at the lower weights their 
blood pressures were no longer sensitive to salt

drug traffickers retaliatory campaign against the government but 
few say they sense any imminent personal danger 
nonetheless some are packing their bags 
i love colombia but i just cant live here right now martha 
reyes who has lived in the country 18 years said wednesday in a 
telephone interview 
she said other factors contributed to her decision to leave next 
week with her three daughters but that the latest wave of violence 
just topped it off 
the us state department on wednesday recommended that americans 
in colombia leave the country to avoid being caught up in the 
violence the us embassy ordered the evacuation of all embassy 
dependents apparently for fear of becoming the targets of the 
ruthless cocaine cartels 
traffickers are lashing out because of a government 
antinarcotics offensive that has included a nationwide manhunt and 
the confiscation of more than 200 million in drug barons property 
part of the campaign sparked by the aug 18 assassination of 
popular presidential candidate sen luis carlos galan included 
renewal of an extradition treaty with the united states traffickers 
are known to greatly fear extraditon to the united states 
mrs reyes married to a colombian said she planned to spend a 
year in the united states with her daughters her husband an 
economist with a private company in bogota plans to stay behind for 
now but will look into job possibilities in the states she said 
she said she felt no direct threat but admitted the tension of 
colombia gets really tiring 
a change of scene would also be welcome she said 
id like to see something different for a year mrs reyes 
said who knows i may be back in a year it may be too quiet for 
me over there 
at bogotas american school summer vacation ended tuesday on 
the first day of classes all students were assembled and the 
headmaster told them to assure their parents special security 
measures were being taken 
one teacher said the measures included constant contact between 
the school the us embassy and the bogota mayors office strict 
measures to keep unauthorized people off campus and checks on any 
cars parked on the schools perimeter the school has always 
employed guards and watchmen 
the teachers are all there working with confidence and calm and 
without fear she said asking not to be identified by name we 
dont feel any particular threat to americans 
on the other hand there arent many of us left she added 
of the schools 1400 students less than 10 percent are us 
citizens she noted 
the american community shrank dramatically in late 1984 when 
extradition of drug traffickers to the united states began angry 
cocaine cartel bosses threatened to kill five americans for every 
dealer who was extradited to america for trial 
a bomb exploded outside the downtown us embassy killing a 
female colombian passerby 
hundreds of americans fled to the states many of them executives 
in us companies that before the drug violence had been frequent 
targets of the countrys wellentrenched leftist guerrilla 
organizations some eventually trickled back but many returned only 
long enough to pack their furniture 
the us embassy then established its policy of barring 
dependents under 18 years of age 
recalling those frightening times the oftrepeated refrain among 
those who remain now is its been worse 
theres been many incidents over the last few years said

monday but then fell a total of 120 yen in the next two days

today after rallying sharply in new york late wednesday 
the rally was triggered by speculation that us monetary 
authorities would allow the dollars upswing as long as the us

market too aggressively before the release of the latest us 
unemployment figures due out in washington friday said the bank of

a former textile worker was executed for 
raping and murdering the 61yearold woman he stabbed 42 times with 
a butcher knife in her farmhouse 12 years ago 
alton waye 34 was put to death in the electric chair at the 
state penitentiary late wednesday 
the sentence was carried out following a day of appeals that 
ended with the us supreme court voting 72 against postponement 
justices william j brennan and thurgood marshall who oppose the 
death penalty under all circumstances voted for a reprieve 
earlier gov gerald l baliles denied clemency for waye 
waye was baptized tuesday night and took communion before the 
execution 
in a final statement he said i would express that what is 
about to take place is a murder i dont hate anyone i forgive 
everyone involved 
waye was convicted of murdering lavergne b marshall a widow who 
authorities testified had been beaten beyond recognition when her 
nude body was found in a bathtub in 1977 she had been bitten as 
well as stabbed and the killer had poured laundry bleach on the 
body according to testimony 
amnesty international argued that waye should have been spared 
the death penalty because he is borderline mentally retarded 
defense attorneys offered new evidence showing brain damage and 
diminished mental capacity 
richard h burr a lawyer from the naacp legal defense and 
educational fund in new york told an appeals panel that waye was 
deprived of an adequate psychiatric evaluation when he was tried in 
1978 
deputy attorney general linwood wells argued that the defense 
should have raised such objections earlier 
waye was the eighth person to be put to death in virginia since 
the state resumed executions in 1982 and the 117th nationwide since 
the us supreme court allowed states to resume capital punishment 
in 1976 
about 50 opponents of the death penalty held a candlelight vigil 
wednesday night outside the prison and about 20 supporters of 
capital punishment gathered on a sidewalk across the street 
as far as the victim goes i have sympathy for the family but 
as far as the guy goes i believe people can change said mirella 
neff 24 who was at the vigil with her 2yearold daughter 
across the street joe jackson of richmond said you cant let 
them get away with murder if i committed a crime like he did i 
would deserve to die 
sue stone of lunenburg county who was a close friend of mrs 
marshall said she had had no reaction to wayes execution 
with anyone being killed the way she was you never get over 
it she said by telephone you try to come to terms with it 
through the years we were very very close and for a person as 
good as she was a religious woman a gentle woman its hard to 
accept

week agreed that the contacts were proper and prosecutors who have 
reviewed deans actions have not alleged any wrongdoing the times 
said 
dean executive assistant to former housing secretary samuel r 
pierce jr from 198487 has refused to testify before congress 
citing the fifth amendment the appearance before the grand jury 
sitting in jackson miss was several months before dean became a 
central figure in allegations of influence peddling and political 
favoritism at hud 
the times obtained a transcript of the grand jury testimony 
a lawyer for dean joseph e digenova told the times her 
statements and other recently disclosed evidence establish beyond 
doubt that miss dean was not an independent operator but rather was 
acting under direction and with authorization 
two officials in the reagan white house told the times they had 
asked hud to give close attention to specific grant applicants but 
said the contacts were routine and that the white house never 
ordered hud to finance the projects 
according to the transcript dean said politics was discussed in 
awarding money under the urban development action grants program 
that lawmakers often contacted her to promote projects for the 
program and that the white house intervened in at least onequarter 
of the successful grant applicants 
the grand jury was investigating allegations of local corruption 
involving hud money and a hotel project in biloxi 
dean acknowledged in her testimony that a grant awarded to biloxi 
in 1987 probably would not have been approved without a white house 
request that it be given special attention 
before you could pretty much have guessed biloxi miss would 
not get a udag she said 
the grand jury investigation led to the indictment of a former 
biloxi mayor gerald blessey on charges he conspired to divert 
160000 of the hud grant the mayor is now on trial in federal 
court in biloxi

obese women are six times more likely than 
normalsize women to get gallstones but being even slightly 
overweight increases the risk a study published today concludes 
although researchers have long known that overweight people are 
more likely to get gallstones the new results show that the problem 
gets progressively worse as women grow fatter 
these data suggest that even a slight excess of weight may be 
an important determinant of the increased risk of gallstones in 
middleaged women wrote the studys authors 
the analysis conducted by dr k malcolm maclure of the harvard 
school of public health was based on a health survey of 88837 
female nurses the results were published in the new england journal 
of medicine 
about 475000 americans undergo surgery each year for painful 
gallstones and the problem is twice as common among women as men 
the study shows that middleage womens risk of gallstones 
increases if they put on weight during their middle years it also 
linked the disease with teenage obesity 
the researchers assembled their statistics by computing womens 
relative weight their weight divided by the square of their 
height women whose relative weights were more than 32 kilograms per 
square meter were six times more likely to have gallstone disease 
than were those whose relative weights were below 20 
for those who were slightly overweight relative weights of 24 
the gallstone risk was 70 percent higher than for trim women 
drinking alcohol appeared to reduce the risk of gallstones

the leader of japans largest opposition 
party said in an interview published today that if she became prime 
minister she would ban us nuclear weapons from japan 
the sydney morning herald newspaper said such a policy might 
force the us navy to abandon many of its operations in the 
northwest pacific and it quoted us and japanese officials as 
saying it could damage the alliance between the nations 
takako doi chairman of the japan socialist party was quoted as 
telling the newspaper that the united states had pledged to consult 
with japan before carrying nuclear weapons into its territory and 
that it was time to enforce the agreement 
the popular ms doi could become prime minister if the governing 
liberal democratic party loses its control of parliament in an 
upcoming general election and the socialists are able to forge a 
coalition with other opposition parties 
once the us has promised it must observe its promise the 
morning herald quoted her as saying it is a matter of principle 
japan must face up to its responsibilities and hold diplomatic 
negotiations with the united states 
japan cannot admit from any country ships carrying nuclear 
weapons 
ms doi said she was prepared to pursue the policy even if it 
denied the us navy the ability to operate in the parts of the 
pacific 
the herald said the united states has ignored its pledge and 
routinely carries nuclear weapons into japanese territory on ships 
the united states refuses to publicly confirm or deny whether its 
ships carry nuclear weapons such a policy has affected its 
relations with new zealand which has denied us ships suspected of 
carrying nuclear warheads entry to its ports 
the herald quoted a us diplomat as saying a policy such as the 
one promoted by ms doi would have a tremendous impact on our 
strategic posture and would be tantamount to an abrogation of 
the japanus security treaty 
it quoted a japanese defense official as saying the change would 
produce a breakdown in the japanus relationship and be a very 
serious source of instability in the region neither official was 
identified 
japan the only nation to have suffered atomic attacks maintains 
a policy of not manufacturing storing or allowing nuclear weapons 
to be introduced into the country

a carpenter said he is bitter after spending 
18 months in jail for having oral sex with his wife and maintained 
his fiveyear sentence for violating georgias sodomy law was an 
unfair result of a domestic dispute 
james d moseley 35 left the metro correctional institution on 
wednesday afternoon after dekalb county superior court judge robert 
castellani granted a motion to free him on his own recognizance 
pending appeal or dismissal of the charges 
sodomy even between consenting married adults is a felony in 
georgia under a 156yearold law recently upheld by the us supreme 
court 
sure im bitter moseley said after being released 
he said faith in humankind kept his spirits up adding i knew 
someone would see this thing as it really was 
he said he will contact the carpenters union about a job as soon 
as possible 
the state he said gave him 25 i guess to start my life 
over 
the case against moseley began when bette roberts his commonlaw 
wife of four years complained to authorities in february 1988 that 
he had raped and forcibly sodomized her the couple has since 
divorced 
moseley denied ever using force to have sex saying i only did 
what she wanted me to do and then she used it against me to get 
custody of the kids he said he was granted no rights to visit his 
sons 
moseley was acquitted of rape and forcible sodomy but in 
testifying in his own defense he admitted on the stand that he had 
had oral sex with ms roberts the jury found him guilty of sodomy 
without aggravation a lesser charge that means oral or anal sex 
with consent 
some jurors later expressed shock when moseley was sentenced to 
five years in prison he is believed to be the first person 
convicted under the sodomy law for conduct between marriage partners 
clive stafford smith an attorney with the american civil 
liberties union argued that the georgia law violates constitutional 
rights to privacy he accused prosecutors of hypocrisy for ignoring 
his request that they disqualify themselves if they ever had engaged 
in oral sex 
mary beth westmoreland a senior assistant attorney general 
representing the state argued that privacy was not the issue 
because the wife made the criminal complaint 
its not a matter of police peeking in windows thats not what 
is before this court she argued

game show host and animal rights crusader bob 
barker has been slapped with a 10 million libel lawsuit by the 
american humane association and its west coast director 
the action filed in superior court wednesday contends barker 
and other animal rights organizations conducted a twoyear campaign 
to ruin the reputation of the association and its regional director 
betty denny smith 
the lawsuit claims barker falsely stated on radio shows that the 
association allowed muzzling of two dogs and approved a fight 
between the animals on the film the tender which would have 
been illegal 
barker also claimed the association lied on its reports of an 
investigation of cruelty against chimpanzees during production of 
the film project x the lawsuit says 
barker denied the allegations 
if this suit results in the american public becoming more aware 
of the extent of animal cruelty in entertainment then the suit will 
have served a very valuable purpose and it will be well worth the 
money and the time it costs me he said 
the lawsuit accuses barker united activists for animal rights 
and its executive director nancy burnet of libel slander trade 
libel interference with prospective business relations conspiracy 
and falselight invasion of privacy association attorney barry 
langberg said 
no one is saying mr barker isnt an animal rights activist 
langberg said at a news conference were only saying he has other 
things on his schedule than the protection of animal rights 
a separate claim was filed against the city and department of 
animal regulation head robert i rush for allegedly assisting barker 
in the campaign langberg said 
i havent even seen it said rush but the conduct of this 
office in the past has been beyond reproach and it is currently 
beyond reproach the claim will be discussed with the city attorney 
and a response will be made 
telephone calls to ms burnet and the united activists seeking 
comment were met with repeated busy signals 
ms smith said it was unfortunate the situation resulted in a 
lawsuit since both parties want to protect animals 
it is sad and it has wasted a lot of our time but we are not 
the ones doing the attacking she said weve been trying to get 
our work done we didnt want to take it this far but these have 
been vicious attacks 
the association was founded in 1877 for the protection of animals 
and children and the west coast regional office has been active in 
protecting animals in the entertainment industry 
barker longtime host of the television game show the price is 
right said he has never been sued before 
in 1987 he won the highest award given by the american society 
for the prevention of cruelty to animals that same year he quit 
after 19 years as host of the miss usa pageant because contestants 
wore fur coats

the government said today that at least 86 of the 
nearly 2000 boat people who have arrived in japan over the last 
three months were chinese jobseekers posing as vietnamese 
a foreign ministry spokesman said its united nations bureau 
director in a meeting today with a chinese embassy official asked 
china to investigate the matter and take measures to stop the 
illegal entries of chinese into japan 
the foreign ministry said japanese immigration officials 
determined that at least two of the 86 were carrying fake vietnamese 
birth certificates 
ministry officials said 1919 boat people have arrived on 14 
vessels many of them barely seaworthy since may that figure 
contrasts sharply with the 219 refugees from vietnam who arrived in 
japan in all of 1988 
on wednesday japan issued its first deportation order for 
chinese who came to the country pretending to be refugees from 
vietnam 
the first order was for xu weiming 30 who admitted he boarded a 
vietnamese refugee boat in hopes of finding a job in japan said 
hideo daian spokeman of the justice ministrys immigration office 
in fukuoka on the southernmost main island of kyushu 
xu considered an illegal immigrant was among six chinese 
discovered among 107 vietnamese who arrived in southwestern japan 
aboard a wooden boat on may 29 daian said 
meanwhile chief cabinet secretary mayumi moriyama said today 
that japan would tighten screening of the boat people to cope with 
the refugee problem 
japan has decided it will accept only refugees from political 
persecution and not economic migrants but officials say details of 
the screening policy remain to be worked out

china today blamed vietnam for the failure of the 
cambodian peace conference and questioned whether its rival would 
make good on a promise to pull its troops out of cambodia by the end 
of september 
the monthlong international conference ended wednesday night in 
the french capital without an agreement to halt fighting among 
cambodias vietnaminstalled government and three guerrilla 
factions which united as a coalition for negotiations at the 
conference 
the delegates from 19 countries and the united nations agreed to 
suspend the meeting and come back when the warring parties were more 
willing to compromise 
prince norodom sihanouk leader of the coalition and one of its 
three factions called for patience in ending the 19 years of 
fighting in his nation 
cambodian prime minister hun sen blamed the khmer rouge the 
strongest of the three resistance groups for sabotaging the 
negotiations he predicted it would begin a new round of killing 
after the vietnamese troops pull out 
they are striving for victory on the battlefield and did not 
have the slightest intention of striving for a political 
arrangement he said wednesday 
but china which backs the khmer rouge blamed the stalled 
negotiations on the intransigence of vietnam and phnom penh 
authorities foreign ministry spokesman li zhaoxing said in 
beijing 
despite the lack of an accord vietnam will complete the 
withdrawal of its 26000 troops by sept 27 as planned hun sen said 
chinas official xinhua news agency quoted vice foreign minister 
liu shuqing as saying in paris that china did not believe that 
vietnam showed no sincerity at the conference liu said 
the main obstacle was the insistence by vietnam and hun sens 
government that the khmer rouge be barred from any future coalition 
government 
the khmer rouge the strongest of three guerrilla forces is 
blamed for the deaths of hundreds of thousands of deaths during its 
fanatical rule from 1975 to 1978 when vietnam invaded the country 
foreign ministers roland dumas of france and ali alatas of 
indonesia the chairmen of the conference said they will begin 
consultations within six months with the cambodian factions in hopes 
of reconvening the meeting 
we will come back to paris sihanouk said the problem is 
complicated we must be patient

syrian and christian forces battled with 
artillery and tanks around beirut today killing two people and 
wounding 16 police said 
a proiranian moslem cleric was quoted as calling for the 
kidnapping of pope john paul ii if the pontiff visits the 
beleaguered christians 
the casualties raised the toll since march to at least 807 killed 
and 2334 wounded more than 90 percent of beiruts 15 million 
population has fled the ravaged city since the latest round of 
fighting began 
sheik said shaaban leader of lebanons sunni moslem 
fundamentalists was quoted as saying in beiruts addiyar daily 
that moslem zealots also should kidnap president bush and french 
president francois mitterrand to halt alleged french aid to the 
christians 
if the pope comes to lebanon and we manage to hold him for the 
sake of salvaging palestine i wouldnt be against such an act 
said shaaban the only sunni cleric in lebanon to support shiite 
moslem iran syrias ally 
shiite fanatics carried out suicide bombings against us french 
and israeli forces in lebanon between 1983 and 1985 killing 
hundreds of servicemen and have kidnapped scores of westerners 
the pope said aug 19 that he intended to visit lebanon to help 
end the countrys 14yearold civil war the vatican has said the 
final decision on a trip depends on security in beirut 
i support the abduction of bush and mitterand to serve the 
purpose of ousting israel from palestine and stopping the french 
intervention and the naval warships that came to rescue frances 
children in lebanon shaaban said he was referring to six french 
warships in the eastern mediterranean sent to evacuate french 
citizens if the fighting worsens 
syrias moslem allies charge that the french who ruled lebanon 
from 1918 to 1943 and have traditionally been the christians 
protector plan a military intervention to aid the christians 
besieged in their enclave north of beirut 
fighting has raged since march 8 between the syrian army and 
christian forces led by gen michel aoun

regulations said syrian gunners deployed in moslem west beirut and 
the mountains south and east of the capital today hammered the 
christian enclave with 20 shells a minute 
aouns gunners using usmade 155mm howitzers shelled syrian 
positions along beiruts dividing green line the waterfront in west 
beirut and the wooded aramoun hills southeast of the capital the 
spokesman said 
addiyar which is close to aoun said the shelling escalated 
late wednesday because a peace mission by french envoy francois 
scheers was collapsing over differences involving a proposed halt 
in arms deliveries to both sides aoun has said he wants 
international guarantees that syria will stop providing its allies 
with weapons 
the moslems demand the formation of an interlebanese committee 
to monitor arms deliveries to ensure that aoun does not get 
shipments from his main backer iraq which is syrias archrival in 
the arab world 
syria which has 40000 troops in lebanon under a 1976 arab 
league peacekeeping mandate has refused to pull its forces out 
aoun has launched a war of liberation to drive them out 
charging that syria abrogated the arab league mandate by siding with 
the moslems 
scheer ended two days of talks with lebanese leaders wednesday 
and was expected to travel to saudi arabia and then algeria and 
morocco

the trial of a woman charged with 
shooting her lover after a stormy 11year lesbian relationship may 
eventually hinge on whether testimony about the socalled battered 
spouse syndrome is allowed 
that decision could come next week in a murder trial that 
attorneys for both sides believe is one of the first to test that 
defense in a homosexual relationship 
annette green 30 is charged with firstdegree murder her 
attorney said wednesday she was beaten and tormented for years 
before she fired a single shot from a 38 caliber pistol at the head 
of ivonne julio 32 after a halloween party last year 
west palm beach attorney william lasley said he plans to 
introduce expert testimony at ms greens palm beach county trial 
that she suffered from battered spouse syndrome and acted in 
selfdefense 
its the first case that im aware of where the battered 
syndrome is used with lesbians said assistant state attorney bob 
johnson 
lasley said ms green felt like a mother to ms julios teenage 
twin daughters and that kept her from ending the relationship which 
culminated in the oct 30 1988 slaying 
for 11 years she was the mother of ms julios twins and 
performed the domestic duties of the relationship lasley said 
wednesday during a break in the first day of testimony she was 
frequently battered and abused physically and psychologically along 
with the children when determining if she acted reasonable you can 
look at those 11 years 
palm beach circuit judge thomas waddell is expected to rule next 
week on whether or not to allow experts to testify about battered 
spouse syndrome 
johnson says hell challenge any attempt to bring the syndrome 
into the case because he says there are no studies about such a 
defense in homosexual relationships 
the prosecution maintains that ms julio was killed while she was 
in the closet of the mobile home the women shared in west palm beach 
ivonne julio was down on her knees in the closet begging for 
her life johnson told jurors in his opening statement tuesday 
jurors on wednesday viewed a taped interview police had with ms 
green just hours after the shooting 
the women had just returned from a party where they had been 
drinking when an argument erupted and ms julio pulled out her gun 
from the closet ms green told palm beach detective wesley buxton 
ms green said she grabbed a knife that had been on a nightstand 
because she thought ms julio would kill her 
i was afraid she said there was a point i thought she was 
going to shoot me and i just ran into her and grabbed the gun 
ms green said she didnt recall firing the weapon or what 
happened to the knife but in a subsequent taped interview also 
played to jurors wednesday she confessed to police 
ms green could face life in prison if convicted the trial is 
expected to last about a week

the rocky flats nuclear weapons plant was plagued 
by safety problems two months after federal agents raided it for 
evidence of alleged environmental crimes according to an energy 
department report 
the safety inspection report for the week of aug 711 obtained 
wednesday by the denver post said there was no improvement in the 
radiological protection areas at rocky flats during the past 
several months 
a similar report based on a plant inspection in july detailed 
10 serious problems with radiation protection at the plant none of 
the specific problems cited in july resurfaced in august however 
rocky flats is operated by rockwell international corp under 
contract from the doe the plant produces plutonium triggers for 
nuclear bombs 
a federal grand jury in denver is investigating officials from 
rockwell and the doe for allegedly conspiring to illegally dispose 
of radioactive and hazardous wastes 
about 75 fbi agents and special officers from the environmental 
protection agency raided the plant on june 6 after a search warrant 
was issued on an affidavit containing more than 100 pages of 
allegations 
a rockwell spokesman said the new safety inspections they started 
at rocky flats in early july are correcting many problems but 
spokesman ed heints admitted no factory is perfect not even one 
that handles plutonium 
we act on these things as soon as we are notified of them he 
said but with as many people as we have here some people are 
just going to get careless the plant employs about 6000 people 
the report written by an unidentified energy department safety 
inspector said an employee was seen in a radiation control area not 
wearing anticontamination clothing the employee then left the area 
without going through a required monitoring device 
another employee in a building where radioactive material is 
handled violated safety procedures by leaving doors open that should 
have been closed the report said 
these are just two of the numerous problems observed across the 
rocky flats site the inspector wrote

colombia is in a costly war with drug 
traffickers and it appears to have little chance of a quick victory 
the current campaign to crush drug lords and their private 
armies if it continues is likely to drag on for years before it 
succeeds according to officials familiar with the situation 
it will take billions of dollars and at least a decade to defeat 
the traffickers a senior us diplomat with the us embassy in 
bogota said in response to a question during a briefing wednesday 
the official spoke on condition that his remarks be paraphrased 
that he not be identified and that the briefing not be recorded 
a former colombian army intelligence officer told an associated 
press reporter that he too thinks it will take billions of dollars 
and well over a decade before drug traffickers are no longer a 
threat 
the officer a former major said he has his doubts about whether 
the war can be won at all he also spoke on condition of anonymity 
the former army officer pointed out that there is no reason to 
believe government security forces will have any more success 
fighting drug traffickers than they have had combating leftist 
guerrillas 
the army has been fighting leftist guerrillas for three decades 
and the rebel forces have grown steadily to an estimated 10000 
combatants 
the traffickers power also has grown quickly 
fifteen years ago some of todays millionaire and billionaire 
cocaine traffickers were pickpockets and pig farmers six years ago 
they offered to pay off colombias 10 billion foreign debt if the 
government would give them amnesty 
the offer was rejected 
today the traffickers have private armies totaling about 4000 
men intelligencegathering units modern weapons and fleets of 
airplanes and helicopters the former major said 
to meet this growing threat the government has sharply increased 
its spending on security forces and president bush has authorized 
65 million of emergency assistance to colombia to fight the 
traffickers 
unfortunately it all may be too little too late 
a lot of army officers know it would take billions of dollars 
to exterminate all of the drug traffickers to destroy their 
empires the former intelligence officer said 
the united states has been giving colombia about 10 million a 
year to fight the traffickers an amount that seems small 
considering the urgency the united states has given the drug problem 
and the traffickers power 
in the last five years an ap reporter in bogota has seen many 
signs of colombias inability to combat the cocaine problem 
a us dea agent once said that colombias antidrug agents were 
so poorly equipped that they had to beg gas from their us 
counterparts to go on drug raids 
an air force pilot flying searchanddestroy missions over the 
eastern jungles to eradicate coca plantations told the ap reporter 
that pilots need longer range planes to be effective 
and farmers in the andes in southeast colombia told the reporter 
they werent worried about police helicopters swooping down 
periodically to destroy coca bushes new bushes are planted 
immediately after police leave they said 
army troops in the field are poorly equipped boots are worn 
until they almost fall apart as ap reporter in combat areas has 
seen soldiers flagging down banana trucks and forcing drivers to 
transport troops because the army does not have enough trucks of its 
own 
meanwhile the traffickers use the most modern automatic weapons 
including light antitank weapons 
the former intelligence officer told the ap that former 
colleagues told him recently about raids on one traffickers hideout 
that turned up records indicating he spent 100000 a month 
gathering information 
former president belisario betancur speaking of the traffickers 
during his 198286 term said colombia is fighting against 
something that is stronger than the state 
betancurs justice minister rodrigo lara bonilla was murdered 
riddled with bullets because raids on cocaine laboratories had hurt 
the traffickers too much 
in the last 10 years traffickers have killed 220 judges and 
other court employes two newspaper editors a justice minister an 
attorney general hundreds of policemen and soldiers and dozens of 
others perceived by traffickers as a threat to their business 
to counter the violence the colombian government has started for 
the first time in 30 years spending more on the military than on 
education 
the government increased the militarys share of the 1990 budget 
to 17 percent from 10 percent for a total of 560 million 
that is almost certainly bound to limit growth of spending on 
schools hospitals and other public works 
it is that sort of thinking that got colombias guerrillas 
started three decades ago 
progressive governments have done much to develop the country 
but extreme poverty is still a problem 
many children grow up never tasting meat or milk cardboard boxes 
discarded in front of houses disappear in minutes taken by people 
who sell them 
people digging in garbage dumps for bones to sell to chemical 
companies and for such things as bottles are so common that there 
are labor unions among the scavengers 
such shortcomings are eventually going to have to be weighed as 
colombias guerrillas continue to press for changes in government 
spending to help the countrys poor people 
a costly and continued war against drug traffickers will make 
that difficult if not impossible unless there is massive aid from 
the united states and elsewhere

a lightskinned woman has won her battle to be 
designated black even though her parents listed her as white on her 
birth certificate in an attempt to help her overcome racial bias 
a judge on wednesday directed kansas officials to issue a new 
birth certificate for 39yearold mary christine walker who was 
born in great bend kan 
im glad its over said the former denver public school 
teacher who always called herself black im very thrilled 
her attorney penfield tate ii said kansas current birth 
certificates do not designate race so her new one will have no race 
on it at all but that is fine with us he said 
the order came from us district judge john brooks of denver 
who heard walkers plea to stop the illusion that she was white a 
wellintentioned deception she said her parents started 
her father whos black and her mother who had a white mother 
and a black father endowed their daughter with a fair complexion 
green eyes and a light brown hair that would allow perpetuation of 
the secret 
my parents wanted their kids to make it and they picked the 
easiest way possible walker said they knew what it was to be 
black they knew the problems 
at that time passing for white was risky but financially 
rewarding for blacks who had the physical and emotional ability she 
said 
mom really stressed the white world on the kids education 
manners and she was very paranoid about the secret getting out 
walker said 
but she said she couldnt blame her parents 
i resent that this society is set up in such a way that someone 
would have to pass for another race its a disgrace that this 
country is so screwed up racially because it really is she said 
walker said that living as a black she never was bothered by 
the heritage of deception except when applying for work prospective 
employers would point out the discrepancy between the white on 
her birth certificate and the black she had filled in as race on 
an application accusing her of lying to take advantage of policies 
that encourage minority hiring 
her claim of civil rights discrimination following the incident 
was rejected too because of the birth certificate 
the federal government put in writing that i was not black 
and that was too much she said it just hurt that this was the 
federal government saying the history of my family didnt mean 
anything 
so she decided to pursue the change 
this is like emancipation for me so i wont have to go through 
this again she said i dont want to be put in a box i dont 
fit in

west germany asked the austrian railroad 
today to begin preparing for the mass transfer of thousands of east 
german refugees in hungary who are awaiting resettlement in the 
west rail officials said 
one official speaking on condition of anonymity said the 
request to make an unspecified number of railway cars available for 
sept 6 came from officials in bonn the west german capital 
another railway official said sept 6 was only one of several 
possible dates for such a mass movement of east germans and i 
personally expect this to happen before that 
thousands of east germans have fled into hungary since may when 
that communist country which is experimenting with westernstyle 
reforms dismantled much of its border fortifications with austria 
the border flood has created friction between the relatively 
liberal government in hungary and hardline leaders in warsaw pact 
neighbor east germany many refugees say they are fleeing east 
germanys stagnant economy 
an austrian government source on wednesday said at least 1500 
east germans would be allowed to leave hungary under a plan being 
drawn up by the international red cross 
but the second rail official who also asked to remain anonymous 
said german federal railways officials told the austrians to prepare 
for between 1500020000 east german refugees adding this 
number is fairly official 
the rail official said austrian railways had promised the west 
german embassy in vienna to have 50 rail cars available within six 
hours at an unspecified border point with hungary 
neither austrian railway officials nor their hungarian 
counterparts had been asked to move east german refugees directly 
from budapest he said 
asked how they would cross the border the official speculated 
that they would either cross on foot or ride vans or buses 
more than 5000 east germans frustrated by rigid constraints at 
home on economic and political freedom have fled to the west through 
hungary since july according to west german estimates 
thousands more in hungary who have outstayed visitors visas 
refuse to go back and are crowding red cross camps in budapest 
where a fifth camp for the refugees is to open friday 
hundreds of likeminded east germans also refuse to leave west 
german diplomatic property in prague and east berlin unless 
guaranteed safe passage to west germany which considers them 
citizens 
most of the east germans managing to flee have done so from 
hungary to austria after hungary in may began removing barbed wire 
and other barriers 
some others have had to risk two illegal escapes one from 
czechoslovakia the only country east germans can visit without 
permission from their communist government to hungary and then 
from hungary to austria 
detailing the international red cross committee plan wednesday 
the austrian government source said it involves transporting the 
refugees from hungary to austria and then to west germany 
speculation of an impending major development in the protracted 
standoff was fueled wednesday by the surprise visit of west german 
envoy michael jansen to vienna for talks with austrian foreign 
minister alois mock 
hungary last week allowed 108 east germans holed up in west 
germanys budapest embassy to go to west germany in a plan also 
organized by the genevabased international red cross committee 
bonn and budapest said then it was a onetime occurrence 
but the west german state of bavaria continued today to set up 
four tent camps for east german refugees further heightening 
speculation of a mass exodus within the next few days 
in bonn a west german government spokesman hans klein said he 
did not know how many east germans now in hungary would eventually 
ask to come to the west but officials estimate there are 150000 to 
200000 vacationing there 
hungarian and west german officials speculate many of the 
undecided east germans with schoolage children will make up their 
minds this weekend whether to return home in time for the start of 
the school year 
east german authorities have pledged that none of those returning 
would face penalties for attempted escape attempts or overstaying 
visitors visas in hungary

a steel sheet lining the bottom of a three 
mile island reactor cracked in spots during the 1979 accident 
officials said after seeing video footage from the depths of the 
submerged reactor 
but a clear picture of how well the unit 2 reactor vessel 
withstood the 5000degree heat will have to await further study 
the first color video to be taken inside the 40foot depths of 
the submerged reactor clearly showed that lines first spotted in 
july were cracks said the plant operator gpu nuclear corp on 
wednesday 
investigation of the four cracks on saturday required a newly 
developed radiationresistant color television camera and specially 
designed tools to brush debris from the area probe each crack and 
take measurements 
the cracks one as long as 6 inches and just fractions of an inch 
wide and deep were caused by molten uranium fuel that streamed like 
lava to the reactor bottom during the accident 
its all new but it is not surprising to find them at this 
location said gpu nuclear spokesman doug bedell 
though other cracks are possible in the thin steel sheet the 
company feels its more important to concentrate on removing 
thousands of pounds of fuel debris still left in the reactor 
fuel removal should be completed by november so a 7 million 
11nation research project into the 5inch thick carbon steel 
reactor vessel can start bedell said 
thats when well get a more definitive analysis of how the 
bottom head withstood the accident bedell said 
until then it will not be known if the cracks in the 
threesixteenthsinch thick sheeting extend into the vessel he 
added the stainless steel layer is intended to protect the carbon 
steel walls of the vessel from corrosion 
the accident the worst ever at a us commercial nuclear power 
plant was triggered by a combination of operator and mechanical 
errors water was cut off to the 150ton radioactive core and about 
half of it melted radioactive gas was released to the atmosphere 
tmis unit 1 adjacent to the damaged plant was closed for six 
years after the march 1979 accident but was returned to commercial 
service in 1985

china today denied amnesty internationals charges 
that authorities carried out secret executions and mass arrests 
following the military crackdown in june 
foreign ministry spokesman li zhaoxing at a weekly briefing 
also said us sanctions had infringed upon chinas dignity and 
that the united states must be held responsible for deteriorating 
ties between the countries 
also today the official press reported that the government is 
tightening control of the economy and cracking down on profiteering 
in scarce materials and income tax evasion 
li said claims by amnesty international that a wave of 
repression in china followed the june 34 military attack on 
studentled protesters in beijing are entirely ungrounded and 
unreasonable 
he said that during the attack an extremely small number of 
people used terrorist means and took violent actions in an attempt 
to overthrow the legitimate government that the chinese 
government according to law arrested those criminals and sentenced 
them to imprisonment is entirely legitimate and justified 
no country or organization has the right to interfere in an 
issue that is purely another countrys internal affair li said 
amnesty said wednesday it had sent premier li peng a telex 
message urging the chinese government to stop using judicial 
killing as a political tool and to release all prisoners of 
conscience 
a statement released by the human rights groups headquarters in 
london said at least 1000 people were killed in the military attack 
on beijing 
the government has said about 200 died in the crackdown 
the statement added there was strong evidence that the 
authorities had taken a deliberate decision after the army massacres 
in early june to carry out secret executions but also to publicize 
certain death sentences in order to cow political opposition 
the report said the number of people arrested as a result of the 
protests may be much higher than the official figure of 4000 
asked whether china has any political prisoners foreign ministry 
spokesman li replied the chinese government always attaches 
importance to human rights and protection of civil rights according 
to law theres no such thing as political persecution in china and 
therefore there is no such thing accordingly as political 
prisoners 
china says students and other prodemocracy activists who have 
been arrested were guilty of counterrevolutionary crimes but denies 
they are political prisoners 
li said current tensions between china and the united states 
have been caused by the deep involvement of the united states in 
chinas internal affairs and by its taking the lead to impose 
sanctions against china which damaged chinas interests and 
infringed upon chinas dignity 
he said any improvement in bilateral relations depends on the 
policies and actions of the united states 
following the military crackdown washington stopped arms sales 
and other military exchanges with china and suspended highlevel 
contacts it also has urged international lending organizations to 
put off providing new credit to the beijing government 
reports in the official media today said the government is 
reasserting controls over the distribution and pricing of raw 
materials 
the state also will launch a campaign against what it says is 
rampant tax evasion among the nations 145 million privately owned 
enterprises the china daily reported 
xie mingan an official at the ministry of materials and 
equipment said the state will tighten controls on prices of some 
raw materials such as coal rolled steel and nonferrous metals 
he said redundant middlemen will be eliminated illegal dealers 
and officials trading power for money will be disciplined and state 
supplies of materials to production enterprises will be maintained 
decentralization of controls over raw materials one aspect of 
the economic reforms has led to a chaotic situation of hoarding 
speculation and pricegouging middlemen often with links to 
influential party and government officials buy up scarce materials 
at low governmentset prices and sell them for huge profits on free 
markets to desperate factories 
jin xin director of the state tax administration said at a 
conference wednesday that if the problem of tax evasion among 
private businessmen is not solved it will certainly sap the 
morale of the dominant working classes and bring adverse effects on 
the enthusiasm of intellectuals

orders to us factories for manufactured goods 
fell 17 percent in july to the lowest level in eight months the 
government said today 
the commerce department said orders for both durable and 
nondurable manufactured goods totaled a seasonally adjusted 2313 
billion it was the lowest level since november and the second 
decline in three months 
orders rose 06 percent in june and fell 26 percent in may 
the latest decline was steeper than most analysts expected 
recently a string of strong statistical reports have indicated that 
economists fear of an imminent recession was overblown however 
todays report shows that the economy is still far from robust 
if weakness in manufacturing persisted it could lead to layoffs 
and a rise in the unemployment rate 
in two other signs of sluggishness shipments of manufactured 
goods fell 19 percent the sharpest fall since march 1986 and 
inventories shot up 11 percent the biggest jump in five years 
a runup in inventories without a corresponding rise in new orders 
can signal production cutbacks in the future as factories attempt to 
get rid of goods and shelves and backlots 
in july orders for durable goods items expected to last three 
or more years fell 22 percent a revision from last weeks 
estimate of a 19 percent decline 
orders for nondurable goods fell 11 percent 
in the key category of nondefense capital goods a barometer of 
business investment plans orders rose 57 percent in july after 
gaining 50 percent a month earlier this was one of the few bright 
spots in an otherwise negative report 
much of the july weakness was concentrated in orders for military 
goods down 145 percent and nonelectrical machinery down 105 
percent 
new orders for aircraft pushed the transportation sector up 26 
percent despite weakness in automobile manufacturing and 
shipbuilding

former premier ciriaco de mita said today he has 
resigned as president of the christian democrats thus ending seven 
years in the top leadership of italys dominant political party 
de mita told reporters that he informed the christian democrat 
national council that he was concerned the party gives the 
impression of being in a different frequency than mine 
i have already resigned he said at the end of a threeday 
meeting of the party leadership 
he suggested his management position restricted his freedom to 
express his views and that he needed time to reflect about the 
future line of the party 
the resignation further eroded the power of one of the most 
influential italian politicians of the 1980s it also underscored 
the discord that has recently grown among traditional and more 
liberal factions of the party that has dominated italian government 
since world war ii 
political observers have speculated that a de mita resignation 
could lead to a formal split in the christian democrat party such a 
division would radically change the political landscape in italy 
where the christian democrats have been the main force keeping the 
communists out of power 
de mita 61 resigned as premier in may after heading the 
government for 13 months his fall from power began three months 
earlier when he was forced to step down as christian democrat party 
secretary the partys top post because of charges by party members 
that he held too much power 
he was named party president a position with far less authority 
months of bickering followed between de mita and socialist party 
leader bettino craxi on may 19 de mita resigned as head of a 
fiveparty coalition that also included the socialists social 
democrats liberals and republicans 
christian democrat veteran giulio andreotti formed italys 49th 
postwar government in late july after two months of unsuccessful 
efforts to resurrect the de mita government 
de mitas resignation appeared to give ground to andreottis 
faction in the christian democrats which is considered conservative 
and roman catholic churchoriented de mita headed what was 
considered the partys left wing 
de mita remains a member of the chamber of deputies or lower 
house of parliament it wasnt immediately clear whether he would 
stay on as a member of the party national council

the white man accused of firing the shot that 
killed a black teenager setting off a racial furor surrendered to 
upstate police today a day after the victim was laid to rest amid 
anger and anguish 
police said joseph fama 18 the subject of a weeklong manhunt 
turned himself in to police in oneonta at about 230 am police in 
the otsego county town about 175 miles northwest of new york city 
said they expected to send fama back to the city this afternoon 
officials had said fama was a member of a white mob that attacked 
yusuf hawkins 16 and three other blacks in the predominantly white 
bensonhurst section of brooklyn on aug 23 fama they said is 
believed to have drawn a gun and killed hawkins 
fama is the seventh person arrested in the attack two of them 
including the man alleged to be the ringleader of the mob were 
indicted wednesday 
hawkins was mourned wednesday by civil rights leaders 
politicians and the parents of a black man killed in the 1986 howard 
beach racial attack 
if as we lower him in the grave we are raised in 
consciousness then his living and dying will not be in vain 
black muslim minister louis farrakhan said to spirited applause 
inside and outside the brooklyn church where the funeral was held 
it seems like im burying my son again said jean griffith 
sandiford whose son michael griffith died after being chased by 
whites into the path of a car in the howard beach section of queens 
miles from the brooklyns predominantly white bensonhurst section 
where hawkins was killed more than 300 people packed a small 
baptist church a thousand gathered outside listening to the 
proceedings over two speakers set up outside the building in a 
mainly black section of brooklyn 
the longer we waste time in frivolous divisions this will 
happen again and again and again farrakhan told the crowd we 
say as the jews say never again never again never again 
gov mario cuomo mayor edward i koch police commissioner 
benjamin ward and republican mayoral hopeful rudolph giuliani were 
heckled outside the church none of them spoke at the funeral 
hawkins and three friends were answering an ad for a used car 
when up to 30 whites carrying bats golf clubs and at least one 
gun confronted them and killed him aug 23 authorities said 
mayoral candidate david dinkins who was wellreceived by the 
crowd said he could understand why tempers might be running high 
i think one has to understand there has been a young life 
taken senselessly uselessly dinkins who is black said after 
the funeral its not abnormal or extreme for people to have that 
depth of feeling 
inside the church filmmaker spike lee whose current movie do 
the right thing is about racism in another brooklyn neighborhood 
sat near hawkins parents during the twohour service 
the death of the 23yearold griffith in howard beach was invoked 
by several speakers by coincidence griffith was a cousin of one of 
the teenagers who were with hawkins the day he was killed 
let freedom ring from howard beach said the rev curtis 
wells pastor of the church and a cousin of hawkins 
let freedom ring from bensonhurst were not going to take what 
we used to take were going to walk where we want to walk 
a few bensonhurst residents also went to the funeral to show 
their sympathy about the killing 
racism is wrong and killing somebody is very evil that is the 
thing that we all feel said the rev al barozzi a priest at st 
dominics catholic church in bensonhurst 
earlier the grand jury charged keith mondello 18 and pasquale 
raucci 19 with seconddegree murder raucci also was charged with 
manslaughter 
both had been charged with firstdegree assault riot criminal 
possession of a deadly weapon civil rights violations aggravated 
harassment menacing and unlawful imprisonment 
district attorney elizabeth holtzman said the two acted with 
depraved indifference to human life 
you dont need to pull a trigger you dont need to stab 
somebody if you act in concert with people who do actually 
effectuate the murder then you can be held responsible holtzman 
said 
the judge allowed mondello the gangs alleged leader to 
remain free on 100000 bail and raucci on 75000 bail four others 
have been arrested in the case

princess anne the only daughter of queen elizabeth 
ii is separating from her husband mark phillips after 15 years of 
marriage but they do not plan to divorce buckingham palace 
announced today 
the queen on holiday at balmoral scotland was described by 
royal sources to be obviously saddened but to understand the 
couples decision which was taken in principle earlier this year 
according to press association britains domestic news agency 
her royal highness the princess royal and capt mark phillips 
have decided to separate on terms agreed between them the 
announcement said there are no plans for divorce proceedings 
the terms of the separation were not disclosed but anne 39 will 
continue to live at the couples home gatcombe park in 
gloucestershire 80 miles west of london phillips 40 will move to 
another house nearby the palace said 
the palace press office could not say whether this would be aston 
farm on the gatcombe estate 
the couples children peter 11 and zara 8 will live with 
their mother at gatcombe and phillips will have full access to 
them the palace said 
princess anne in puerto rico for a meeting of the international 
olympic committee brushed past reporters this morning without 
answering questions 
it was only the second formal rupture of a marriage within the 
immediate royal family in this century said sue goddard manager of 
burkes peerage 
ms goddard could not recall another instance since george iv 
attempted to divorce his wife shortly before he ascended to the 
throne in 1820 before that she said there was no royal divorce 
since henry viii and his six marriages in the 16th century 
the separation announced by the palace today was disclosed 
wednesday night by phillips father maj peter phillips 
rumors of trouble in the marriage date back to 1981 in recent 
years anne and phillips have spent periods of up to six months 
apart 
speculation that their marriage was on the rocks arose most 
recently in april after personal letters written to anne by a 
handsome 35yearold aide to the queen naval cmdr timothy 
laurence were stolen and sent to the tabloid the sun 
phillips name has been linked romantically with several women in 
british tabloid reports in recent years 
princess margaret 59 the queens only sister was divorced in 
1978 from photographer lord snowdon he has remarried she has not 
as in the case of anne who is seventh in line to the throne the 
palace repeatedly denied that margarets marriage was in trouble 
 
a common view that has taken hold this century is that the royal 
family as a symbol of national unity is supposed to set an example 
for the nation 
before margarets divorce british news media often depicted the 
royals as the ideal family but the divorce showed they could not 
meet that expectation and cost them some of the unquestioning 
respect they had enjoyed 
sniping at the royals their glamorous privileged lives wealth 
and taxpayer money they receive to help carry out their duties now 
is commonplace 
anne a former member of britains olympic equestrian team and 
phillips an exarmy captain and olympic equestrian gold medalist 
met through their love of horses 
they married in londons westminster abbey nov 14 1973 in a 
televised ceremony viewed by an estimated worldwide audience of 500 
million 
anne who is head of the international equestrian federation was 
attending an international olympic committee meeting in puerto rico 
today and bodyguards and aides kept reporters away from her she is 
due to return to britain by midseptember after traveling to belize 
honduras ecuador and bolivia 
phillips remained wednesday at gatcombe park 
his fathers statement said phillips a commoner who farms and 
trains horses will go on managing the work on the estate and will 
continue to organize the horse trials and the stables 
phillips has traveled widely for business and equestrian 
interests 
anne has become one of the busiest members of the royal family as 
president of the save the children fund a charity that helps poor 
children worldwide 
on april 6 the sun britains biggestcirculation paper with a 
daily sale of 4 million copies reported it had been handed four 
stolen letters written to anne by a man it did not identify 
it did not disclose the contents but said it passed them to 
police on april 8 the palace identified laurence as the writer to 
try to halt intense news media speculation 
phillips told reporters at that time that his marriage was fine 
and happy 
on aug 23 the queen personally awarded laurence the royal 
victorian order as he left her service after three years as her 
equerry to take command of a frigate the citation said the order 
was awarded for extraordinary important or personal services to 
the sovereign or the royal family

chad and libya signed a peace accord 
today that calls for an end to fighting over a disputed strip of 
desert that has been the focus of 16 years of bloodshed diplomats 
said 
the agreement was signed in algiers by chadian foreign minister 
acheikh ibn oumar and his libyan counterpart djadallah azouz talhi 
also at the signing was algerian foreign minister boualem 
bessaieh who helped mediate the agreement 
details of the accord were worked out aug 2125 in meetings 
outside paris the french foreign ministry in paris confirmed 
the agreement calls for the parties to try to resolve their 
dispute through a political settlement within a year 
if that fails they are to take the issue to the international 
court of justice in the hague to rule on who holds sovereignty over 
the aozou strip a 45000squaremile band of mineralrich desert 
between the two countries 
according to the chadian embassy in paris which issued a copy of 
the accord chad and libya agreed to 
the withdrawal of all forces from the disputed region leaving 
it under the administration of a group of african observers until 
the court renders its decision 
the release of all prisoners of war held by both sides 
the halting of all hostilities 
the signing of a treaty of friendship 
chad holds about 2000 libyan prisoners while most of the 
chadians held by tripoli have been released 
the accord was signed one day before libya celebrates the 20th 
anniversary of col moammar gadhafis rule 
gadhafi claimed the disputed land in 1973 under an unratified 
1941 treaty between italy then colonial ruler of libya and france 
which then ruled chad 
by 1984 the us state department estimated that 3000 libyan 
soldiers occupied northern chad 
in august 1987 chadian president hissene habre launched a 
successful offensive to recapture northern chad but failed to push 
them out of the disputed area controlled by tripoli 
in september 1988 a ceasefire was proclaimed under the auspices 
of the organization of african unity 
a month later the two countries reestablished diplomatic 
relations and in july the two leaders held a brief summit in bamako 
mali to settle the remaining differences 
france has maintained a small force of 1500 men in southern chad 
since september 1984 under operation sparrowhawk although the 
troops have not been directly involved in the fighting 
a statement by the french foreign ministry in paris paid homage 
to the wisdom of the leaders of the two countries and expressed 
hope that this accord will allow the consolidation of peace in the 
region 
habre and gadhafi former allies met for the first time in seven 
years july 21 in bamako mali the two leaders shook hands and the 
organizers of the meeting felt an accord was so close that they told 
reporters in the malian capital that signature on a pact was simply 
a formality 
the meeting ended with no agreement not even a communique but 
both sides later said progress had been made

moldavian leaders today declared their native 
tongue the official language of the republic but agreed to allow the 
use of russian in some circumstances a compromise aimed at 
appeasing russianspeaking minorities 
the moldavian supreme soviet meeting in the republics capital 
kishinev approved the language law overhwhelmingly a moldavian 
activist and a reporter for the republics official news agency said 
by telephone 
the initial proposal to make moldavian the official language 
caused widespread strikes and protests by ethnic russians and other 
russianspeaking ethnic groups in the southern republic bordering 
romania 
the choice of language is an important issue for many of the 
diverse soviet ethnic groups many have felt they were forced to 
adopt russian even though their native tongues are vastly different 
and represent a distinct cultural heritage 
vasily nestase a member of a promoldavian nationalist group 
known as the peoples front called the move a first victory for 
ethnic moldavians 
the bill was approved 32111 said a reporter for atem 
moldavias official news agency 
as the official language moldavian is to be used for government 
documents and meetings and commerce 
the same legislation also contained a provision to placate 
russian speakers a declaration that russian is the language of 
interethnic relations of the peoples of the ussr apparently 
sanctioning the use of russian in communications among different 
ethnic groups 
the original draft of the legislation still pending said 
moldavian must be used for everyday life within the republic 
angering the russian speakers 
a compromise proposed wednesday by moldavias communist party 
chief semen grossu at the urging of president mikhail s 
gorbachev said moldavian would be the language of officials and 
documents but russian would be the everyday tongue for contact 
among all ethnic groups within the republic 
also today the moldavian supreme soviet approved legislation 
restoring the latin alphabet to the moldavian language the cyrillic 
alphabet like that used in russian was imposed by dictator josef 
stalin after he annexed moldavia from neighboring romania in 1940 
stalin imposed cyrillic to back his claim that romanians and 
moldavians are two distinct nationalities 
many ethnic minorities in the republic do not speak russian and 
have staged rallies and strikes to express their objections to the 
proposed language changes nestase said the strikes which have 
involved as many as 200 businesses and industries were continuing 
today 
moldavia has had no language law russian traditionally has been 
the tongue for government affairs and is commonly used in commerce 
which upsets native moldavians 
several hundred russian speakers took to the streets of kishinev 
today and held red flags to underscore their concerns as the supreme 
soviet met nestase said

the explosives detection devices the government 
wants installed at 40 of the worlds busiest airports might not have 
detected the bomb that destroyed pan am flight 103 last year a 
congresswoman said today 
rep cardiss collins dill chairwoman of the house government 
operations transportation subcommittee said more work on the 
detection equipment is needed 
she questioned whether it would have picked up the relatively 
small bomb believed to have weighed about one pound that brought 
down flight 103 last december over lockerbie scotland killing 270 
people 
the faas detection standards were set several years ago and 
have not been revised as its knowledge about explosives and 
terrorists has become more precise the congresswoman wrote the 
federal aviation administration recently in comments made available 
today 
the faa regulation issued wednesday was made possible because of 
evolving technology that allows detection of chemicals in plastic 
explosives 
the equipment likely to be installed detects nitrogen a 
component in most explosives but also present in small amounts in 
wool leather and nylon this makes detection of small bombs 
difficult ms collins said because the device does not determine 
the source of the nitrogen 
the smaller the amount of explosive the more difficult it is 
to detect in the background nitrogen content of the suitcase she 
wrote 
the airlines which would have to pay an estimated 393 million 
over the next 10 years to install detection devices have questioned 
the cost and effectiveness of the technology available to meet the 
faa requirement 
we cannot support the widespread deployment of this equipment 
in the near term because its capability has not yet been 
demonstrated said stephen d hayes of the air transport 
association an airline industry group 
the faa which can require airlines to follow certain procedures 
abroad as a condition for flying into us airports says it will 
continue to consider whether to require the new screening on all 
international flights by us carriers a move that could send the 
cost to airlines to an estimated 896 million by 1999 
the faa has acquired six prototype screening devices the first 
already installed at new yorks kennedy international airport 
the others are scheduled for installation by the end of the year 
at londons gatwick airport and airports in frankfurt west germany 
detroit miami and san francisco 
the faa declined to identify the other 34 airports citing 
security considerations and the possibility there could be some 
shifts in those affected 
investigators have concluded that the bomb that exploded over 
lockerbie was hidden in checked luggage loaded in the forward cargo 
compartment of the new yorkbound boeing 747 
the rule does not require a particular device but says one called 
thermal neutron analysis has been shown to have the highest degree 
of explosives detection currently possible for detecting known 
civilian and military explosives manufactured here and abroad 
any system used by the airlines must be approved by the faa the 
rule requires that the system be automated detect specified 
quantities and configurations of explosives as defined by the faa 
and be safe for operators and baggage 
the tna units are estimated to cost 750000 each the faa said 
it said this cost is expected to drop as production increases the 
device was developed by science applications international corp of 
san diego under an faa contract the agency said it has been tested 
successfully at several airports 
the system emits lowenergy neutrons that pass through luggage 
and interact with the chemical elements in explosives triggering an

president bushs national drug strategy 
envisions sending up to 260 million in economic and military aid to 
colombia bolivia and peru in an effort to stomp out cocaine where 
its produced an administration source says 
the final version of the presidents plan which he will unveil 
in a nationally televised speech tuesday night will be much like 
the draft proposed by drug czar william j bennett according to 
another source 
it will be tough on users heavy on law enforcement and call for 
a new emphasis on treatment the source said 
but it wont threaten states with a loss of federal highway funds 
if they dont impose strict antidrug laws as bennetts draft had 
proposed and it wont include the 25 million national drug 
intelligence center said the source who spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
some parts of the 180page drug stategy will not be made public 
another official said today adding its a war and you dont 
give all your plans to the enemy 
the other administration source also speaking on condition of 
anonymity said wednesday that bushs strategy will call for 250 
million to 260 million in economic and military aid for the three 
main cocaine producing countries colombia bolivia and peru 
also wednesday sen joseph biden ddel unveiled 
debtfordrugs legislation intended to offer debtrelief 
incentives to latin american nations to subsidize the withdrawal of 
farm land from producing coca crops which are refined to produce 
cocaine 
a us investment of 400 million in such a plan could free 
enough funds to subsidize the withdrawal of every acre in bolivia 
columbia and peru in coca production said biden who plans to 
introduce the legislation when congress reconvenes next month 
sources who had seen the classified section of the draft 
containing information about proposed aid to the three latin 
american countries had said the figure could reach 300 million and 
national security adviser brent scowcroft indicated tuesday that it 
would be even higher 
scowcroft had included the 65 million in military equipment that 
bush announced on friday for colombia that money comes from a 
discretionary fund available for fiscal 1989 which ends sept 30 
the strategy covers fiscal 1990 
although bush met with his top lieutenants in the drug war 
tuesday at his vacation home in kennebunkport maine to discuss the 
strategy the focus of the meeting was colombia sources said 
wednesday 
the fundamental issues of the strategy did not change a 
third source said noting that the final strategy had gone to the 
printer before the meeting occurred 
colombia has been wracked with violence since president virgilio 
barco imposed emergency regulations allowing the immediate 
resumption of extraditions of alleged drug traffickers to the united 
states the move came after the aug 18 assassination of a leading 
presidential candidate who was an outspoken foe of drug traffickers 
colombian justice minister monica de greiff met for about 40 
minutes wednesday with bennett said bennett spokesman don hamilton 
who declined to say what bushs final drug strategy provides for 
colombia 
mrs de greiff asked on tuesday for 19 million in aid for 
judicial protection the united states has so far pledged 25 
million 
the crackdown on drug users called for in the strategy will start 
early with a program allowing judges to strip student loans and 
other federal benefits from drug offenders expected to begin friday 
the program required by the antidrug abuse act of 1988 wont 
affect welfare disability or social security benefits 
the decision to drop the plan for the national drug intelligence 
center stemmed from justice department objections after the treasury 
department proposed combining it with a new moneylaundering 
intelligence center a source said 
the draft also had called for a 49 percent increase in treatment 
funds 925 million in 1990 compared with 621 million in the 
current budget as well as 12 billion for new prisons a 28 
percent increase 
the draft sought 10 percent reductions in drug use in two years 
and a 50 percent reduction in a decade it called for the same 
reductions in supply as represented by estimates of illicit drugs 
coming into the country and estimates derived from reports of the 
ease of obtaining drugs 
it also focused on the street crime of the inner city spawned by 
the drug trade and the insidious nature of crack the highly 
addictive smokeable form of cocaine the draft called for 
increasing justice assistance grants to states and cities from 150 
million to 350 million 
copies of the draft strategy were leaked to the media shortly 
after it was produced in late july 
the sections of the drug strategy that will remain classified 
deal with the limits the administration is willing to go to attack 
drug traffickers growers and users 
you dont want the narcotraffickers to know what the limits 
are an official said we cant let them know how far we would 
go before retaliation or how far before we pump more money in 
he said the sections dealing with intelligence gathering and 
detailed analysis on the drug situations overseas and domestically 
also would be classified 
the idea is to tell as much as possible to the people the 
source said but it is obvious we cant tell all

gov edward d diprete today proposed a 
sweeping plan that would provide academic help to students from the 
third grade through high school and promise graduates money toward 
college costs 
in return parents and children signing up for the rhode island 
childrens crusade would have to obey the law avoid drugs agree 
to work with mentors and tutors have their report cards monitored 
by state officials and act as good examples in their neighborhoods 
mentors would work with students much like the national big 
brothers program giving advice and acting as companions and role 
models 
the state board of governors for higher education approved the 
program shortly after the diprete announced it this morning 
rhode island is about to become the first state to embark on a 
program of this magnitude on a statewide basis diprete said 
diprete said would be knocking on the door of the white house 
for a significant contribution of federal funds for the plan 
new york state last year enacted liberty scholarships for 
lowerincome students accepted at public or private new york 
colleges rhode islands program goes further to enroll students at 
an early age and give them educational and social help said leila 
mahoney dipretes senior assistant 
the crusade is aimed at the estimated onethird of the states 
10000 thirdgraders who receive subsidized hot lunches at school or 
whose families receive food stamps ms mahoney said 
it would seek to cut the dropout rate among those students in 
half to 25 percent as a result an estimated 1200 additional 
students each year would attend college and 1200 would go on to 
other training programs 
students from other families could seek mentors and tutoring 
help but would not be promised the scholarships ms mahoney said 
there would be little checking on a familys financial status she 
said 
we dont want the borderline people to slip through the 
cracks ms mahoney said if three people cheat thats fine 
they probably need our help anyhow 
the childrens crusade would enroll its first class of 
thirdgraders in september 1991 
the maximum scholarship available when the youngsters reach 
collage age a decade later be 3436 per year the estimated tuition 
cost at the university of rhode island in the year 2000 the maximum 
scholarship would increase 5 percent a year after that said americo 
w petrocelli the states higher education commissioner students 
attending other state schools and apprenticeship programs or 
proprietary schools would receive less 
students attending private colleges whose tuitions are higher 
would receive the maximum scholarship 
we really feel that if the program is successful we may have 
made a fundamental change in certain patterns that contribute to 
students dropping out said petrocelli 
ms mahoney plans to ask businesses foundations and schools to 
contribute 10 million to a statecreated foundation to get the 
program going the state would be expected to contribute 32 
million a year bringing the fund with interest to approximately 
50 million after 10 years ms mahoney said the money would pay 
for scholarships tutors and administrative costs 
if it doesnt work well give everyone their money back she 
said 
petrocelli said mentors would be recruited among high school and 
college students the elderly and others report cards would be 
monitored by the states higher education office

president bush has abandoned plans to 
travel to alaska next month in the face of continuing negative 
publicity over the exxon valdez oil spill it was learned today 
bushs trip would have been part of a midseptember swing to 
montana south dakota and washington the white house had not 
officially announced the trip as details continued to be worked out 
the alaska leg of the trip would have been for the purpose of 
examining the cleanup progress in the wake of the 
multimilliongallon oil spill from the tanker exxon valdez last 
march 
bush was said to be very intent on going but one source 
speaking on condition of anonymity said the views of other officials 
that it would be unwise politically prevailed 
it was thought it would not be a good idea for the president to 
renew focus on the oil spill a situation for which he was 
criticized for not moving quickly enough to involve the federal 
government in the cleanup 
initially the administration took the position that exxon corp 
was handling the job adequately but after several days officials 
criticized the company saying it had not moved as quickly as it 
could have 
the 11million gallon spill occurred march 24 in prince william 
sound smearing oil on hundreds of miles of once pristine shoreline 
environmentalists have criticized exxons plan to halt the 
cleanup next month in the face of severe weather conditions

not plan to to rehire the countys teacher of the year even though a 
jury acquitted her of charges she manufactured and possessed 
marijuana 
vicki sherling who was accused of helping her husband michael 
grow marijuana in their backyard greenhouse was found innocent of 
the charges in superior court late wednesday 
she said afterward she might try to get her job back because i 
am a teacher 
but superintendent billy mock said today he does not intend to 
rehire mrs sherling to her former post at colquitt county high 
school

otherwise he said noting that mrs sherling already has appealed 
her firing to the state board of education

that she knowingly allowed marijuana to be used the local school 
board did not consider whether she was involved in possessing or 
growing marijuana he said 
she admitted in our hearing that she knew it was going on that 
it was being used he said the action taken yesterday by the 
jury and the action taken by the board of education are not related 
to each other 
jurors deliberated two hours wednesday before reaching their 
verdict 
i respect the opinion of the jury and thats why we have 
juries but ill continue to prosecute cases where drug squads find 
marijuana growing in someones back yard district attorney lamar 
cole said 
the couple were arrested may 19 when drug agents acting on a 
tip found 22 small marijuana plants growing in their back yard and 
drug paraphernalia in their house 
mrs sherling testified that her husband planted marijuana 
without her knowledge sherling said the same thing in earlier 
testimony and 11 character witnesses took the stand to vouch for 
her honesty 
it was the truth and they knew it mrs sherling said as 
jubilant relatives and supporters rushed up to congratulate her 
wednesday evening 
during the trial the 38yearold teacher testified im trying 
desperately to put my life back together im trying to clear my 
name 
my picture was on the front page of the newspaper teacher of 
the year charged with marijuana i spent two weeks curled up in a 
fetal position 
cole questioned her about marijuana found in a chest of drawers 
in the couples bedroom and about a pipe with drug residue in a 
washroom chest 
i trust my husband and in one thing he betrayed me she 
said he never told me he would quit that would have been a lie 
he said vicki ill cut down vicki i wont smoke it in your 
presence

intelligent for one to have grown marijuana in the back yard without 
the others knowledge 
dwight may mrs sherlings attorney said she had suffered 
enough by putting up with her husbands marijuana addiction 
vicki sherling is innocent except for one thing may said 
shes guilty of loving her husband and she may be guilty of 
living with him all these years and suffering through what shes 
suffered 
the couples arrest came as a shock to most in moultrie an 
agricultural community of 15000 
mrs sherling could have been sentenced to up to 11 years in 
prison and fined 1000 if convicted on a felony count of 
manufacturing marijuana and a misdemeanor charge of possessing less 
than an ounce of the drug 
she told the superior court that she first learned of the 
marijuana in the back yard when she phoned her home and a drug agent 
answered 
i went home and saw police cars all over the place she said 
i saw my husband in the living room with his hands handcuffed 
behind his back my whole world came crashing in on me 
character witnesses including coworkers members of a theater 
group and parents from a local boy scout troop praised mrs 
sherling as a woman of stellar character who would never lie to her 
friends about something as serious as marijuana use

marijuana use he testified tuesday that his wife never grew or

a teacher who tells fortunes and gives 
card readings but says she was falsely accused of practicing 
witchcraft has filed a 16 million suit against a school district 
contending it ruined her career 
laura linzay dick filed suit against the north kansas city school 
district in federal court tuesday six months after she quit her job 
teaching speech and drama at maple park middle school 
she contends that school district administrators accused her of 
practicing witchcraft and coerced her into resigning she has been 
unable to find a teaching job since the suit says 
ms dick resigned from the tenured teaching position she had held 
for seven years in february after complaints from a parent that she 
practiced witchcraft 
in her lawsuit ms dick said she never practiced or believed in 
witchcraft 
but in a newspaper interview in february ms dick said she had 
been hearing voices like joan of arc since childhood she said 
she tells fortunes gives card readings and has warned people to get 
medical treatment for otherwise undetected illnesses 
she said her belief in psychic phenomenon does not extend to 
witchcraft 
ms dick said in february that she resigned rather then fend off 
speculation about her beliefs her attorney james humphrey said 
his client was never disciplined while working in north kansas city 
the parents complaint stemmed from a publication intuitive 
directory that listed ms dick as one of several people in the 
kansas city area who practice witchcraft

channeling and card reading

a man has dropped a lawsuit seeking to keep 
his exgirlfriend from getting an abortion after learning that she 
was not pregnant his lawyer said 
elton k johnson of columbia on wednesday dropped his suit 
against a woman publicly known as jane doe after learning 
through a variety of sources though not from a medical examination 
that she was not pregnant said his attorney richard g whiting 
the 23yearold woman has refused to take a pregnancy test and 
still will not say if she was pregnant said the womans attorney 
victoria eslinger 
that is none of their business she said referring to 
johnson and his attorney 
eslinger said johnson knew no more about her clients condition 
wednesday than when he undertook his court fight last week 
we take the position that that is a victory ms eslinger 
said 
once the suit was withdrawn a temporary restraining order 
preventing the woman from seeking an abortion became invalid 
she was extremely relieved ms eslinger said she plans to 
resume her life 
ms eslinger said a threemonth relationship between her client 
and johnson ended about a month ago but johnson 34 wanted the 
woman to carry the fetus to term if indeed she was pregnant 
ms eslinger said she sees the suits withdrawal as both 
vindication of her belief that the family court did not have 
jurisdiction and affirmation of a womans right to independently 
terminate a pregnancy within the first three months 
steven bates executive director of the state chapter of the 
american civil liberties union said the lawsuit appeared to be part 
of an effort by antiabortion activists to alter current law 
this is guerrilla warfare by the righttolifers bates said 
there is no legal basis for bringing these actions 
but whiting said he felt johnsons motives were sincere and in 
the interests of the unborn child 
this case was not brought for publicity reasons whiting said

communist officials said thursday that erich 
honecker was recovering very slowly from a gallbladder 
operation but denied reports the 77yearold east german leader has 
cancer 
on wednesday western media reported that honeckers gall bladder 
operation two weeks ago had to be abandoned because of the 
condition of the tissue west german security sources confirmed 
they had information honeckers operation had to be abandoned 
because of complications 
the masscirculation west german newspaper bild said honecker 
was struggling with death he is apparently incurably sick with 
cancer 
east german officials speaking on condition of anonymity said 
thursday such assertions on cancer were totally unfounded 
they conceded however that honeckers recovery was proceeding 
very slowly 
bild which did not identify its sources also said honecker is 
in an east berlin hospital receives heavy doses of painkilling 
medication and is hardly aware of his surroundings 
western diplomatic sources in east berlin said honecker would not 
be attending the leipzig trade fair and all his appointments up to 
the middle of september had been canceled 
east germanys leadership attaches enormous prestige to the 
leipzig trade fair which begins sunday and honecker traditionally 
opens the biannual international event 
honecker underwent a gall bladder operation two weeks ago and has 
not been seen in public since 
the operation was the second time this summer honecker was 
hospitalized 
illness forced him to leave the warsaw pact summit in bucharest 
on july 8 before its conclusion and the official east german media 
later announced he was in a hospital for problems related to 
gallstones 
he was released the following week but looked frail and tired at 
a public appearance 
honecker has ruled the country of 166 million people since 1971 
he supervised the building of the berlin wall 10 years earlier he 
has shunned the adoption of kremlinstyle reforms a factor in the 
recent surge of refugees from east germany to the west

there are 1707 unaccounted for in vietnam with the rest missing in 
laos cambodia and china 
on july 31 vietnam returned 15 sets of remains believed to be 
those of us servicemen 
the united states does not preclude that there are still american 
prisoners left alive in vietnam although it says it lacks firm 
evidence 
in july president bush said that finding out what happened to 
us servicemen listed missing in southeast asia or prisoners of war 
remained a matter of highest national priority 
bush called on hanoi to shed light on the fate of the missing and 
said that the pace of restoring diplomatic relations with vietnam 
could be impeded unless it cooperates on the powmia issue

senior leader deng xiaoping rumored to be 
seriously ill is in very good health the foreign ministry said 
thursday 
foreign ministry spokesman li zhaoxiang declined comment 
however on the whereabouts of deng 85 who has not been seen since 
june 9 
he said some foreign correspondents did concoct and spread 
rumors about dengs health when asked whether deng was dead or 
alive li replied thats a provocative question 
dengs last appearance was before a gathering of military 
officers whom he congratulated for their actions in the bloody 
suppression of studentled prodemocracy protesters on june 34 
wellplaced chinese sources have said deng is seriously ill with 
cancer and is receiving medical treatment in beijing 
premier li peng told the bangladesh foreign minister last week 
that deng was resting at beidaihe a popular seaside resort for 
chinese leaders anna chennault a prominent chineseamerican with 
ties to the chinese leadership said saturday she was told by 
members of dengs family that he was in good health at beidaihe 
although deng has retired from all his official posts except head 
of the central military commission he is still regarded as the 
ultimate source of power in the inner circles of chinese leadership 
his death could open the way for a power struggle between 
factions particularly between the conservatives wielding power and 
reformers who have been on the retreat since the military crackdown

president bush and canadian prime 
minister brian mulroney went to sea again today as the north 
american leaders mixed statecraft and recreation 
bush took mulroney and his family on a boat ride on a brilliant 
but windy morning touring the rocky coastline up to nearby cape 
porpoise 
the breezes that were stirring up whitecaps in the ocean could 
make it even harder for bush to break his twoweek streak of failing 
to catch a fish despite daily attempts 
the president and the prime minister old friends holding their 
third teteatete this year planned an informal midafternoon 
session with reporters before mulroney and family take their leave 
this evening 
in canadian parlance the session was billed as a scrum 
something short of a full news conference at bushs scenic family 
compound overlooking the atlantic 
mulroney wife mila and their four children arrived by helicopter 
at walkers point wednesday afternoon 
were going fishing pronouncd a merry mulroney who added 
when asked what he and bush would talk about probably fish 
and lobster 
bush and wife barbara later took the mulroneys down the scenic 
kennebunk river in the presidents speedboat fidelity but they 
didnt appear to get in any fishing 
actually lobster was one of the few possible bones of contention 
for the two leaders to mull over 
maine lobstermen are griping that their canadian counterparts are 
depressing prices by catching and exporting lobsters smaller than 
can be caught legally in us waters maine gov john r mckernan 
wrote bush asking him to press mulroney on the issue 
while white house aides said in advance that the two were likely 
to talk about the drug crisis in colombia and events in lebanon and 
poland 
bush told a chamber of commerce luncheon wednesday this is a 
pure total vacation 
im not going to look busy in order to convince people in 
america that its something other than a vacation said bush who 
actually has already let far more work intrude on this vacation than 
his predecessor ronald reagan allowed during his woodchopping 
retreats to his santa barbara ranch 
bush approved a 65 million aid package for colombia last friday 
huddled with top advisers over drug strategy tuesday and flies back 
briefly to washington on friday to meet japans new prime minister 
toshiki kaifu before a final labor day weekend here 
bush who has had no success fishing despite daily outings since 
aug 16 told reporters while jogging that he was taking mrs bush 
with him for luck on his next fishing trip he said he would end the 
dry spell even if he has to murder some fish 
in an oceanside speech to the kennebunkkennebunkport chamber of 
commerce bush expressed chagrin at a vicious assault on my 
ability a graphic in the portland press herald showing a bluefish 
inside a circle with a line slashing through it indicating no fish 
bush complained a friend had caught a fish that very day while he 
was driving the boat 
i think they should knock off that advertisement telling me 
that yet a 13th day i havent caught one said bush who was named 
the resorts outstanding citizen of the year

injuring at least three 
police said firefighters had to cross a floor supported only by

planning to introduce a 1 million dinar banknote this fall the 
official tanjug news agency reported thursday

difficulties caused by the countrys 800 percent annual inflation 
rate one dollar was worth almost 30000 dinars on thursday 
the new bill which will probably appear on nov 1 will be the 
countrys secondlargest a 2 million dinar bill was put into 
circulation earlier in august 
yugoslavias soaring inflation rate has caused large bills to 
lose value rapidly with ever bigger denominations being issued 
yugoslavs and foreign tourists are obliged to carry huge 
quantities of paper money even when doing simple everyday shopping 
and banks and other financial institutions have reported growing 
confusion in counting handling and storing the vast quantities of 
small nearly worthless bills

eliminate several zeros from present denominations

next tuesday president bush will announce a new

not long ago what happened to ernest polo staley would have 
been unthinkable 
staley a 30yearold man from tallahassee fla was sentenced 
to life in prison without parole earlier this summer for dealing 
crack he had no prior criminal record 
ive represented people who took lives and received less of a 
sentence defense attorney robin rosen complained after the 
sentencing in federal court 
but staley was in the wrong place at the wrong time doing the 
wrong thing laws against drug abuse in the united states have 
changed dramatically in the past five years and while the only 
certain result so far has been overcrowded prisons and overburdened 
courts police and prosecutors say they now have far more potent 
weapons with which to fight drugs than they had a short time ago 
the laws have gotten tougher acknowledged hubert williams 
the former police chief of newark nj who now heads the police 
foundation in washington they are good and strong and effective 
for our purposes 
a decade ago drug laws were in remission the recreational drug 
use that had become popular during the late 1960s had fostered a new 
sense of permissiveness 
marijuana was decriminalized in some states and laws against it 
went unenforced in others strong laws against cocaine heroin and 
methamphetamines remained in place but the legal system was less 
eager than it once was to enforce them 
crack the cheap smokable form of cocaine ended that 
crack began showing up in a few large cities about five years ago 
and spread quickly across the country it led congress and nearly 
every state legislature to overhaul drug laws and impose much 
tougher penalties 
statistics on convictions and sentencings for drug crimes are 
scarce but those that exist suggest that more people are going to 
prison for drug crimes than ever before 
in new york state for instance the number of people serving 
time for drug crimes has risen more than 400 percent in the past 
seven years 
federal drug convictions have jumped 161 percent in the 1980s 
and the percentage of federal inmates serving time for drug crimes 
has more than doubled 
about half the inmates in federal prisons today were convicted of 
drug crimes and by 1995 the bureau of prisons expects seven out of 
every 10 to be a drug criminal thats in addition to the high 
percentage of convicts who were under the influence of drugs when 
they committed nondrug crimes such as murder 
one reason for the upswing is the antidrug laws that congress 
passed in 1984 1986 and 1988 they established mandatory jail terms 
and fixed sentences for drug offenders taking much of the 
sentencing discretion out of judges hands 
similar laws have been passed by most states and some have gone 
much further 
thats been the major outcry in the last decade lets get 
tough on the manufacturers and sellers and now its lets get 
tough on the users too said bob frohling who follows drug 
issues for the national conference of state legislatures 
in the past few years frohling said virtually every state has 
raised the penalties for drug crimes that occur in or around 
schools more than half have established stronger penalties for 
crack than for plain cocaine some have extended the death penalty 
to include murders committed during drug transactions 
in the most recent wave of legislation about twothirds of the 
states have enacted laws allowing law enforcement officials to seize 
the property of drug dealers 
its difficult to assess the effectiveness of these laws and 
some people believe they have been been failures 
the problem we have is not the strength of the laws but the 
application of the laws said williams of the police foundation 
mark kleiman a professor of criminal justice at harvards 
kennedy school of government said the emphasis on drug crimes has 
diverted police from other problems while doing little to stop drug 
abuse 
in lots of big cities burglary is effectively being 
decriminalized while we concentrate on crack dealers he said 
both kleiman and williams also say the cost of imprisoning drug 
criminals is getting out of hand in the federal prison system it 
costs 15000 a year to house one inmate plus 5000 in treatment 
costs for those with drug problems some people are beginning to 
look for alternatives 
washington state recently enacted one of the most comprehensive 
drug laws in the nation it includes tough new penalties and an 
additional 21 million for prison construction but it also provides 
for education and treatment and its supporters say that will be 
crucial to its success 
we wanted to attack the problem in just about every responsible 
way said house majority leader brian ebersole 
williams said preventing drug abuse is the only reasonable 
solution given the alternative of more police more courts and more 
prisons 
who can afford that he said what country can afford 
that

a noisy flap is brewing over a new quiet 
time rule to be imposed at the county treasurers office 
its a technique to help them plan their day explained 
assessortreasurer wendell brown 
its more like kindergarten said a disgruntled employee 
beginning tuesday for two hours each morning all but a few 
employees will be barred from receiving telephone calls 
conversation will be banned and movement around the office will be 
discouraged to give workers a quiet uninterrupted time to work at 
their desks brown said in a memo 
the idea has come under fire from employees and outsiders who 
deal frequently with the agency including developers and public 
officials 
give me a break said county auditor brian sonntag were 
in public service we only exist because people come to the 
counters 
the counter where people go to resolve assessment problems or pay 
taxes will be open during the quiet time but the attending staffers 
generally wont be allowed to go to other employees for immediate 
help 
i very seldom can get a question answered by the people at the 
counter said developer jeff christensen i usually have to go 
into the back room to get a question answered 
brown said he doubted many people would be turned away during 
quiet time i think 90 percent can be handled at the counter he 
said

soldiers in northern colombia killed five 
members of a paramilitary squad reportedly run by drug traffickers 
and police today said more than 500 people were arrested for 
violating a curfew in medellin 
american dependents of us embassy employees were advised by the 
state department to leave the country 
also in medellin a rocket hit a paint factory early today 
setting it on fire and injuring an undetermined number of people 
radio station rcn reported no one immediately claimed 
responsibility for the attack 
the 10 pmto6 am curfew was imposed in medellin and eight 
other cities as part of a nationwide crackdown on cocaine 
traffickers who have waged a campaign of assassinations bombings 
and arson in recent weeks 
medellin is considered the headquarters of the cartels that 
supply 80 percent of the cocaine to the united states 
national police said in a communique that 530 people were 
arrested for vioalting the first day of the curfew all but two had 
been released by this morning a police spokesman in medellin told 
the associated press 
meanwhile a paramilitary band believed affiliated with drug 
traffickers clashed with an army patrol in a remote area of the 
northern state of cesar the colombian radio chain rcn quoted 
military sources as saying 
five of the attackers were killed rcn quoted the army sources as 
saying 
leftist guerrillas seeking to topple the government have 
generally been inactive during the recent war with drug lords but 
new political violence broke out on wednesday 
six insurgents of the national liberation army were killed and 
one soldier was wounded in a battle wednesday in the state of cesar 
the bogota morning daily el tiempo said 
two policemen also were killed in a guerrilla ambush in the 
northeast state of arauca el tiempo said quoting police in arauca 
meanwhile 12 bodies were found in a shallow grave in the state 
of cordoba el tiempo said one of the victims reportedly was 
identified as a veterinarian kidnapped several months ago by leftist 
rebels 
leftist guerrillas also executed 10 of their own ranks 
apparently for suspicion of being traitors el tiempo said quoting 
sources with the armys 2nd division in the northern state of sucre 
in medellin a police force of 4000 was on full alert and 18 
special antiterrorist units were stationed throughout the city 
everything has started with no major inconveniencies people 
rushed to their homes shortly before the curfew time began and now 
the city is quiet a spokesman at the medellin police office said 
by telephone wednesday night 
he said a fragmentation grenade exploded in a country club but 
caused only minor damage 
interior minister orlando vasquez velazquez said the government 
would extend the curfew the first in colombia in 19 years 
wherever it is required to prevent terrorism 
he said medellin a city of 2 million had become a center of 
perturbation 
the us embassy gave no reason for ordering the dependents of 
its staff to leave but it was clearly related to the colombian 
campaign against drug traffickers and plans to extradite some 
suspects to the united states 
the extradition of one suspect reputed medellin cartel finance 
chief eduardo martinez romero was considered imminent 
an embassy spokesman peter samson said in a telephone 
interview us embassy dependents have been ordered to leave 
colombia in the next few days thats all i can tell you 
because of the recurring violence in colombia the embassy 
already had a policy of not allowing dependents under the age of 18 
but had permitted older children spouses parents and other adult 
dependents the embassy order would apply to up to 50 relatives of 
embassy staffers a source said 
the order also recommended that us students leave colombia the 
us state department last week urged american tourists to stay away 
from medellin to avoid the possibility of getting caught up in the 
violence there 
the city has suffered almost daily bombing attacks by drug 
traffickers who are pressing the government to end its 13dayold 
crackdown and negotiate a peace the government began its offensive 
after a string of assassinations that culminated aug 18 with the 
slaying of sen luis carlos galan the leading presidential hopeful 
authorities since have arrested several midlevel drug dealers in 
raids in which they seized more than 200 million in property 
including lavish estates office buildings airplanes and cars 
allegedly obtained with drug money 
the drug barons responded by declaring war on the government 
medellin and surrounding communities have been rocked by at least 
18 bombings and three arson attacks according to police reports 
several other bombs were found and deactivated 
in washington an administration source said wednesday that when 
president bush presents his drug control strategy next week he will 
call for up to 260 million in economic and military aid for the 
three principal cocaineproducing countries colombia peru and 
bolivia

vice premier yao yilin said thursday the 
government will take even tougher retrenchment measures in the next 
three years to reduce inflation and restore market order 
finance minister wang bingqian meanwhile predicted chinas 
money shortage wil grow more acute next year when more foreign loans 
start coming due 
the two officials delivered their sober assessments of chinas 
economic situation to the standing committee of the national 
peoples congress the legislature which began meeting tuesday 
yao said consumer demand continued to grow and many measures 
intended to cut investment didnt work as expected the official 
xinhua news agency reported workers income is still growing faster 
than their productivity he said and agricultural growth still lags 
far behind that of industry 
the government will take tougher measures in the comming three 
years to accomplish the ongoing economic retrenchment xinhua said 
yao reported it gave no specifics of what measures would be taken 
however the official china daily reported earlier thursday the 
government would crack down on illegal trading in key raw materials 
such as coal and steel eliminate middlemen in the distribution 
chain discipline illegal raw material dealers and begin an 
investigation of private businesses to ensure they pay taxes 
it quoted xie mingan of the ministry of materials and equipment 
as saying efforts would be made to control steel and coal prices and 
the trend of privatizing distribution of more and more materials 
would be halted 
the government said monday that any local officials who fail to 
cut investment will be punished 
the government has been trying since september 1988 to reassert 
many controls over the economy that were weakened or abolished over 
a decade of reform inflation that peaked at about 36 percent it 
now is running at a 25 percent annual rate combined with shortages 
of key materials hoarding black marketeering and panic runs on 
banks triggered the pullback 
measures already taken include orders to cut capital 
construction new restrictions on borrowing and government control 
of the prices and distribution of some goods 
yao told the legislature that the policies had succeeded in 
cutting industrial growth production in the first seven months of 
the year was up just 106 percent from the same period last year 
which had been up 17 percent from the year before that 
he said bank savings were up wang said state revenue exceeded 
expenditures over the seven months although revenue grew more 
slowly than spending 
but both officials spoke gloomily of the future xinhua headlined 
wangs report financial situation dire and quoted yao as 
saying china faces great economic difficulty 
wang noted that government subsidies have ballooned in recent 
years as it has bailed out inefficient stateowned companies and 
tried to give farmers a better price for their grain while keeping 
groceries cheap for urban residents 
borrowing also has accelerated chinas foreign debt zero in 
1978 totaled 40 billion at the end of 1988 including 10 billion 
in shortterm loans 
the government also has borrowed 93 billion from its own 
citizens over the past decade by issuing treasury bonds many 
chinese workers are required to buy the bonds with the price 
automatically deducted from their pay 
wang blamed the problems on ousted party general secretary zhao 
ziyangs errors in financial decisions including violating what 
he called the socialist financial principle of balancing the 
budget zhao who lost his post in a power struggle in june over 
handling of the spring democracy protests had advocated rapid 
growth 
chinese officials have issued repeated assurances recently that 
the country will be able to repay its debt

polands only rabbi said thursday he wont 
join leaders of other religions in a prayer for peace marking the 
50th anniversary of world war iis start because of a roman catholic 
convent at auschwitz 
organizers had pointed to the participation of the rabbi a 
survivor of the nazi death camp as evidence that jews were not 
boycotting the event led by roman catholics and bringing to warsaw 
representatives of many other faiths 
i personally will not participate in the joint prayers when i 
go to auschwitz i cannot pray there because i am disturbed by a 
cross and the carmelite convent there said rabbi menachem 
joskowicz 
one cannot be barred from prayer at auschwitz and at the same 
time participate in joint prayers in warsaw said the rabbi who 
arrived in poland in june 
the world prayer for peace was designed to foster understanding 
among religions polishborn pope john paul ii is to give an address 
via a giant tv screen in warsaws royal castle square on friday the 
anniversary of the german invasion of poland that started the war 
this is a moment for peace and reconciliation a meeting of 
international friendship a day of peace brotherhood of all the 
worlds relgions said roman catholic monsignior pietro rossano 
rector of the pontifical lateram university in rome 
but jewishcatholic relations have been strained by the decision 
by the archbishop of krakow to abandon a 1987 accord to move the 
carmelite convent from the perimeter of auschwitz and by a speech 
by cardinal jozef glempany 
international jewish leaders were invited to the event but said 
they could not come said mario marazziti a prayer day organizer 
marazziti said the convent controversy may be one of the 
reasons but not the only reason for the lack of greater jewish 
participation 
there are no jews on the list of religious representatives for 
the event 
marazziti said three representatives of the jewish community were 
attending the conference but they were academic rather than 
religious leaders 
jacob neusner of the institute for advanced study at princeton 
unversity called the convent dispute a heartbreaking conflict 
between catholics and jews that shows the need for religions to 
learn to accommodate each other 
marazziti said he received confirmation aug 20 that joskowitz 
would attend the prayer and had only heard informally that he would 
not 
the rev wieslaw nieweglowski a prayer organizer for the polish 
catholic episcopate said he did not know about the rabbis refusal 
to take part 
on wednesday andrea riccardi of the catholic community of st 
egidio that organized the prayer day denied jews were boycotting and 
pointed to the rabbis participation 
joskowitz said he would instead lead services saturday at 
warsaws only synagogue in memory of the 5000 jews who died 
fighting with the polish army during the war events also are 
scheduled at the monument to the warsaw ghetto uprising and at the 
jewish cemetery large sections of which have become overgrown 
organizers of the peace prayer scheduled a trip to the 
international monument at birkenau the main extermination camp for 
jews in the auschwitz complex 
jewish groups and others view the convent as an intrusion of 
christian religious symbols at the world war ii death camp complex 
built in southern poland mainly to exterminate jews among the 4 
million killed there at least 25 million were jews and joskowitz 
called the site our biggest jewish cemetery 
protests increased after the passing of a feb 22 deadline for 
moving the nuns to an interfaith prayer center farther away in one 
incident an american rabbi and six students were roughed up while 
being removed from the grounds 
on saturday glemp delivered a speech intended to quiet 
international criticism after the krakow archbishops aug 10 
announcement on the convent instead the controversy seemed fueled 
by glemps statement that antisemitism would disappear if jews 
abandoned antipolonism or antipolish sentiments 
i cannot believe that cardinal glemp thought what he was 
reported to have said said joskowitz recalling a recent cordial 
meeting with him 
i cannot speak for him but if i were him i would make some 
declaration which would correct it this would extinguish in 
time the glimmer of antisemitism 
i dont want poland to become the country from which the flame 
of antisemitism would start it is easy to extinguish it now 
when it is only a little glimmer but such a glimmer may in the end 
burn the whole house said the rabbi 
only several thousand jews remain in poland from a prewar 
population of 35 million about 3 million jews were among the 6 
million poles killed during world war ii and most of the rest have 
emigrated 
there are so few of us left in poland and it would be a pity if 
those few also left i personally came after 45 years because i 
wanted the jewry to rise again on this ruin said joskowitz who 
survived the lodz ghetto and auschwitz to emigrate to israel in 1947 
i would not like to leave it all again if antisemitism starts 
in which case these few thousand jews in poland would lose their 
rabbi he said

osha said employers must guarantee that the machinery cannot be 
accidentally activated during repairs and maintenance and that 
workers cannot be exposed to electrical current during that work 
the rule requires most employers to guarantee the protection by 
installing locks that cut machines off from their power supply it 
will cost the affected establishments 214 million in the next year 
for the necessary equipment and training and 135 million in 
subsequent years osha said those costs will range from 120 for 
small establishments such as a small print shop to 28000 for 
large plants with scores of machines osha said 
the regulation a decade in the making is tougher in its final 
form than when proposed the government initially said employers 
could either install locks to prevent accidental activation of 
equipment during repairs or place warning tags on the power source 
to alert workers that the machinery was being worked on and was not 
to be activated 
the final rule places a greater emphasis on locks allowing tags 
only when an employer can prove that equipment cannot be locked 
off a power supply or that its tag program is as effective as using 
locks because of the additional training required to meet that 
threshold it would cost employers more to use tags than it would to 
install locks said alan mcmillan acting osha chief he said 90 
percent of electrically powered machinery is capable of being locked 
we have so many fatalities loss of fingers crushed bones and 
other serious injuries because these precautions are not taken 
mcmillan said in an interview this will have a major effect on 
workplace safety 
the provision allowing use of tags will not apply to new 
equipment or machines that are taken off line for major 
modifications mcmillan said in those cases locks must be used 
the rule which takes effect oct 31 also requires annual 
training of all affected workers employers also must inventory all 
equipment covered by the rule and establish a written plan for 
cutting off power during repairs 
the standard applies to most machinery used in manufacturing and 
in services such as industrial laundries osha data show that 
packaging and wrapping equipment printing presses and conveyors 
account for a high proportion of accidents blamed on a failure to 
cut off power during major maintenance and repairs typical 
accidents in such situations include electrocution and shock and 
getting limbs caught in moving parts when a machine lurches on 
the rules do not apply to construction or maritime industries as 
is its custom osha will use separate rulemaking procedures to 
tailor the requirments to those industries separate standards also 
are being developed for utilities

world war ii began 50 years ago 
friday one of many events marking the grim anniversary will be a 
concert in warsaw the first target of blitzkrieg adolf hitlers 
fearsome lightning war 
the soviet union called the conflict the most horrible and 
destructive of all wars an ultraconservative west german cabinet 
minister said germans should not bear all the blame 
more than 50 million people were killed in the war touched off by 
the german invasion of poland on sept 1 1939 the nazi 
extermination of 6 million jews shocked the world like no other 
atrocity 
major events are scheduled for friday in west germany east 
germany and poland including an internationally broadcast concert 
in warsaw conducted by leonard bernstein 
pope john paul ii used the occasion to declare we have a duty 
to learn from the past so that never again will there arise a set of 
factors capable of triggering a similar conflagration 
in the statement issued last weekend he called the nazi 
slaughter of jews something which will forever remain a shame for 
humanity 
john paul is to address his polish countrymen friday evening by 
means of a huge television screen set up in royal castle square in 
warsaws old city 
tass the official soviet news agency said thursday the sad 
jubilee 50 years since the beginning of the most horrible and 
destructive of all wars requires that the world public not only 
learn the lessons of the past anew but also determine guidelines 
for the future 
its commentary repeated soviet calls for a reduction of armed 
forces and weapons in europe 
neues deutschland the official newspaper of east germanys 
communist party said the most important historical lesson of 
sept 1 1939 consists of never again letting fascism return 
in hitlers native austria which he occupied and annexed in 1938 
without firing a shot the popular tabloid kurier is running a daily 
series it calls hitlers war 
it scarcely ever happened in history that the responsibility 
for a war was so clear the newspaper said monday it was in 
the end the work of one man it was hitlers war 
austria has claimed to be the dictators first victim 
news media politicians and intellectuals in west germany have 
used the anniversary for a review of nazi atrocities 
special events included a concert thursday night in frankfurt 
featuring violinist annesophie mutter and polish composer krzysztof 
penderecki conducting his polish requiem 
as a gesture of reconciliation the government said it was 
willing to return the polish embassy in berlin seized by the nazis 
in 1941 to polish ownership 
the far right in germany has taken the opportunity to try to 
shift some of the blame 
theo waigel the federal finance minister said he did not want 
to deny one iota of german guilt for the nazi era and the war 
but declared a onesided view of history with the conclusion that 
only the germans are burdened with guilt would be unbearable and 
would lead to dangerous condemnations 
waigel did not say who should share the guilt but many on the 
far right claim soviet dictator josef stalin also was responsible 
the minister wrote in the latest issue of the bayernkurier party 
organ of his ultraconservative christian social union 
franz schoenhuber leader of the extremist republican party 
spoke of the war guilt of the soviets who together with hitler 
brought the people of eastern europe under their yoke a 
reference to the soviet absorption of estonia latvia and lithuania 
under a 1939 pact with hitler 
schoenhuber said an international panel of historians should be 
appointed to reassess whether germans alone were responsible for the 
war 
at a service in berlin west german jewish leader heinz galinski 
denounced the resurgence of rightwing extremism in germany 
anniversary events in hungary included a live hookup with the 
voice of america the bbc and swiss radio thursday night for a 
dicussion show about the causes of the war and the postwar division 
of europe

the council of state today appointed 
comptroller francisco rodriguez as president of panama as it moved 
to fill the vacuum created by the cancellation of the presidential 
election on may 7 
the new government takes over friday the same day the term of 
acting president manuel solis expires 
todays appointments assure the continuation of gen manuel 
antonio noriega as commander of the military known as the 
panamanian defense forces and as the countrys de facto leader 
foreign minister jorge ritter who resigned wednesday night said 
rodriguez was appointed president and carlos ofores was named vice 
president ritter spoke with reporters after the council of state 
met in closed session 
there was no official announcement by the council of state which 
is up of about 40 people including cabinet ministers heads of 
government agencies and military leaders the civilian president 
will be the formal head of the council of state which will continue 
to be controlled by noriega 
sources said the new government will abolish the national 
assembly and replace it with 41 appointed legislators the sources 
who spoke on condition of anonymity said the new government will 
evaluate the countrys situation in six months before deciding on 
the possibility of holding new elections 
rodriguez an economist has been comptroller for seven years he 
is a veteran administrator who has held mostly economic positions 
government officials have refused to discuss what shape the 
government would take but sources said wednesday that it appeared 
it would consist of a junta with civilian and military 
representatives 
the government will have the blessing of noriega who met today 
with current government officials including cabinet members and 
agency heads 
since noriega was indicted on drug charges in florida in february 
1988 the us government has demanded his ouster 
in washington us deputy secretary of state lawrence 
eagleburger was to present new drug charges against panama at a 
special meeting today of the organization of american states 
officials said 
the 31nation session was set at us request after panama last 
week challenged the bush administration for evidence of its charges 
of drug involvement against noriega 
the government announced the arrest wednesday of several members 
of the opposition christian democratic party on charges of planning 
sabotage activities and increased security nationwide in 
anticipation of protests 
paramilitary groups organized into national defense 
committees trained at various sites in the capital and government 
agencies announced they were placing themselves in a state of alert 
but opposition leaders said they did not plan any street protests 
friday they said the arrests were part of a military campaign of 
propaganda and repression 
christian democratic leader ricardo arias calderon said the new 
government would be a continuation of the military dictatorship 
the changes are superficial added former opposition 
presidential candidate guillermo endara 
they are thinking of a government junta endara said they 
are not thinking of elections 
the winner of the presidential election held may 7 was supposed 
to have taken office on friday 
endara was the opposition candidate and international observers 
said he won but the government annulled the balloting alleging 
that us interference and support for the political opposition 
distorted the results 
opposition leaders complain that the united states has 
concentrated its campaign against noriega on drug trafficking 
charges at the expense of the antidemocratic aspects of the 
government 
our argument with noriega is over the democratization of 
panama arias calderon added the united states has a different 
perspective 
opposition leaders say the oas was partial to noriega in failing 
to condemn the general and the government for annulling the 
presidential elections 
oas members could not agree last week on a declaration about 
panama based on a report by a special mission that visited panama 
five times since may to seek a negotiated settlement between the 
opposition and the government 
endara said he did not expect any favorable action by the oas at 
todays meeting unless there is a drastic change of attitude i 
would be surprised if it happens

a judge suspended jim bakkers fraud and 
conspiracy trial today and ordered the ptl founder committed for 
psychiatric testing after he was told bakker suffered hallucinations 
and was found cowering under a couch 
us district judge robert potter ordered bakker who was not in 
court at the time to be taken to the federal corrections facility 
in butner to see if he is competent to stand trial 
potters court order allows bakker to be held at the institution 
for up to 60 days assistant us attorney mike scofield said 
psychiatric evaluations normally take about 45 days 
a sobbing disheveled bakker was later brought to the courthouse 
then taken away in handcuffs 90 minutes later to the mental facility 
the fourth day of bakkers trial opened with his psychiatrist 
dr basil jackson testifying in a brief hearing out of the jurys 
presence that bakker was lying in the corner of his attorneys 
office with his head under a couch hiding he was expressing 
thoughts that someone was going to hurt him 
jackson who has been treating bakker for nine months said 
bakker suffered hallucinations after breaking down wednesday when a 
witness collapsed during crossexamination that witness former ptl 
vice president steve nelson was back at the courthouse today 
saying he felt better 
mr bakker reported that when he left the courthouse suddenly 
people outside took on the form of frightening animals which he felt 
were intent on destroying him attacking him and hurting him said 
jackson a milwaukee psychiatrist whom the prosecution dismissed as 
a hired gun 
potter summoned the jurors and told them the trial was being 
delayed without saying why he instructed them to check with the 
courthouse tuesday to see if the trial would resume wednesday 
after potter suspended the trial us marshals drove bakker from 
his attorneys office to the courthouse 
mr bakker im going to have to ask you to sit up please a 
deputy marshal said to bakker after he curled up in fetal position 
in the back seat 
jackson asked that bakker be sent to an unidentified private 
hospital but potter instead ordered marshals to deliver bakker to 
the butner facility 
jackson said bakker had not agreed to be voluntarily committed 
assistant us attorney jerry miller told potter the defense had 
presented its motion for a psychiatric evaluation just 15 minutes

quoting the evangelist as saying i want to go to court i want to 
be on trial davis told the judge bakker lay on the floor in a 
fetal position 
it was not the first time that bakker was described as 
emotionally distraught since the ptl scandal broke his wife tammy 
faye said in a fundraising letter to supporters last fall that he 
lay in a fetal position for hours after he was forced to leave the 
ministry in march 1987 
mrs bakker was in florida continuing broadcasts of the couples 
evangelistic cable television show todays show made no mention of

orders to us factories slumped 17 percent in 
july to the lowest level in eight months the government said 
thursday in a report indicating that although a recession appears 
remote growth remains subdued 
the commerce department said orders for both durable and 
nondurable manufactured goods totaled a seasonally adjusted 2313 
billion it was the lowest level since november and the second 
decline in three months 
orders rose 06 percent in june and fell 26 percent in may 
recently a string of strong statistical reports have indicated 
that fears of a recession this year are overblown retail sales 
personal income and housing construction all rose in july while 
unemployment edged down 
however economists said thursdays report which showed 
weakerthanexpected factory orders suggested the economy is still 
far from robust 
the manufacturing sector is struggling said economist robert 
g dederick of northern trust co in chicago so far this hasnt 
dragged down the aggregate economy but it may yet 
forecaster william k macreynolds of the us chamber of commerce 
blames the slowdown on the federal reserve boards program during 
the first five months of 1989 to fight inflation by boosting 
interest rates 
the policy has particularly hurt manufacturers that produce big 
ticket durable goods such as autombiles and appliances goods 
consumers usually buy on credit he said 
since early june the central bank has reversed course allowing 
rates to decline slightly but macreynolds noted theyve only 
backed off part way 
based on their statements i dont expect them to ease further 
and unfortunately that could be a disaster for the economy he 
said 
if weakness in manufacturing persists it will lead to layoffs 
and a rise in the unemployment rate he warned 
i think its already happening macreynolds said i expect 
unemployment to rise through the rest of the year as a result of the 
slowdown that is happening now 
in two other signs of sluggishness shipments of manufactured 
goods fell 19 percent the sharpest drop since march 1986 and 
inventories shot up 11 percent the biggest jump in five years 
a runup in inventories without a corresponding increase in new 
orders can signal production cutbacks in the future as factories 
attempt to get rid of goods on shelves and backlots 
the rise in inventories is a warning that despite our good 
track record over the last several years in managing inventories it 
is still possible that if the economy slows down rising 
inventories can exacerbate a downturn said economist john hagens 
of the wefa group a bala cynwyd pa consulting firm 
the economists predicted that manufacturing will remain sluggish 
this year the rise in the value of the dollar since late 1988 will 
take the edge off booming export sales they said and businesses 
in turn will purchase fewer capital goods such as machinery and 
computers 
in july orders for durable goods items expected to last three 
or more years fell 22 percent a revision from last weeks 
estimate of a 19 percent decline orders for nondurable goods fell 
11 percent 
in the key category of nondefense capital goods a barometer of 
business investment plans orders rose 57 percent in july after 
gaining 50 percent a month earlier 
however hagens noted the upturn was wholly concentrated in 
aircraft orders which are booming as airline companies worldwide 
replace their aging fleets 
a 383 percent increase in new orders for aircraft in july pushed 
the transportation sector up 26 percent despite weakness in 
automobile manufacturing and shipbuilding 
much of the months weakness was concentrated in orders for 
military goods down 145 percent and nonelectrical machinery 
down 105 percent 
orders fell for glass products fabricated metal products 
engines and turbines construction and mining equipment computers 
electronic components and scientific instruments they rose for 
communications equipment

the american legion said thursday it has 
received about 1 million signatures on a petition seeking a 
constitutional amendment against desecration of the american flag 
senate republican leader robert dole of kansas appearing at a 
press conference with american legion national commander hf 
gierke said legislation calling for the amendment has been 
scheduled for senate floor action oct 16 
the house will consider a bill sept 12 that would create a 
federal law against flag desecration but not amend the constitution 
its a long process dole said of the amendment route which 
requires approval by twothirds of the house and senate and 
ratification by threefourths of the states 
but he said the issue was one that deserved consideration by 
the states 
gierke said that the legion was getting about 40000 signatures a 
day in its nationwide petition drive which still goes on 
the constitutional process requires constitutional assurances 
well do the right thing said sen john warner rva who also 
appeared at the news conference 
proponents of the amendment say it rather than a statute is 
needed so that the supreme court will not rule the prohibition 
unconstitutional earlier this year the court touched off the 
controversy by deciding that burning the flag was a constitutionally 
protected form of political protest 
many lawmakers and constitutional law experts oppose the 
amendment saying that while emotionally offensive flagburning is 
not a serious enough offense to merit curtailment of freespeech 
protections 
the house bill includes penalties of up to a year in prison plus 
an unspecified fine for physically desecrating a flag and was 
drafted to address the high courts decision that existing statutes 
against flag burning were an attempt to squelch free speech 
reps gerald solomon rny and chuck douglas rnh who also 
attended the news conference said the fight in the house for an 
amendment would be much tougher than in the senate 
house majority leader richard gephardt dmo has said the 
democrats want to try a statute before a constitutional amendment to 
avoid adding political graffiti to the constitution

members were referred to the human rights commission the other 
permanent members are the united sates soviet union britain and 
france

those imprisoned after the army brutally suppressed prodemocracy

government of china and other reliable sources 
china rejected the resolution as interference in its internal 
affairs 
asbjorn eide a norwegian member of the subcommission described

human rights commission which includes delegates from 43

agriculture secretary clayton yeutter said 
thursday the farmers home administration has turned from being a 
lender into a grant agency and that he is determined to put it 
on a more businesslike footing 
weve just got to reform that program take it out of the 
status of what its really become a grant agency and move it 
back to being a credit institution once again yeutter said 
the fmha has its roots in the great depression of the 1930s and 
is often called the governments farm lender of last resort to be 
eligible for loans farmers must be unable to get regular loans from 
banks or other commercial institutions 
yeutter said the agriculture department agency has made 
billions of dollars of questionable loans over the last decade or 
so many of which are in default today 
but he noted that attempts have been made to change fmha and to 
toughen its lending practices only to be thwarted by legal action 
filed by farmers or their advocates or by congress 
if we have to change legislation in this area in order to do a 
more effective and skillful job of managing fmha well make 
legislative proposals to have that happen yeutter told a 
television news conference if we can do it administratively 
well do it that way 
for years the fmha has been embroiled in controversial attempts 
to collect longoverdue farm loans new procedures to help protect 
the interests of farmers and to enable the agency to proceed with 
its collections were included by congress in the agricultural credit 
act of 1987 
the latest move involves fmha sending out a new batch of 
collection notices to borrowers who failed to make their scheduled 
payments by the first of this year 
agency spokesman marlyn aycock said the fmhas county offices 
were told to mail out the collection notices by aug 25 so that 
delinquent borrowers could have them by sept 1 
the county offices were sent lists of delinquents totaling 13217 
borrowers as of aug 1 and were instructed to delete names of those 
who had settled their accounts since then 
aycock said those deletions possibly could reduce the list to 
between 11000 and 12000 names by the time they were mailed out 
last week 
but we wont get an actual count until farther down the road 
he said 
the list of delinquencies has shrunk dramatically since jan 1 
when it was more than 30000 borrowers he said by july 3 it was 
down to 15704 names and the aug 1 count dropped to 13217 the 
basic list sent to county offices 
borrowers will have 45 days from receipt of the notices to return 
forms to fmha describing how they want to settle their overdue 
accounts the 1987 law requires the agency to tell farmers they have 
certain options including reamortization or rescheduling payment 
deferral reduced interest rates and in some cases debt 
forgiveness 
if farmers do not respond or if a borrower is in such poor 
financial shape that no alternative can be worked out forced sale 
or foreclosure proceedings could begin 
aycock said the latest notices are in addition to more than 
66000 sent out last fall to delinquent borrowers many of whom had 
not made payments for three years or more 
the total owed fmha by all delinquent borrowers is around 87 
billion although there is no breakdown showing how much the 1989 
notices involve he said

a senior energy department official violated a 
conflictofinterest law by participating in the award of a 1 
billion contract to a group of companies that included one of his 
former employers a federal judge found 
us claims court judge reginald gibson in a finding released 
thursday said samuel rousso had violated the federal statute 
prohibiting an energy department supervisor from participating in 
department decisions involving any energy company that the 
supervisor has worked for within the past year 
rousso is acting director of the department office administering 
a program to evaluate yucca mountain nev as a possible site for 
building the nations first permanent repository for highlevel 
radioactive waste from nuclear reactors 
gibsons finding on rousso was a central feature of a ruling he 
handed down last week that blocked the energy department from giving 
a 1 billion yucca mountain management contract to a group led by 
bechtel management systems inc a subsidiary of the san 
franciscobased engineering and construction giant 
gibson agreed with a contention by trw inc an unsuccessful 
bidder that rousso should not have been involved in weighing the 
bechtel teams bid for the yucca mountain project 
the clevelandbased company said rousso had previously worked for 
one of bechtels partners science applications international corp 
a san diegobased engineering and consulting firm that has played a 
major role in the yucca mountain project as an energy department 
contractor since 1983 
rousso declined to comment on gibsons finding 
i cant respond since im a key party to the case he said 
in a brief telephone conversation 
the department issued a terse statement thursday saying it was 
reviewing gibsons ruling and evaluating its legal and operational 
options and that in the meantime it would answer no questions 
about the matter 
phil keif a department spokesman said the department was not 
ruling out the possibility of seeking civil penalties against 
rousso even though government lawyers had argued during the 
sixweek claims court hearing last spring that there was no conflict 
of interest 
the conflictofinterest statute at issue in the case allows for 
civil penalties of up to 10000 for each violation to be imposed 
by the department head or a federal court 
in an interview earlier this week with the associated press 
rousso said he had acted in good faith and believed no conflict of 
interest had been shown by lawyers for trw which had sued 
department over roussos role 
i hold no pension rights no favoritism no job promises no 
thoughts to that regard and i dont see where any conflict of 
interest has been shown he said monday 
the gist of the ruling was made public last thursday but gibson 
sealed the actual opinion to allow the companies involved to review 
the document for any proprietary information or trade secrets that 
should not be publicly disclosed 
gibsons ruling has broad implications for the energy department 
which is struggling to revive a nuclear waste disposal program that 
has been plagued for years with costly delays scientific 
uncertainties and stiff opposition from the state of nevada 
rousso worked for science applications from october 1985 to may 
1986 he started working in the energy departments nuclear waste 
management office in june 1986 he was chairman of a department 
panel that studied the various yucca mountain contract bids and 
recommended on dec 2 1988 that the bechtel team be chosen the 
winner 
the energy department asserted in the claims court hearing that 
there was no conflict of interest because among other things 
rousso was not aware during the restricted oneyear period after he 
left science applications that the company was interested in the 
contract 
gibson however said he found clear and convincing evidence 
that mr rousso actually knew or at least should have known of 
science applications involvement in the contract bidding process 
gibson rebuked government lawyers for arguing that the 
desirability of enforcing conflictofinterest laws is not reason 
enough to conclude that it would be in the public interest to block 
the department from awarding the contract to the bechtel team 
this court will not sit idly by and blink at such 
transgressions on the part of government officials acting under the 
misguided assumption that such conduct does not harm the publics 
faith in the integrity of the procurement process gibson wrote

princess anne and mark phillips the royal couple 
rarely seen together on thursday admitted the open secret of their 
life apart with a palace statement that they are separating 
although have no plans to divorce 
the announcement ended rumors of strife that have dogged queen 
elizabeth iis only daughter and her commoner husband for more than 
half their 15year marriage 
it was the second time this century that a marriage in the 
immediate royal family has broken down the queens sister princess 
margaret separated from lord snowdon in 1976 and they divorced two 
years later 
her royal highness the princess royal and capt mark phillips 
have decided to separate on terms agreed between them said the 
short palace statement there are no plans for divorce 
proceedings 
if they want to file for divorce british law requires them to 
live apart for two years 
anne will live at the family estate gatcombe park in western 
england with their two children peter 11 and zara 8 while 
phillips will move to a home nearby the palace said marks father 
maj peter phillips said wednesday night that his son will move to 
aston farm on the estate 
the decision to split up was taken in principle earlier this 
year added a palace spokeswoman the queen who was at her 
balmoral castle in scotland was said by palace sources to be 
saddened but understanding 
anne 39 and phillips 40 have been spending up to half the 
year apart and tabloid newspapers have speculated about 
extramarital attachments for both 
the two avid equestrians met in 1968 at a dinner for the british 
olympic riding team and their glittering 1973 wedding in westminster 
abbey was broadcast to 500 million tv viewers 
anne was attending an international olympic committee meeting in 
puerto rico when the separation was announced and refused to answer 
reporters questions although she appeared unperturbed a source 
close to her said she was upset by the attention 
the princess who is seventh in line to the throne was not due 
back in britain until midseptember she will fly friday to belize 
on a fourday trip on behalf the save the children fund of which 
she is president from there she was scheduled to travel to ecuador

equestrian businesses was at gatcombe park 80 miles west of london 
and also was silent 
sharing a passion for horses anne and phillips have competed in 
olympic equestrian events and won riding championships 
but over the years they drifted apart at the 1984 and 1988 
olympics they stayed in different hotels and last year spent their 
15th wedding anniversary thousands of miles apart 
a former captain in the queens dragoon guards phillips 
describes himself as quiet and shy and a farmer at heart 
anne who has a biting wit and downtoearth manner was known as 
her royal haughtiness in the 1970s for her often cold and brisk 
manner 
but that image changed in the early 1980s as newspapers began to 
notice her devoted work for the save the children fund an 
international charity her courage in visiting dangerous corners of 
the globe and her willingness to roll up her sleeves and work for 
the poor and hungry made her one of the most respected members of 
the royal family 
she is a patron of more than 75 charities and 23 military groups 
on april 6 the sun britains biggestcirculation tabloid 
reported it had been handed four stolen letters written to anne by a 
man who turned out to be a palace aide and navy officer tim 
laurence 35 
late in august laurence left the queens service to take command 
of a frigate but was awarded the royal victorian order for 
extraordinary important or personal services to the sovereign or 
the royal family 
phillips said at that time that his marriage was fine and 
happy 
barbara cartland romantic novelist and a stepgrandmother of 
annes sisterinlaw princess diana said changing times and public

human beings im not surprised they behave like human beings

a 1 million bomb detector that the federal 
aviation administration starts operating friday at a new york 
airport is not sensitive enough to spot an explosive like the one 
that destroyed pan am flight 103 last december science magazine 
reports 
the magazine the journal for the american association for the 
advancement of science said the bomb detector called a thermal 
neutron analysis device or tna is being set at a sensitivity that 
will uncover about 25 pounds of plastic explosives 
science said that british experts believe the bomb that brought 
down pan am flight 103 over lockerbie scotland on dec 21 
contained only about one pound of explosive the crash killed 270 
people 
a tna bomb detector has been installed in a special building at 
jfk airport in new york and will go into operation for international 
twa flights on friday faa officials said the agency said that it 
wants us airlines to spend about half a billion dollars to install 
491 of the machines at international airports over the next five 
years 
the bomb finder is a 10ton 13footlong machine it uses 
neutrons a type of subatomic particle to probe luggage for the 
presence of nitrogen a major component of explosives the luggage 
passes through the machine on a conveyor belt and if nitrogen of a 
certain level is detected the machine indicates the source 
enabling operators to seperate suspicious bags 
science said the machine is so massive that it requires special 
construction to install increasing the cost of deploying the 1 
million machine 
a problem with the system is that some types of fabric leather 
and such things as plastic ski boots can have nitrogen densitities 
are high as explosives 
if heavy trunks and woolen clothing are involved it becomes 
hard to distinguish a real bomb from background readings creating 
false alarms the magazine said 
to avoid an excess of false alarms science said the machine will 
be operated at a sensitivity to detect about 25 pounds of plastic 
explosives 
this sensitivity the magazine said will produce a false alarm 
rate of about 5 percent on a fullyloaded jumbo jet such a false 
alarm rate would represent about 30 pieces of luggage that would 
require special handling the magazine said 
raymond salazar the director of the office of civil aviation 
security for the faa acknowledged that the false alarm rate for the 
detector that goes into operation on friday could be as high as 5 
percent but he declined to discuss the level of sensitivity used in 
the device 
it seems to me to not be in anybodys best interest to make 
those kinds of disclosures he said in a telephone interview 
this technology can be programed to find a full range of 
explosive devices 
he said the false alarm rate may be reduced to 2 percent to 3 
percent when the detector is teamed with an xray system the device 
would detect the possible presence of explosives and the xray would 
actually examine the interior of each piece of luggage 
the tna currently cannot be used to check carryon bags the 
technology involves the use of ionized radiation which has some 
potential health hazard the magazine said 
it isnt applicable to passenger screening salazar agreed 
salazar said that suspicious bags detected by the tna device will 
require some special handling but he believes that any delay in 
flights will be minimized he declined to describe the special 
handling 
science magazine said that the airlines are not happy with the 
prospect of even a 5 percent error rate 
the airlines cannot cope with such large requirements for 
handsearching luggage and they want to reduce the tna machines 
alarm rate to about 1 percent the magazine said the rate that 
they would face if the tna machine were adjusted to scan routinely 
for 1pound bombs would be unacceptably high and thus the machine 
would almost never be used this way 
edith holleman on the staff of the house government operations 
subcommittee that oversees the faa said there was concern among 
members of the committee that the device will not protect against 
small size bombs 
the pam am flight 103 bomb would have gone right through 
said ms holleman 
she blamed the sensitivity setting used on the insistance by 
airlines to hold false alarm readings to a minimum 
the airlines cannot function in a commercial way with more than 
a certain number of false alarms she said 
congressional hearings on the tna machine deployment have been 
announced for sept 26 by rep cardiss collins dill who chairs 
the government operations subcommittee

wildlife officials will split the only captive 
colony of endangered whooping cranes to reduce the chances of 
disease or disaster wiping out the flock 
the us fish and wildlife service said this week that 22 of the 
54 birds at the patuxent wildlife research center will be sent in 
november to the international crane foundation in baraboo wis 
the service has been concerned about having all of their eggs 
in one basket literally david trauger the patuxent centers 
deputy director 
the service felt it was the prudent thing to do to separate 
the breeding flocks and theres enough breeders now to do that 
the center started in 1987 to breed the rare birds known for 
their elaborate courtship dance under a joint program with canadian 
wildlife officials 
a wild flock of the cranes migrates to texas for the winter from 
canada 2400 miles away this year 138 made the migration before 
conservation efforts began there were only 21 whooping cranes in 
texas in the winter 
scientists hope that by breeding whooping cranes in captivity 
they will be able to establish another flock in the wild

president bush and canadian prime 
minister brian mulroney said today they stand ready in mulroneys 
words to help colombia stomp out the terror of drugs 
in a seaside news conference at bushs vacation home the two 
leaders chatted about what bush called an unusually productive 
visit that included airing differences on two trade issues 
lobsters and pork 
but the two leaders both casually dressed directed most of 
their attention to international issues including ongoing efforts 
to oust panamanian dictator manuel antonio noriega 
on the situation in panama where noriega has thwarted the 
scheduled transition to democracy bush acknowledged feeling a 
high frustration level with us efforts to dislodge the dictator 
but he added we are not going to give up on this we are not 
going to permit the will of the people of panama to be thwarted by 
this dictator 
bush said ive never seen a coming together in world opinion 
as there is on this one that noriega ought to get out 
after the two leaders concluded their 35minute news conference 
white house chief of staff john sununu predicted the presidents new 
antidrug package will cost 78 billion almost 2 billion above 
current spending levels bush will unveil it on tuesday 
asked whether he favored use of a multilateral military to help 
colombia wipe out the drug cartels bush replied the main thing 
is to cooperate with president virgilio barco in the ways that he 
feels would be most effective 
bush added there is no point on canada or the united states or 
any group of countries imposing its will on a country that is 
now trying very very hard to rid itself of this menace 
mulroney said he and bush were in complete agreement on 
the need to support a very courageous leader in colombia and the 
need to stomp out by every reasonable means the terror of drugs 
while bush said there was broad agreement between the united 
states and canada on trade there are still bumps in the road 
asked whether he favored a multilateral force to fight colombias 
drug cartels bush said he didnt want to do something or say 
something that would be counterproductive and turn public opinion 
against president barcos efforts 
but he said an international effort on whatever line it is 
aid help of any kind would be useful 
on the lobster dispute mulroney said the president was big on 
lobsters today i was big on pork because we feel that the americans 
have just imposed an unfair tariff on pork 
he said they had discussed the mechanisms to resolve the pork 
dispute under the free trade agreement 
mulroney said bush advanced some persuasive arguments that i 
have instructed my officials to begin examining on the lobsters 
maine lobstermen say the canadians catch lobsters so small they have 
not even had a chance to reproduce 
mulroney who leaves with his family later today said they had 
been swimming boating and doing other activities including a 
little fishing by me mulroney like bush throughout his 16 days 
here on vacation caught nothing 
mulroney offered the impartial international assessment of the 
fact that there are no fish out there i can certify to that its 
not the presidents fault 
on another issue bush said he was considering increasing 
emergency food shipments to poland that is one area where we 
ought to be able to do more he said

a reagan administration official last year 
urged repeal of a program to assist the homeless but several 
department of health and human services officials warned against 
such a move in an election year according to documents released 
thursday 
such an effort would undoubtedly be unsuccessful and could 
unfortunately be interpreted as a lack of in interest in the plight 
of the homeless by this department thus subjecting the secretary 
and the administration to strong criticism of a politically 
sensitive and visible issue during an election year one 
department of health and human services official wrote in response 
to the recommendation from then social security commissioner dorcas 
hardy 
in that memo robert docksai then the departments assistant 
secretary for legislation also warned that it would be 
politically untenable to attempt to repeal the program under 
which the government was to fund efforts to screen the homeless 
population for people eligible for social security 
the memo in which hardy made the recommendation to thenhhs 
secretary otis bowen and a number of subsequent internal hhs memos 
discussing the idea were released by the national law center on 
homelessness and poverty which had criticized the reagan 
administration for not implementing the program 
the documents show that while several hhs officials appeared to 
agree with hardys recommendation they did not believe congress 
would agree to the repeal and also suspected that even suggesting 
such a move would hurt the gop in last years presidential election 
the law center obtained the documents under the freedom of 
information act 
we agree that the department should not seek an appropriation 
for the program assistant secretary for health steven a grossman 
wrote in an april 1988 memo however if we actively work to 
repeal the legislation the administration risks being portrayed as 
uncaring for the homeless since nothing is happening at the moment 
silence seems the best policy given the politics of homeless 
issues 
in a letter to bush administration hhs secretary louis sullivan 
the advocacy group said the program still has not been funded 
this policy is reprehensible it is also illegal maria 
foscarinis of the law center said in the letter to sullivan i ask 
that you reverse this policy by implementing the outreach program at 
once 
a sullivan spokesman did not immediately return a telephone 
message left thursday 
the program was authorized by congress in 1987 it was designed 
to create an hhsadministered pilot program under which the federal 
government would provide money to state and local governments that 
established teams to identify homeless people potentially eligible 
for social security benefits congress authorized 375 million for 
the program and said up to 1 million should be taken from social 
security administration surplus funds to pay for implementation of 
the program

an american jesuit priest who was 
jailed by ferdinand marcos for criticizing the government said 
thursday the churchs greatest recent achievement was helping oust 
the former president 
the rev james bertram reuter jr made the remarks during 
ceremonies at which he was awarded the 1989 ramon magsaysay prize 
for journalism literature and creative communications arts 
a malaysian an indian a south korean and a technological school 
in thailand also were honored by the magsaysay foundation 
the awards were presented thursday by the foundation on the 82nd 
birthday of the late president ramon magsaysay jr 
the most spectacular contribution of the church to the world in 
recent years through media was edsa said reuter referring to a 
highway where mutinous soldiers took control of the militarys 
headquarters to start a fourday revolt that toppled marcos and 
propelled corazon aquino to the presidency 
it was the first revolution in history to be run by radio 
reuter added he said the roman catholic church led by manilas 
archbishop cardinal jaime sin called on the people to march in the 
streets as a sign of support for the rebellious soldiers 
sins call was made over the churchs radio station veritas 
troops loyal to marcos destroyed the churchs transmitter but the 
radio station continued airing information about the revolt using 
another radio station 
it was an accident of history that the church was in position 
at that time reuter said we had the equipment we had the 
personnel we had the organization and we had the courage to do 
it 
reuter who has lived in the philippines for more than 40 years 
ran a weekly newsletter that had been critical of marcos rule when 
martial law was declared in 1972 the newspaper was closed and he 
was placed under house arrest for two years 
the other winners were zakiah hanum binti abdul hamid of malaysia 
for government service sri lakshmi chand jain of india for public 
service kim imsoon of south korea for community leadership and 
the asian institute of technology based in thailand 
each winner received a gold medallion a scroll and 30000

new regulations designed to make it easier and 
less expensive to learn to fly went into effect thursday over the 
objections of federal air safety regulators and the air line pilots 
association 
the new rule would permit issuance of a socalled recreational 
pilots license after only 30 hours of flight instruction compared 
with the 40 required for a regular license 
the recreational license will permit pilots to fly only within 50 
miles of the airport where they learned to fly they may fly only in 
the daytime and in clear weather and may not use airports with 
traffic control towers 
we are hoping this is going to provide a stepping stone said 
john leyden a spokesman for the federal aviation administration 
people are going to get into aviation as a result of this because 
it is going to be less expensive 
leyden said the faa hopes many of them will then go on to get a 
regular pilots certificate helping to fill a growing shortage of 
airline pilots 
john lauber a member of the national transportation safety 
board said the board has long opposed the new license 
i am in sympathy with the problem we have of getting more 
people involved in aviation lauber said its just that im not 
convinced that thats the right way to go about it 
i do wonder how they can adequately enforce the many 
restrictions that have been put on he said 
the new rule was first proposed in 1979 
the faa estimates it will reduce the cost of learning to fly by 
as much as 39 percent from about 3000 to less than 2000 
the license will limit the pilot to planes with no more than four 
seats and 180horsepower engines 
john obrien director of engineering and air safety for the air 
line pilots association said the association plans to renew its 
objections to the new rule which is still subject to revision 
it does cost an awful lot for a young person coming up through 
the ranks to try to get a private pilots license today obrien 
said and if there is any means of reducing the cost of that 
license then we might provide more pilots and a larger demand for 
airlines and a larger group of pilots for the airlines to select 
from 
this seems to make sense except that by getting a recreational 
license you certainly arent getting the kind of training necessary 
to go on to flying with the airlines or making yourself a good 
safe sane pilot he said

the vatican has remained silent this week on 
the possibility of a trip by pope john paul ii to lebanon while 
apparently keeping up diplomatic efforts to arrange such a mission 
vatican spokesman joaquin navarro told reporters on aug 25 that 
different practical possibilities are being studied so that this 
desire of the pope can be carried out and contacts were under way 
on different levels 
since then navarro and other vatican officials have declined to 
elaborate on the statement 
the pontiff first said aug 15 that he wanted to go to lebanon to 
pray for peace there 
but several obstacles have cropped up to a possible papal trip 
including a recommendation by the proiranian leader of lebanons 
fundamentalist sunni moslems that the pontiff be kidnapped 
a previously unknown islamic organization also threatened in 
beirut monday to kill john paul if he visited lebanon 
john paul has frequently expressed anguish in recent weeks about 
the sixmonth battle between christian troops and syrianled forces 
including lebanese moslems the fighting has claimed more than 810 
lives 
on wednesday during his weekly general audience the pontiff 
appealed once again for prayers for peace in lebanon 
vatican media have also been quiet on a possible papal peace 
mission since sunday when the director of the vatican daily 
losservatore romano defended such a trip in a frontpage commentary 
certainly those who carry out politics only with the criteria 
of craftiness and slyness cant understand the logic of care and the 
most deeply felt testimony of the pope wrote director mario 
agnes 
he did not say who he was referring to 
some lebanese political figures have said a papal visit would 
express support for lebanese christians

tenor luciano pavarotti and his high cs have been 
banished from the lyric opera where officials say they tired of 
hearing the same old song after he once again canceled his 
appearances for the season 
lyric opera is now unwilling to take the risk of one more 
cancellation by mr pavarotti said general director ardis 
krainik im very sad about this but i didnt have any 
choice a lot of people have been very mad about his cancellations 
the last straw came when pavarotti 53 canceled six performances 
as cavaradossi in puccinis tosca scheduled at the civic opera 
house for late september and early october citing an inflamed 
sciatic nerve miss krainik said 
pavarotti has backed out of 26 of his 41 scheduled performances 
with the lyric since 1981 she said 
pavarottis new yorkbased manager herbert breslin said he 
spoke with the tenor thursday at his home in modena italy and 
pavarotti issued a statement saying that he agreed there should be 
no future collaboration with the lyric 
it is true that most of the cancellations in my career have 
happened with the lyric opera of chicago so i understand very well 
the disappointment that they have pavarotti said i have never 
been a canceler and i do not like to cancel my appearances in 
chicago because they have a beautiful audience and theater there 
i can say that if i am not good luck to the lyric opera of 
chicago then perhaps the lyric opera of chicago is not good luck to 
me 
breslin said he considered miss krainiks reaction a little bit 
irrational 
i think she gets the impression that he is doing this out of 
spite for the lyric opera of chicago which is absolutely wrong 
he said 
breslin had written and advised the lyric that the tenor cannot 
subject himself to the rigors of a live operatic performance 
because the inflamed sciatic nerve near the hip left him unable to 
move extensively on stage 
the singer requires two months of therapy breslin said 
miss krainik said she did everything possible to try to 
convince pavarotti to appear even suggesting that he sing the 
role from a chair 
his medical problem while certainly a concern is apparently 
not affecting his voice she said the singer rejected the idea 
lyric spokesman danny newman said the opera had received more 
than 100 calls from fans thursday nearly all of whom supported the 
decision not to do business with pavarotti 
outside chicago opera experts were more understanding 
jane poole managing editor of opera news published by the 
metropolitan opera guild in new york said such cancellations are 
not unique 
the man is a serious artist and i dont think he would cancel 
if there wasnt a valid reason for it she said 
patricia oneill director of administration for the pittsburgh 
opera where pavarotti left the stage in may when his voice cracked 
in the third act of tosca said he would be returning to do a 
concert in 1990 
he gave a very heroic effort in attempting to complete the 
opera even though he was ill with bronchitis ms oneill said 
he didnt want to disappoint the audience 
breslin said the singer is discussing returning to chicago in 
1991 for engagements with the chicago symphony orchestra and at 
ravinia the outdoor summer music theater 
health and family problems have forced pavarotti to cancel 
various performances in the 1980s in april 1985 the tenor called 
off a performance with the greater miami opera because he was 
fatigued and indisposed in part because of his excessive weight in 
1984 his youngest daughter became severely ill and the tenor spent 
much of his time at home 
a replacement for pavarotti in tosca is expected to be named 
within several days newman said 
the lyric with 32000 subscribers has sold 99 percent of its 
3550 seats for the coming 35th anniversary season

president bush has scrapped plans to 
go next month to alaska still embroiled in controversy over the 
exxon valdez oil spill officials said thursday 
bushs trip which never was finalized or officially announced 
would have been part of a midseptember swing to montana south 
dakota and washington the trip may be rescheduled for the spring 
officials said 
there were various reasons voiced privately by administration 
officials on why the alaska trip was dropped 
chief of staff john sununu told reporers covering the presidents 
vacation here that logistical problems and weather conditions caused 
the cancellation he said there was a possibility it could be 
rescheduled for the spring 
but another official said the main reason for dropping the trip 
was a feeling that bush already had a full schedule for september 
with several important policy issues and that the alaska trip would 
not do him any good politically 
something had to give in what was already shaping up to be a 
busy month said one official who spoke on condition of anonymity 
two officials denied that weather and logistics were the reason 
for the cancellation as indicated by sununu in his public 
statements 
the purpose of going to alaska would have been to examine the 
progress of the cleaup of the 11milliongallon spill from the exxon 
valdez tanker on march 24 
the spill swept masses of gooey oil on the once pristine beaches 
along prince william sound 
bush was said to be very intent on going sources said 
but one source said other officials prevailed with advice that it 
would could do him no good to refocus attention on the valdez oil 
spill 
bush was criticized in the aftermath of the spill for not moving 
quickly enough to get the federal government involved in the cleanup 
initially administration officials said the exxons cleanup 
efforts were satisfactory but eventually bush said those efforts 
had been inadequate and ordered us military personnel to assist in 
the cleanup 
winter weather conditions are the reason also given for exxons 
decision to shut down its cleanup efforts in midseptember 
environmentalists have criticized the pullout plan contending 
some aspects of the effort could continue 
critics also are blasting a government plan calling for all 
studies on damage caused by the spill to be completed by feburary 
environmentalists say the plan could lead to a serious 
underestimation of harm to the environment and a limited recovery 
of damages from exxon 
bush has a heavy legislative calendar in september and is trying 
to focus attention on his drug strategy which he unveils on tuesday 
he also has called a twoday education summit with all the nations 
governors and will take trips to new jersy boston the united 
nations in new york and annapolis md

the moral majority called it quits thursday 
but not before it made history by helping to marshal the religious 
right into a political force in the last decade 
after raising 69 million from 6 million people helping elect 
three republican administrations and rallying conservatives behind 
issues ranging from abortion to pornography the lobbying group 
officially disbanded a stroke before midnight thursday the end of 
the fiscal year 
the moral majority acted as a catalyst as an energizer for the 
conservative movement it had a major impact on bringing a new voter 
bloc into the political mainstream said president jerry nims 
by thursday however nims said he was the last employee on the 
job im standing on the bridge until the gun goes off 
it was 10 years ago in june that the rev jerry falwell gathered 
religious leaders from around the country in his office conference 
room in lynchburg to discuss how to get conservatives involved in 
politics 
it was really a brainstorming meeting falwell aide mark 
demoss said thursday it was paul weyrich president of free 
congress foundation in washington who actually said in that 
meeting i believe there is a moral majority in this country and 
somebody said thats the name thats how it all started 
falwell who carried the sword that carved out a permanent place 
for the religious right in politics is now devoting his time to his 
expanding ministry thomas road baptist church and liberty 
university in lynchburg 
falwell resigned as president of moral majority in 1987 and 
announced two months ago the organization would meet its end 
thursday he passed the position to jerry nims an atlanta 
entrepreneur who was falwells chief executive officer during 
falwells brief beleaguered leadership of ptl 
nims said the plan had been to slowly dismantle the organization 
which had a dozen employees in washington and 20 in lynchburg when 
he took over to avoid damaging the conservative movement 
my specific job was to wind it down in an orderly fashion so we 
wouldnt trip going off the stage he said by telephone from his 
atlanta office the group also wanted to remain intact through the 
reagan administration and the presidential election nims said 
we didnt want a major headline right in the middle of a major 
battle battle moral majority quits he said 
the last legislative fight ended in december with passage of the 
child protection and enforcement act which nims said will help get 
organized crime out of the pornography industry 
there were several objectives the moral majority failed to meet 
such as cutting down the federal bureaucracy increasing 
presidential powers and reducing the reelection rate in congress 
nims said 
but overall it was a smashing success he said 
we are encouraged by the fact that 10 years ago there were 
virtually no likeminded organizations demoss said today 
there are literally dozens of conservative organizations involved in 
moral and social issues family issues 
the moral majoritys work has been taken over by lobbying groups 
of religious conservatives such as the american coalition for 
traditional values concerned women for america the rutherford 
institute the freedom council and the american family association 
falwell said in june

the federal government issued tighter controls 
thursday on cancercausing benzene saying the new restrictions will 
eliminate 90 percent of benzene releases from industrial sources 
ranging from steel plants to service stations 
but the curbs are expected to be quite costly and they do not 
cover the primary source of benzene pollution automobiles the 
environmental protection agency said 
congress is considering legislation that would tighten air 
pollution standards including provisions to reduce benzene releases 
from motor vehicles epa officials said the agency also plans to 
announce separate regulations next month to reduce vapor releases 
including benzene from automobiles 
in its announcement thursday the epa said new emission control 
equipment may force industry to spend nearly 13 billion with 
another 200 million annually in maintenance costs 
these will be costly but feasible controls said f henry 
habicht deputy epa administrator he conceded that in some cases a 
company may choose to close an aging plant instead of install the 
new equipment the agency could provide no estimates on how many 
such shutdowns might occur 
habicht predicted the new rules likely will be challenged in 
court but said he was determined to enforce them vigorously 
the regulations some of which will become final immediately 
while others were expected to become final within six months to 
eight months would cut industrial benzene emissions by 34000 tons 
a year or by about 90 percent over the next two years 
the epa first listed benzene as a hazardous air pollutant in 1977 
after chronic exposure to the colorless and odorless liquid was 
found to cause adult leukemia birth defects and other disorders 
benzene usually escapes into the air after evaporating from 
gasoline in automobiles and from a range of industrial sources 
including iron and steel plants oil refineries chemical and 
pharmaceutical plants as well as during transit and delivery to 
storage tanks at local gasoline stations 
the new epa rules cover only emissions from industrial sources 
which account for only about onefifth of the benzene released into 
the air annually according to the epa automobiles account for 
nearly 80 percent of all benzene released into the air other 
sources are cigarette smoke and various consumer products 
the regulations announced thursday came 12 years after the epa 
first began considering curbs on industrial benzene pollution while 
some segments of industry have curbed such releases they remain 
largely uncontrolled in other areas such as iron and steel where 
benzene is a major byproduct of coke production the epa said its 
new rules would cut benzene emissions by 97 percent in the steel 
industry 
sizeable emission reductions also are expected in the 
transportation of benzene in the pharmaceutical industry and in the 
distribution of gasoline from refineries to local service stations 
the agency said 
the tighter rules are expected to reduce the cancer risk to the 
general population from industrial benzene exposure to less than one 
in 1 million according to epa estimates 
but habicht conceded the risks could continue to be greater to 
individuals perhaps a risk of as much as one in 10000 for as 
many as 300000 people who live close to industrial plants where 
high levels of benzene are present 
it is riskier to live near a factory that emits benzene i 
dont know what we do to eliminate that risk short of closing the 
plants all down habicht told reporters 
the epa estimated that of the nearly 40000 tons of benzene 
released yearly from industrial sources about 40 percent comes from 
the iron and steel industrys coke production the agency said the 
cost of bringing 36 coke furnaces and foundaries into compliance 
with the new regulations would be 74 million 
by far the largest costs are expected in the petroleum industry 
which may have to spend as much as 930 million on new emission 
control equipment for its gasoline storage distribution and 
marketing operations according to epa estimates those costs 
however will be spread over thousands of facililities from bulk 
gasoline storage plants to individual service stations officials 
said 
benzene is only the seventh toxic chemical to be regulated by the 
epa which has been under criticism from congress for not moving 
more quickly to curb releases of such substances 
there are more than 300 toxic chemicals for which industry must 
make annual reports of releases

the proiranian leader of fundamentalist 
sunni moslems was quoted thursday as saying pope john paul ii should 
be kidnapped if he visits lebanons besieged christians 
sheik said shaaban also recommended president bush and president 
francois mitterrand of france be abducted as a means of ending 
support for lebanese christians and for israel the beirut daily 
addiyar reported 
seven people were killed in artillery and rocket exchanges 
between syrian and christian soldiers including a 27yearold woman 
who burned to death in an apartment set ablaze by shellfire police 
reported they said at least 36 people were wounded 
by police count 812 people have been killed and 2354 wounded 
nearly all of them civilians in the artillery war that began march 
8 between gen michel aouns christian army command and a moslem 
alliance led by the 40000 syrian troops stationed in lebanon 
a mediation mission by french envoy francois scheer appeared to 
have collapsed raising fears of intensified fighting 
an artillery round hit the secondfloor apartment of mustafa 
najjar 33 a sound technician with the british television agency 
visnews neighbors said he carried his 8yearold daughter and 
7yearold son down the stairs but returned to find the charred 
body of his wife amal lying in the flames 
addiyar quoted shaaban as saying in an interview if the pope 
comes to lebanon and we manage to hold him for the sake of salvaging 
palestine i wouldnt be against such an act 
it is our duty to abduct all those related to states that 
recognize israel every citizen of a foreign state that recognizes 
israel should be a hostage in our hand 
i support the abduction of bush and mitterrand to serve the 
purpose of ousting israel from palestine and stopping the french 
intervention in lebanon and the naval warships that have come to 
rescue frances children in lebanon 
although shaaban is a sunni he supports the radical shiite 
moslem goal of an iranstyle islamic repubic in lebanon and has made 
several trips to tehran 
his reference was to six french warships in the eastern 
mediterranean france which governed lebanon by mandate until 1943 
says the ships are on a humanitarian mission to evacuate the 
7000 french citizens in lebanon if necessary 
shaabans talk of abduction was the most overt threat to john 
paul since he expressed a desire aug 19 to visit lebanon and help 
end the 14yearold sectarian civil war which has killed more than 
150000 people iran has advised him to stay away 
threatening to kidnap the pope may seem farfetched but shiite 
zealots loyal to iran carried out suicide bombings against american 
french and israeli forces in lebanon in 198385 and have kidnapped 
scores of westerners sixteen western hostages including eight 
americans still are held 
police said syrian artillery deployed in moslem west beirut and 
the mountains south and east of the capital hit the christian 
enclave with up to 20 shells a minute thursday 
they said scores of 240mm and 180mm mortar rounds exploded at and 
around the hilltop presidential palace in baabda a christian suburb 
east of beirut 
aouns command bunker is under the palace a regular target of 
syrian fire his 155mm howitzers fired on syrian positions along the 
sectarian dividing line in beirut the seafront boulevards of west 
beirut and the wooded aramoun hills southeast of the capital police 
said 
one salvo landed at the khaldeh junction which is south of 
beirut on the coastal highway linking the syriancontrolled sector 
of the city with the rest of lebanon syrian soldiers scrambled from 
sandbagged checkpoints and dived into foxholes along the seafront 
dozens of apartment buildings on both sides of the city were set 
afire and burned out of control because the shellfire kept 
firefighters from reaching them 
addiyar said the shelling increased because scheers mediation 
effort foundered on differences about halting arms supplies to the 
rival factions 
aoun wants international guarantees that syria would stop arming 
its allies syria wants an interlebanese committee to make sure 
ships bound for christian ports do not carry weapons and ammunition 
for the christians 
iraq an arab enemy of syria is aouns main arms supplier 
scheer ended two days of talks with lebanese leaders wednesday 
and is expected to visit saudi arabia morocco and algeria 
an arab league summit in may appointed the leaders of those three 
nations king fahd king hassan ii and president chadli bendjedid

just say no to drugs and pregnancy and 
rhode island will say yes to full college scholarships for 
lowincome students gov edward d diprete announced thursday 
the 50 million program approved by the state board of governors 
for higher education would serve as many as 10000 thirdgraders a 
year beginning in 1991 and continuing through 2000 
now the state must persuade thirdgraders and their parents to 
enlist 
students would be tutored and paired with mentors throughout 
elementary and high school and top performers would receive summer 
jobs where they could serve as role models 
in return students and parents in the rhode island childrens 
crusade must allow state monitoring of report cards shun drugs and 
early pregnancy and obey the law the only academic requirement is 
that they dont flunk 
we really feel that if the program is successful we may have 
made a fundamental change in certain patterns that contribute to 
students dropping out said americo w petrocelli the states 
highereducation commissioner who designed the program 
diprete said students who ran into legal problems or became 
pregnant should be given a chance to get back into the program if 
they showed willingness to continue their studies 
the plan seeks to cut the dropout rate among disadvantaged 
students in half to 25 percent an estimated 1200 of the students 
who finish the program each year would attend college and 1200 
would go on to jobs or other training programs as a result said 
leila mahoney dipretes senior assistant who is in charge of 
raising the funding 
all thirdgraders could enroll but the program is aimed at 
approximately 3200 who receive subsidized hot lunches at school or 
whose families receive food stamps ms mahoney said 
businesses foundations and schools would be asked to contribute 
the initial 10 million to a foundation the state would be expected 
to contribute 32 million a year bringing the fund with interest 
to approximately 50 million after 10 years ms mahoney said 
diprete also said he would be knocking on the door of the white 
house to at least to match the states contribution 
there was some doubt however about whether the parents of 
disadvantaged students would sign them up 
i dont think the parents that dont care that theyre going 
to even bother with this said jessica ley 12 who serves as a 
tutor in one of providences poorest neighborhoods some parents 
dont care and i have a few friends who have parents like that 
im not so sure diprete said when the comment was repeated 
to him i think they might say thank god give us a hand 
the maximum scholarship would cover the estimated 3436 yearly 
tuition at the university of rhode island in the year 2000 and 
would increase 5 percent yearly petrocelli said students attending 
other rhode island schools and apprenticeship programs or 
proprietary schools would receive less 
students attending private colleges would receive the maximum 
scholarship

prices farmers got for raw products dropped 14 
percent from july to august leaving the monthly average at a 
yearago level the agriculture department said thursday 
the departments agricultural statistics board said in its 
preliminary report that lower prices for soybeans corn lettuce and 
potatoes were mostly responsible for the decrease from the july 
average 
higher prices for cattle apples eggs and grapefruit partly 
offset the decline for the other commodities 
oilseeds which include soybeans and feed grains showed the 
greatest monthtomonth decline while meat animals and milk had the 
largest increases 
a 90centsperbushel decline in the price of soybeans from 
july to august was the largest monthtomonth decline since 
junejuly 1984 the report said corn and sorghum prices were 
down but the average barley price was up

and beef cattle were up from july but calf prices were down 
slightly 
agriculture secretary clayton yeutter said earlier thursday that 
he expects 1989 will be a good year for farmers although there 
is a mixed situation across the country because of drought and 
other weather problems 
i would guess net cash income nationally would be slightly 
below 1988 but not very much below he said crop production 
generally has rebounded from last years droughtreduced yields and 
exports are up overall id say farmers feel a lot better 
yeutter said 
department economists say net cash income of farmers gross cash 
income minus cash expenses rose in 1988 to a record of about 60 
billion as drought forced commodity prices up many producers were 
able to sell harvests at the higher prices thus more than 
offsetting reduced production 
the decline this year is expected to stem from farmers larger 
cash expenses as they boost plantings and also because of lower 
federal subsidies 
consumer food prices are forecast by usda to rise an average of 5 
percent to 7 percent this year following a 41 percent increase in 
1988 
based on the preliminary figures the price index for livestock 
and livestock products as a group increased 19 percent from july 
and averaged 53 percent above the yearearlier level 
crop prices overall dropped 45 percent from july and averaged 
59 percent less than in august 1988 
the allfruit price index for august was up 88 percent from july 
but was down 49 percent from a year ago the report said apples 
were reported at 161 cents per pound compared with 98 cents in 
july a year ago apples were 245 cents per pound 
grapefruit prices averaged 724 per box compared with 462 in 
july and 409 a year earlier as used in the report a box of 
grapefruit is about 67 pounds 
prices of commercial vegetables dropped 15 percent from july 
averaging 65 percent below a year ago the report said 
the overall index of prices paid to farmers in july averaged 144 
percent of a 1977 base used for comparison down from 146 percent in 
july that was the lowest reading since november when the index was 
also 144 percent 
the report said 
cattle averaged 6960 per 100 pounds of live weight nationally 
up from 68 in july and 6590 in august 1988 those are averages 
for all types of cattle sold as bee 
hogs averaged 4610 per 100 pounds compared with 4590 in 
july and 4470 a year earlier 
corn at 229 a bushel was down from 247 in july and 265 
in august 1988 
wheat prices at the farm according to preliminary figures 
averaged 383 per bushel compared with 378 in july and 361 a 
year earlier 
rice averaged 720 per 100 pounds down from 733 in july and

the judge in john m poindexters irancontra 
case thursday ordered a hearing on whether the former national 
security adviser may introduce evidence that covert aid to 
nicaraguan rebels was legal 
us district judge harold greene scheduled a sept 6 hearing to 
discuss whether there was valid evidence that poindexter could use 
to defend the charge that he obstructed congressional inquiries into 
whether national security council aide oliver l north was secretly 
helping arm the nicaraguan contras 
poindexter is accused of obstructing congress in august 1986 by 
assuring three house committees in letters that the national 
security council was observing the spirit as well as the letter 
of a ban on us military assistance to the antisandinista rebels 
greene said he wanted to determine if poindexter should be given 
a chance to prove he had no motive to conceal norths activities by 
showing they were legal authorized or known throughout the 
government 
at issue is whether any knowledge of the activities by president 
reagan or other government officals could be presented as evidence 
that poindexter thought the national security council was following 
the law 
greene said he would also hear arguments on whether the existence 
of other covert operations by the reagan administration could also 
be cited as evidence that poindexter thought norths activities in 
support of the contras did not violate the congressional ban 
no date has been set for the trial of poindexter who is also 
accused of lying and helping devise a false chronology of usiran 
arms sales in november 1986 when congress began its investigation of 
the irancontra affair

a couple kept their 4yearold grandson in 
a filthy outdoor pen next to dog kennels for most of each day with 
a bottle of water and no access to a toilet authorities charged 
thursday 
he looked like a caged kid a wild kid that had been caged up 
and youd find out in the woods somewhere living with the animals 
said police cpl jim doty 
district attorney drew edmondson filed a misdemeanor charge of 
omitting to provide against joyce and gene white the charge 
usually filed in cases of failure to pay child support carries a 
year in jail or a 500 fine 
mrs white said her grandson was kept in the pen to keep him from 
running onto a highway she said he was safe there and kept cool 
under large trees 
investigators said the boy appeared to be wellnourished and had 
no apparent injuries but edmondson said if the pen were 
sanitary if you were talking about an outdoor play pen that might 
be reasonable 
edmondson said the boy was confined to the 100squarefoot pen 
from morning until night he said the boy used a corner of the pen 
as a toilet and had a dirty baby bottle of water to drink the pen 
is next to a kennel with dozens of dogs 
the boy was filthy from head to toe said sheriffs deputy 
patrick howland 
the boy an 11yearold cousin and the whites 13yearold 
daughter were taken into custody tuesday by the state child welfare 
investigators will hold a hearing to determine if the children 
should be returned to the home or placed in temporary custody 
elsewhere 
the whites and the children have been living in a motor home at a 
site where the whites are trying to start a commercial kennel 
officials said 
howland said the boys mother left him with the grandparents when 
he was 2 and the boys father apparently works in another city

president hosni mubarak sent a toplevel 
envoy to libya thursday in a cautious new step toward reconciling 
one of the arab worlds bitterest conflicts 
however mubaraks decision to send an envoy to celebrate col 
moammar gadhafis 20th anniversary in power and not attend himself 
indicated the egyptian leader remains unwilling to forget more 
than a decades conflict with his western neighbor 
government sources say this wariness is due largely to gadhafis 
frequent changes of mood toward egypt 
the current rapprochement began in may when fellow arabs enticed 
gadhafi to sit with mubarak at an arab league summit they hugged 
then met privately for several hours 
since then their desert border has been reopened and air service 
between the countries restored each has ended invective against the 
other 
but they still have no diplomatic relations and egypt is waiting 
for gadhafi to restore relations he ruptured in 1978 after mubaraks 
predecessor anwar sadat began peace talks with israel 
gadhafis invitation to mubarak to attend the anniversary 
celebrations of the coup in which gadhafi ousted king idris is 
itself progress 
mubaraks acceptance was another step forward 
he designated as his representative deputy prime minister youssef 
waly waly who flew thursday to tripoli is the most senior 
egyptian official to visit libya since 1977 when the two countries 
fought a fiveday border war 
tripoli fell out with egypt in 1972 when sadat spurned gadhafis 
proposal to merge their countries relations deteriorated as sadat 
pursued his peace policy and rapprochement with the united states 
egypt blamed gadhafi for bombings in cairo alexandria and other 
cities in 1975 and 1976 which led to the war 
since mubarak took office in 1981 gadhafi envoys have embarked 
on more than a dozen futile secret missions to egypt mubarak 
publicly said they always brought expressions of friendship yet 
each trip was followed by hostile libyan actions 
that was before this springs summit in casablanca morocco on 
may 23 mubarak and gadhafi met there and agreed to bury the hatchet 
about relations with libya mubarak told the yugoslav news agency 
tanjug in an interview published thursday they are improving 
steadily there is no problem there he added embassy buildings in 
the respective capitals are being prepared but did not say when 
he expects resumed diplomatic relations 
a senior government official who demanded anonymity said walys 
trip underlines the two countries common desire to reinforce and 
normalize relations 
but on restoring diplomatic ties he said its up to libya 
syria and libya are the only two to hold out among 17 arab states 
that broke with egypt between december 1978 and the following april 
because of the treaty with israel cairo exchanged ambassadors with 
the other 15 after a november 1987 arab summit gave its approval

more than 10000 poles roared their 
applause as lech walesa joined them thursday to celebrate the ninth 
anniversary of the birth of solidarity and pray for the success of 
the new solidarityled government 
walesa and solidarity the east blocs first independent trade 
union had much to celebrate this year the union emerged from seven 
years of banishment to end 45 years of communist control of the 
polish government 
on aug 31 1980 i signed in your name the document which 
became the basis for the creation of solidarity and which changed 
the course of polish history walesa told his cheering supporters 
we reject the road of violence and revolution but we have the 
right to use legal measures we want to have a government really 
capable of changing poland and really responsible in front of 
solidarity and its allies and in front of the nation 
it is our duty to make sure that is what happens remember at 
the end it is always the nation the ordinary people who decide 
walesa a shipyard electrician and 1983 nobel peace laureate 
drew cheers as he took his seat in front of the towering workers 
monument in front of the lenin shipyard where solidarity was born 
sitting next to walesa was a special guest jan nowak the 
courier from warsaw who smuggled information out of 
nazioccupied poland during world war ii and who long headed the 
polish section of us governmentfinanced radio free europe 
becoming an enemy of the communist state for his uncensored 
broadcasts 
solidaritys tadeusz mazowiecki who became prime minister last 
week said in a television address he could not join the gdansk 
commemoration because of the pressing need to form his new 
government 
dozens of delegations from mines and factories across poland 
dipped solidarity flags at the monument honoring workers killed 
during 1970 workers riots along the baltic coast two parachutes 
lettered with solidarity fluttered from poles near the shipyard 
entrance 
exactly one year ago the shipyard was strikebound for the second 
time in four months and walesa was in warsaw for his first talks in 
six years with communist authorities desperate for a solution to 
nationwide labor unrest 
later that day walesa returned to gdansk and successfully 
appealed for an end to the strikes his discussions with authorities 
led to the start in february of talks on political and economic 
reform 
after the historic negotiations came restoration of solidaritys 
legal status april 17 and june elections that were the freest in the 
soviet bloc in four decades 
solidaritys stunning victories and the communist partys 
disastrous showings led to the unprecedented possibility of 
powersharing 
and on aug 24 as a result of a parliamentary coalition forged 
by walesa between solidarity and two smaller parties long allied 
with the communists mazowiecki became prime minister 
we enter a new epoch it depends on us when we will be able to 
say poland is a free democratic and wealthy country now i say that 
next year we will be thankful for visible economic acheivements 
walesa said 
mazowiecki said over tv i very warmly greet all my friends 
from those times that we spent together in such hard dramatic but 
i think fruitful circumstances i am with them during these solemn 
ceremonies 
nowak was overcome by emotion as he stood to address the 
assemblage he returned to poland on tuesday for the first time 
since fleeing at the end of the warsaw uprising of 1944 
it seems absolutely impossible i can stand in front of you 
nowak said solidarity although defenseless opened a road to me 
for my own country with its spirit 
not so long ago what i would have faced here would have been a 
death sentence 
an outdoor mass was celebrated by gdansk bishop tadeusz 
goclowski who wore robes embroidered with solidarity in red 
glitter 
today we can be real copartners in truth be those who will 
build the new reality of our homeland goclowski said 
piles of bouquets two framed photos of polishborn pope john 
paul ii and a wooden cross decorated the main gate of the lenin 
shipyard 
even the gdansk communist party newspaper glos wybrzeza marked 
the anniversary in a front page article under the headline hope 
almost all of us remember that day from august 1980 not 
only nine years have passed an epoch has passed especially the 
recent months were filled with changes that stunned the world the

the internal revenue service responded to 
business pressure thursday and delayed for two months implementing a 
tax rule that encourages companies to provide health and life 
insurance benefits to all their workers 
the new deadline for implementing the socalled section 89 rules 
is dec 1 the irs said 
legislation enacted in 1986 requires employers to demonstrate 
that health and accident plans and group life insurance do not favor 
higherpaid workers the original deadline of jan 1 1989 had been 
delayed until oct 1 
business groups have lobbied to have the rule dropped altogether 
arguing that it is so complex costly and time consuming that it 
will drive some small companies out of business 
they claim the rule is having the opposite effect intended and 
that companies are dropping benefits rather than extend them to all 
workers 
several measures affecting section 89 are pending in congress 
one which has passed both the house and senate but must be 
reconciled before going to president bush would delay 
implementation until oct 1 1990 
a second bill passed by the house ways and means committee and 
the full senate would revamp but not rescind the rules and postpone 
the effective date until jan 1

with nothing but blueberries for food 
and the wisdom of years to guide him a 95yearold miner survived 
three weeks lost in the wilderness with little more than sore feet 
to show for the ordeal 
i knew the good lord would rescue me dennis d wilkins said 
after he was found tuesday northwest of anchorage as for being 
scared as that no one would find me well i never even gave it a 
thought 
after his meager supply of food ran out wilkins ate nothing but 
berries for almost two weeks as he wandered moose trails through the 
woods 
he said that except for his swollen and blistered feet he was in 
good condition but im sore inside and out i feel like ive been 
run over by a logging truck 
wilkins said things went awry aug 8 when he set out from his 
cabin for derf lake where he was to meet friends who would fly him 
to anchorage 
i cant explain it but somehow i got lost he said there 
were a lot of moose trails crisscrossing and then my food supply 
ran out should have brought more and i think i must have had some 
blackouts you know you dont think right when your stomachs 
empty 
state troopers were called in to search for wilkins weve had 
to look for him in the past said sgt warren grant 
wilkins meanwhile reached a cabin and subsisted on its store of 
crackers before being discovered in a day or so by its surprised 
owners harold brian and wayne davis those fellows looked like 
heaven to me wilkins said 
grant said that people have been lost in alaskas woods for 
longer periods but that wilkins must be one rugged guy to 
survive at his age

a leading private environmental group said 
thursday the world bank was not doing enough to help third world 
countries combat the threat of rising global temperatures 
the bank owned by 151 governments is the largest source of aid 
to the third world lending over 19 billion a year 
the status quo is not acceptable as an option said david a 
wirth senior attorney for the national resources development 
council 
his criticism was based on an internal bank paper prepared in 
advance of a major speech on the environment that the banks 
president barber conable is due to deliver in tokyo on sept 11 
the paper includes a section entitled the bank can do more 
this document is the equivalent of saying that hats and 
sunglasses will solve the problem of stratospheric ozone 
destruction wirth said in a statement on the paper 
one threat to the environment foreseen by some scientists is that 
chemicals released on earth are destroying the layer of ozone a gas 
in the upper atmosphere that protects the planet from harmful rays 
of the sun 
frank vogl the banks chief spokesman said the paper was only 
one of many inputs for conables speech and for a new operational 
directive the bank is preparing 
the statements of a tiny number of environmentalists fail to 
acknowledge the immense volume of undertakings by the bank he 
said in an interview

7 presidential elections by a 31 margin but the government 
annulled the vote on grounds the results were distorted by us 
interference and economic aid to the opposition

effort to oust noriega who has been indicted in florida on federal 
charges of drug trafficking and money laundering

washington deputy secretary of state lawrence eagleburger said 
noriega was a man of shameless excess who amassed a fortune of

sovereign nation and within its laws noriega said after the 
announcement that his friend would become president 
political opposition leaders have called the new government a 
continuation of the military dictatorship

he has of the countrys economic situation and balanced judgment he 
has exercised in his decisions

declined 17 per cent in 1988 the worst drop since 1945 and more

will be turned over to panama 
noriega claims the us charges against him are part of a plot to 
renege on the 1977 treaties and keep the canal

campbell 65 tripled the size of the hoover institution whose

ice a potent new form of the drug known as 
speed with a high that lasts 12 to 24 hours is on the streets in 
hawaii and is threatening to invade major west coast ports 
this is a real horror story honolulu police captain henry 
lau told the san francisco chronicle on thursday 
ice a colorless and odorless form of the stimulant 
methamphetamine is smoked much like crack the highly addictive 
rock form of cocaine but unlike a crack high which lasts less than 
half an hour a few puffs of ice can keep the user high all day 
ice has been found at all levels of society in hawaii 
authorities said 
its a nightmare here and there is still only a glimmer of 
understanding of its longterm effects said us attorney dan 
bent in honolulu only now are we learning that its high is many 
times more potent and longer than crack that its low is deep 
morbid and entrenched and that its addiction is at least as great 
as crack and possibly far greater 
most of the ice in hawaii appears to be coming from asia 
normally we are not on the cutting edge of something like 
this said major mike carvalho of the honolulu police narcotics 
squad 
drugs usually come here from the mainland heading west but 
this drug is coming from the opposite direction the far east 
its couriers are not us gang members like the crips and the 
bloods but gang members from the philippines korea and japan who 
are just as deadly we have become their test tube for smokable 
crystal meth 
ice costs two to three times the current price of crack cocaine 
hawaii police said while crack might cost 2000 a pound ice is 
4000 to 6000 for the same amount

on the eve of the 50th anniversary of the 
start of world war ii poles from lech walesa to president wojciech 
jaruzelski remembered the conflict with sadness thursday and vowed 
war never again 
they fell on the field of glory shouted soldiers assembled 
for a torchlight ceremony at the tomb of the unknown soldier in 
warsaw 
in a symbolic roll call an officer read out a list of groups of 
the fallen soldiers sailors pilots and the millions of civilians 
killed in camps and forgotten forests and the honor guard replied 
honor to their memory 
war never again the officer shouted 
never never never the guard responded 
the alarm read on the day of the nazi attack by thenmayor stefen 
starzynski was replayed and the wail of sirens as the german 
bombers approached once more sounded in the twilight 
jaruzelski wearing his army generals uniform saluted as he 
approached the tomb to lay flowers portraying the white polish eagle 
in a sea of red 
beside him was prime minister tadeusz mazowiecki the longtime 
solidarity activist who last week became polands first 
noncommunist government leader in 45 years 
on friday jaruzelski will speak at westerplatte on the baltic 
coast where the first shots were fired and leonard bernstein will 
lead a memorial concert in warsaw 
but a key event bringing together members of the worlds 
religions to pray for peace appeared likely to be marred by a 
boycott by polands only rabbi he said he is staying away because 
the roman catholic church has not removed a convent from the 
auschwitz death camp that many consider offensive to the memory of 
the estimated 25 million jews who died there 
the world prayer for peace project began thursday with a solemn 
convocation at warsaw university led by polish primate cardinal 
jozef glemp and attended by leaders of many world religions 
including orthodox christians protestants hindus and buddhists 
glemp was joined by jaruzelski who noted poland was the first 
country visited by the war and remembered the 6 million poles who 
died 
war destroys man and his material and spiritual heritage but 
it is man alone who sets it ablaze the general said 
opposing war means engaging in dialogue tolerance and 
mutual respect including endorsing the sovereignty of states and 
the rights of nations to selfdetermination 
glemp spoke of polands difficult past a country that 
suffered greatly preserving always its deep religious and 
spiritual values 
the primate who has been criticized for insensitivity to jews 
said poland was a tolerant country where catholics and jews had 
lived together he said jews were the most numerous religious 
community besides catholics in poland before the war and suffered

an unusual mix of ivy leaguers and 
western cowboys the band of volunteers who formed the armys world 
war ii mountain division holds a unique place in american military 
and skiing history 
more than 44 years after their victories the veterans of the 
10th mountain division still get together regularly to reminisce and 
enjoy the fellowship of the men they once fought against 
the divisions record was most phenomenal never defeated 
never pushed back said earl e clark a retired denver 
businessman and founder of the 10th mountain division association 
holding a reunion here this week 
it was something that happened once in our military history 
he said after the war the german commanders labeled the 10th 
division the elite unit of the us army 
the division was the only american unit of infantrydivision 
strength ever trained specifically for high altitude and cold 
weather fighting 
you had quite a conglomeration men from dartmouth williams 
princeton and yale because thats where the skiing was and montana 
cattle ranchers said clark 
made up of skiers mountain climbers and survival experts 
supported by a group of cowboys mule skinners and blacksmiths the 
10th captured key german strongholds in the apennine mountains in 
northern italy in early 1945 that paved the way for the final 
allied thrust into the po river valley and the dolomite mountains 
inspiration for the division came from finlands ski troops in 
1939 clark said russian invaders were literally stopped for the 
winter by a very small unit of men on skis said clark that was 
a graphic example of how a skilled unit of men on skis could stop an 
invasion force 
finding skilled skiers wasnt easy 
there werent many in the united states at that time said 
clark who still skis at age 70 there were more skiers at vail 
colo during christmas week than there were in the united states 
in 1939 
veterans of the division helped create the nations postwar ski 
industry 
the division which had 14000 troops at one point was sent in 
mid1944 to fight its way up the mountains of northern italy 
more than 2000 mules carrying supplies and howitzers accompanied 
the division which took heavy casualties with 992 men killed and 
more than 4100 wounded 
many members of the division were also firstgeneration austrian 
and german immigrants who had been given the option of fighting the 
japanese rather than having to face soldiers from their old 
countries said clark 
the white ski suits cold weather tents and mountain skis the 
division used are on display this week at the divisions reunion 
youd be soaking in sweat if you were in one of those tents and 
it wasnt 20 below said felix church of seattle a rockclimbing 
specialist who lost his left leg in combat and won the silver and 
bronze stars and the purple heart 
the 10th veterans also have forged ties with mountain fighters 
from west germany austria italy france and japan participants 
from those countries were in southern indiana this week and will be 
at the international federation of mountain soliders congress that 
starts friday in vail 
theres very little refighting of the war that goes on at 
these said clark 
in addition to the war experience you had another great love 
that binds us all together the love of the mountains

president bush and canadian prime 
minister brian mulroney emerging from a seaside retreat said 
thursday they explored ways of providing more help for colombian 
president virgilio barco in his battle against the drug barons 
but both leaders pressed on the possibility of sending a 
multilateral force to fight the drug cartels stressed that any such 
appeal must start with barco and not be imposed upon the latin 
american nation 
bush said there is no point in canada or the united states or 
any group of countries imposing its will on a country that is 
now trying very very hard to rid itself of this menace 
mulroney said they were in complete agreement on the need 
to support a very courageous leader in colombia and the need to 
stomp out by every reasonable means the terror of drugs 
in a windy seaside news conference the two leaders also renewed 
their condemnation of panamas gen manuel antonio noriega who has 
thwarted democratic rule in his country 
bush who played host to mulroney and family for a 26hour stay 
here called it an unusually productive visit that despite its 
private nature included almost four hours of talks on world issues 
and uscanadian ties 
both men wore yellow sports shirts and casual slacks while their 
wives bushs 88yearold mother dorothy and mulroneys children 
stood watching them field questions on the lawn between bushs 
tennis court and the blue sea dotted with brightly colored markers 
from lobster pots 
lobster in fact was one of the few areas of strain in 
uscanadian relations and mulroney allowed that bush had 
advanced some persuasive arguments about canadian lobstermens 
catch of lobsters that in us waters would be too small to keep 
the americans contend the canadian catch lobsters before they grow 
big enough to reproduce 
while bush said there was broad agreement between the united 
states and canada on trade there are still bumps in the road 
on the lobster dispute mulroney said the president was big on 
lobsters today i was big on pork because we feel that the americans 
have just imposed an unfair tariff on pork 
he said they had discussed the mechanisms to resolve the pork 
dispute under the free trade agreement 
the canadian leader said they were making progress on acid rain 
thanks in part to bushs recently proposed clean air amendments but 
mulroney said he wants a uscanada bilateral clean air accord 
and i wont be satisfied that the issue is resolved until 
president bush and i sit down and sign that accord 
we agree on almost all the major issues said the president 
and where canada and the us may have bumps in the road we can 
talk very frankly 
bush said the national drug strategy he will unveil next tuesday 
will not slight drug interdiction efforts abroad to expand drug 
enforcement at home 
afterwards his chief of staff john sununu predicted the drug 
package will cost 78 billion almost 2 billion above current 
spending levels and require a reallocation of resources 
on another issue bush said he was considering increasing 
emergency food shipments to poland that is one area where we 
ought to be able to do more he said 
on the situation in panama bush said ive never seen a coming 
together in world opinion as there is on this one that noriega 
ought to get out he said he had just received a letter from 
british prime minister margaret thatcher on panama 
i am not going to give up on multilateral diplomacy said 
bush 
theres a high frustration level im ready to concede that 
but we are not going to give up on this bush said we are not 
going to permit the will of the people of panama to be thwarted by 
this dictator 
mulroney who came with his wife mila and four children 
encountered the same luck as bush when he tried fishing 
mulroney offered the impartial international assessment of the 
fact that there are no fish out there i can certify to that its 
not the presidents fault 
bush said i positively guarantee you that this jinx will be 
broken before he heads home monday from his 20day vacation

delegates and experts predict more factional warfare 
in cambodia now that an international conference has failed to 
produce a peace plan 
the moment is favorable for a period of military testing 
asian specialist francois godement of the french institute for 
international relations said thursday the question is at what 
level of intensity 
an overriding concern at the monthlong conference which ended 
wednesday in paris was that civil war would resume when vietnam 
pulled its forces out sept 27 leaving the army of premier hun sen 
to fend for itself 
vietnam invaded cambodia in december 1978 and overthrew the 
brutal khmer rouge regime of pol pot which was held responsible for 
1 million deaths during less than four years in power 
lt gen naruedol dejpradiyuth the thai army spokesman said 
thursday in bangkok he doubted the vietnamese pullout would be 
complete but still expected a renewal of the war in neighboring 
cambodia he spoke at the monthly army news conference 
a vietnamese radio broadcast said guerrillas encamped near the 
border already were trying to push soldiers and civilians into the 
cambodian interior to provide a legal status for the socalled 
resistance before a ceasefire takes effect and elections are 
held 
delegates and observers note the vietnamese departure comes at 
the beginning of the dry season the traditional time for 
intensified combat in cambodia 
although it may have been inadvertent the conference left time 
for military confrontation with its decision to renew contacts 
within six months about resuming peace talks 
without results on the battlefield there are no results at the 
negotiating table said ek sereywath spokesman for the delegation 
of prince norodom sihanouk the former cambodian ruler who leads the 
guerrilla alliance we were deadlocked here because the military 
situation is not decisive 
most of those commenting felt the chinesebacked khmer rouge the 
strongest element of sihanouks threeparty rebel coalition would 
act first 
the khmer rouge have something to prove that they cannot be 
eliminated in the political domain and that they are a permanent 
factor in any settlement godement said in a telephone interview 
at the 19nation conference hun sen excluded a share of 
authority for the khmer rouge sihanouk contending his allies would 
be less dangerous in power than out insisted they participate in a 
fourparty transitional government that would run the country before 
elections 
chinas chief delegate vice foreign minister liu shuqing said 
the failure to reach a settlement signifies that the resistance 
struggle against vietnamese agression will continue in cambodia 
he said china would continue aid to the guerrillas while seeking 
peace 
a senior us official said privately we may be moving into a 
period where having had this initial test of political opinion 
things will go back to the battlefield 
in washington state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler 
said the bush administration welcomed the progress made at the 
conference and hoped it would lead to a comprehensive settlement 
li mai vietnamese ambassador in bangkok said hun sens army was 
capable of defending itself they are very selfconfident and i 
think they are very capable he said 
at a news conference wednesday night hun sen called for a 
diplomatic solution but said he expected renewed attacks by the 
khmer rouge we have really prepared ourselves for the worst he 
told the reporters

a bridge being built over a major 
baltimorewashington artery collapsed during rushhour thursday as 
workers poured its concrete deck trapping several motorists beneath 
debris fourteen people were injured 
one victim kimberly anderson of elkridge was listed in critical 
condition she was one of five commuters in two cars caught under a 
hail of wet concrete metal and wood on the baltimorewashington 
parkway 
ms anderson 30 suffered multiple injuries including head 
wounds and facial cuts said andy trohanis a spokesman for the 
university of maryland shock trauma center 
none of the other victims including nine construction workers 
had serious injuries authorities said 
investigators were focusing on the false work or shoring that 
supports the concrete road surface while it cures and sets the 
workers had poured about 200 tons of concrete and were twothirds of 
the way through when the bridge collapsed in the middle said gene 
mccormick deputy administrator for the federal highway 
administration 
the shoring basically collapsed we suspect the shoring is 
probably the cause of the failure we have no specific conclusions 
at this point mccormick said 
the shoring was a combination of timber members and steel 
members mccormick said conceivably i am not suggesting this 
at all something could have hit one of the support members and 
thereby led to the failure 
early morning rushhour traffic was heavy when the route 198 span 
collapsed about 630 am 
all i seen was concrete flying and falling down said steve 
brown it collapsed fast 
rescue workers initially feared more cars may have been trapped 
under a 10foottall pile of debris and carefully removed pieces of 
gooey concrete wood and metal by hand 
by 11 am however rescuers said it appeared all the victims 
had been rescued heavy equipment was brought in to clean up the 
debris 
mccormick said five federal inspectors were at the overpass at 
the time of the collapse the supports for the molds into which the 
concrete was being poured had been inspected and approved in early 
july he said 
the foreman said he heard a clanging or a clunk just before the 
bridge collapsed but there was really no warning mccormick said 
the concreteladen span lay in the parkway amid the broken and 
twisted metal and wood that once formed its framework us park 
police said it will be two days before the parkway is reopened 
one commuter ernest izzard 52 of baltimore was treated for 
minor injuries at the shock trauma center and released a hospital 
spokesman said 
three baltimore men riding in the same car as izzard roderick 
farmer 29 woodrow brown 52 and thomas rogers 53 were listed 
in good condition with minor bruises at prince georges county 
hospital center 
nine construction workers were taken to greater laurel beltsville 
hospital hospital spokeswoman darci nelson said eight were treated 
for sprains and bruises and discharged the ninth suffered a 
fractured and dislocated shoulder

foreign dignitaries streamed into a freshly 
painted tripoli on thursday for celebrations of the 20th anniversary 
of the radical revolution led by col moammar gadhafi 
fridays multimilliondollar bash featuring a military parade 
and air show was expected to attract top officials from nicaragua 
to north korea 
the dispatching of highranking envoys from egypt chad and italy 
to the festival underlined gadhafis efforts in recent years to move 
away from a radical goitalone policy to one of cooperation with 
his northern african neighbors and western europe 
however it appeared not all of gadhafis plans for the 
celebration would come off a western european diplomat speaking on 
condition of anonymity said committee sessions on a planned maghreb 
summit had broken off over differences in financial matters between 
the maghreb members libya algeria tunisia morocco and 
mauritania he did not elaborate 
gadhafi seized power from king idris on sept 1 1969 and 
replaced the countrys prowestern policy with his own personal 
brand of socialism and panarabism relations between libya and 
washington deteriorated and in april 1986 the united states bombed 
tripoli and benghazi in retaliation for what it called libyas 
sponsoring of international iterrorism 
on thursday gadhafi went to tripolis military airport to greet 
the leaders of gabon madagascar south yemen ghana algeria 
tunisia mozambique and syria as well as palestine liberation 
organization chief yasser arafat 
syrian president hafez assads presence was unusual he rarely 
travels and is thought to have gone to libya an ally because of 
his isolation in his war against lebanons christians 
a military band played and 21gun salutes boomed as the 
dignitaries were met by gadhafi wearing white slacks a white 
jacket a green shirt and sunglasses 
king hassan ii of morocco made the grandest entry sailing into 
tripolis downtown harbor in a small white ship flanked by libyan 
escort vessels and blaring its horn 
the leaders of madagascar somalia malta djibouti and south 
yemen already were in tripoli along with official delegations from

italian foreign ministrer gianni de michelis was the 
highestranking westerner who traveled to the former italian colony 
he was the first italian government official to visit libya since it 
fired a missile at an italian island in 1986 
egyptian president hosni mubarak sent a toplevel envoy to the 
celebrations in a cautious step toward resolving a bitter feud with 
libya youssef waly deputy prime minister and secretarygeneral of 
the ruling party was the highest egyptian official to visit since 
1977 when the two countries fought a fiveday border war 
egypt and libya recently reopened their border and resumed air 
flights western european diplomats in tripoli said they expected 
the two countries would soon reestablish diplomatic relations 
broken in 1978 
in algeria diplomats announced that libya and chad had signed a 
peace agreement in the accord signed in algiers the two countries 
agreed to end 16 years of fighting over the disputed aozou strip and

thousands of people in the republic of moldavia 
surged into the streets of its capital thursday night to protest a 
legislative compromise that will keep the russian language a part of 
their everyday life activists said 
members of the southern republics legislature voted to 
substitute moldavian similar to romanian for russian as the 
language of government and economic affairs but they ruled that 
both russian and moldavian could be used in everyday life 
the people are scandalized we need only one language said 
vasily nestase of the promoldavian peoples front speaking by 
telephone from kishinev the capital 
nestase estimated tens of thousands of people took to the streets 
outside the theater where the deputies had met and he played a tape 
recording of the shouting masses he said hundreds of police armed 
with clubs had formed a cordon around the building 
if this decision is not reversed we will start a general 
strike he said the next step he said is secession from the 
soviet union 
we are not a legal part of the soviet union he said 
pointing to the soviet annexation of moldavia from neighboring 
romania in 1940 under the terms of the nazisoviet nonaggression 
pact which also put the baltic states under soviet control 
the legislators had been seeking a compromise that would placate 
both moldavian nationalists and russian immigrants the moldavians 
are trying to shed what they see as decades of infringement on their 
rights the russians feared they would be forced to learn moldavian 
and went on strike at 200 enterprises in protest 
representatives of both the moldavian peoples front and the 
prorussian group yedinstvo said wednesday they saw support for the 
compromise 
the choice of language is an important issue for soviets because 
many believe they were forced to adopt russian even though their 
native tongues are vastly different and represent their distinct 
cultural heritage 
the legislature or supreme soviet gave the nationalists a 
clearcut victory in two of its three decisions thursday 
it declared moldavian the state language to be used in 
political economic social and cultural affairs moldavia 
previously had no official language but russian was typically used 
in government and commerce especially since many cities are 
dominated by nonmoldavians 
the legislature also restored the latin alphabet taken away a 
halfcentury ago by dictator josef stalin when he annexed moldavia 
stalin imposed cyrillic the alphabet used in russian to back his 
claim that romanians and moldavians are two distinct nationalities 
even though the languages are virtually identical 
the vote approving the bill on moldavian as the official language 
was 32111 with an undetermined number of abstentions said a 
reporter for atem moldavias official news agency there were 
conflicting reports on the vote counts on other measures 
the third proposal which was rejected would have made moldavian 
the language of communication among russians ukrainians jews 
bulgarians and other nationalities in the republic many 
nonmoldavians do not speak moldavian but they share some knowledge 
of russian as a result of soviet schooling 
legislators instead opted for an obscurely worded compromise of 
bilingualism similar to that proposed wednesday by moldavias 
communist party chief semen grossu after a telephone conversation 
with president mikhail s gorbachev 
according to a reporter for atem it reads the russian 
language as the language of interethnic communication in the 
ussr is used on the territory of the republic together with 
moldavian as a language of interethnic communication which ensures 
the carrying out of real bilingualism between russian and the 
national tongue 
in the baltic republics meanwhile the leaders of the peoples 
fronts of latvia lithuania and estonia reacted to the communist 
party leaderships recent scathing criticism of their independence 
movements with a lengthy analysis of the situation 
the peoples front report says recent petitions and 
demonstrations calling for freedom in the baltics are a normal 
process for today said ianis krummins deputy editor of the 
latvian peoples front newspaper atmoda 
the soviet press has been full of criticism of the baltics since 
the party statement saturday 
tass reported thursday that some members of communist partys 
central committee met to discuss rising violence in 
nagornokarabakh a largely armenian territory inside azerbaijan 
the group called for dialogue at all levels to stop ethnic clashes 
there

soldiers killed one man and 
wounded six in a mistaken attack on a group of unarmed young people 
whose pickup truck ran out of gas after nighttime beach party 
victims said thursday 
the man killed was rafael garcia whose friends gave the party 
for him the night before he was to leave for the united states 
col rene emilio ponce head of the joint chiefs of staff said 
of the attack tuesday and the killing of a high school student by a 
soldier last week these are lamentable incidents that happen in 
the climate of tension in which we live 
at least 70000 people most of them civilians have been killed 
in el salvadors 10yearold civil war with leftist rebels 
ponce told a news conference thursday the soldiers involved in 
both shootings were in custody and would stand trial 
the high command has no intention of covering up any criminal 
activity within the armed forces he said 
rafael ernesto franco 23 spoke with the associated press from 
his bed at rosales hospital he was wounded in both arms and the 
abdomen during the encounter in the western province of sonsonate 
in the next bed with a chest wound was francisco lopez 
escalante 20 
they said they were returning from the beach to their homes in 
sonsonate city with 13 companions at about 300 am tuesday and ran 
out of gas on a rural highway 
we were waiting for dawn to see if someone would come by and 
take us to buy gas when two vehicles drove up and without saying a 
word they opened fire franco said after they shot us they 
asked us where our guns were a statement from col juan 
rodriguez sonsonate provincial commander said his post was 
informed by a motorist that guerrillas had set up a roadblock on the 
highway 
a patrol was dispatched and when the patrol was driving along 
the highway some individuals stepped out all of a sudden making 
signals to stop and that is when the soldiers opened fire the 
statement said 
franco said the the soldiers acted wrongly they could have 
pointed their guns at us asked us who we were and checked our 
documents 
he lopez and another seriously wounded man were moved to san 
salvador on wednesday 
the soldiers did not want to take us to the hospital but after 
a while their hearts softened and they took us to the sonsonate 
hospital franco said even so their truck wouldnt start at 
first and they made us even the wounded ones push it to start 
it 
on aug 22 high school student manuel miranda 17 was killed by 
an army trooper who was checking the youngsters documents at a 
checkpoint in san salvador 
we have no doubts about the honesty and the good conduct of the 
student miranda who was not involved in any subversive activity

president mengistu haile mariam said 
tigrean rebels launched surprise attacks on all fronts in 
northeastern ethiopia at dawn thursday six days after saying they 
wanted peace talks 
the announcement came only hours after mengistu had given an 
optimistic assessment of recent peace moves to the countrys shengo 
or parliament 
but when the legislative assembly resumed its afternoon session 
mengistu reappeared to tell deputies of a dawn offensive by the 
tigrean peoples liberation front 
the president said the rebels launched massive attacks in tigre 
and wollo provinces in northeastern ethiopia and that fighting may 
have extended to gondar in the northwest 
he said the offensive appears to be supported by ethiopias major 
rebel group the eritrean peoples liberation front 
there are indications that the rebels might extend the fighting 
to gondar and attempt to cut the addis ababaassab highway 
mengistu said 
assab is ethiopias main port on the red sea and the highway 
which was badly damaged in a series of earthquakes 10 days ago was 
reopened only wednesday it is the capitals main link to the sea 
the two rebel groups supported each other in coordinated attacks 
in early 1988 that won them control of all of tigre and most of 
eritrea ethiopias northernmost province gondar and wollo were 
largely spared in that offensive 
mengistu called thursdays attack a regrettable and sad 
development 
while he did not give casualty figures for either side his 
description of the fighting suggested government forces are being 
pushed back 
mengistu had told the mornings opening session of parliament 
that his government soon would hold peace talks with the tigrean 
rebels 
although he made no reference to those planned talks in his 
afternoon announcement the attack may have put any possible 
negotiations on indefinite hold 
government officials and eritrean rebels have planned to meet in 
atlanta beginning sept 7 with former president jimmy carter acting 
as an observer tigrean rebels took up arms 14 years ago to press 
for increased autonomy in their region on aug 25 they announced 
they were ready for peace talks overseen by carter 
eritrean rebels have been fighting for independence since 1961 
they agreed to peace talks in june after mengistu announced there 
would be no conditions and he would welcome an independent observer

gallons revised its figure after british petroleum said the spill 
involved only 600 gallons a slick extended 4 miles downriver from 
the site 
representatives of the minerva owned by argo dua shipping pte

the director of forensic medicine in israel said 
thursday that many palestinian deaths attributed to clashes with 
troops in the occupied areas actually resulted from criminal 
disputes or other circumstances 
the comments by yehuda hiss director of the state abu kabir 
institute for forensic medicine in tel aviv came as an israeli tax 
collector died of injuries from a palestinian firebomb attack two 
weeks ago and a palestinian whose family said he was beaten died 
of wounds in the gaza strip 
tax collector gideon zakens death raised to 39 the number of 
israelis killed in the palestinian rebellion at least 554 
palestinians have been killed by soldiers or jewish settlers during 
the 20monthold revolt and 100 palestinians have been killed by 
fellow arabs as suspected collaborators 
at least 16 palestinians were shot and wounded in clashes with 
troops in the gaza strip on thursday arab reports said 
hiss told the associated press he found 25 percent of deaths 
attributed to israeli troopers during the uprising were not linked 
to the army 
he said 30 percent of the palestinians killed and said to be 
victims of the intefadeh or uprising were brought to abu kabir 
for autopsies 
in one fourth of the cases hiss said he found the arabs died of 
strangulation stabbing or suffocation and not army force in two 
cases the victims had been decapitated he said 
hiss attributed the deaths to criminal disputes family honor 
killings and suspicion of collaborating with israel 
i fear that in a number of years the world will blame us 
for causing the death of thousands of residents of the territories 
many of whom i am certain did not die from army operations hiss 
said 
he said the deaths including some from natural causes are all 
put in one basket of victims of the intefadeh 
the controversy over cause of death in the occupied west bank and 
gaza strip is reflected in differing death tolls offered by rival 
sides and by news organizations 
official army statistics show 450 palestinians killed in the west 
bank and gaza strip as a result of clashes with troops between 
december 1987 and midaugust 1989 
an unofficial toll for the same period compiled by the ap showed 
535 palestinians killed by troops or settlers 
both tolls exclude many deaths which arab reports said resulted 
from teargas inhalation or beatings 
some palestinian organizations put the number of palestinian 
deaths at more than 700 
one palestinian journalist who spoke on condition of anonymity 
called the arab figures exxagerated he said hospital doctors were 
threatened and their cars burned for refusing to falsify death 
records 
hiss also noted the widespread practice of taking bodies from 
hospitals in arab areas and burying them before an autopsy he 
recommended exhuming the bodies for autopsies 
hiss said many claims of torture or killing by troops proved 
untrue when autopsy was performed he cited the death of amjad 
jibril tawil 14 a palestinianamerican boy near the west bank 
city of ramallah two weeks ago 
palestinian reports said the boy was found dead with broken arms 
teeth knocked out and cigarette burns covering his body but an 
autopsy at abu kabir and a subsequent independent autopsy found no 
signs of torture 
tawil died from a gunshot in the back 
hospital spokeswoman ruth mekel said thursday that zaken died in 
jerusalems hadassah hospital after suffering burns on 70 percent of 
his body in a firebomb attack 
in gaza 19yearold ahmad abdullah agha died at nasser hospital 
in khan yunis of head injuries his family said he was beaten by 
soldiers in a clash four days earlier the army said it was 
investigating the reported beating 
in the west bank the body of a 30yearold palestinian taxi 
driver burhan badawi was found in a pushcart in nablus the army 
said arab reporters said the reason for his death was unclear

the overall premium charges for medicare 
catastrophic coverage would be lowered by plugging a loophole that 
favors senior citizens with taxfree investment income the health 
and human services departments inspector general said thursday 
inspector general richard kusserow said in an audit report that 
if taxexempt interest were included in the income calculation used 
to figure individual premiums significant revenues could be 
generated to reduce premiums and correct an inequity that hurts less 
affluent beneficiaries 
auditors said they were unable to estimate how much could be 
produced by closing the loophole 
we believe however that it is sizable the audit said 
across the country financial advisors are educating the public on 
how they can reduce their catastrophic coverage premium by shifting 
to taxfree or taxdeferred investments such as municipal bonds 
annuities and mutual funds 
the inspector general said closing the loophole would produce 
savings that could be used if the administration and congress were 
so inclined to reduce premiums 
the audit said the exclusion is unfair to lower income and 
financially unsophisticated taxpayers who do not own taxfree 
investments and have no opportunity to avoid paying the premium 
the exclusion of taxexempt interest also is inconsistent with 
the way the federal government taxes social security benefits in 
figuring how much of these benefits can be taxed social security 
recipients must include taxexempt income 
the health care financing administration in comments included in 
the audit rejected the inspector generals recommendation that it 
propose legislation to close the loophole the agency noted that 
president bush has said it is too early in the program to start 
making changes in it 
the catastrophic coverage program was set up to be funded 
entirely by the elderly senior citizens who object to the 
supplemental premium they will pay have been pressuring congress to 
change the funding mechanism 
to pay for the program the medicare part b premium this year was 
increased by 4 per month and medicare beneficiaries will pay a 
supplemental premium computed at 2250 per 150 of federal income 
tax liability that premium is scheduled to increase to 42 by 1993 
the most a person will have to pay this year is 800 or 1600 
for a couple in which both partners are eligible for medicare

a sevenpronged 191 million research program 
to understand how mans activities and pollution are changing the 
planet was laid out thursday by a group of federal agencies 
the goal is to monitor understand and ultimately predict 
global change said robert post of the office of science and 
technology policy 
global change is a large complex scientific problem and it 
still is not largely understood said dallas peck director of the 
u s geological survey and chairman of the federal committee on 
earth science which is coordinating the research effort 
there is a shared common purpose to understand global change 
were in the planning stages added dixon butler of the national 
aeronautics and space administration 
the effort announced thursday covers the coming fiscal year 
beginning oct 1 peck described it as largely a planning period to 
be used setting up research programs likely to last a decade or more 
the atmosphere and the role of clouds received top priority in in 
the program michael hall of the national oceanic and atmospheric 
administration said clouds are a major factor in the feared rise in 
global temperatures and their effect is not well understood 
the widely discussed threat of global warming however is only 
part of the overall research effort the studies also will look at 
threats to the earths protective ozone layer possible changes in 
the oceans and atmosphere air pollution acid rain and other 
processes 
reports of warmer temperatures have drawn the most attention 
recently some scientists are concerned that carbon dioxide and 
other gases added to the atmosphere by human activities are causing 
the higher temperatures and tha eventually they might lead to 
disruptive climate changes 
other scientists dispute the socalled greenhouse effect and 
evidence is lacking on both sides that is an area the researchers 
hope to tackle early 
funds totaling 1915 million for fiscal 1990 are included in the 
budgets of various departments to get the program under way said 
bob corell of the national science foundation in january the 
committee will put together requests for funds for 1991 and future 
years he said 
the seven major areas of research set forth thursday are 
climate and hydrologic systems the role of clouds is the first 
item on the agenda followed by research in ocean circulation and 
interaction of the air land and water 
biogeochemical dynamics the relationship between living 
organisms and the water and atmosphere for example trees take 
carbon dioxide out of the air and replace it with oxygen cutting 
down trees reduces that activity 
ecological systems and dynamics how people plants and animals 
would react to climate change and how those reactions might in turn 
affect other processes 
earth system history what has happened to the land air and 
water when climate has changed in the past 
human interactions population growth and development energy 
and land use and industrial production and how those activities 
affect the earth 
solid earth research coastal erosion volcanoes and their 
effect on climate permafrost the seafloor and other areas 
solar influences monitoring incoming radiation from the sun 
the amount reflected back into space and how this energy affects the 
earth and its climate 
in addition to the geological survey nasa and noaa other 
agencies in the program are the state department environmental 
protection agency department of transportation department of 
agriculture council on environmental quality and the department of 
defense

the supreme court on thursday suspended 
the adoptions of babies by foreigners after president andres 
rodriguez complained the system was run more like a business than a 
social service 
court president jose alberto correa said adoptions in process may 
be completed 
rodriguez complained publicly on aug 17 that infants are being 
sold for 7000 and incredibly judges and lawyers are involved in 
this business it is a shame that paraguayan children are 
negotiated over like merchandise 
the general ousted the 34year regime of president gen alfredo 
stroessner in a feb 3 coup and was overwhelmingly elected president 
on may 1 
newspapers printed stories involving poor women who said they 
felt pressured to give up their children and of foreigners many 
from the united states allegedly paying large sums for healthy 
babies with blond hair and blue eyes 
judges became reluctant to give the final authorization that 
would allow paraguayan infants to leave the country with adoptive 
parents 
jay and susan steinhof of berlin mass are among eight us 
couples in asuncion awaiting judicial permission to take home babies 
they were given since arriving during the previous two weeks 
jason has put on 1 pounds since we got him jay steinhof a 
36yearold computer software salesman said in a telephone 
interview 
they asked us what color we wanted he said noting that the 
baby has dark hair dark eyes and medium to dark skin we 
didnt care we were more concerned that it be a boy we have a 
daughter 
until recently adoptions by foreign families were comparatively 
easy and fast adoptions by us families went from 37 in 1985 to 
322 in 1988 
i called several adoption agencies in alabama but when they 
found out our ages they wouldnt accept us said judy hooper 37 
in an interview earlier this year 
she and her husband granville hooper 40 of hanceville ala 
now are the parents of 6monthold tyler dennis a chubby 
blackhaired boy with brown eyes 
about 220 adoptions are pending a us embassy official said in 
a telephone interview the official who commented on condition of 
anonymity said it was unclear how many would be allowed to go 
through 
under regulations due to be revised preference was given to 
paraguayans seeking to adopt and foreign families had to submit 
eight reports during the first two years to document their childs 
progress 
the maximum age was 60 instead of 45 as is the limit in many 
us states and there were fewer obstacles to adoptions by single 
parents 
most us applications included an approval from a stateside 
adoption agency or social worker and a visa from the immigration 
and naturalization service that allowed the child to enter the 
united states 
steinhof said he thought public opposition to the adoptions was 
based on misconceptions they seem to think we come on a plane on 
tuesday pay someone and leave with a kid on wednesday

a congressman opposed to aid for nicaragua 
contras contended thursday the state department admits it lacks the 
intelligence capability to assure that rebel attacks on civilians in 
nicaragua had ceased 
the adminstration admits now that they knew that they couldnt 
keep their promise to congress and the american people rep peter 
defazio said in a news release that quoted a state department letter 
to him 
defazio was referring to the agreement under which the contras 
could receive nonmilitary aid if they refrained from offensive 
actions 
the state department however said its letter was misinterpreted 
the letter from janet mullins assistant secretary of state for 
legislative affairs said we do not have a strong intelligence 
capability to assess responsibility for the initiation of the 
reported clashes which mar the informal truce in effect between the 
nicaraguan resistance and sandinista forces 
but given that the resistance has been cut off from military 
aid and is very low on ammunition we do not believe that they have 
the ability to take an offensive mode 
ms mullins said the department has asserted to the contras its 
position against military attacks 
in one case we terminated family support to a commander whose 
unit initiated an offensive operation after the bipartisan accord 
she said 
she also said we may have prevented an offensive operation in 
another instance by contacting the contra command after learning a 
unit leader may have been planning an attack 
the letter was a response to one written by defazio and signed by 
83 members of congress asking the administration to investigate 
allegations that the contras were engaged in offensive military 
actions 
defazios letter listed nine alleged contra attacks between april 
13 and june 8 reported by witness for peace a human rights 
organization the congressman said the reports have been 
corroborated by us journalists 
the administration is turning a blind eye to a series of 
welldocumented human rights abuses and military actions by contra 
forces said defazio 
mullins response did not speak directly to the witness for peace 
list but alluded to another series of alleged contra attacks 
reported by the nicaraguan government which she said were 
investigated by an agency she did not identify the agency but said 
that it could verify only a small number as having taken place 
on the other hand she said the department has received an 
increasing number of worrisome reports of sandinista abuses from 
nicaraguan and international human rights organizations 
under the bipartisan agreement that accompanied the 48 million 
contra aid package approved last april president bush promised to 
cut off funds to all contra units that persisted in offensive 
actions such as killing or kidnaping civilians 
under the informal agreement which has no legal standing bush 
said he would not continue spending the 48 million on the contras 
after nov 30 if congressional leaders found that the contras were 
not acting in good faith toward peace in nicaragua 
the money was appropriated for use through feb 28 1990

jim bakker was committed to a mental 
institution in handcuffs and leg shackles thursday after a 
psychiatrist reported the tv evangelist was hallucinating and 
cowering in a fetal position in his lawyers office 
us district judge robert potter suspended bakkers fraud trial 
and ordered him to the federal correctional institute in butner for 
up to 60 days for psychiatric evaluation to determine whether he is 
competent to stand trial 
please dont do this to me a sobbing disheveled bakker said 
as he was led from his lawyers office by us marshals to the 
courthouse for processing of the commitment order he curled up in a 
fetal position in the back seat 
mr bakker im going to have to ask you to sit up please a 
deputy marshal said 
after the paperwork was completed bakker bound hand and foot 
was taken to butner to spend his first night behind bars since the 
ptl scandal broke the evangelist is accused of fleecing followers 
of his evangelical empire 
he was lying in the back seat of a marshals car when he arrived 
and a marshal held him on each side as he walked in a slow stooped 
shuffle into the prison 
dr basil jackson a psychiatrist who has been treating bakker 
for nine months told the judge that bakker began hallucinating 
wednesday after a former ptl executive testifying against him 
collapsed on the stand the witness was revived within seconds and 
said he was laid low by illness 
mr bakker reported that when he left the courthouse wednesday 
suddenly people outside took on the form of frightening animals 
which he felt were intent on destroying him attacking him and 
hurting him jackson said 
jackson said bakkers condition worsened overnight even after he 
was given xanax an antidepressant sedative bakker was not in 
court for the hearing 
on thursday morning bakker was lying in the corner of his 
attorneys office with his head under a couch hiding jackson 
said he was expressing thoughts that someone was going to hurt 
him 
to put it in lay language the man is stressed out jackson 
said later 
prosecution and defense lawyers are under court order not to 
discuss the trial outside of the courtroom but during the hearing 
assistant us attorney jerry miller described the psychiatrist as a 
hired gun 
former assistant us attorney mike scofield said most pretrial 
psychiatric evaluations take about 45 days but the judge told 
jurors who were not told the reason for the suspension in the 
trial to report back to court in a week 
bakker and other ptl executives are accused of diverting for 
their own use more than 4 million of 158 million raised from 
followers who gave 1000 for three nights free lodging each year 
for life at the ministrys hotels 
if convicted on all 24 counts bakker could be sentenced to 120 
years in prison and fined 5 million 
bakkers wife tammy told reporters her husband was very 
distressed by the collapse in the courtroom wednesday of former ptl 
executive steve nelson a prosecution witness 
i knew when i talked to jim last night that he was in a 
terrible emotional trauma and i prayed with him and we agreed that 
we would trust the lord she said outside her home in orlando fla 
i would like to tell the people you be in our shoes and see if 
you can hold steady for 2 years she added 
defense attorney george t davis told potter that bakker 49 
kept saying he wanted the trial to continue but was on the floor 
in a fetal position 
if mr bakker is handled gently and carefully he may be able to 
proceed with this trial davis said the defense had tried to 
persuade the judge to allow bakker to stay in a private institution 
last year mrs bakker described a similar scene saying in a 
fundraising letter to supporters that her husband had stayed in a 
fetal position for hours after he was forced to leave the ministry 
in 1987 
and jessica hahn the woman whose 1980 sexual encounter with 
bakker led to bakkers downfall said in a 1987 playboy interview 
that just after the tryst a fellow evangelist who had just come 
from bakkers hotel room said he was lying in a fetal position in 
his room saying hes happy 
jim bakkers biggest power play was and still is manipulation 
through sympathy miss hahn said through her publicist kari 
lundin after hearing of thursdays incident 
jackson said his initial diagnosis was that bakker was actively 
hallucinating suffers from acute depression and has episodes 
where he is unable to adequately judge and relate to reality 
nelsons collapse came the same day that lawyers confirmed that 
another key witness in the trial former ptl secondincommand 
richard dortch was being treated at a clearwater fla hospital 
for an undisclosed ailment 
the butner facility has been used for psychiatric evaluations of 
john hinckley who shot president reagan and hustler magazine 
publisher larry flynt it houses about 320 inmates including about 
150 in the mental health unit 
marshals said the shackles that bound bakker are standard 
procedure for moving prisoners 
a few supporters were on hand to offer encouragement 
he will come back said loretta mays of jacksonville fla 
jims a fighter hes not a quitter but it will take time

buses beaches and public 
swimming pools are segregated by law throughout south africa but a 
judge ruled thursday that a town council was wrong in reserving a 
park for whites 
pretoria supreme court judge cf eloff said the carletonville 
town council acted with improper motives when it resegregated 
the park last year 
in johannesburg the south african council of churches said 
authorities in bonn are refusing to investigate charges that west 
german firms are helping south africa build submarines in violation 
of a un arms embargo 
also thursday publishers of south africas largestselling 
newspaper were fined 800 for violating a security law by quoting a 
banned black activist 
the sunday times published an interview with harry gwala a 
senior member of the african national congress guerrilla movement 
in december after his release from prison 
lawyers said they will appeal the judgment from a magistrate who 
said the newspaper was negligent in failing to determine that gwala 
is among people not allowed to quoted in south africa 
in carletonville town council chairman jacobus nel told a 
pretoria supreme court that officials banned blacks from the park 
because of complaints they were littering and urinating in public 
however eloff said i find that the town council was not 
motivated to make the decision on account of a nuisance of black 
people 
three carletonville businessmen filed the suit saying the 
resegregation triggered a black consumer boycott 
the town 50 miles west of johannesburg is one of several where 
the farright conservative party has reinstituted strict segregation 
since capturing control in municipal elections last year 
the conservatives oppose all concessions to the 28million black 
majority and say blacks should have political rights only in tribal 
homelands 
under south africas apartheid policy of race discrimination it 
is legal to segregate public facilities though many public places 
have been integrated in recent years 
conservative party spokesman arthur kemp said thursdays ruling 
will be appealed because the council acted strictly within statute 
law 
he said the national partys position is vicious hypocrisy 
the nationalists like to boast to foreign audiences that they are 
dismantling apartheid while maintaining segregation to please white 
voters he said 
the south african council of churches said in a statement that 
reports by an oslobased monitoring group and colognes wdr 
television provided details of three west german companies 
collaborating in south africas submarine project 
throughout the submarine saga the german government has sought 
to sweep the matter under the carpet the church council said it 
noted the bonn government on aug 1 refused a request by the kiel 
prosecutors office to investigate the kiel shipbuilding company 
howaldtswerkedeutsche werft ag and the engineering firm 
ingenieurkontor luebeck 
west germanys economics ministry said there was no evidence the 
firms dealings with south africa were illegal 
the government can only be cleared if it allows an intensive 
investigation the council said 
vice adm dries putter chief of south africas navy said in a 
statement thursday that the navy has postponed indefinitely 
plans to build its own submarines he said the navy has completed a 
major modernization of one of its three frenchbuilt daphne class 
submarines and is busy upgrading a second 
south africa customarily refuses to disclose details of military 
cooperation with foreign countries

former premier ciriaco de mita resigned thursday as 
president of the dominant christian democrat party then changed his 
mind several hours later 
de mita told a meeting of party leaders late thursday that he 
would stay on as christian democrat president after receiving 
assurances that his opinions would be respected 
only hours earlier he told reporters he had resigned because of 
concerns the party gives the impression of being in a different 
frequency than mine 
the decision to stay on appeared to represent a gain for de 
mitas wing of the christian democrats considered on the left 
of the party its members had been criticized and excluded from top 
government posts since christian democrat giulio andreotti succeeded 
de mita as premier in july 
andreottis faction of the party is considered more traditional 
and closer to the roman catholic church 
the support de mita received in party leaders speeches thursday 
also patched over a growing breach in the party which has been the 
most important force in italian government since world war ii 
andreotti has responded in a convincing way de mita said 
thursday evening referring to the premiers public plea to de mita 
to remain in his post 
de mita 61 is credited with reversing the sliding electoral 
fortunes of italys dominant party during his sevenyear term as 
party secretary which ended in february 
he was then moved to party president a position with less 
authority post because of charges by party members that he held 
too much power 
the move led to the collapse of de mitas 13monthold government 
in may andreotti then formed italys 49th postwar government with 
the partys same five coalition partners christian democrats 
socialists social democrats liberals and republicans 
political observers had speculated that a de mita resignation 
could lead to a split in the christian democrat party such a 
division would radically change the political landscape in italy 
where the christian democrats have been the main force keeping the 
communists out of power

a leader of ethnic turkish immigrants 
from bulgaria claimed thursday that 160 people have been killed in 
clashes this month between bulgarian security forces and the moslem 
pomak minority 
mehmet cavus head of the association for culture and solidarity 
of balkan turks told a news conference hundreds of pomaks have been 
killed in fighting in northern and southern bulgaria and thousands 
have been imprisoned 
in new york the united nations announced thursday it has sent a 
team to investigate charges that bulgaria has expelled more than 
250000 members of its turkish minority in the past three months 
the team will visit turkey and bulgaria 
in istanbul cavus said his reports on alleged killings came from 
sources in bulgaria he declined to identify them further saying he 
did not want to endanger them 
last week bulgaria denied a report quoting diplomats in sofia as 
saying 15 people had been killed in fighting between security forces 
and pomaks a bulgarian moslem ethnic group numbering about 200000 
president bush recalled us ambassador sol polansky from 
bulgaria to protest the alleged human rights abuses 
cavus said the latest violence occurred after pomaks held rallies 
to protest the governments refusal to give them passports to 
emigrate 
the pomaks had hoped to follow at least 310000 ethnics turks 
living in bulgaria who have received passports and crossed to turkey 
since may when communist authorities said at least nine ethnic 
turks died in clashes with security forces in northern bulgaria 
diplomats put the number of deaths in may at 30 or more 
like the pomaks the ethnic turks say they were victims of a 
forced assimilation campaign 
the sudden emigration has left bulgaria facing an acute labor 
shortage last month special regulations empowered authorities to 
draft labor from towns to harvest the fields 
turkey also is affected by the exodus europes largest refugee 
problem since the end of world war ii and two weeks said it was 
closing its border to stem the flow 
early in august 92 pomaks from northern bulgaria signed a 
statement protesting that the interior ministry had refused to give 
them travel documents 
they reportedly were told they are not included in reforms 
allowing all bulgarians to travel abroad 
un spokeswoman nadia younes said secretarygeneral javier perez 
de cuellar has been in touch with leaders of bulgaria and turkey 
he did send a team headed by james jonah the head of the 
office of research and the collection of information to go to the 
area to ascertain the facts and report back to him she said 
jonah is an assistant secretarygeneral whose office sometimes is 
called the secretarygenerals foreign ministry it was formed 
in 1987 and collects information on situations that could threaten 
peace and security 
for five years bulgaria has been trying to assimilate its 1 
million ethnic turks by denying their identity as a minority and 
forcing them to give up islamic names bulgarias population is 
about 9 million

the former director of mexicos largest copper 
mine was arraigned thursday on charges of defrauding the bankrupt 
state company thirtythree company officials have been arrested 
attorney general enrique alvarez del castillo said emilio ocampo 
arenals actions did not involve the administrative council of the 
cananea mine and that his office will not investigate the full 
council 
all of the illegal actions that were taken were without the 
consent and without the knowledge of the administrative council 
they were personal actions of the implicated party and he confessed 
that he told a news conference on thursday 
ocampo is accused of embezzling 3 million he is the soninlaw 
of former president luis echeverria who served from 197076 
the miners union had demanded an investigation of the 
chileanborn ocampo and other top management opposition political 
parties also alleged company mismanagement was involved and asked 
for an investigation after soldiers forced the openpit mine to 
close down on aug 20 
alvarez del castillo said the bankruptcy was not due solely to 
mismanagement the bad administration and conspiracy that occurred 
obviously caused damage that is one of the reasons he said 
his office said in a statement earlier that ocampo admitted to 
illegally authorizing contracts to obtain personal benefit of 5 
percent of authorized sales from 198389 
closing of the mine 25 miles south of the arizona border threw 
3200 miners out of work it came one week before the mineworkers 
had scheduled a strike to press for a 330 percent wageandbenefit 
increase 
the government which owns 90 percent of the operation is 
seeking a buyer for the insolvent mine

soviet lawmakers here observing the workings of 
us government said thursday they want the same authority that 
congress has in order to curb the power of executive government 
officials in moscow 
unfortunately many good ideas for soviet democracy such as 
legislative oversight over the military and the kgb secret police 
still lack support to become law said konstantin lubenchenko 
leader of the sixmember delegation of the supreme soviet 
lubenchenko deputy chairman of the supreme soviets committee on 
constitutionality and legislative reform said many old guard 
deputies in his countrys legislative body refuse to even vote on 
such proposals 
when the question of roll call arises twothirds of the 
deputies oppose letting the voters know how they voted and until 
today the proposal is blocked said another supreme soviet member 
andrei e sebentsov 
the delegation is studying the adoption of timesaving us 
electronic voting systems that will make it possible for every 
voter to know how his deputy voted sebentsov said this may be 
hard for some deputies to get used to but theyre going to have 
to 
addressing a news conference here the soviet lawmakers said they 
are determined to convert their country to a genuine democracy 
despite entrenched resistence and potentials for setbacks 
people in all groups of society favor moving toward greater 
democracy farmers intellectuals the working class young people 
the middleaged and this is a very powerful force lubenchenko 
said 
we are building from the ground level like bricklayers 
without a good blueprint but with great desire to build a good 
house he said to draw the blueprint we have come to study the 
us model and not only the us but also european continental 
parliaments 
the soviet lawmakers threeweek visit is being sponsored by the 
american committee on ussoviet relations an independent 
nonpartisan educational group and the international foundation a 
philanthropic organization 
the visitors have met with numerous congressional staff and 
support officials and next week will meet legislators and witness

by the warm climate record numbers of exotic insects are invading 
los angeles county and posing an unprecedented threat to the states 
16 billion a year farm economy 
as of july 1185 potentially harmful pests have appeared in 
california including fruit flies and gypsy moths fire ants 
russian wheat aphids japanese beetles mealy bugs and scales 
we are being literally swamped said rosser w garrison a 
county entomologist who supplied the statistics the variety of 
insects is increasing and the sheer number is increasing 
besides the climate los angeles has become a magnet for imported 
insects because of the ease of international travel more than 37 
million foreigners passed through us customs at los angeles 
international airport last year and at least some presumably 
slipped fresh fruit and vegetables past inspectors officials said

two plays that flopped in new york are 
delighting critics and audiences at the edinburgh festival fringe 
vindicating the faith of a producer with a fondness for problem 
plays 
to be sure the 422 plays on offer in the 43rd annual festival 
fringe include the usual number of american classics and broadway 
hits from long days journey into night to more recent works 
including agnes of god and night mother 
but two plays that were original alsorans are unexpectedly 
coming up trumps edward albees the man who had three arms and 
michael cristofers the lady and the clarinet 
both plays which were new york flops in the early 1980s have 
won the scotsman newspapers coveted fringe first awards given 
weekly to the best of the fringes many openings during the 
festivals three weeks 
edinburgh is a place where people feel able to see stuff over 
again to make a reevaluation said harold easton the new 
yorkbased producer of lady and the clarinet 
the play about the amorous foibles of a woman named luba 
starred stockard channing in its offbroadway production in 1983 
this time with british actress imelda staunton as luba the play is 
selling out at the 72seat netherbow center playhouse 
on sept 12 it transfers to londons kings head theater for a 
month with a further transfer to the commercial west end likely to 
follow 
its not shakespeare its not great social drama but it is 
more than just a funny play said easton who believes the play 
was undervalued in its new york debut i was surprised it hadnt 
fared better there 
easton has been at the fringe for eight years as executive 
producer of the american festival theater a producing organization 
devoted to a crosssection of american plays 
ive always liked to take on problem plays plays that havent 
had whatever reception you think they should have had he said 
critics in london and edinburgh have reaffirmed his faith in 
cristofer who is at work on the screenplay of tom wolfes novel 
bonfire of the vanities john peter in the sunday times of 
london called lady a spickandspan little play brilliantly 
acted by everyone michael coveney in the financial times thought 
it zippy and said staunton was wonderful 
lynn morrow director of the southside international production 
of edward albees man who had three arms similarly refused to 
be swayed by her plays previous fate 
i think this is an exciting really wonderful play said 
morrow a professor of english at albright college in reading pa 
she described her contribution as getting the play out of the 
drawer following its frosty broadway reception in 1983 
morrow first mounted the threecharacter play at an albee 
festival last november and decided then to bring it to edinburgh 
the author is best known for whos afraid of virginia woolf and 
the zoo story plays of the 1960s that are also being revived at 
this years fringe 
critic colin affleck writing in the scotsman called man a 
remarkable play and the same newspaper quoted albee in a 
longdistance interview as saying he was ecstatic with its local 
reception in light of his long war with the drama critics of the 
united states 
morrow said her staging was probably more audiencefriendly 
than the strident haranguing production so coolly received in new 
york a production she did not see 
the original production was a little more hostile to the 
audience and the critics were lying in wait for him albee she 
said the play is structured around a lecture given by a man who 
mysteriously grows a third arm one day and then watches it shrink 
what albee does is make us question our own value system 
said morrow i think the play is brilliant 
not every unsung american play has its reputation restored in 
scotland beth henleys the wake of jamey foster a shortlived 
broadway entry early this decade got mixedtopoor reviews at this 
years fringe and david rabes hurlyburly a broadway success 
was denounced in the scotsman as exploitative badmouthed and 
boring

housewife peg bundy is crass pushy all 
dolled up and yearning to be appreciated and loved 
as such the star of fox broadcasting cos marriedwith 
children is much like the upstart network that the sitcom has led 
out of the ratings wilderness 
this past week marriedwith children got a 134 rating the 
highest ever for a fox show and for the second time this summer it 
beat the network competition the ac nielsen co rating is the 
percentage of the estimated 904 million homes with television in 
the united states 
the show ranked 17th in the nielsen ratings right there with the 
bigtime competition of nbcs the golden girls and empty 
nest 
marriedwith children which pokes fun at the happy 
wholesome families on television sitcoms has been criticized as too 
raunchy but fox has no intention of toning it down the publicity 
if anything has helped the show the show does push the limits but 
its also incredibly funny 
katey sagal stars as peg bundy the lazy sexstarved housewife 
and ed oneill is loutish al bundy whod rather roll his socks than 
satisfy his wifes longing they have a sluttish daughter a 
delinquent son and two loveydovey neighbors they are eager to 
disillusion 
were quite happy around here said peter chernin president 
of the fox broadcasting entertainment group its a happy place 
these days 
that wasnt always the case for fox broadcasting 
media mogul rupert murdochs challenge to the three commercial 
networks is at last being taken seriously after getting off to a 
shaky start three years ago with a single latenight show that 
show starring joan rivers was a ratings bomb and lasted less than 
a year 
it didnt begin primetime programming until april 1987 first on 
sunday then on saturday this fall it expands to monday 
chernin said he attributes the fox success to two factors i 
think there is a tremendous sense of momentum which helps viewers 
find fox he said theres a lot of word of mouth the press is 
writing more about us advertisers are taking us more seriously and 
our stations are growing stronger everything is working together 
the other key factor is we have tried to be as aggressive as we 
can about launching new series as early as we can weve had new 
episodes on saturday night since june 
two other fox shows americas most wanted and totally 
hidden video have also done well in the ratings this summer 
open house a revamp of duet premiered last week in 47th 
place 
21 jump street a police show about young detectives has 
attracted a large following among young people although its ratings 
have never gotten it out of the cellar 
this fall it spawns booker in which maverick policeman 
dennis booker played by richard grieco gets his own show 
booker debuts on sunday sept 24 jump street moves to 
monday on sept 18 where it will be joined by a new show alien 
nation 
fox expects to move its movie night to tuesday in october 
the tracey ullman show although not highly rated is one of 
the most critically acclaimed shows on television 
the fox success comes at a time when the three networks are 
offering mostly reruns it also comes at a time when network viewing 
is down due not only to competition from fox but from cable and pay 
networks the growing power of independent stations and the growing 
popularity of videocassettes only 57 percent of the audience 
watched the networks last week 
the real test for fox comes this month as the networks begin 
previewing shows for the fall season which officially opens on 
monday sept 18 
on one hand well have more competition in the fall said 
chernin but two things make us optimistic this same phenomenon 
happened last summer to a lesser degree thats when fox really 
started to grow that growth continued into the fall and that makes 
us optimistic it will happen again 
premiering our shows over the summer builds familiarity before 
we go head to head with the networks were optimistic that weve 
already gained an audience and a foothold in those time periods

it begins with the cocagrowing peasant in 
bolivia or peru moves on to the colombian drug baron and ends up 
with the user in the united states or europe this is the cocaine 
trail that has brought the peasant more than he has ever had before 
and the baron enormous wealth but cocaine money as colombia has 
recently shown is a curse in south america 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the cocaine trade has become so pervasive 
and so great an economic force in south america that it threatens 
the sovereignty and security of nations 
billions of cocaine dollars are making their way into and in some 
cases corrupting the economies of colombia peru bolivia and more 
recently ecuador on a scale that approaches the amounts they earn 
from legal exports 
cocaine cartels producers and traffickers have established 
virtual autonomous states in remote areas and with the support of 
local cocagrowing peasants operate out of the reach of the law 
antigovernment guerrillas in peru are arming themselves with 
millions of dollars from drug cartels and traffickers with whom 
they have allied themselves in their attempts to seize power 
in colombia traffickers have formed private armies with 
intelligencegathering units modern weapons and fleets of aircraft 
in the past decade they have killed 220 judges and other court 
employees two newspaper editors a justice minister an attorney 
general hundreds of policemen and soldiers and dozens of others 
perceived as a threat to their business 
but it was the assassination last month of the popular 
presidential candidate luis carlos galan that left the nation in 
outrage and prompted the government to launch allout war against 
the cartels 
in bolivia and peru however officials say the overall war 
against the cocaine trade will be lost without a regional effort and 
greater resources for effective cocaleaf reduction and interdiction 
programs peasant coca farmers in the far reaches of bolivia and 
peru are the suppliers for the traffickers of cocaine to the united 
states and europe 
the implications for colombia and for other latin american 
nations where narcotraffickers are able to amass huge fortunes are 
crucial the us ambassador to bolivia robert s gelbard said 
in an interview the traffickers in a variety of ways are out to 
suborn and destroy the democratic system in bolivia as in other 
countries of the region this is nothing less than a war to decide 
who will govern these countries 
gelbard added both producing and consuming nations should take 
heed of what is happening in colombia there is no such thing as 
benign drug production or consumption the sovereignty of producing 
nations is a little less secure with every new acre of coca planted 
and with every dollar spent on a cocaine high 
what we require is a regional approach to the problem because 
otherwise whatever plans we have in bolivia would be affected by 
events in other countries said gonzalo torrico under secretary 
of the interior in charge of bolivias drug interdiction programs 
already there is concern that the offensive against the colombian 
cartels will drive the traffickers to other south american nations 
where vast areas are unpatrolled and lack radar to control air 
traffic increased border patrols have already been set up in 
brazil peru ecuador and bolivia 
so far the us governments antidrug strategy in south america 
has been based on an effective interdiction program involving the 
seizure of chemicals used to process coca leaves and the destruction 
of cocaineproducing facilities the intent was to drive down the 
price of coca leaves and encourage farmers to shift to other crops 
operation snowcap a multination cocaine interdiction 
program central to the us strategy has destroyed since its 
inception in 1987 more than 200 cocaine labs and seized more than 43 
metric tons of cocaine 
us drug agents and local police forces have in recent years 
increased their operating capacity but as police activities become 
more effective traffickers use their vast resources to bribe 
judges district attorneys and police officials 
despite a greater us presence in drug producing nations 
cocaine production continues to rise by 10 percent a year a us 
state department report says as a result cocaine prices in the 
united states have steadily declined making cocaine and crack more 
available europe and asia are now the growth markets for cocaine 
peru bolivia and colombia produced 348 to 454 metric tons of 
pure cocaine in 1988 according to us government figures 
with cocaine selling wholesale in miami for 15000 a kilo 22 
pounds or higher and retailing for 50000 to 120000 the value 
of south americas cocaine is worth at least 5 billion wholesale 
and at least 17 billion retail many times the legal exports of 
drugproducing nations 
in bolivia an impoverished country of 69 million people the 
cocaine produced is worth at least 17 billion wholesale from that 
an estimated 300 million to 500 million flows back into the 
economy compared with 600 million for all legal exports combined

for perus beleaguered economy 700 million to 12 billion 
enters the economy while legal exports bring in 25 billion 
the us government allocated 549 million for cocaine 
interdiction and police training programs for the fiscal year 1989 
for all countries south of the united states before president bush 
announced a 65 million emergency package for colombias antidrug 
war 
the us congress allocated to bolivia 10 million for fiscal 
1989 5 million less than in 1988 a single planeload of cocaine 
from bolivia to colombia usually about 14500 pounds would fetch 
10 million for the shipper 
bolivian antidrug police trained by us soldiers and assisted 
by members of the us border patrol and american agents have 
destroyed three cocaine labs and 5723 cocaine paste processing 
pits compared to 3542 pits in 1988 
but vast areas of the bolivian tropical lowlands are beyond their 
reach and traffickers planes fly cocaine from the northern regions 
of bolivia to colombia or brazil without interference 
at least 60 us experts operate in bolivia alongside 1050 
bolivian antidrug police 
ecuador is becoming an important money laundering and trafficking 
center in south america cocaine shipments for the united states and 
europe have been discovered in everything from canned fruit to wood 
and handicrafts while cocaleaf production is relatively small in 
ecuador traffickers are using that andean country as a transit 
point for drugs the us drug enforcement agency dea says 
police estimate that 200 million to 400 million was laundered 
or invested in ecuador last year the united states provides ecuador 
with 1 million a year for interdiction activities 
as pressure increases in colombia and peru cocaine trafficking 
will increase in ecuador because traffickers will move to the 
country with the least amount of pressure said william fernandez 
a us dea station chief for ecuador 
newspapers in ecuador have expressed concern in editorials about 
the danger of corruption of judges and government officials by drug 
cartels 
in ecuadors most publicized case so far two judges signed an 
order for the release from jail of an important drug trafficker the 
judges then fled into hiding one was captured later with nearly 
20000 officials said he apparently had received as a payoff the 
other judge and the trafficker are still at large 
the security threat in peru is concentrated in the expanding 
insurgency of the shining path a maoist guerrilla organization that 
in the last two years has received millions of dollars from its 
involvement in the drug trade the money has allowed shining path to 
better arm itself and is the principal reason the peruvian 
government is concerned about the drug trade 
at the same time corruption of lowerlevel officials and police 
in perus huallaga valley hampers government efforts to wipe out the 
cocaine trade in the jungle region 
in the campaign for bolivias national elections this year some 
congressional candidates received backing and money from cocaine 
traffickers 
bolivian traffickers also have even staked out whole towns or 
areas as their own 
when police tried recently to capture bolivian and colombian 
traffickers in the town of santa ana hundreds of townspeople came 
to the traffickerss defense and forced the police to leave the 
town is considered a haven for traffickers 
in san borja a cocaine trafficking center police and us 
agents tried to confiscate airplanes that had small traces of 
cocaine but thousands of area residents forced them out 
cocaine corruption has reached high places in the bolivian 
government in years pase a rightwing government installed after a 
military coup in 1980 was backed by cocaine traffickers 
luis arce gomez that governments minister of the interior is 
under indictment in miami on drug trafficking charges 
bolivias new president paz zamora says several hundred million 
dollars is needed to combat the cocaine trade in bolivia 
we can win the war he said but we must change the focus 
so that the war is backed by the people of the country

us drug officials are concerned that a 
disruption of cocaine production in colombia because of the 
government crackdown will raise cocaine prices in peru and bolivia 
and make it harder to persuade farmers to switch from coca leaf to 
other crops 
an estimated 300000 people in bolivia depend on coca farming and 
cocaine production for a livelihood coca leaf still provides a 100 
percent profit to farmers and cocaleaf acreage increased by 20 
percent in 198788 according to a us state department report 
for farmers to stop growing coca leaves viable alternative crops 
must be found but with the recent drop in the price of coffee a 
crop suited for the tropics where coca is grown and the lack of 
other profitable alternative crops farmers prefer to grow coca 
which provides four crops a year and is easy to sell 
the bolivian government last year passed a law that limits 
cocaleaf acreage president jaime paz zamoras government which 
was sworn in aug 6 says it will wage an allout war against 
traffickers 
cocaleaf reduction in bolivia is moving ahead but slowly as the 
new government implements an antidrug strategy 
bolivian law calls for the reduction of 12350 acres of coca land 
by the end of the year in order to comply with a quota agreed upon 
by the us government if the quota is not reached bolivia stands 
to loose 10 million in aid this year so far only about 3200 acres 
have been destroyed 
in peru coca leaf reduction programs in the 150mile huallaga 
valley 300 miles northeast of lima have been temporarily suspended 
because of threats to us drug agents and the killing of peruvian 
officials 
coca farmers and traffickers in peru have allied themselves with 
insurgency groups among them the shining path and many cocaleaf 
producing areas are off limits to law enforcement officials 
eradiction and interdiction activities in the huallaga valley are 
expected to resume this month when a secure base is completed in the 
santa lucia area 
peru destroyed 12670 acres of coca in just four months last year 
peru produces coca leaves on 285600 acres it is the main 
supplier of paste for colombian cocaine producers and distributors

when james lee left prison five years ago no 
one believed he was a changed man after all lee began smoking 
marijuana at age 13 and graduated to snorting cocaine and heroin at 
14 feeding an appetite for drugs that for two decades dictated a 
life of crime 
i knew the ins and outs of drugs he says explaining that as 
a youngster he had seen the debilitating effects of illicit drug 
use but it was the slick thing to do i wanted to belong to do 
what everybody else was doing at the time 
so at 13 he began an involvement with drugs that would last 
almost 20 years 
now a successful businessman who spends his free time speaking at 
churches and counseling inmates at the lorton correctional 
facilities in suburban virginia lee says he is committed to help 
others change the deadend course of their lives 
my whole life had been filled with drugs and hustling said 
the 45yearold lee whose closely cropped hair now has an even mix 
of gray 
occasional use of marijuana then cocaine and heroin became an 
obsession by age 15 and thats when the crimes increased because 
i had to get drugs every day he said 
at first money for the drugs came from petty thefts and what he 
described as yoke robberies strongarm robberies or holdups 
without weapons 
despite all of this lee continued to attend school and to 
conceal his drug habit and crimes from his mother a christian who 
demanded church attendance most of the expensive clothes and 
jewelry he bought with his illgotten money were stored at friends 
houses 
lees first car at age 16 a 1964 mustang that then held the 
same prestige as todays bmw was parked around corners and in 
friends garages and driveways 
robbery was the thing in the 60s we went from bank robbery to 
robbing private businesses said lee whose first adult arrest 
came in the summer of 1966 when he joined some friends who hijacked 
a truck full of merchandise the charges were later dropped 
his profession as a thief ended in april 1968 when lee was 
arrested for felony murder after an accomplice shot a clerk during a 
postal robbery while waiting 18 months in jail to go to trial he 
met two men from new york who convinced him that selling drugs would 
reap greater profits faster 
so when charges again were dropped lee headed for new york 
where his friends introduced me to a new hustle selling drugs 
the money came so fast there was no comparison with money 
from the robberies said lee thats part of the problem today 
the money is fast there is no money in the world faster than drug 
money 
lees success was meteoric i was able to acquire a grocery 
store a new home an apartment building new cars fine clothes 
jewelry and traveled around the world i met people that put me in a 
position to get more and better drugs 
but as his business skyrocketed so did his craving for drugs 
i went from snorting drugs to shooting drugs because i had a raw 
habit he said when you become your best customer you become 
unreliable as far as the supplier is concerned as far as paying 
money back 
lees drug suppliers entrusted him with smaller and smaller 
amounts of drugs dropping from 10 kilograms down to five kilos and 
then three he also had frequent skirmishes with the law and was 
convicted four times on drug charges 
when you know people getting drugs or going to jail wasnt a 
problem to me because my life pattern never had to change said 
lee explaining that drugs were just as plentiful in jail as on 
the streets if not more plentiful 
lee who married at age 17 said his son brought him drugs in 
prison concealing them in tennis balls or using other ingenious 
smuggling techniques 
my last arrest had me facing 60 years in jail lee said but 
he was sentenced to only 20 monthstofive years at lorton 
it was during his last incarceration that lee met several 
christian inmates who persuaded him to change his life after his 
release he was still viewed skeptically by his family especially 
his wife who had left him three years into the marriage 
people didnt want to believe it theyve heard before id 
changed and then id come out and do the same thing he said 
but the longer i stayed out the more they had to reevaluate 
whether or not i was serious 
lees family began to respect his commitment then in april 1988 
his 24yearold son a dealer himself was killed on the street 
shot nine times lee said he successfully suppressed his urge to 
retaliate against his sons murderers 
today lee is production manager of a print shop in reston va 
making 40000 a year that he can spend without worrying about the 
police kicking my door in 
after a 20year separation lee and his wife reunited last 
november and live in suburban maryland

when law officers arrested high school dropout 
thomas tony montana mickens just a month short of his 25th 
birthday they gawped openly at his 730000 long island home and 
fleet of luxury cars 
this was no wall street financier or wunderkind film producer 
like many young people seeking their share of the american dream 
mickens amassed his fortune the newfashioned way he sold cocaine 
his 100employee multimilliondollar operation was based in the 
new york city neighborhood of laurelton the workingclass section 
of south queens where mickens grew up his headquarters was the 
corner of merrick boulevard and 226th street but he also sold drugs 
in harlem and atlantic city 
the mickens operation wasnt the largest in druginfested south 
queens but authorities said it was one of the most sophisticated 
how many 25yearolds do you know who can accumulate so much 
wealth and know how to launder illegal money one investigator 
said after mickens arrest last year 
two months ago a brooklyn federal jury convicted him of 16 counts 
of drug conspiracy tax evasion and money laundering he faces 
sentences totaling 220 years of prison time 
defense lawyer robert simels maintains his clients innocence he 
argues that the fabulous wealth was left by mickens late father 
said to be a bigtime queens numbers runner 
but andrew j maloney the us attorney for the eastern district 
of new york said mickens personally cleared at least 25 million 
in cocaine profits in the 3 years before his arrest like other 
young drug kingpins mickens spent it freely and lavishly maloney 
said 
in mickens circle incredible sums of money changed hands 
packed in bags and shoeboxes with sacks of cash and stacks of money 
orders mickens bought a 100000 custom rollsroyce equipped with a 
pair of television sets vcrs and videogames he maintained a fleet 
of sporty expensive cars bmws porsches ferraris and 
mercedesbenzes in which the popular young man took neighborhood 
kids for rides 
he was the big talk of laurelton said a teenage 
neighborhood girl who declined to give her name theyd talk 
about his cars and how fly they were how nice 
mickens took his moniker from tony montana the violent 
highliving cocaineaddicted gangster portrayed by actor al pacino 
in scarface prosecutors said he tried to model his existence 
after that character said capt charles mattes of the queens 
narcotics squad 
his fascination with the movie was complete he named his 
businesses after tony montana and several copies of scarface 
were found in mickens home and in his limousine 
agents who arrested mickens at his home in exclusive dix hills 
were amazed to find a jacuzzi for 10 and a spiral staircase that 
ended at a fully outfitted workout gym 
he wore fancy clothes and gold jewelry and owned homes in florida 
and california where he docked his 38footlong yacht 
that someone so young could become a multimillionaire by 
selling cocaine shows how tempting and lucrative the business is 
said assistant us attorney patricia a pileggi 
prosecutors said mickens showed financial savvy in making his 
purchases and hiding his income much of his property was registered 
under false names or by his girlfriend shelby kearney who was 
convicted of helping him launder money major purchases were made in 
installments under 10000 to avoid federal financial reporting 
requirements 
unlike most drug dealers mickens empire went beyond the cocaine 
trade he owned several stores the gold coast lounge montana dry 
cleaners all of which along with the houses boat and cars were 
seized by the government 
montana sporting goods one of those companies sponsored a team 
in a summer basketball league in st albans queens mickens also 
coached the team among the players was mark jackson guard for the 
new york knicks 
mickens enjoyed a good reputation for truthfulness and 
honesty jackson said in testimony at mickens trial 
others also defended him an old friend told new york newsday 
that wealth notwithstanding mickens had not changed very much 
he was still one of the guys not tommy the drug dealer just 
cool tommy the guy we grew up with

no one can accuse steven bochco of resorting 
to stale old formulas with doogie howser md 
in the pilot our hero interrupts his driving test to administer 
emergency medical aid at the scene of a traffic accident so why is 
a doctor just now getting his drivers license hes only 16 
the halfhour dramedy is the first show to derive from 
bochcos multimilliondollar development deal with abc 
howser is a wellmade show but it remains to be seen what 
audience will take to an offbeat pairing of adult and teen themes 
in the pilot doogie wins his first kiss and loses his first patient 
the series is slotted in a decidedly adult time period replacing 
bochcos other dramedy hooperman on wednesday 
bochco says it is feasible that a child genius who graduated 
from princeton at 10 could have a medical license at 16 the 
premise interested him because his late father was a violin prodigy 
neil patrick harris is an excellent actor and taking the same 
character in and out of parallel lives is kind of interesting 
dramatically 
but do we want to watch doogie make lifeanddeath decisions at 
the hospital then come home and sulk because his father james b 
sikking wont loan him the car 
bochco has tried to do something different here but it has ended 
up just being kind of weird

with no secret weapons available the strategy 
president bush sets tuesday night for the war on drugs will foretell 
a long struggle in the trenches that is going to demand patience 
persistence and drudgery long after the drama of a nationally 
televised redeclaration of war has faded 
the government has declared war on drugs before bush has 
commanded such an effort before and the government has reported 
some progress but against a changing and growing target now as 
president bush is setting a course to redeem a campaign pledge 
underscored in his inaugural address 
take my word for it this scourge will stop 
as bush outlines his drugfighting program in an address to the 
nation americans are said to be ready to make war on drugs whatever 
the cost even if it takes a tax increase bush has said it wont 
that the needed funds will be shifted from other programs 
in key ways today the american people are in a wartime mode 
and sense a national emergency in the drug crisis said george 
gallup jr reporting on an early summer poll his organization 
conducted for the drugfighting effort 
that sense of crisis has since been heightened by the colombian 
government crackdown on the drug lords blamed for the murder of a 
presidential candidate there and said to be responsible for about 
80 percent of the cocaine flowing into the united states 
bush already is sending 65 million worth of arms and equipment 
to help the colombians combat the drug cartels the broader 
administration program will propose up to 260 million in economic 
and military drugfighting aid to colombia bolivia and peru 
bush is presenting a strategy report required by the law that set 
up the office of national drug control policy the new agency 
william bennett heads bush could have left the report to his drug 
czar by delivering it himself in his first nationally televised 
address from the white house the president puts the drug crisis at 
the top of his autumn agenda 
theres likely to be more drama in the medium than in the 
message bennett has said again and again that there is no magic 
bullet to be fired in the drug battle his report sets goals far 
more cautious than the rhetoric of the bush campaign or inaugural 
address a 10 percent reduction in drug use in the next two years 
50 percent in 10 years 
the tools include increased federal aid to local law enforcement 
agencies more prisons to house drug offenders tougher and more 
certain punishment more funds for drug education and treatment 
interdiction efforts that will increase the role of the us 
military 
during the 1988 campaign bush advocated execution of bigtime 
drug dealers for those who commit drugrelated murders for the 
drug kingpins who are poisoning our kids the penalty should be 
death he said if this is war then lets treat it as such 
lets get these killers off the streets 
that proposal has not been mentioned in advance discussion of the 
drug strategy report 
all told the administration plan would cost an estimated 8 
billion about 2 billion over the current budget for the programs 
involved 
there will be debate on whether thats enough how much should be 
spent and how it should be used 
sen joseph biden ddel chairman of the judiciary committee 
and a prime sponsor of the bill that created the new drug policy 
agency has complained that the government so far hasnt been 
willing to pay whats needed to fight the drug epidemic we have 
no war on drugs he told a midaugust conference of corrections 
officers we need a dday we dont need another vietnam 
biden who is to deliver a democratic response to bush after the 
president speaks tuesday night proposed this week that the united 
states set up a system of debt relief for latin nations that 
subsidize shifts away from the coca crops that are the raw material 
of cocaine 
the gallup survey conducted in june and july and donated to the 
drug agency reflected a dday mood the poll of 1005 adults and 
500 teenagers showed that americans consider drugs to be the most 
serious problem facing the nation with no other single concern even 
coming close 
gallup said the survey showed a public willingness to sacrifice 
as in wartime with a majority favoring increased spending to combat 
drugs and willing to pay higher taxes if necessary 
by all those measures the bush address comes at prime time on 
the calendar as well as the clock to a nation fed up with the drug

pupils returning this fall to sandpiper 
shores elementary school near this quiet welltodo palm beach 
county community will find much of their schoolyard off limits 
not because of construction or asbestos or hazardous waste but 
because of the power lines next to the school that can carry 230000 
volts 
emanating from the lines are electromagnetic fields present 
wherever there is electric power that have been linked to 
everything from cancer to miscarriages chronic depression and 
learning disorders 
galvanized by reports of possible health risks parents took the 
school board to court last november when classes started in 
january before a ruling came down some parents kept children home 
or sent them to private schools 
i saw it as a gamble with my childrens life said steve 
tenner a stockbroker who sent his 9yearold daughter kerry to 
private school this year and plans to do the same for his 4yearold 
son jeff the dosage theyre receiving now may not affect them for 
another 20 years 
in their lawsuit tenner and robert and sharon rausch contended 
that the electromagnetic fields from a series of power lines that 
begins 135 feet from the nearest school building may be harmful to 
their childrens health 
palm beach circuit judge timothy poulton ruled this summer that 
there was insufficient evidence of potential harm to close the 
school as the parents had asked but he did close much of the 
schoolyard during recess and barred outdoor activities in an area 
that includes art and music rooms and the cafeteria 
the evidence is clear that both electrical and magnetic fields 
affect the human body he said depending on the dosage the 
result can be harmful to the human body increasing the incidence of 
cancer and other disease 
although research has not proven that electromagnetic fields are 
hazardous it does show that power at 60 hertz cycles per second 
a frequency commonly used in north america can produce biological 
changes in humans 
a recent carnegie mellon university report for the federal office 
of technology assessment noted legitimate reasons for concern 
over emfs and even more disturbing fields from sources like 
household wiring and appliances 
the results are very complicated said m granger morgan who 
heads carnegie mellons engineering and public policy department and 
helped prepare the report i think everybody agrees looking at the 
science that its most unlikely the fields will be an initiator of 
cancer the way the fields appear to interact with cells is the very 
elaborate processes on the surface of the cell thats why the 
notion of cancer promoter has gotten going 
the report also noted that construction of power lines is 
increasingly beset by public intervention and lawsuits the issue is 
expected to heat up in states including florida new york 
california texas washington and oregon already suits have forced 
utilities to delay reroute and even scrap planned construction one 
canadian utility has offered to buy homes along a powerline 
corridor 
in florida among several states with electric field standards 
and the first to set a standard for magnetic fields strong 
opposition is building from homeowners parents and 
environmentalists to proposed 500000volt lines in the westcentral 
and southeastern parts of the state should scientists prove that 
fields are dangerous the implications would be staggering 
it would be a multibilliondollar problem to correct said 
buck oven of the state department of environmental regulation it 
may be we will have to come up with an alternative method of getting 
power to people 
even if additional research turns up nothing public perception 
is a powerful driving force said ron spinka a spokesman for the 
florida electric power coordinating group whose members produce 
nearly all the states power 
the boca raton school case is being closely watched attorney 
larry marraffino who represented the parents hailed it as one of 
the first to have judicial recognition that these fields can cause 
harm 
school board lawyer abbey hairston said i have to take the 
position the judge was saying theres not anything there yet 
because he didnt completely close the school even if theres an 
association the risk at sandpiper shores is no greater than that at 
the home environment 
marraffino disputes the contention that children arent 
threatened i think were just at the stage now maybe asbestos was 
many years ago theyre still trying to understand the mechanism by 
which it works theres no doubt in my mind in 10 years its going 
to be a foregone conclusion 
poulton reserved the right to alter his ruling if necessary 
based on additional scientific data in posttrial motions he also 
ordered the school board to pay for periodic radiation measurements 
but he refused to let parents transfer children to nearby schools 
after the board argued that parents would seek transfers for a host 
of environmental concerns 
sharon rausch recalls taking her concerns to the board they 
were real hung up on conclusive proof that means names on death 
certificates and i didnt feel that was the right approach 
the rausches believe emfs may have contributed to the death from 
brainstem cancer in 1985 of their 8yearold son william the 
school where they had lived before in warner robins ga had power 
lines out front 
if not for the lines mrs rausch would have preferred sending 
her two youngest children to sandpiper shores a sprawling campus of 
onestory tan brick buildings and portable classrooms attended by 
more than 1000 children 
unable to transfer 10yearold angela and 7yearold jared to 
another school or to afford private school the rausches turned 
their living room into a classroom and now teach their youngest of 
three children at home 
for years scientists were convinced there was no risk because 60 
hertz power produces extremely low frequency fields that dont cause 
tissue damage as do other forms of electromagnetic radiation like 
xrays and microwaves but the view of categorically no harm is 
on hold as evidence of effects builds 
by and large the scientists dont have their minds made up 
they are genuinely puzzled said carnegie mellons morgan there 
are enough suggestive studies that we ought to continue exploring 
this 
one of the most puzzling aspects is how much exposure for how 
long may pose a health threat in fact higher voltages may not 
necessarily be worse than lower ones tissue may only be affected at 
certain levels 
epidemiological studies have found a higher incidence of cancer 
in exposed groups in the socalled henhouse project fertilized 
chicken eggs exposed to pulses at 60 hertz produced a greater 
proportion of abnormal embryos 
other studies have found increased enzyme activity in tumor 
cells changes in the functioning of the genetic material dna and 
rna changes in the calcium flow across cell membranes changes in 
the neurotransmitters which send signals between nerves and changes 
in the hormones that control the biological clock 
still other studies have found no link between fields and health 
effects 
the ota report noted that the epidemiological studies have shown 
a weak association between field exposure and leukemia and 
nervous system cancer 
researchers also say that despite a dramatic increase in power 
consumption over several decades theres been no accompanying rise 
in cancer rates and if there was a problem they say the public 
would also have to be concerned about household appliances like 
coffeemakers blenders vacuums electric blankets hair dryers and 
shavers any risk would be quite small compared with other causes of 
death such as smoking according to researchers 
the link between emfs and cancer was first raised in the late 
1970s in a colorado study by nancy wertheimer and ed leeper of 
children living near power distribution lines more than a decade 
later public awareness will mean more battles for power companies 
and added pressure for intensive studies 
all sides agree that a major research effort is the key to 
settling the debate over electromagnetic radiation millions are 
being spent on studies by the electric power research institute 
the research arm of the power industry and the us energy 
department among others the national cancer institute also will 
include emfs in a threeyear study of childhood leukemia 
meanwhile parents in boca raton and another group in broward 
county near davie where florida power amp light is facing stiff 
opposition to a transmission line proposal say theyd rather play 
it safe than accept any assurances 
i feel its too unknown said dorothy doering whose 
5yearold son is is going to a private school instead of the davie 
elementary school being built near highvoltage power lines im 
really that fearful you get five experts who say its safe and five 
that say its not 
i just dont want to take the chance

james ponzetti has heard all the jokes 
about natural family planning like the one about how people who use 
it are called parents or those who use the rhythm method have 
children in a rhythmic fashion every two years 
but ponzetti argues that advances in natural techniques have made 
effective birth control possible without pills or condoms or vows of 
abstinence and says the poor image comes from its association with 
religious beliefs primarily the catholic church and the ineffective 
rhythm method 
the natural methods got linked to religion but they can stand 
on their own many of the religious proponents are incredibly 
zealous said ponzetti who teaches family studies at central 
washington university and recently published his findings in the 
can receive training usually in larger cities where 
there are doctors available for it 
cities where training is available include portland ore 
washigton dc omaha neb new york boston san francisco 
minneapolis albuquerque nm and wichita kan he said 
but tyrer said the inconvenience of learning plus the lengthy 
period of abstinence makes natural family planning impractical a 
1982 federal survey found that only about 553000 of 36 million 
women who used birth control chose natural methods one reason is 
that it had a failure rate of 24 percent for the average user in the 
first year and most people do not find that acceptable 
proper use of natural family planning in research studies has 
produced much higher success rates but that does not reflect real 
world use she said its usually limited to those with moral or 
religious concerns 
ponzetti contends that natural family planning could become more 
widespread and effective if it was properly taught during school sex 
education courses it especially appeals to those concerned about 
the health effects of birth control pills and barrier methods like 
condoms and iuds he said 
once a woman charts her cycles she will be amazed how regular 
she is said ponzetti whose wife uses the method its like 
clockwork

the hulking roots of a toppled tree 
covered by lush moss and surrounded by saplings symbolize the 
extremes of life and death in one of north americas last virgin 
stands of spruce and balsam fir 
the 110acre stand on the connecticut river headwaters six miles 
from canada has faced threats from nature as well as man in the 
past century what is left owned by the nature conservancy is in 
many places not a pretty sight 
saved by man from logging operations but ravaged by the great 
hurricane of 1938 and a spruce budworm attack in the early 1970s 
the towering spruce trees some estimated to be 350 years old are 
few and far between 
it looks sad up there now after the budworm it was so pretty 
up there before said fred cowan a paper company forester 
instrumental in saving the stand situated at norton pool on east 
inlet brook 
the boggy lowlands are not ideal for spruce and fir and more 
impressive specimens can be found elsewhere said freds son john 
but at norton pool he said the idea is that they havent been 
trashed 
you can see what nature does to itself too it killed its 
own trees and theres thick regeneration coming up underneath 
the stands inaccessibility its 50 miles north of the states 
last stoplight has helped protect it through the ages it faced 
its first threat in recorded times from lumbering in the late 
1800s 
the connecticut valley lumber company bought it as part of 
125000 acres of timberland in 1888 and reached east inlet 10 years 
later the 10000acre east inlet watershed had never been cut but 
its spruce was in demand 
the spring of 1898 was extremely dry however and the loggers 
were unable to float logs down to mills and railroads after a few 
weeks they gave up 
there was a budworm onslaught from about 1910 to 1915 though it 
wasnt nearly as serious as the infestation in the 1970s the tiny 
worms which later become moths eat spruce and fir needles 
sometimes killing the trees 
nature again wrought havoc in the hurricane of september 1938 
fred cowan estimated that at least 25 percent of the spruce and even 
more of the fir were blown down or broken cowan observed the 
destruction for the first time in 1941 when at age 23 he was in 
the first st regis paper co team surveying to mark trees for 
cutting st regis had bought connecticut valley lumber in 1926 
sometimes we seemed to go a quarter of a mile climbing on top 
of blowndown trees youd be perhaps 10 15 20 feet in the 
air climbing over that stuff the team recognized that the trees 
still standing were special he said most of us hadnt been in 
large oldgrowth stands before 
st regis began cutting in east inlet in the late 1940s though 
not in the area later protected by the 1950s with pressure 
increasing to cut the huge trees cowan and some colleagues began 
plotting actively to spare it 
some of us kind of decided gee you know lets kind of skip 
around that we can always get back get to it thats what we had to 
tell some of the other people in the company who said why did you 
bypass that 
the audubon society and other conservation groups began 
expressing interest in saving the area that also held rare birds and 
plants in the late 1960s st regis agreed to save the stand but 
st regis and champion international corp which took it over in 
1984 for years declined to give the stand to the groups saying the 
company was taking care of it champion eventually deeded the land 
to the nature conservancy in july 1987 
by then nature had wreaked havoc 
in 1974 masses of budworms swept into the region in a fiveyear 
infestation lots of places very close to 100 percent of the fir 
got picked off and a lot of the other growth the small trees 
underneath cowan said the spruce was a little bit more 
resistant to it but it got hit badly up there it really spoiled 
the looks of it 
but cowan remains philosophical about norton pools future 
in this part of the world things are both man and nature and 
unless they pave it over nature recovers he said another 100 
years or so and itll look good again

a roomful of diners is probably a roomful of 
people eating more than they would if they were alone according to 
research indicating that people on diets might do well to decline 
invitations to eat out 
eating in a social setting increases the duration of the meal 
youre eating at the same speed but youre eating longer said 
john de castro who reported on his work in augusts american 
journal of clinical nutrition 
de castro a georgia state university psychologist hired 63 
adults in the atlanta area to keep sevenday diaries of their how 
much they ate what they ate where they ate it and how they felt 
physically 
people tend to eat 44 percent more food when eating with others 
than when eating alone and the bigger the group the bigger the 
individuals appetite in addition the food eaten in social 
settings was often higher in fat and that eaten when alone was more 
healthful he said 
contrary to de castros expectations he did not find many 
instances of people stuffing themselves out of the watchful gaze of 
others i had expected to see people become closet eaters that 
wasnt the case he said 
the threeyear study of nutritional habits is continuing at 
georgia state with more people to be hired to keep diaries de 
castro said the research could eventually yield a complete picture 
of what factors contribute to overeating

its a bugeatbug world for jack and jake 
blehm 
the father and son breed good insects to eat bad insects at 
rincon vitova one of 15 insectaria nationwide every day 
rincon produces more than 80 million voracious critters from 
ladybugs to wasps business has tripled in the past five years as 
farmers concerned about pesticides turn to natural options 
sales from the 15 insectaria total 25 million a year the blehms 
say most insects are sold to cotton and vegetable growers plus 
backyard farmers 
this is the future said ken hagen an entomologist at the 
university of california berkeley there is a great need the 
farmers are desperate 
theyre so desperate that some universities are adding classes on 
integrated pest management ways to hold down troublesome pests 
while cutting the use of pesticides the association of applied 
insect ecologists a trade group is producing a video showing 
farmers how to work with such insects 
controlling pests with beneficial insects takes longer and 
because pesticides kill good bugs along with bad farmers are forced 
to stop chemical spraying while waiting for the good bugs to do 
their duty 
the hardest thing for the farmer is to have enough faith 
jake said hes not used to seeing pests in the field hes used 
to a quick knockdown 
with this method you have to watch for several weeks before 
you see a difference and at the beginning all the farmer sees is 
that his crop is contaminated with bugs 
rincon vitova sells 15 species including beetles mites and 
parasitic wasps that control flies around chickens and cattle it 
even sells to moviemakers a studio needed four gallons of maggots 
last summer we shipped them federal express to their location 
site in montana jake said 
more than 600 species of beneficial insects have been introduced 
into american agriculture in the past 100 years to curb pest 
populations according to the us department of agriculture which 
must approve the insects for use before insectaria start breeding 
and releasing them

grizzly bears in 
yellowstone national park and nearby forests are bouncing back from 
a brush with extinction and should be off the threatenedspecies 
list within a decade 
but the longterm prognosis is uncertain because bear habitat 
continues to be pressured by development interests either for 
resources or recreation said chris servheen of the us fish and 
wildlife service all those pressures will continue in grizzly 
bear habitat theyll never go away 
in the short term servheen said the number of bears with cubs 
during the last four years has been good bears are more dispersed 
mortality rates are down and perhaps most important few bears are 
seeking human food sources 
however agencies managing bears will need to continue working to 
protect the grizzlies and their habitat he said as soon as we 
say theyre recovered and we drop our guard well be in a crisis 
situation again 
two decades ago grizzly bears fed largely at dumps in and near 
the park in the early 1970s the dumps were closed a controversial 
move that forced the bears to go cold turkey off human food 
sources many continued to seek food from humans leading to 
encounters the bears rarely won so many were killed in the 1970s 
that there is no accurate count but some put it at well over 100 
wildlife agencies and communities fenced dumps and garbage areas 
campers were required to keep food out of bears reach bears 
especially females of reproductive age were moved and public 
education campaigns were begun 
now servheen said the goal is in sight when we started 
there was so much to do that the didnt know where to start weve 
come a long way 
it still could be several years before there is serious 
discussion of removing the grizzly from the threatenedspecies list 
he said 
michael scott of the wilderness society said much of the bears 
future depends on the forest service biologists agree that the 
limiting factor for grizzlies is security and bears are thriving in 
yellowstone because they are secure the pressures are ever 
going to increase around yellowstone whether its a new mine a new 
resort or timber sales

drexel burnham lambert inc the wall street 
giant that recently settled federal securities fraud charges has 
announced several senior management changes including the 
appointment of a new president 
the company said wednesday that howard brenner 56 currently 
senior executive vice president will succeed joseph a vitanza 65 
as president vitanza who has held the post since 1982 plans to 
retire dec 31 and will remain a consultant to the firm 
brenner a wall street professional for 33 years started with 
drexel in 1963 as an account executive his responsibilities have 
included manager of retail sales director of marketing and head of 
equity trading 
frederick joseph drexels chief executive officer said the 
appointment of brenner and others will further strengthen the firm 
for the competitive climate drexel anticipates for the 1990s and 
represent a natural extension of the broad restructuring the firm 
implemented in april 
drexel is one of the most aggressive wall street investment firms 
and helped pioneer the use of highyield securities known as junk 
bonds as tools for corporate refinancings and acquisitions in the 
1980s 
but its image was tarnished by an intensive government 
investigation that began nearly three years ago and stemmed from 
disclosures by nowimprisoned inside trader ivan f boesky who had 
business dealings with drexel 
on april 13 drexel and the securities and exchange commission 
announced a settlement of an extensive fraud case stemming from the 
boesky affair 
under that agreement drexel pleaded guilty to six criminal 
charges paid a record 650 million in fines and penalties 
subjected itself to unprecedented federal scrutiny for three years 
and agreed to sever ties to its junk bond financier michael milken 
milken has since been indicted on racketeering and fraud charges 
to which he has pleaded innocent 
drexel also announced as part of the agreement that john shad 
the former sec chairman instrumental in starting an investigation of 
the firm had been appointed as its chairman 
in addition drexel began a drastic restructuring that included 
the sale of its retail brokerage unit and other changes that has

terry robson says more than one person has 
compared his business to the ghostbusters of movie fame he has a 
team armed with chemicals that goes into offices to fight 
invisible enemies 
the enemies in this case are the indoor pollutants that 
environmental officials say are threatening workers health 
increased awareness of indoor pollution which some say is as 
dangerous as the toxins floating around outdoors is creating plenty 
of work for companies such as robsons britetech international inc 
five or seven years ago it was hard to go in and convince 
someone they had indoor pollution said robson president and 
founder of britetech of norcross which franchises its services 
theyd look around and say i dont see it 
an environmental protection agency survey conducted last year 
found that 1200 companies were providing indoor environmental 
cleaning or analysis work most of it for radon or asbestos 
bob axelrad director of the indoor air division of the epas 
office of air and radiation in washington dc said many of these 
companies are expanding into the field of indoor air pollution 
though the survey did not give a precise figure 
our sense is it is a growing business axelrad said a lot 
of those doing industrial hygiene work are finding pretty good 
demand for their services he said 
we definitely think this is an emerging issue axelrad said 
of indoor pollution 
an epa report released last spring said pesticides radon 
asbestos tobacco smoke bacteria and mold inhaled in poorly 
ventilated offices may threaten the health of americans as much as 
outdoor pollution 
the epa report attributed more than 1 billion in medical costs 
from cancer and heart disease to eight indoor pollutants 
the combination of indoor pollutants has earned the name sick 
building syndrome americans spend most of their time indoors and 
robson said that as more people become aware of the syndrome they 
want something done about it 
people often are surprised by the pollution found in an office or 
other indoor environment robson said the toxins in cigarette 
smoke for example stick to walls and ceilings and stay there for 
years he said 
there are 350 types of gases and pollutants in tobacco smoke 
he said if the building was contaminated before the residue is 
still there 
charles almond staff engineer at north carolina baptist hospital 
in winstonsalem nc a customer of a britetech franchisee said 
hospitals are extremely concerned with indoor pollution but he said 
that only in recent years has the means for fighting the toxins 
grown more sophisticated 
we were very much concerned with odors we cant have any 
because of our criticalcare areas almond said we used to have 
a can of lysol and thats what we used 
almond said the availability of indoor pollutioncontrol 
companies is contributing to cleaner hospitals 
with the growth of an industry that deals with something that 
often cannot be seen however comes inevitable fraud officials 
warn 
martha casey an epa spokesman in washington said the agency 
conducts training programs for both pollution testers and 
mitigators and makes lists of participants available to its 
regional offices in an effort to minimize fraud 
we know there are some con artists out there who come in with 
the mayonnaise jar scoop up some air and then tell them customers 
theyll analyze it and get back to them ms casey said 
britetech uses a variety of measuring tools and also talks to 
building occupants to determine the level of pollution the company 
also suggests remedies and has about 20 formulas all nontoxic and 
biodegradable robson said for cleaning indoor areas 
robson said the cleaning process involves spraying a chemical 
mist onto surfaces which dissolves the toxins there is no 
scrubbing he said 
the cleaning materials also are sprayed into ventilation systems 
though in extreme cases installation of a new air conditioning 
system may be recommended 
though the cost of britetech service varies according to the type 
of surface and degree of pollution robson said franchises generally 
charge 25 cents to 50 cents per square foot 
britetech is a relatively new player in the indoor pollution 
field having started in january robson said he believes britetech 
is the first franchisor in the industry 
the company has 12 franchises operating in nine states 
franchisees must put up a fee of 15000 to 25000 plus 10000 
working capital the norcross headquarters provides training 
materials and a fulltime staff including a chemist 
robson said his companys revenues so far are about 3 million a 
year and he is hoping for 45 units and revenues of 20 million by 
the middle of next year

corps future environmental policies and practices calls the alaska 
oil spill a terrible disaster 
john h steele on wednesday was named a director of the nations 
largest oil company the appointment follows exxons promise earlier 
this year to large shareholders to appoint a director with interest 
and expertise in the environment in the wake of the companys alaska 
oil spill 
major shareholders and some environmentalists said they approved 
of the marine scientist but other environmental groups were not 
pleased by the choice 
steele 62 is president of and a senior scientist at the woods 
hole oceanographic institution in massachusetts in addition to his 
seat on the board of directors he will serve on the boards newly 
formed public issues committee which monitors the companys 
environmental policies 
im confident his presence on the board will increase exxons 
sensitivity to environmental concerns said gray davis controller 
of the california public employee retirement system the largest 
individual us public pension fund which owns exxon stock 
protecting the environment is both good public policy and good 
business said davis who is also cochairman of the washington 
dcbased council of institutional investors 
the california pension fund was one of several funds with large 
holdings of exxon stock that publicized its dissatisfaction with 
exxons handling of the march 24 spill and cleanup 
the trustee for new york citys employee firefighter and police 
pension funds also praised steeles appointment 
the election of dr john h steele demonstrates 
environmental and social responsibility said city comptroller 
harrison j goldin 
however the environmental policy institute which includes 
friends of the earth and the oceanic society issued a statement 
that criticized steeles appointment 
the fact that john steele has been obscure within the american 
environmental movement speaks yet another volume as to exxons crude 
insensitivity toward the environment the statement said 
steeles appointment increases the size of exxons board to 15 
members 
in a telephone interview from his office at woods hole mass 
about 70 miles south of boston on the southeast end of cape cod 
steele spoke of the spill 
i think its a terrible tragedy and a major disaster not just 
for the animals but for the people in alaska steele said 
he declined to comment on exxons handling of the cleanup but 
said he would visit alaska in about two weeks for a separate 
scientific meeting on arctic research and would view the remnants of 
the spill 
it will give me an opportunity to discuss these research and 
scientific questions with colleagues in alaska he said 
steele will serve on the board until exxons annual shareholders 
meeting in april when his name will be submitted for shareholder 
approval along with the other directors said exxon spokesman bill 
smith 
born in edinburgh scotland steeles career includes 26 years at 
the marine laboratory at aberdeen scotland he joined woods hole 
oceanographic institution in 1977 
steeles principal research subject is the marine environment he 
is the us delegate to the international council for exploration of 
the sea 
smith said steele was elected by exxons board from among 100 
names submitted for review 
at the companys annual meeting in may shareholders demanded 
changes in what they called exxons inadequate state of 
preparedness for dealing with future environmental problems 
although the pension funds ultimately voted for management this 
year they warned of a major shareholder revolt next year if the 
exxon appointment was unsatisfactory to dissident shareholders 
at the may meeting exxon management agreed to create the 
sixmember public issues committee which includes four nonexxon 
employees exxon said the committee would review the corporations 
policies programs and practices on public issues of significance 
including their effects on the environment and worker safety and 
health

the food and drug administration has extended 
for two months its deadline for deciding whether to ban red dye no 
3 as a cancercausing food additive 
the agency had been prepared to act by the earlier deadline 
which was wednesday when the house in july passed legislation 
calling for further study of the coloring that gives marachino 
cherries their bright glow 
the senate has not yet acted on the legislation 
since 1960 when congress called for a ban on foods that cause 
cancer in laboratory animals red dye no 3 and other additives have 
been on a provisional list that allowed them to stay on the market 
for an additional two years pending further study 
the fda has granted dozens of extensions of the provisional 
listing since then 
the agency in announcing the latest extension wednesday said it 
has been evaluating research data submitted by the certified color 
manufacturers association 
the association maintains that the dye is not a primary cause of 
cancer and causes tumors only when used in doses higher than would 
ever be consumed through its use as a food coloring

in two months on whether the detroit news and detroit free press 
should be allowed to merge some operations to cut costs 
the court said wednesday it will hear an hour of arguments at 2 
pm oct 30 
the free press owned by knightridder inc and the news owned 
by gannett co inc have sought since may 1986 to merge business 
operations such as advertising production and circulation to cut 
costs while keeping news and editorial operations separate 
the newspapers said the free press will fail if the joint 
operating agreement isnt granted under the federal newspaper 
preservation act 
former us attorney general edwin meese iii approved the limited 
antitrust exemption aug 8 1988 
but michigan citizens for an independent press is challenging 
meeses ruling contending the newspapers have failed to prove the

the capital paper chase begins in earnest oct 
1 
in a city where photocopying and paperpushing have been elevated 
to art forms recycling is about to become the norm 
newspaper and office paper we can produce that in great 
numbers said tara hamilton a spokeswoman for the citys public 
works department we read a lot of newspapers we write a lot of 
memos we prepare a lot of reports 
in fact the city estimates that 53 percent of the approximately 
740000 tons of trash collected each year is paper 
the new recycling law will require office workers government 
employees and residents to separate paper from the rest of their 
garbage 
and in conjunction with the law officials are encouraging 
lawyers to stop using yellow legal pads which like other colored 
paper is not wanted by many recyclers that is not a small matter 
considering that the capital boasts the highest concentration of 
attorneys in the nation more than 30000 
not to be melodramatic but its going to change the way we 
live hamilton said wednesday over the next five years we are 
all going to have to change our definition of what we call trash 
while the rules governing paper recycling go into effect oct 1 
the city has an ambitious plan to begin glass aluminum and metal 
recycling programs by 1994 hamilton said 
a set of proposed rules stipulates that most city residents will 
have their newspapers collected on the same day that trash is picked 
up while businesses and government offices will be required to hire 
private haulers to take away their newspapers and office papers 
condominiums and cooperative apartment groups which pay for 
private trash collection will be allowed to ask the city to pick up 
newspapers 
the rules which will be reviewed by the city council in the next 
three weeks allow businesses to apply for exemptions however 
hamilton cautioned that small stores and offices rather than 
paperproducing monsters such as the federal government are far 
more likely to avoid having to recycle 
there are some businesses that are so small use so little 
paper that it doesnt make sense for them to enter into a contract 
to have paper hauled away hamilton said 
however she said most of those business wont receive 
exemptions but will be encouraged to pool their paper resources 
with small businesses nearby 
to help make the adjustment to recycling easier hamiltons 
office has produced an information sheet printed on recycled paper 
that will be sent to city residents and businesses 
the mailing spells out the rules tells residents when their 
papers will be picked up and warns against mixing paper with regular 
garbage 
residents violating the regulations can be fined 25 while 
condominium groups and cooperative apartment organizations can be 
penalized between 100 and 400 levies against businesses start at 
400 
in recent years construction of new office buildings and the 
conversion of singlefamily homes to condominiums and apartments 
have contributed to a growth in washingtons trash rate hamilton 
said 
in 1981 according to district figures the city collected 
450000 tons of trash last year that figure swelled to 740000 
tons and hamilton estimated that without recycling the city would 
be producing 1 million tons of trash a year by 2002 
the district which has no landfill must pay to cart its trash 
to neighboring maryland and virginia 
we just cant go on like this hamilton said this is just 
a first step in dealing with our solidwaste problem

hitachi ltd of japan said thursday it has succeeded 
in confining a subatomic particle that can be used in a new chip 
device to vastly speed the work of computers 
a hitachi official speaking on condition of anonymity said the 
successs made it possible for the company to produce ultrahigh 
speed opticalelectronic functional devices with a computing speed 
more than 10000 times that of the chips used in supercomputers now 
available 
he said the company has decided to use the particle called a 
polariton because it has the feaures of both electrons and light 
the official said conventional chips using electrons function 
relatively slowly and scientists have been studying the possibility 
of using light to increase the speed but light has the defect of 
being uncontrollable he said 
he said the chip device with the polariton is fast and 
controllable 
the polariton originally was discovered by us physicist jj 
hopfield in 1960s 
hitachi will produce a test chip device with polaritons by 1990 
and adapt it for practical use in optical computers by 2000 the 
official said

lincoln savings amp loan whose failure may 
cost the government 25 billion invested 100 million with inside 
trader ivan boesky according to newspaper reports 
lincolns heavy investments in highyield highrisk corporate 
securities are wellknown and were one reason why the recent 
federal savingsandloan bailout bill banned thrifts from investing 
in such securities called junk bonds 
articles in wednesdays editions of the los angeles times and the 
orange county register detailed other types of risky investments by 
lincoln including attempts to profit in various ways from takeovers 
lincoln officials apparently had no knowledge of boeskys illegal 
information gathering according to the times which cited 
unidentified sources familiar with lincolns operations 
lincoln invested 100 million with boeskys hudson funding corp 
boesky the wall street trader known for investing in companies that 
frequently became takeover candidates was forced to liquidate the 
fund prematurely when he pleaded guilty to securities law violations 
the times said lincoln statements showed the company hoped to 
reap a 29 percent return on the investment in the fund but quoted 
unidentified sources as saying the company realized a 9 percent 
profit 
the register said lincoln broke even on the investment 
federal regulators seized lincoln on april 14 the day after its 
parent company american continental corp of phoenix filed for 
protection under federal bankruptcy laws 
the house banking committee plans to reopen an investigation into 
lincolns collapse a failure that regulators and analysts say could 
result in the governments most costly bailout requiring more than 
25 billion in federal funds 
attorneys for american continental dispute that figure and say 
losses were brought on by the regulators who seized the thrift 
in november 1986 boesky pleaded guilty to felony insider 
trading he paid a 100 million fine and is serving three years in a 
federal prison 
the federal office of thrift supervision found that lincoln made 
numerous risky investments with federally insured deposits even 
after regulators citing the boesky expenditures criticized the 
thrift in march 1987 
however lincoln fared well with some of its highrisk ventures 
the register said investments with british financier sir james 
goldsmith earned lincoln 31 million in 1986 
in a related development the arizona republic in phoenix 
reported in a copyright story prepared for thursdays editions that 
a california state official in late 1984 authorized lincoln to 
engage in 800 million in risky ventures and then became a director 
and officer of a san diego firm about the same time the firm 
received a 29 million investment from lincoln 
larry taggart commissioner of californias department of savings 
and loan from march 1983 to jan 1 1985 on wednesday told the 
republic he helped arrange a meeting that may have led to lincolns 
january 1985 agreement to purchase stock in tcs financial inc a 
financialservices firm now known as tcs enterprises inc 
taggart said there was no impropriety and no conflict of interest 
in his relationships with lincoln and tcs 
im not going to apologize for anything he told the 
newspaper

deere amp co chairman robert a hanson has 
given up his title as chief executive officer after directing deere 
through its darkest days and into an era of record profits 
hanson 64 relinquished the companys reins wednesday to hans w 
becherer currently president of deere the world leader in tractor 
and agriculturalimplement manufacturing 
the action is reflective of the commitment by deere amp cos 
board of directors to an orderly and effective management succession 
plan hanson said in a news release 
this new appointment indicates the boards confidence in his 
ability to continue to exercise the kind of effective leadership 
that will help ensure deere amp cos progress in the years ahead 
said hanson who retains his title as chairman 
deere spokesman robert combs said no firm date has been 
established for hansons retirement although company policy 
mandates he step down in 15 months on his 66th birthday in december 
1990 
mr hanson will remain very active in leading the company up 
until his retirement combs said 
the choice of becherer as heirapparent signals the end of a 
remarkable near 40year tenure which saw hanson take control in 1982 
as the company stood on the brink of collapse 
deere accumulated 328 million in losses in two years and its 
operating losses totaled 637 million in the sixyear period 198287 
hanson orchestrated a brutal costcutting program and laided off 
about 12000 workers as the farm crisis gripped the midwest and 
caused thousands of farm foreclosures nationwide 
the problems were compounded by a 163day work stoppage at 13 
deere plants in illinois iowa and four other states that ended feb 
1 1987 when workers accepted a wage freeze 
since then hanson has led the 152yearold company to its 
highest profit levels ever aided by a diversification plan that saw 
deere enter insurance consumer credit mailorder catalogue and 
health maintenance fields the company has flourished 
in 1988 deere earned 3154 million on sales of 53 billion 
despite a crippling drought that cut corn and soybean yields in half 
in key states like illinois and iowa profits and sales again are on 
a record pace nine months into the 1989 fiscal year 
hanson an east moline native was the first person not a member 
of the deere family by blood or marriage to run the company but 
hes the ultimate company man 
raised a few miles from the corporate headquarters hansons 
father was a middlelevel manager at a deere foundry 
hanson joined deere in 1950 and rose through the ranks until 
attaining a seat on the board of directors in 1974 he was named 
president in 1978 and achieved the post of chief operating officer 
in 1979 
becherer 54 joined deere in 1962 and followed a course to the 
top similar to hansons in marketing and extensive overseas work he 
joined the board of directors in 1986 and was elected president and 
chief operating officer in 1987

a group of japanese economists said thursday the 
united states could expect only greater frictions with its trading 
partners if it adopted an advisory committees calls for a more 
resultoriented approach to lowering the us trade deficit 
the economists also said japan must reexamine such business 
practices as the tendency of japanese doing business mainly with 
each other manufacturers dominance in pricesetting and 
discriminatory treatment against imported products 
but while these practices may be frustrating to american 
exporters they have little to do with the large trade imbalances of 
the united states or japan said masaru yoshitomi directorgeneral 
of the economic research institute and a leading member of the 
japanus business council 
the council presented a counterproposal thursday to 
recommendations in february by us trade representative carla 
hills advisory committee for trade policy and negotiation 
the us panel headed by james robinson chairman of american 
express co recommended that the us trade representative take a 
more resultoriented approach to the us deficit with japan this 
would mean judging japanese actions by how much they reduce the 
deficit 
yoshitomis group recommends handling trade imbalance issues 
separately from trade policy issues saying that lowering barriers 
is a separate issue from achieving a balance between imports and 
exports 
it argues that it is totally wrong to see a large deficit as 
reflecting a countrys free trade practices and a large surplus as 
reflecting trade restrictions 
fundamental confusion is often seen in many journalistic 
articles it says 
referring to growing protectionist sentiment in the united states 
against japanese trade practices the report says the united states 
should not be frustrated by the lack of progress in reducing trade 
deficits and should not let politicians use the sentiment 
politically 
the report also attacks the united states use against japan of 
new trade legislation providing for retaliation if the two sides 
cannot negotiate a solution to japanese trade practices the united 
states deems unfair 
the global free trade system would completely break down if 
every country adopted the same policies based on unilateral 
judgments of unfair trade practices of trading partners in specific 
products especially when no country always acts fairly including 
the united states it says 
yoshitomi stressed that americans must change in order to reduce 
their trade deficit rather than simply demanding that its trade 
partners change 
us technological hegemony was established through essentially 
a mass production system since early this century he said 
but the situation may have changed in favor of japan so that 
many aspects of the american system must adapt he said

drivers of cars equipped with antilock brakes 
could soon be getting a break on their auto insurance rates 
in a move that could set a precedent for other major insurance 
companies allstate insurance co announced wednesday it is offering 
a 10 percent discount on three major autopolicy coverages for cars 
with antilock brakes 
this discount in effect is the first of its kind for a major 
carrier said greg rossiter a spokesman for the company based in 
the chicago suburb of northbrook 
the only other us insurance company currently offering an 
antilock brake system discount is usaa of san antonio texas a 
firm which provides insurance to military personnel and their 
dependents rossiter said 
antilock brakes use an onboard computer to control wheel speed 
during braking allowing faster and safer stops without skidding or 
loss of steering control 
theres no question that the antilock brake system provides a 
remarkable amount of braking protection that is not available in 
regular brake systems rossiter said 
william geen senior vicepresident of ccc information services 
inc a chicagobased firm that evaluates car losses for the 
insurance industry said he also has found that antilock brakes are 
effective 
its certainly been proven that the antilock brake system 
works very well and more manufacturers are offering it 
geen said he expected other insurance companies to follow 
allstates example in offering the antilock brake discount 
geen said there are few cars on the road with antilock brakes

the second bigtime wall street securities 
professional in two weeks has reversed position and pleaded guilty 
to fraud charges that stem indirectly from the ivan boesky insider 
trading scandal 
stock speculator salim b sandy lewis 50 unexpectedly 
entered a guilty plea wednesday to three felony charges involving 
alleged fraud in the trading of firemans fund corp stock more than 
three years ago 
the guilty plea by lewis a wellknown wall street figure and 
former special adviser to the securities and exchange commission 
came a month before he was to go on trial for charges his lawyer 
originally denounced as a piece of garbage 
on aug 17 goldman sachs amp co trader robert freeman also 
implicated as an indirect result of the boesky scandal said he 
would plead guilty to a single felony count for insider trading in 
beatrice cos stock in 1986 freeman originally had asserted his 
innocence 
it was not immediately clear why lewis changed his position 
neither he nor his lawyer stanley arkin would comment 
but many lawyers have speculated that recent jury guilty verdicts 
in two other cases involving takeover speculator paul bilzerian and 
partners in an investment partnership called princeton newport 
partners convinced other defendants that juries are willing to deal 
harshly with suspects in whitecollar fraud crimes 
lewis entered the pleas before us district judge kimba wood to 
charges of manipulating the price of firemans fund common stock 
aiding and abetting the falsification of records and stockmargin 
violations 
in addition his brokerage firm sb lewis amp co pleaded guilty 
to two counts of securities laws violations 
in a statement before the judge lewis did not provide a motive 
for the stock manipulation 
the charges against lewis carry a total maximum 15year prison 
term and 275 million in fines his company faces up to 1 million 
in fines a sentencing conference was set for sept 25 
lewis and his brokerage were named in a 22count indictment 
handed up by a federal grand jury nov 3 the indictment claimed 
lewis manipulated firemans fund stock price just before american 
express co announced the sale of firemans fund shares in 1986 
lewis had a close working relationship with american express one 
of the nations biggest financial services companies and parent of 
shearson lehman hutton inc a leading wall street investment house 
american express was not named in the indictment but was 
portrayed as the intended beneficiary of lewis alleged scheme the 
company denied any wrongdoing and said it had cooperated with 
investigators 
american express reiterated its position after lewis entered his 
guilty plea 
in a press statement the company also said we conducted our 
own internal investigation and concluded that no one at american 
express was involved in any wrongdoing whatsovever we have had a 
longstanding business relationship with mr lewis we have always 
regarded him as a man of integrity and high profesional competence 
and we are saddened by this episode 
charges against lewis stemmed from a 1987 guilty plea of boyd 
jefferies former head of the los angeles brokerage firm jefferies amp 
co who turned states evidence jefferies had been implicated by 
boesky the nowimprisoned speculator who settled insider trading 
charges in november 1986 
federal prosecutors alleged lewis requested two unidentified 
jefferies employees to buy more than 400000 shares of firemans 
fund on may 8 1986 in an attempt to drive its price up to 38 a 
share substantially above its price at the time 
the indictment also accused lewis of promising to reimburse the 
jefferies employees for any losses and of hiding his role through 
phony records 
on may 9 1986 american express announced it would sell 8 
million shares of firemans fund at 4150 a share it eventually 
made a profit of 88 million from the sale

credit card disclosure rules taking effect 
today offer the nations 107 million card holders a new opportunity 
to shop around for lower interest rates consumer activists say 
industry analysts however say they expect the new rules to have 
little impact at least over the short haul 
the regulations adopted by the federal reserve board in april 
require credit card issuers to disclose the interest rate monthly 
fee grace period and other terms in a chart on applications used to 
sign up customers 
previously the cards costs did not have to be disclosed until 
it arrived in the mail 
the new rules also require companies to notify existing customers 
in advance when their accounts are about to be renewed and another 
annual fee charged 
consumers should use the renewal notice as a reminder to switch 
cards and save said elgie holstein director of the bankcard 
holders of america a consumer group he advised cardholders to pay 
off their highrate cards with a cash advance from a lowrate card 
the new rules apply to bank cards such as visa mastercard and 
discover to department store cards and also to cards such as 
american express and diners club whose full balance must be paid 
monthly 
im very hopeful that this will at least provide the edge to 
consumers to make better judgments said peggy miller a lobbyist 
for the consumer federation of america 
miller and other consumer activists believe the regulations 
should force card companies to compete by lowering their interest 
rates and annual fees 
bankers and analysts however say most cardholders probably 
wont see much decline 
its going to put some strain on banks charging abovemarket 
rates and some of the banks that have extremely low rates may 
see a little more business but the vast majority are going to stay 
where they are said robert h burke senior vice president of the 
bank of new york 
i dont think its going to do much of anything agreed 
robert b mckinley publisher and editor of ram researchs bankcard 
update a frederick md newsletter that follows the industry 
mckinley said competition has increased in the past several 
years but rates are still high even in the dozen or so states such 
as california and new york that have their own disclosure laws 
nationally cards offered by banks had average interest rates of 
1828 percent in august and an average annual fee of 1697 he said 
one reason interest rates are not lower is the growing 
concentration of the industry as large institutions buy out smaller 
credit card operations said mckinley another is that consumers 
dont appear to pay much attention to interest rates 
economists attribute the indifference to interest rates in part 
to the fact that most people intend to pay off their entire bill 
each month avoiding interest charges but a substantial portion 
dont follow through on their good intentions 
credit card rates became a political issue in the early 1980s 
when shortterm interest rates soared above 20 percent consumer 
groups sought disclosure rules and federal caps on the rates but 
made little headway until they dropped their demand for caps 
although earlier disclosure of card terms should help card 
shoppers mckinley said it still wont be easy to find cards with 
the lowest rates 
big national operations which do the most advertising and mail 
solicitation generally charge higher rates and fees the best 
bargains often come from banks and savings institutions that at 
most advertise only regionally 
mckinley said consumers should decide whether they will use it 
for convenience or to borrow cardholders who pay their entire 
balance monthly should look for a card with a low annual fee or no 
fee however those who carry balances of 1000 or more may find it 
cheaper to pay a fee in exchange for a lower rate 
he lists some gimmicks that consumers should beware of even with 
the new rules 
some cards with no annual fee compensate by charging interest 
rates of more than 20 percent the annual fee often is waived only 
for the first year 
other cards offer skipapayment options but tack on added 
interest costs to the next bill 
cards with low rates compensate by charging high annual fees or 
allow no grace period assessing interest from the day of purchase 
others advertise costsaving variable rates that wind up being 
substantially higher than national averages for fixed rates 
some banks offer a lower annual fee or an interestrate break 
but only if customers maintain a checking account that carries a 5 
or 6 a month service charge 
other companies tout 1 percent rebates on purchases but charge 
interest rates 3 to 4 percentage points higher than most cards

the federal government clamped tighter controls 
today on the industrial handling and use of the cancercausing 
chemical benzene saying the new requirements will cut releases of 
the toxic chemical into the air by 90 percent 
the regulations some of which will take effect immediately and 
others within six months would cut benzene emissions into the air 
by more than 34000 tons yearly according to the environmental 
protecton agency 
todays rules and proposals will lower the industrial 
emmissions of benzene by 90 percent f henry habicht the epas 
deputy administrator said in the announcement 
the epa estimated the new requirements some of which will be 
phased in over two years will reduce the risk of the general 
population of getting cancer as a result of benzene exposure to less 
than one chance in 1 million 
but the agency acknowledged the risk could be much higher 
perhaps one in 10000 near some industrial plants where large 
amounts of benzene are found 
the new controls come 12 years after the epa first listed 
benzene a colorless odorless liquid widely found in the chemical 
steelmaking and petroleum industries as a hazardous air pollutant 
the sharpest emission cuts are expected to be seen in the steel 
industry where benzene has long been a chief byproduct with few 
controls on releases into the air the epa said the new rules cut 
those emissions by 97 percent officials said 
sizable emission reductions also are expected in the 
transportation of benzene in the pharmaceutical industry and in the 
transportation of gasoline from refineries to local service 
stations the agency said 
according to one epa official as many as 100 million people 
across the country are exposed to some level of benzene pollution 
releases into the air can be found anywhere from steel mills and 
refineries to the corner service station 
in addition to cancer federal authorities concluded in the 1970s 
that chronic exposure to benzene also causes leukemia and birth 
defects and damages bloodforming organs 
details of the new benzene controls werent disclosed in advance 
but they are considered by the epa to be among the most costly 
issued so far in curbing toxic emissions 
initial capital investment costs are expected to exceed 1 
billion over the next two years there was no immediate estimate on 
what additional operational costs companies might face 
we think this is an expensive standard we think its worth 
it said gerald emison director of the epas office of air 
quality planning 
in 1987 industry users reported more than 32 million pounds of 
benzene was released into the air but environmentalists say that 
doesnt count additional releases by small companies and other 
facilities such as gasoline stations that were not required to 
make emission reports 
benzene is only the seventh toxic chemical to be regulated by the 
epa which has been under criticism from congress for not moving 
more quickly to curb releases of such substances from the nations 
plants and factories 
there are more than 300 toxic chemicals for which industry must 
make annual reports of releases 
epa officials have acknowledged that the task of developing 
comprehensive emission controls for benzene has taken too long but 
blame much of the delay on the complex legal process they have been 
forced to follow 
as part of its planned tightening of federal air pollution laws 
congress is considering a revamping of how the epa deals with toxic 
chemicals so the agency can issue broad regulations based on 
installation of technology that would curb emissions of many 
chemicals at the same time 
the agency now must deal with each chemical separately as it 
has with benzene 
although some benzene releases are already controlled by either 
federal or state regulations the vast majority of the releases are 
not 
the epa for example says that the largest single source of 
benzene releases into the air stem from the production of coke in 
the iron and steel industry yet those releases have remained 
largely uncontrolled until now according to the epa 
significant releases also continue to occur in the transportation 
of benzene as well as during the transfer of gasoline from 
refineries to retail service stations controls on releases in those 
areas are largely nonexistent officials said 
federal controls have been in effect curbing benzene emissions 
from certain industrial equipment since 1984 but those controls 
cover only about 5 percent of all industrial releases of the 
chemical 
the occupational safety and health administration began 
regulating benzene releases in the workplace in 1987 but that 
doesnt cover emissions outside the immediate work environment

it may not make your day to hear this but the 
federal budget deficit will soon be back making news 
congress returns to session after labor day facing a deadline 
just a few weeks away to shrink somehow the projected gap between 
income and outgo for the government fiscal year that begins oct 1 
if it doesnt succeed then the law known as 
grammrudmanhollings calls for automatic cuts in spending to bring 
the deficit down within specified limits 
the stage is set for intense negotiations over the budget in 
the coming weeks says susan simon political analyst for the 
investment firm of shearson lehman hutton inc 
unless something is done president bushs budget staff says the 
government will stand to run 116 billion give or take a few 
hundred million in the red for fiscal 1990 
thats 16 billion more than mandated by grammrudmanhollings 
but a conservative estimate by comparison to others who have 
projected deficits as large as 140 billion 
it seems safe to assume that this will bring a lot of the usual 
scenes that have become so familiar in the 1980s wrangling between 
the administration and the lawmakers latenight maneuvering and 
some sort of lastminute compromise that will keep the government 
lurching along 
lots of people will pay no attention and why should they the 
debate over the deficit has been going on since the nixon 
administration at least and the situation never seems to change 
much 
besides whatever is done this fall the underlying problem wont 
go away any budget pain encountered in getting under the 
grammrudman ceiling for 1990 will be dwarfed by the agony coming 
down the track for 1991 observes the united amp babson investment 
report a bostonbased newsletter 
in that fiscal year grammrudman calls for a deficit limit of 
64 billion 
some people trace the origins of the muchbewailed breakdown of 
the budget process to the mid1960s when the nation was faced 
with a choice of how to spend its large but still finite resources 
should it build up its expensive role in the vietnam war or 
should it embark on a sweeping campaign to deal with domestic 
problems guns and butter decided president lyndon johnson 
the deficit widened with the recessions and oil crises of the 
1970s and got still worse during the reagan revolution of the 
80s 
along the way americans have taken part in a long experiment 
determining what happens to their economy in a period of chronic 
deficits 
it turns out that policy measures taken in response to a deficit 
can cause severe economic slumps runaway booms or long periods of 
mere muddling through they can foster rising inflation or declining 
inflation higher interest rates or lower interest rates 
in short under the deficits of the past two decades the nation 
has witnessed just about every conceivable economic environment 
except for the kind of calamity so many analysts of the problem have 
predicted 
logic still dictates that the government cannot go on 
indefinitely spending more than it takes in experience has shown 
that it could in fact do just that for longer than many experts 
thought possible 
blamed for everything from the stock market of crash of 1987 to a 
decline in family values the deficit persists having survived this 
far it seems ready to take on the 1990s with plenty of energy left

volkswagen of america has moved its northeast 
distribution center from the port of albany to rhode island the 
second major shipper the albany port has lost in two months 
officials said 
volkswagen said wednesday it was transferring its shipping center 
to the port of davisville in rhode island effective immediately 
the west german automaker had shipped more than 100000 cars up the 
hudson river to albany in the last three years 
the pullout will mean work reductions for up to 175 longshoremen 
while about a dozen jobs will be lost in related businesses 
officials said 
volkswagen shipped about 20500 cars to albany last year 
accounting for 135000 in revenues about 9 percent of the ports 
receipts 
the move comes after united brands co which shipped bananas 
from central america to albany for 17 years moved its shipments to 
wilmington del this summer united brands and volkswagen had been 
the ports biggest clients accounting for 80 percent of 
longshoremens work union officials said 
volkswagen was the last major steady client for us said 
wallace turnwall port manager for international terminal operators 
which manages the port 
volkswagen decided to leave albany after 11 years despite 
incentives offered by the port and union leaders the albany times 
union reported those incentives included freezing dock fees in 
1990 the newspaper reported 
its simply more economical to import through rhode island than 
to albany volkswagen spokesman patrick fitzgerald told the 
newspaper 
shipping sources said volkswagen facing slumping us sales had 
complained about the costs of doing business at the albany port 
the rhode island port at an old navy base near providence is 
about 10 miles from the atlantic ocean albany is about 140 miles 
from the atlantic

significant interests in financial services paper and retailing 
including such us holdings as the saks fifth avenue and marshall 
field department stores and farmers insurance group

commissions in several us states for obstructing the bid 
the state regulators have got to ask themselves whether they 
are going to be a poison pill or are going to allow free trade he 
said

australian investor kerry packer in leading the bat takeover bid 
europes largest to date

ever since the coffee beans muddy broth was 
first served 1000 years ago its survived religious persecution 
official banishment and suspected links to maladies ranging from 
heart attacks to male impotence 
its been written about used for inspiration and put to music 
johann sebastian bach composed coffee cantata which parodied 
those who sought to suppress the brew french philosopher voltaire 
reportedly drank 50 cups a day 
coffee as a drink first appeared in the year 900 in a part of 
arabia that is now yemen it became so popular in the middle east 
that moslem priests complained the drink emptied the mosques 
coffees rapid spread to europe led devout catholics to denounce it 
as an infidels brew 
frederick the great of prussia once banned coffee because he 
thought it threatened consumption of beer the national drink 
a study of coffee by findsvp a new york research concern said 
coffees success in 16th century europe led women to agitate for a 
prohibition claiming the drink inhibited the virility of their 
mates 
in more modern times medical studies have concluded the 
stimulant caffeine in coffee may contribute to higher cholesterol 
levels and heart disease 
health concerns about coffee is one reason its popularity among 
americans is diminishing according to recent studies which show a 
longterm decline in us consumption 
while three out of four americans regularly downed at least a cup 
a day in 1962 only half of the population reported drinking coffee 
last year a study by the international coffee organization shows 
in 1988 the average number of cups of coffee consumed per person 
per day was 167 cups down from 176 cups in 1987 and 46 percent 
below 1962 when per capita consumption was 312 cups the ico study 
found 
even hard core drinkers drink less 334 cups per day in 1988 
compared with 417 cups in 1962 
that doesnt mean coffee drinking is doomed in the united states 
which remains the largest market for coffee although americans 
constitute only 5 percent of the world population they still drink 
a third of the planets coffee about 360 million cups a day a 
report by the consumers union shows 
americans have also become more selective about their brew 
consumption of instant coffee has dipped appreciably in the last 
three decades though the number of people drinking decaffeinated 
coffee last year was four times that of 1962 the amount consumed 
declined from 175 percent in 1987 to 158 percent in 1988 the ico 
study found 
the most noticeable change has been in the habits of those 2029 
years of age whose per capita consumption fell from about 3 cups a 
day in 1962 to less than one cup in 1988 people older than 30 who 
consumed more than 4 cups in 1962 now drink about two cups a day 
analysts also attribute the decline in coffee drinking to the 
rise in popularity of soft drinks which has increased 
proportionally since 1985 soft drinks have overtaken coffee as the 
most consumed beverage 
but consumer concern about natural healthy foods also has led to 
a rise in the popularity of gourmet coffees despite the decline in 
overall coffee consumption sales of gourmet blends have grown about 
25 percent a year since 1975 says the findsvp study 
specialty whole bean and gourmet coffee now constitutes 8 percent 
of the total coffee market says robert dechillo spokesman for the 
national coffee association dechillo defines gourmet coffee as high 
quality flavored or unflavored coffee 
the trend to increased supermarket distribution is the most 
significant development in the industry and in helping popularize 
gourmet coffee it has also grown in restaurants 
with the two biggest us roasters procter amp gamble co and 
general foods corp getting into the act and expanding their 
marketing of gourmet coffees at supermarkets sales of gourmet 
coffee which totaled about 600 million in 1988 are forecast to 
double in another decade the findsvp study says 
of the gourmet segment flavored coffees are the fastest growing 
segment and the most controversial many purists shun flavored 
coffees because they consider them adulterated 
but it is this segment that has captured younger consumers who 
have grown up on soft drinks and sweeteroriented taste buds the 
findsvp study concludes 
the research firm found that vanilla nut irish cream and 
chocolate are consumers favorite flavors other favorites include 
cinnamon chocolate raspberry and coconut

a former zzzz best co official was ordered to 
repay 224861 in illegal profits and interest from the fraudulent 
rugshampooing company and to pay triple damages of 674582 
jack n polevoi of woodland hills calif a former zzzz best 
vice president is serving an 18month prison sentence after 
pleading guilty in june to four counts of stock and tax fraud and 
other violations 
the order for polevoi to pay the nearly 900000 came wednesday 
from us district judge robert j kelleher it was based on 
findings that in mid1987 polevoi and his twin brother jerry ordered 
54200 shares of zzzz best to be sold short 
polevoi knew at the time that zzzz bests founder and chairman 
barry m minkow was considering resigning from the reseda 
califbased company which was crumbling 
when investors sell stock short they seek to profit from a 
decline in the stock price by selling borrowed shares and buying 
them back later zzzz best shares fell from more than 5 each at the 
time the short sales were made to 75 cents when polevoi completed 
the transactions 
polevoi and others also laundered 712000 in zzzz best corporate 
funds and bank loans through las vegas casinos in the days before 
the company collapsed 
minkow who convinced wall street and the public that he was a 
teenage business genius was convicted of 57 counts of fraud 
conspiracy and other violations after investigators discovered that 
much of the work supposedly done by zzzz best existed only on paper 
minkow is serving a 25year prison term and has been ordered to 
repay 26 million in illegal profits and restitution

swedish automaker saabscania ab facing 
mounting losses and layoffs refused thursday to confirm or deny 
news reports that ford motor co is a leading suitor for its ailing 
passenger car division 
following a board meeting thursday janerik larsson head of 
saabs auto division declined to clarify a report in the stockholm 
tabloid expressen that a takeover deal with ford was imminent 
it has been rumored for several months that saab is seeking a 
buyer to help salvage its crisisridden passenger car division and 
to enable it to develop a successor to its stock 900 model by 1992 
the 900 model in recent years has run into hard times on the 
vital us market when it was developed saab managed to halve the 
costs by collaborating with italian auto giant fiatlancia 
this time saab reportedly first turned to japane mazda which is 
onefourthowned by ford and then turned to ford itself 
according to the expressen report toplevel negotiations with 
ford are nearing their conclusion the paper reported that ford the 
secondlargest us automaker after general motors co demanded a 
majority share of saab but other sources said the swedish company 
is only willing to relinquish 20 percent to 40 percent of its stock 
lin cummins a ford spokeswoman in dearborn mich said we 
can neither confirm nor deny the report 
larsson in a television interview thursday night said saabscania 
will remain a swedish automaking company indicating a possible 
refusal of a full takeover bid 
saab president georg karnsund who refused all comment thursday 
earlier had said we will seek to make it on our own 
from fords viewpoint a takeover of saabs profitmaking truck 
division could be a golden egg swedens top automaker volvo two 
years ago purchased general motors heavy truck division ford sells 
hardly any heavy trucks in europe where saabs scania truck 
division markets 75 percent of its products which are partly 
produced in the netherlands 
saabscania ab last year showed a record group profit of 32 
billion kronor about 484 million at current exchange rates up 16 
percent despite increasing losses in the passenger car division in 
addition to automotive and engine manufacturing saab makes 
aircraft weapons systems and electronic equipment 
larsson on thursday refused to confirm that the passenger car 
losses would mount to about one billion kronor for the first six 
months of this year and hit two billion kronor for the full year 
however he said losses would increase during the year from the 450 
million kronor suffered in the first four months which would 
virtually halve saabs profit for fiscal 1989 
larsson also said a tough crisis program including a staff 
reduction of about 2000 employees will not take effect until 1991 
and admitted that the automaker is in for a couple of tough years 
before it can hope to break even 
according to swedish business sources the liquidity problem of 
the saab passenger car division reportedly losing about 2500 on 
each car it produces due to high costs and setbacks on the dollar 
market is so severe it had to borrow from the parent company to 
cover this months wages

japanese banks goliaths of international finance 
are growing even bigger leaving their us counterparts in the dust 
as they keep an eye on deregulation 
the 10 largest banks in the world in terms of assets are all 
japanese led by daichi kangyo bank which has assets of 377 
billion thats more than citicorp and chase manhattan bank corp 
the two biggest us banks combined 
on tuesday mitsui bank and taiyo kobe bank said they would merge 
in april forming the worlds secondlargest bank with assets of 
348 billion 
in california four of the top 10 banks are japaneseowned 
deregulation starting in 1991 will allow them to expand across the 
united states backed by the strength of their huge parent companies 
a look at the unwieldy names of japanese banks shows how they got 
so big the mitsui taiyo kobe bank will combine the oldest bank in 
japan with the results of a 1973 merger of taiyo bank and kobe bank 
daichi kangyo bank is the result of a 1971 merger of its namesakes 
and had mitsui achieved its original threeway merger ambitions 
the economic newspaper nihon keizai shimbun says there would have 
been a mitsui taiyo kobe daiwa bank 
mergers of this scale are virtually unthinkable in the united 
states where antitrust regulations prevent the creation of firms 
judged large enough to restrict competition they are also rare in 
europe 
in japan senior ministry of finance officials praised the 
mitsuitaiyo kobe deal as good business strategy the national 
bankers association also welcomed the merger 
although mitsui and taiyo kobe were ranked seventh and eighth 
largest banks in japan each significantly larger than any us 
bank neither bank was really big enough to fulfill its ambitions 
on its own said simon smithson an analyst at kleinwort benson 
securities 
japans fair trade commission said it will look into the merger 
to see if it violates antitrust laws but the usually meek agency 
is not expected to block the deal 
next week us officials are expected to cite what they see as 
japans lax enforcement of antitrust laws in talks on structural 
impediments to correcting japans big surplus in trade with the 
united states 
there have been fears that japanese banks with the enormous cash 
reserves pooled by thrifty japanese savers will dominate 
international markets just as japanese car and electronics 
manufacturers have 
in banking largely through cheap pricing and highvolume 
business japanese banks already have made major inroads into us 
lending and in eurobond issues because of their strong domestic 
market where analysts estimate they make 90 percent of their 
profits they can afford to take slim margins on their overseas 
business 
but sheer size doesnt necessarilymean profitability 
daichi kangyo is ranked first in the world in terms of assets 
but only 77th in terms of return on equity notes j brian 
waterhouse an analyst at the securities house james capel 
some analysts say japans banking is where its manufacturing was 
20 years ago selling simple products cheap 
but foreign analysts say japanese banks are rapidly moving into 
more sophisticated products starting to invent as well as copy and 
that combined with firstclass skills their size will be an 
enormous advantage 
there could be implications for the united states if americans 
found themselves constrained by their own laws from reaching world 
size said an american banker speaking on condition of anonymity

soybean futures prices jumped about 10 cents a 
bushel thursday on the chicago board of trade amid fears that 
freezing temperatures could strike maturing crops in the midwest as 
early as next week 
corn and oat futures also finished higher while the wheat market 
was nearly unchanged 
some private meteorologists say the chance of an early freeze is 
greater than usual this year based on weather patterns that caused 
midwestern temperatures to drop to record lows earlier this month 
michael palmerino a senior agricultural meteorologist with 
weather services corp in bedford mass said his firm sees a 
1in3 chance of a significant freeze in the midwest during 
september compared with the normal odds of 1 in 15 
but palmerino said meteorologists predicting a freeze next week 
were likely using a forecasting model developed in europe whereas 
his firm uses a us model that suggests rain followed by a warming 
trend in the midwest next week 
furthermore he said if a freeze were to occur in the grain belt 
next week it would probably affect only a very small portion of 
the area causing only marginal crop damage 
at the close of trading wheat was 1 cents lower to 1 cents 
higher with the contract for delivery in september at 386 a 
bushel corn was 2 cents to 4 cents higher with september at 234 
a bushel oats were 2 cents to 4 cents higher with september at 
135 a bushel soybeans were 3 cents to 10 cents higher with 
september at 588 a bushel

apple computer incs first portable macintosh 
will be heavy bulky and expensive but it will also have one of the 
sharpest screens in the business analysts say 
apple which plans to announce the new portable sept 20 did not 
cut any corners with its longawaited portable even if doing so 
would have produced a more affordable and easiertocarry computer 
according to people familiar with the product 
theyre trying to be on one machine everything to everyone 
which apple has always done especially in the macintosh line 
said richard meyeroff a computer consultant in brooklyn ny 
the portable mac is expected to be priced at more than 6000 and 
weigh about 17 pounds making it more costly and heavier than the 
latest ibmcompatible laptop computers it is powered either by wall 
current or an internal rechargeable leadacid battery 
on the plus side its flat flipup screen is expected to be 
unusually large and sharp with 1 million picture elements in a 
1000 by 1000 array 
a sharp picture is important because many people use macintoshes 
for design work 
to overcome the slowness of most flat screens apple has attached 
a separate transistor to each picture element or pixel so the 
screen responds almost instantaneously analysts say the screens 
biggest drawback is that it is somewhat hard to read in dim light 
they say 
devoted users of the macintosh for years have seen fellow 
travelers being able to tap away on their laptop versions of tandys 
zeniths toshibas and necs 
apple has said it was not ready to bring out a portable mac 
because the technology for one was not adequate that apparently has 
changed 
in private showings apple has been careful not to call the new 
machine a laptop which would imply it is lighter than it really is 
people are calling it the paul bunyan laptop said dan ruby 
editor of macweek in san francisco a weekly newspaper that has 
broken information about the forthcoming machine 
laptops are the fastestgrowing portion of the personal computer 
market and have spawned their own smaller offspring notebook 
computers which weigh roughly 4 pounds and slip into an average 
briefcase 
ruby said apples decision not to sell a pareddown lightweight 
laptop version of the macintosh is typical of the companys 
attitude when it comes to design stuff theyre rather arrogant 
my personal feeling is id like apple to take a look at what 
toshibas done with the line of portables they have that should 
give them a better idea of what the markets looking for meyeroff 
said 
apple declined to respond thursday to comment and speculation 
about its machine in advance of the sept 20 announcement 
apple wont quite have the portable macintosh market all to 
itself several small companies make fully legal mac compatibles 
billed as addons that are built around circuit boards taken out of 
actual mac computers 
wallaby systems inc of boulder colo is getting ready to 
market a portable that weighs less than 10 pounds and costs 3000 
or 4000 depending on options the customer has to take certain 
circuitry out of an old macintosh se or mac plus and put it in the 
wallaby the wallaby can also be hooked to the gutted mac giving a 
user two screens and twice the power 
at the upscale end of the market dynamac computer products inc 
in denver sells a machine with mac boards that is even more powerful 
than apples own portable mac with possibly a better screen but it 
costs 6000 to 10000 weighs at least as much as the mac and 
cant run on batteries

walt disney world faces a 254 percent tax 
increase on 10175 undeveloped acres in floridas osceola county

agricultural classification on a large portion of disneys property 
that is suitable for development near interstate 4 and us highway 
192 
disneys osceola tax notice which arrived by mail this week

milk supplies are drying up in new 
england which means consumers probably will have to pay up to 20 
cents more per gallon by the end of the year dairy experts said 
thursday 
its good news for the dairy farmer because that means his 
price is going up said richard stammer senior vice president of 
economics and communications at agrimark inc a cooperative of 
about 2200 dairy farmers in new england and new york 
milk is really short all the way from boston out to minnesota 
and wisconsin and clear down through the south said james n 
putnam ii director of research at the farm credit banks of 
springfield 
agriculture officials said they dont anticipate a shortage of 
milk in stores 
there is milk around but the cost is going to be increased 
because theyre going to have to go farther and farther west to get 
the milk said charles costa assistant commissioner of the 
massachusetts department of food and agriculture 
dairy farmer jim williams who runs a herd of about 170 on his 
sunderland farm said he hopes the shortage will translate into a 
better price im optimistic he said 
a few years ago the nation appeared awash in a milk surplus with 
the government installing price supports and giving away cheese in 
bulk amounts however there was no overflow in massachusetts which 
produces only about 25 percent of its fluid milk needs 
now the surplus is gone partly because of a 1986 whole herd 
buyout in which farmers sold their entire herds to the government 
for slaughter and promised to stay out of the dairy business for 
five years 
massachusetts imports much of its milk from vermont and new york 
which are in the same situation of low production at a time when 
consumption historically is high putnam said 
meanwhile the number of dairy farms in massachusetts has fallen 
from about 770 in 1984 to about 450 the buyout program is estimated 
to have reduced herds by 20 percent while rising land prices and 
competition from large midwest dairy farms also affected the state 
industry officials said 
the main reason that were in the current situation is that the 
dairy farmers prices pretty much constantly declined since 1983 
this has driven a lot of farmers out of business stammer said 
right now market prices are bidding up the price said 
clayton plumb chief of the order formulation division in the us 
department of agricultures dairy division its something that 
hasnt been the case since the late 1970s in terms of dairy prices 
being market driven he said 
the shortage is being felt strongest in southern new england

american savings bank which attracted 
thousands of customers with relatively low credit card interest 
rate has bumped the rate by nearly 4 percentage points 
i feel like ive been suckerpunched said david montoya a 
san mateo energy consultant who said he was drawn to americans low 
credit card interest rate a year ago thats simply an awesome 
increase 
however the stocktonbased thrift said the increase is necessary 
to keep its operation competitive 
weve heard few complaints said american spokeswoman layna 
browdy 
browdy said that more than 50 percent of the banks customers pay 
off their credit card balance every month so they are not affected 
by the rate hike 
the onceinsolvent american savings amp loan which changed its 
name to american savings bank after texas billionaire robert m bass 
acquired it last year boosted its credit card loans eightfold in 
the past two years by offering visa holders a relatively low 15 
percent interest rate 
but last month american raised the rate almost 4 percentage 
points to 189 percent the increase is retroactive applying not 
only to new purchases but also to unpaid balances 
that seems immoral montoya said 
but it is legal only a few states such as delaware georgia 
montana and new jersey have laws prohibiting lenders from applying 
a new interest rate to an existing balance and only if the customer 
stops using the card if a customer makes a charge after the new 
rate takes effect the entire balance is subject to the new rate 
americans credit card operation is the second fastestgrowing in 
the state after glendale federal savings 
americans credit card loans jumped to 664 million by the end 
of 1988 from 8 million in 1986 
still it is a relatively small operation considering citibanks 
218 billion in creditcard loans

the federal communications commission on 
thursday approved mccaw cellular communications incs 55 billion 
hostile takeover of lin broadcasting corp 
the commission denied assertions by lin a new yorkbased 
cellular telephone broadcasting and publishing concern that 
mccaws bid for transfer of control of lins telephone and 
broadcasting licenses was not in the public interest and that mccaw 
didnt have the money to make the deal 
lin also had argued that a hearing should be held to determine 
whether british telecom plc held too much control of mccaw the 
worlds largest nonwireline cellular telephone company under laws 
limiting foreign investment in us broadcasting companies that the 
merger would be anticompetitive that mccaw would be too indebted 
and that the merger would violate cabletelevision crossownership 
rules 
in addition lin challenged the character of john malone a mccaw 
director who is president of the nations largest cable tv operator 
telecommunications inc of denver 
the fcc said it appeared that malone would not exert direct 
control over the new companys television operations but it 
conditioned its approval on mccaw providing an exact description of 
malones position and duties and assurances he will comply with the 
cabletelevision crossownership restrictions 
overall the fcc said no good reason has been shown for the 
commission significantly to depart from its longstanding policy of 
strict neutrality and hence minimal intervention into the 
marketplace for corporate control 
lin operates seven networkaffiliated television stations and has 
interests in cellular systems serving new york los angeles 
philadelphia dallas and houston it also owns a specialty 
publishing house that produces hardcover tourist guides for hotel 
rooms 
in may lins board approved in principal spinning off all of the 
stock in a new subsidiary that would own its tv stations it said it 
would operate its cellular operations along with the publishing 
business as a separate company 
kirkland washbased mccaw made a 110pershare cash offer for 
all shares of lins stock in july after first offering 120 a 
share lin management is seeking 12750 a share for its 539 
million shares or nearly 69 billion mccaw already owns 5 million 
shares of lin stock 
mccaw earlier this month extended its offer to sept 1 
about 107 million lin shares have been tendered mccaw said 
earlier this month 
lin said on july 31 its own deadline that its board would 
pursue other options 
mccaw had asked the fcc that in order to speed the merger lins 
licenses be transfered temporarily to a trustee representing its 
wholly owned subsidiary mmm holdings inc but the commission said 
thursday it could rule on the full application for transfer 
immediately 
the commission said it generally does not consider debt or the 
level of debt as a relevant consideration in license transfers 
as for assertions by lin that mccaw hasnt lined up the financing 
necessary the commission said mccaw had well in excess of the 
amount needed to acquire lin with the balance more than adequate to 
operate the lin television stations for three months 
the commission said mccaw had 1 billion in cash from the recent 
sale of stock to british telecom the british phone company 13 
billion in revolving credit 2 billion from a credit line from a 
bank syndicate headed by morgan guaranty and up to 25 billion 
from public or private equity or debt placements to be managed by 
drexel burnham lambert inc 
the commission said british telecoms 22 percent holdings in 
mccaw were within the 25 percent limits for foreign investors the 
british government has a 48 percent ownership interest in british 
telecom plc the parent of british telecom 
the fcc also rejected lins request to look into possible 
anticompetitive rule violations by bellsouth the regional telephone 
company which would be partnered with mccaw in los angeles and 
houston through the merger while competing with mccaw in other 
areas 
it also said no further action was warranted on lins assertions 
that malone was not qualified to hold licenses because of his 
possible involvement in a cable franchise renewal proceeding in 
jefferson city mo that resulted in a multimilliondollar verdict 
against tci for antitrust violations

a federal appeals court on thursday upheld a lower 
courts decision to throw out controversial firstinthenation 
state regulations that would have made it easier for stock traders 
to sue brokers in financial disputes 
the 1st us circuit court of appeals backed up us district 
judge douglas p woodlocks december 1988 ruling throwing out 
massachusetts regulations that prevent stockbrokers from requiring 
customers to seek arbitration in stock disputes 
a coalition of brokers brought the case in september 1988 after 
massachusetts secretary of state michael connolly imposed the 
regulations inspired by the 1987 stock market crash 
the regulations would have required brokers to fully disclose the 
terms of their arbitration agreements and give customers the option 
of maintaining their right to sue in court 
we can find no evidence of a clear congressional command to 
override the unambiguous proarbitration mandate of the federal 
arbitration act in the securities field the court opinion said 
other states interested in instituting requirements similar to 
the massachusetts regulations were watching the case closely 
typically the arbitration agreements state that in the event of 
a dispute the customer and the broker would go into arbitration 
before a mutually acceptable party such as the new york stock 
exchange rather than take the case to court 
among those challenging the regulations were the securities 
industry association and 10 brokerage firms including dean witter 
reynolds inc fidelity brokerage services inc and shearson lehman 
hutton inc 
thousands of investors filed complaints alleging their urgent 
stock transactions were misplaced or mishandled during the stock 
market crash of october 1987 and many have said they prefer lawsuits 
to arbitration 
theres been a certain amount of suspicion that investors dont 
get as good a result in arbitration as in court said attorney 
gerald rath who represents the plaintiffs in the case but as far 
as im concerned thats unfounded 
telephone calls placed to connollys office for comment thursday 
evening were not answered
