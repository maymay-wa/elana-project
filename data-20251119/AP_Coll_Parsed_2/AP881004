after months of 
firefighting with no end in sight officials said tuesday there was 
only one fire burning in and around yellowstone national park and 
it could be contained in three days 
as of tuesday the 387400acre clovermist fire was 90 percent 
contained and the 845 firefighters left on the blaze expected to 
have it contained on friday according to park spokeswoman sandi 
robinson 
the fire which also covers parts of the shoshone national 
forest and into montana has been burning since july 9 one of 
several that have involved an area covering 16 million acres in 
and around the park 
at one time the clovermist blaze threw up 100foot walls of 
flame that dwarfed firefighters trying to get containment lines 
around its perimeter 
as the summer waned however activity has slowed so much fire 
crews have gotten down to cold trailing in which they feel the 
ground with their bare hands in search of hot spots that have yet 
even to produce smoke 
progress also is being made on the 400100acre north fork and 
the 107500acre wolf lake fires in yellowstone and fire crews 
continue to head out of the countrys oldest national park 
however it is too soon to predict when nature will be allowed 
to take over the job of handling the fires robinson said 
we continue to demobilize but as far as when the last 
firefighter will leave the park we just dont know that yet she 
said

craig springer spokesman for the us consulate in frankfurt 
told reporters at the base that singh would undergo a medical 
checkup and then a state department debriefing team was scheduled 
to interview him later wednesday 
this is a twofold operation no 1 is to insure the physical 
and mental health of mr singh but at the same time to find out

djerejian 
djerejian indian charge daffaires b balakrishnan and syrian 
officials saw singh off at the damascus airport 
djerejian said singh asked to be allowed to rest and given 
the circumstances he is feeling relatively well 
a syrian doctor pronounced singh fit for travel 
in new delhi the foreign ministry said india had worked for 
singhs release through contacts with the syrian goverment and 
others 
the captive was released to the us ambassador because of the 
confusion that still existed in the middle east about his 
nationality a spokesman said 
india has maintained singh was kidnapped because his abductors 
thought he was an american 
armed men dressed as policemen took singh hostage jan 24 1987 
on the beirut university college campus in moslem west beirut 
along with americans alann steen robert polhill and jesse turner 
a group calling itself islamic jihad for the liberation of 
palestine claimed responsibility and said it freed singh as a 
goodwill gesture to the united states nearly all the foreign 
hostages in lebanon are believed held by shiite moslem groups loyal 
to iran 
a us official in damascus said the americans decided to accept 
custody because singh had applied for citizenship before his 
abduction 
singh said tuesday he felt wonderful and added thank god 
im free but im very sorry that my colleagues and friends are 
still in captivity i hope theyll be free soon 
he was cleanshaven dressed in a gray suit and appeared before 
dozens of reporters at the syrian foreign ministry after a brief 
chat with djerejian he was brought in through a back door at about 
11 am 
steen polhill and turner were the only hostages he saw while in 
captivity singh said 
asked about the conditions under which he was held he said 
the treatment was better than i had expected but theres no 
substitute to freedom in this world

captivity

anyone else he was a professor of finance at buc steen 49 of 
boston taught journalism polhill 54 of new york city was a 
lecturer in accounting and turner 41 of boise idaho was an 
instructor of mathematics and computer science 
in washington president reagan again ruled out negotiations 
with captors of the americans but said liberating them has been a 
great problem for us and its very much on our minds 
the white house said pleasure about singhs release was 
tempered by the knowledge that nine innocent americans still 
are hostages 
in an interview published tuesday in the new york times the 
spiritual leader of a group believed to be an umbrella for captors 
of foreign hostages was quoted as saying this is not yet the 
right time for the american hostages to be freed 
sheik mohammed hussein fadlallah spiritual head of the 
iranianbacked hezbollah or party of god also was quoted as 
saying the hostages would have to wait for the outcome of the 
american presidential election he said iran prefers to deal with 
the republicans

a 500pound bull moose has been lumbering 
across busy highways and wandering through wooded areas in bostons 
western suburbs and authorities hope he finds his way back north 
on his own 
where does a 500pound gorrilla sleep anywhere he likes 
thats sort of what were doing with the moose said steve 
williams a biologist for the state department fisheries and 
wildlife 
we have moose come in occasionally and normally they cause no 
problems they either wander up back north or find a place to stay 
for the fall 
metro moose was last spotted limping into the woods in 
weston after a car clipped his hind leg monday morning it has been 
seen at least 10 times in five towns 10 to 15 miles west of boston 
during the past week 
animal control officers police and state wildlife officials say 
they cant do much for the moose believed to have wandered from 
new hampshire for mating season except try to keep people away 
from him 
williams said each mating season older male moose chase younger 
males away from the females 
at this time of the year the young males are kicked out of 
the area and travel in search of mates and in search of new 
territory williams said 
and because theres moose populations to the north west and 
east they often head south 
susan webb harvey the animal control officer in wellesley said 
the moose has been spotted crossing route 9 several times in the 
early morning 
hes been moving at night and probably sleeping during the 
day thats why people dont see him she said of course at 
night you cant see him unless he comes in front of your 
headlights

libyas foreign minister on tuesday 
repeated his countrys demand for compensation from america for the 
us air raids in 1986 on tripoli and benghazi 
gadallah azouz eltalhy told the general assembly may i 
remind you of the flagrant barbaric aggression perpetrated by the 
united states of america in the spring of 1986 
this aggression was condemned by world public opinion at the 
time and by this distinguished assembly which recognized the 
right of our people to receive appropriate compensation for the 
losses incurred he said he did not mention any specific amount 
us warplanes attacked the two libyan cities on april 15 1986 
after the reagan administration accused the regime of libyan leader 
moammar gadhafi of supporting international terrorism 
libyan authorities said 41 people perished in the raids and the 
attacks were aimed at killing gadhafi they denied the allegation 
that libya had supported terrorists 
in november 1986 the general assembly passed a resolution 7928 
condemning the raids libya then asked the security council for a 
similar resolution but america britain and france vetoed it 
as the american attack against libya is one of the items on 
the general assembly agenda this session we call upon all 
peaceloving states to reiterate their condemnation of this 
aggression and to support libyas demand for compensation

vice presidential nominees dan quayle and lloyd bentsen polished 
their debate lines tuesday in preparation for their 90 minutes in 
the campaign spotlight 
at the top of the tickets george bush said he wanted to inspire 
affluent youths to help our poor while michael dukakis said 
the gop offers only slogans and symbols 
republican quayle and democrat bentsen were flying to omaha 
neb the site of wednesday nights debate 
i will be prepared to answer any and all questions tomorrow 
night quayle said aboard his campaign plane to omaha 
this will be the first time since new orleans that i will have an 
opportunity to communicate with the american people in an unedited 
version 
a new poll released tuesday suggested that the debate would give 
quayle a chance to overcome some of the negative images about him 
that are driving undecided voters away from bush 
the cbs newsnew york times poll of 1034 probable voters found 
48 percent support for the bushquayle ticket and 46 percent for 
the dukakisbentsen ticket but when voters were asked about their 
presidential preference only the support for dukakis slipped to 43 
percent 
the poll conducted saturday through monday had a margin of 
error of plus or minus three percentage points 
the two presidential candidates split a pair of polls in 
pennsylvania but neither lead could make up for the margin of 
sampling error a poll for the pittsburgh postgazette and 
philadelphia daily news showed bush leading 4842 among the 595 
likely voters who were questioned a survey of 837 registered 
voters for philadelphias wcautv gave dukakis a 4645 lead both 
surveys were conducted by telephone late last week 
we are very very proud of you republican campaign chairman 
james a baker iii told quayle during a tour by quayle of the 
bushquayle headquarters in washington we are very very proud 
of the job youre doing for this campaign and we are very very 
proud of the job we know youre going to do tomorrow in omaha 
when asked during the tour what tactics hed use against 
bentsen quayle said my debate strategy tune in tomorrow 
night 
i have 90 minutes to explain to america why mike dukakis and 
lloyd bentsen should lead this country bentsen said at a rally 
in austin texas before leaving for omaha ninety minutes to 
describe our vision of america to tell the voters how lloyd 
bentsen and mike dukakis plan to keep our economy and our military 
number one 
spokesman mike mccurry said bentsen was working on the best 
way of making a point memorable or punchy 
dukakis campaign manager susan estrich who was in austin 
helping bentsen said were not teaching him new positions on 
issues i think thats what the quayle people have to do 
bush was in sacramento calif and he outlined his plan for a 
quasipublic foundation called youth in service to america to 
encourage young people to volunteer in community activities 
i want our affluent to help our poor he said i want the 
young men and women of our treelined suburbs to get on a bus or 
the subway or the metro and go into the cities where the want 
is 
the republican presidential nominee described his proposal as an 
alternative to massive federal spending 
he said years of federal programs designed to help the poor had 
proven that we cant buy our way out 
a fact sheet distributed to reporters said bush would ask for 
100 million in federal funds to match private donations to the 
foundation 
dukakis spoke at northwestern university in evanston ill and 
attacked what he called bushs record of failure 
mr bush was given five important missions by this 
administration and he failed every one said the democratic 
presidential nominee and that was before they asked him to pick 
a running mate in this election 
dukakis listed the five assignments as resolving trade problems 
with japan heading an antiterrorism panel leading the war on 
drugs investigating problems in the banking industry and heading a 
task force on regulatory reform 
the massachusetts governor said bush offers slogans and 
symbols lloyd bentsen and i are offering real solutions to the 
problems american families face every day and every week and every 
month 
on the advertising front the washington post reported in its 
wednesday editions that bushs campaign has unleased a new attack 
ad the ad featuring uniformed prisoners going through a revolving 
door calls attention to the controversial prisonfurlough program 
in massashusetts that dukakis modified after a firstdegree 
murderer raped a woman and beat her fiance 
the bush campaign did not respond to earlier calls from the 
associated press asking for information on the ads 
another ad says dukakis as governor allowed taxes to rise and 
jobs to be lost 
reporting on a recently begun dukakis advertising campaign 
called the packaging of george the post said dukakis has spent 
an estimated 15 million on the ads which began friday and will 
run through the week

the life of the miniskirt on the milan 
runway has proved to be as brief as its hemline 
only a year after italian designers bared the leg right up to 
the hip bone they are covering it again straight down to the 
ankle 
for the most part the new look for spring and summer 1989 is 
long and loose with a myriad of pants and long skirts creating a 
softer quieter mood than in the past few seasons 
the change was most evident at gianni versace known for his 
hiphugging styles and soaring hemlines 
in his show monday versace concentrated heavily on pants in his 
subdued summer collection either cropping them at the calf or 
letting them flow softly to the ankle waistlines tended to be high 
or placed comfortably on the hip when he wasnt showing pants he 
wrapped his models in demure loose anklelength skirts buttoned 
down the front 
on the whole the versace collection concentrated on a 
sophisticated summer look which ignored the lighthearted outfits 
prevalent in the first two days of the fiveday showings although 
he presented several shades such as tangerine lemon and lime most 
of the collection was in black and white 
except for several trim city pants suits with small jacket and 
tapered mantailored trousers the emphasis was on nighttime his 
favorite evening look was a oneshouldered chiffon gown adorned 
with a single tassel draped over the back on a long silk cord huge 
gold and silver bracelets and earrings added extra glamor 
keith varty for byblos who opened the monday showings at the 
milan trade fair grounds opted for the ethnic mood which has 
prevailed in most of the collections he brings his summer client 
to the shores of copacabana in a brightly colored carioca skirt and 
flowers in her hair or drops her off in the virgin islands in 
loose cropped pants and jungle printed camisole 
there wasnt much novelty in the outfits copied stitch and 
ruffle from their native countries but the funloving styles and 
bright tropical shades created a carefree mood which is what summer 
is all about 
also on mondays calendar was the enfant terrible of italian 
fashion franco moschino who delights in taking the fashion crowd 
for a ride at least at his show in past seasons he spoofed 
chanel by loading his models with gold chains poked fun at 
jeanpaul gaultier by putting everything but the kitchen sink on 
hats and ridiculed the sexier outfits of his italian colleagues by 
parading real underwear down the runway 
his latest gimmick was to show his own clothes from past seasons 
as if they were his new styles and to haul the models off the 
runway to be replaced by a large video screen with the words 
what we really need is a change written in big letters

mikhail s gorbachev won a small painful 
victory in the game of musical chairs in the kremlin but he failed 
to unseat some outspoken critics of his most radical reforms 
gorbachevs most visible success was taking the place of andrei 
gromyko as soviet president combining that office with the more 
powerful post of general secretary of the communist party as did 
his three predecessors 
and he brought some new possibly friendlier faces onto the 
ruling politburo 
but it is still not gorbachevs politburo stephen cohen 
head of soviet studies at princeton university said monday 
i dont see this as a decisive consolidation of power on the 
part of gorbachev cohen said as long as he is a reform 
leader there is never going to be decisive consolidation every 
reform generates new opposition 
peter reddaway who heads the kennan institute for advanced 
russian studies in washington predicted that in the next year or 
two gorbachev is likely to come under increasing political 
pressure 
gorbachev bought some time said cohen by orchestrating a 
fairly complex set of compromises by different groups on where the 
reforms ought to go 
gorbachev made some significant gains on balance but he had 
to pay a price to people who do not share his views cohen said 
for the time being the shuffle at the top has not visibly 
reduced the power of the two politburo members who have most 
vocally differed with the reform movement yegor ligachev and 
viktor chebrikov 
in fact it gave them authority over two of the most important 
areas of reform leaving ligachev in charge of reforming 
agriculture and chebrikov in charge of reforming the legal system 
an extraordinary party conference this summer endorsed the 
partial decollectivization of agriculture by leasing stateowned 
land to farmers and the conference also called for what could be 
sweeping changes in the legal system ensuring protection of 
individual rights a shift in power from the party to parliamentary 
bodies and greater accountability for all those holding public 
office 
putting ligachev and chebrikov in control of those reforms was 
intended said cohen to assure the moderates that the most 
radical reforms are in the hands of the least radical reformers 
chebrikov did relinquish his job as head of the kgb security 
police but he took a much more powerful post party secretary 
when yuri andropov made exactly the same move in may 1982 he 
became the frontrunner to succeed the ailing leonid i brezhnev 
which he did on brezhnevs death seven months later 
ligachevs new status is less clear he had been the no 2 man 
in the kremlin by his own account running the daytoday affairs 
of the party secretariat 
giving ligachev the agricultural portfolio does not remove his 
hand from control of the party secretariat 
and it puts him in charge of food production a sector which can 
make or break gorbachev 
gorbachevs success will rest on the degree to which he can 
carry out the reforms which up till now have been hampered by 
conservatives and bureaucrats cohen said 
and the reforms have not generated much popular support because 
in part they have not put more food on the tables of soviet 
consumers 
there are signs of growing concern among what reddaway calls the 
centerright opposition to gorbachev 
a growing number of observers myself included find that 
gorbachevs program is resulting in stagnant living standards 
with rising popular discontent mounting economic confusion 
uncertainty for moscows allies abroad declining political order 
and a potentially serious reduction in central control over the 
republics reddaway said in an opinion piece published in 
sundays washington post

a new supreme court case involving a christmas 
nativity scene and a jewish symbol will provide the first test of 
justice anthony m kennedys views on the often emotional issue of 
separation of church and state 
although the high courts newest member was a federal appeals 
court judge for 12 years little is known about his approach to 
churchstate controversies 
the supreme court beginning its 198889 term monday announced 
it will conduct its latest study of the constitutionality of 
religious displays in a case from pittsburgh 
the justices frequently have been sharply divided over 
churchstate issues and kennedys vote could be decisive 
on returning to the bench after a threemonth summer recess the 
court issued orders in about 1000 cases agreeing to grant full 
review in 20 of them that is about oneeighth of the cases that 
will yield fullscale decisions before the court completes this 
terms work in july 
in its latest examination of how imposing the wall separating 
church and state must be the justices will decide whether displays 
of a christmas nativity scene and a menorah symbolizing the jewish 
holiday of chanukah should be allowed at two government buildings 
in pittsburgh 
the dispute could provide important clues on whether the court 
is prepared to rearrange the constitutional tests applied in 
certain freedomofreligion cases 
the court also agreed to consider for the second time in two 
years the authority of states to deny unemployment benefits to 
people who refuse to work on their sabbath 
illinois officials refused to pay benefits to a man whose 
refusal to work was not based on the doctrine of any established 
religious body but on his personal christian belief 
in the religious display case a federal appeals court ruled 
that housing a creche and menorah at the public buildings in 
pittsburgh violated the constitution 
since 1981 a creche depicting the birth of jesus christ has 
been displayed inside the main entrance to the allegheny county 
courthouse for about six weeks during the christmas season 
a block away an 18foot menorah has been displayed each year on 
the front steps of the citycounty building since 1982 
the creche is owned by the holy name society a roman catholic 
mens group the menorah a ninebranched candelabrum was donated 
by chabad a jewish organization 
the supreme court in 1984 allowed communities nationwide to put 
christ in christmas by including nativity scenes in officially 
sponsored holiday displays 
in that ruling the justices let pawtucket ri officials 
place a creche in a christmas display because such decorations as 
santa claus reindeer and snowmen also were included 
but lower courts since have treated the 1984 decision as a 
narrow one and have disallowed various christmas displays deemed 
too religious 
in other action the court 
said it will decide whether a railroad routinely may require 
its employees to take drug tests without negotiating the issue in 
collective bargaining 
the court previously announced it will decide sometime in 1989 
whether constitutional privacy rights of railroad workers are 
violated by federal regulations requiring blood and urine tests for 
those involved in serious train accidents and whether people 
applying for us customs service drugenforcement jobs may be 
subjected to drug tests 
agreed to decide in a case from dallas whether communities may 
seek to protect young teenagers by barring anyone over 18 from 
dance halls or other establishments catering to minors 
voted to decide in a minnesota case whether the federal 
government may continue to bar newspapers from carrying 
advertisements for privately run lotteries and other games of 
chance 
the court also said it will judge the validity of a federal 
postal laws effective ban on newspapers publishing lists of 
lottery winners 
agreed to decide whether state colleges and universities may 
ban certain commercial activities from dormitories the justices 
will review a ruling that a new york school violated students 
rights by barring a cookware company from making its sales pitch in 
dorm rooms

president reagan wont get to ride on a new 
air force one before he leaves office because the airplanes 
contractor is months behind schedule with no prospect of making up 
the delay air force and company officials say 
the boeing co which is building the new air force one and a 
backup plane by customizing huge 747 passenger jet airframes 
advised us last week they wont be prepared even to finalize a 
new delivery schedule until midtolate october lt col darrel 
c hayes an air force spokesman said monday 
so obviously delivery wont occur in november as anticipated 
but rather next year hayes continued and the delivery is 
going to occur later in the year probably summer and not in 
january before reagan steps down 
boeings contract with the air force called for delivery of the 
first plane by nov 30 three months ago however air force 
officials disclosed boeing was going to miss that deadline because 
of problems with installing wiring for the planes specialized 
communications gear 
at the time james c mckinney the chief of the white houses 
military office said he still was hopeful the company could get 
the first plane delivered by jan 20 inauguration day to enable 
reagan to take a ride on the new plane as he began his retiremnt to 
californaia 
other white house aides have said they wanted reagan to have an 
opportunity to fly on the plane since he was the president who took 
the political heat from pushing congress for money to replace the 
existing jets 
boeing was awarded a firm fixed price contract totaling 2498 
million for the two 747s in the summer of 1986 they will replace 
boeing 707s that are now 15 years and 25 years old respectively 
according to hayes boeing is in the midst of a special 
engineering study trying to set a realistic schedule for 
completing the lead plane and obtaining its flight certification 
but the scope of the work is such that the plane is obviously 
not going to be ready even for a january delivery the spokesman 
said the installation of wiring harnesses communications checks 
and flight checks are still to be done 
hayes said most of the delays stemmed from unexpected problems 
in stringing wiring throughout the plane to support its specialized 
communications gear 
there was just a lot of extra engineering and design work that 
was required he said 
right now were working with the air force and expect by the 
middle or end of october to have a new schedule boeing spokesman 
peter dakan said 
but i wouldnt contradict statements that the plane wont be 
ready to ferry reagan into retirement he added 
the term air force one is actually a radio call sign applied to 
any airplane that is carrying a president but the term has become 
synonymous with the two boeing 707s maintained by the 89th military 
airlift wing at andrews air force base md outside washington 
the planes are recognizable by their distinctive striping and 
american flag on their tails the air force says they are so old 
that it is becoming increasingly difficult to support them with 
spare parts 
the new 747s are being constructed to carry 70 passengers and 23 
crew members compared with the 400 passengers that can be carried 
by the commercial version of the fourengine jet the existing 
presidential planes can carry 59 passengers along with a crew of 10 
the air force has said the new planes will have stateoftheart 
communications equipment an emergency medical facility and 
special work and rest areas for the president his staff the 
secret service and the news media

the congressional record is the verbatim 
record of every word said on the floor of the senate and the house 
except for when it isnt 
it is a congressional privilege to change the congressional 
record when it suits 
sometimes it is only a matter of cleaning up a congressmans 
grammar or misstatements of fact 
changes sometimes involve matters of substance sometimes not 
sometimes they are made to soften a stinging phrase or smooth 
over an embarrassment 
former sen barry goldwater rariz contends in his recently 
published autobiography goldwater that sometimes changes are 
made for reasons of politics 
an example he declares occurred several years ago on the 
morning after a speech by senate democratic leader robert c byrd 
of west virginia 
byrd had goldwater said used some frothy language that 
wasnt particularly fitting for the floor 
i cant recall exactly what he was excited about but his 
anger poured out as if he had just finished a bad jug of west 
virginia moonshine 
god i said to myself ive got to get a copy of that speech 
from the congressional record he said some things that will really 
hurt him well send it along to the republican party in west 
virginia 
but after a linebyline search of the record goldwater said 
byrds remarks were nowhere to be found 
so i went back to the senate reporters room and asked 
wheres all that stuff byrd talked about last night 
oh the reporter said he edited it out 
goldwaters conclusion today some senators operate regularly 
on this double standard saying one thing on the floor to capture 
state or media attention but deleting it from the official record 
so their precise remarks cannot be used against them 
changes large and small are made in the record virtually 
daily 
a dispute flared on the house floor last week during 
consideration of legislation to require a study of the federal pay 
system to determine if women are being paid less than men for 
comparable work 
rep mary rose oakar dohio told rep dan burton rind that 
the reason he did not know a detail about the bill was that he 
rarely bothered to attend meetings of the house post office and 
civil service committee which had considered it 
burton said he served on many other committees and had higher 
priorities and listening to the gentlewoman from ohio at these 
meetings is not one of my top priorities 
rep gerald solomon rny angrily intervened accusing the 
congresswoman of smartaleck remarks 
after an intervening vote rep mervyn m dymally dcalif 
demanded that solomon apologize 
but here the words he said and the words recorded in the 
congressional record part company 
what dymally was heard to say and what he did say as confirmed 
by a review of the television tape of the proceedings was 
if there is any decency left in the gentleman he will come to 
the floor here and ask that those words be stricken from the 
record 
perhaps that was too strong 
the congressional record version if there is any courtesy 
left in the gentleman he will come to the floor here and ask that 
those words be stricken from the record 
in the end courtesy did prevail 
the gentleman from new york already had apologized the 
gentlewoman from ohio said

michael dukakis and george bush are sticking 
by plans to meet in a second presidential debate later this month 
despite the league of women voters withdrawal as sponsors in a 
dispute over control of format and other details 
the bipartisan commission on presidential debates sponsors of 
the first presidential debate and wednesdays debate between vice 
presidential nominees quickly stepped in monday and agreed to take 
over sponsorship 
there is going to be a second presidential debate said bush 
spokesman mark goodin 
the second debate viewed as an opportunity for dukakis as he 
trails bush in most polls was scheduled to be held in los angeles 
on oct 13 or 14 depending on the length of the american league 
baseball playoffs the campaigns said they would stick to those 
dates 
janet brown executive director of the commission said it hoped 
to keep the debate in los angeles and was seeking local groups to 
help it finance preparations which the league had estimated at 
500000 
but the league of women voters has rights to the shrine memorial 
auditorium in los angeles where it was scheduled and vicky 
harian the leagues debates director said i doubt very 
seriously it would relinquish its rights 
all sides said they would look elsewhere if a los angeles site 
cannot be arranged 
i want to go forward in los angeles dukakis said the 
agreement with the bush campaign provides that if for some reason 
the sponsor decides to pull out we still go ahead i want to go 
ahead 
the commission agreed to follow the two campaigns detailed 
agreement for debate format and staging an agreement the league 
denounced as a charade that would stiffle spontaneity and a 
true exchange on the issues 
we have no intention of becoming an accessory to the 
hoodwinking of the american public said nancy m neuman the 
leagues president 
neuman contended the campaigns have so controlled the format 
that questioning by a panel of journalists will be subject to 
very clear restrictions in terms of what they can ask when 
pressed to back up her charge she pointed to script approval 
required for the moderators remarks and to her disagreement with 
the pattern for followup questions by the panel and rebuttal by 
the candidates 
in a printed statement she did not read at her news conference 
neuman said the agreement would perpetrate a fraud on the 
american voter and add debates to their list of campaigntrail 
charades devoid of substance spontaneity and honest answers to 
tough questions 
but the commission director rejected suggestions the format was 
too controlled and pointed to the success of the first debate 
the leagues involvement in 1988 debates has been long at issue 
spurred in part by discontent with the leagues sponsorship of 
debates in previous presidential elections the republican and 
democratic parties joined with the bipartisan commission on 
presidential debates to sponsor them this year 
but sponsorship itself became one of the items at issue in 
hardball debate negotiations between the dukakis and bush 
campaigns the campaigns ultimately agreed to two debates one 
sponsored by the commission and one by the league plus a vice 
presidential debate under commission sponsorship 
at her news conference neuman acknowledged that at the heart of 
their dispute was the leagues lack of involvement in the agreement 
the issue is whos in control of the debate she said 
bush campaign officials privately belittled the leagues 
complaints as nitpicking items and denied an attempt to control 
questioning 
one bush campaign source speaking on condition of anonymity 
said the leagues action guarantees theyre out of the debate 
business for good they made the mistake of misunderstanding their 
role

iran is reorganizing its military forces 
and seeking advanced weapons in the wake of disasterous defeats in 
the war with iraq that forced it to accept a united 
nationssponsored ceasefire 
the reconstruction of the armed forces has a very high 
priority in the overall postwar reconstruction program defense 
minister brig gen mohammad hussein jalali stressed last week 
the army and the revolutionary guards corps must definitely be 
strengthened he said in an interview with tehrans kayhan daily 
this does not mean reinforcement for an offensive but rather 
the prevention of probable aggression and for defense 
asked if irans unconditional acceptance of the un security 
councils ceasefire resolution will ease a usled arms embargo 
that caused major problems during the 8year war jalali replied 
not yet 
but there have been some signs the world has now realized 
that irans cause has been genuine 
diplomatic sources have said that the iranians are badly short 
of combat aircraft tanks radar and other sophisticated weaponry 
even before the iraqi victories the iranians were believed to 
be chronically short of heavy weapons 
the iraqis claim they captured much of irans operational armor 
in a series of offensives between april and august that retook all 
the territory the iranians had seized in the previous six years 
us sources in the persian gulf reported that when the iraqis 
scored one of their key battlefield victories shortly before july 
20 the iranians hastily withdrew tanks based on sirri and abu musa 
islands in the southern gulf and rushed them to the front 
one source said the move showed how desperate the iranians 
were for supplies and weapons they didnt have much of anything 
left 
the speed with which the iranians were driven back surprised 
even the iraqis iranian resistance mainly by the revolutionary 
guards appeared to collapse rapidly as the iraqis regained the 
offensive after years of static defense 
the iranians abrupt acceptance of un resolution 598 the 
basis for the aug 20 ceasefire stunned many iranians including 
the military said businessmen who were in tehran at the time 
several of the young men in my family were at the front and 
they couldnt believe it said one iranian in nicosia to attend 
a seminar 
they knew things werent going well but they were absolutely 
speechless they couldnt understand how it all caved in so fast 
some were relieved that the dying was over but some were extremely 
bitter 
they argued that if we were going to accept resolution 598 
why didnt we do it while we still occupied iraqi territory while 
we had something to bargain with a lot of people are asking such 
questions the businessman said speaking on condition he was not 
identified 
there have been indications that the revolutionary guards known 
as pasdaran have been blamed for irans defeats 
the corps was originally formed as a paramilitary force to 
safeguard the islamic revolution but it was thrust into a military 
role by iraqs invasion in september 1980 and eventually eclipsed 
the regular army which had been built up by the shah and was 
distrusted by the hierarchy 
irans parliament last month dismissed mohsen rafiqdoust the 
government minister in charge of the corps he was replaced by ali 
shamkhani 33 deputy commander of the corps ground forces 
but iranian leaders have publicly defended the pasdaran 
ayatollah ruhollah khomeini told corps commanders at a military 
seminar last month you are my closest and dearest aides 
a unified military command set up by parliament speaker hashemi 
rafsanjani named acting commanderinchief by khomeini last june 
in a bid to reverse irans battlefield defeats has been reshaping 
the armed forces 
the reorganization has centered on the 350000strong 
revolutionary guards 
but moves to merge the guards with the 200000man regular army 
have been shelved 
the pasdaran have become very powerful and theyre not going 
to surrender that easily one western analyst noted 
but the parallel chains of command that so bedeviled the 
iranians during the war have been streamlined to produce what 
rafsanjani hopes will be a more cohesive iranian military machine 
rafsanjani told the pasdaran that they must temper their islamic 
zeal with conventional military training and discipline 
you must pay attention to the hierarchy and to orders 
rafsanjani cautioned them

mention rep newt gingrich to stalwarts of the 
democratic party and they vow through gritted teeth to do 
everything in their power to unseat the georgia republican 
youve got a guy in georgia whos trying to destroy the 
democratic party said rep beryl anthony dark chairman of 
the house democratic congressional campaign committee thats his 
sole mission in life theres a price to pay for that and the 
price is return to the private sector 
traditionally the dccc has come to the aid of promising 
democratic challengers providing campaign funds and advice but in 
david worleys campaign to replace gingrich the committee is 
leaving no stone unturned 
in january the dccc filed mail fraud charges against gingrich 
and a political action committee he heads conservatives for hope 
and opportunity the complaint to the us postal service received 
widespread publicity but no action was taken against gingrich or 
the pac 
then in may on the same day gingrich filed an ethics complaint 
against house speaker jim wright dtexas the committee accused 
the georgia republican of accepting 13000 from a group of wealthy 
friends in 1977 to write a book he never produced 
the object of the committees attention is a conservative 
fiveterm representative who does not shrink from the opportunity 
to attack democrats 
gingrich has accused wright of improperly using his position for 
financial gain including the allegation that the house speaker 
made unduly high royalties on his book a house ethics committee is 
investigating the complaints 
and last month gingrich called democratic presidential nominee 
michael dukakis nuts and accused the candidate of being a 
leftwinger who opposes weapons systems supported by republican 
george bush 
the dukakis campaign dismissed gingrichs comments as typical 
of his nasty approach 
gingrichs opponent for the house seat worley is a 
29yearold attorney from jonesboro making his first bid for public 
office 
after a close democratic primary win in august worley received 
5000 from the committee to pay off his primary debts and the 
promise of another 5000 for the fall campaign 
the amount is the maximum the committee can provide in direct 
contributions but legally it also can give up to 40000 in 
coordinated expenditures for such services as polling and voter 
identification anthony said that amount would be determined by the 
committees ongoing assessment of worleys chances of defeating 
gingrich 
in his campaign arsenal worley has incorporated the committees 
charges of mail fraud and the book allegations against gingrich as 
well as a claim that gingrich wants to abolish social security 
that allegation stems from a plan gingrich proposed which calls 
for people under 40 to get no social security retirement but 
require them to put 10 percent of their incomes into individual 
retirement accounts 
worley also has accused gingrich of missing 70 percent of his 
house committee meetings and of ignoring the concerns of his 
constituents while traveling the country to promote his own 
conservative agenda 
gingrich acknowledges that he is potentially vulnerable on that 
issue but said the voters in his suburban atlanta district 
understand that his role as a national spokesman for the gop right 
helps him better represent them in congress 
i think thats what you want in a congressman to take local 
problems and understand their national implications and speak out 
on how we can change things in america so that we are changing 
things in the 6th district gingrich said 
anthony said worley is beginning to score some good points 
against gingrich but he conceded that a democratic victory in 
november would be an upset 
and if worley fails theres always 1990 anthony said 
sometimes it takes a fouryear effort to knock off an 
incumbent he said

libyas decision to reestablish diplomatic 
relations with westernbacked chad is another sign that col 
moammar gadhafi is moving toward moderation or at least wants to 
be seen that way 
the libyan leader has been having a hard time removing the label 
of terrorism attached to his regime just last week the top us 
antiterrorism official accused libya of continuing to support abu 
nidal a palestinian blamed for engineering several spectacular 
attacks including a commando strike this summer on a greek cruise 
ship that killed nine people 
gadhafi is keen on improving relations with the united states 
which led a campaign in early 1986 to convince the west to join an 
economic boycott to punish libya for its alleged support of 
international terrorism 
but last friday the west german government cited recent 
positive changes in libya when it announced it is sending an 
ambassador back to tripoli the post had been vacant since spring 
1986 shortly after a bombing of a berlin disco an attack that 
us officials blamed on gadhafi the us administration responded 
with bombing raids on the libyan cities of tripoli and benghazi 
in an interview with the associated press last month gadhafi 
expressed confidence that libyaus relations will improve after 
january when president reagan leaves the white house 
gadhafis turnabout regarding chad is one of several foreign and 
domestic changes indicating that he may have decided that he will 
get more mileage out of moderation than intransigence 
in dealing with chad for example gadhafi passed from a 
policy of conquest to negotiation commented a european diplomat 
who has been monitoring developments in libya for years 
after years of bitter fighting in the deserts of northern chad 
libya and chad announced on monday that they have restored 
diplomatic relations and said they will settle their border dispute 
in a responsible and understanding manner 
in the interview with the ap on sept 5 gadhafi said he was 
willing to negotiate on the status of the aouzou strip a 
45000squaremile stretch of land possibly rich in minerals that 
borders the two countries 
more than once libya had labeled chads president hissene habre 
as a stooge of imperialist france and the united states which 
backed chad in the conflict 
the diplomat said gadhafis foreign policy had been feeling the 
influence of libyan prime minister omar almuntasser considered a 
moderate he was named to the post in a cabinet shuffle earlier 
this year 
a west german foreign ministry official in explaining why bonn 
decided to upgrade its diplomatic relations cited gadhafis 
freeing of many chadian prisoners this summer as well as internal 
reforms 
this year gadhafi has called for the abolitin of the death 
penalty in libya freed some political prisoners from libyan jails 
and loosened economic restrictions even giving his blessing to 
black market enterprises 
gadhafi has been paying special attention to forging solid ties 
with his north african neighbors he restored relations with 
tunisia in december after a twoyear hiatus following libyas 
expulsion of more than 30000 immigrant workers looming largely in 
that move were economic considerations libya depends heavily on 
the workers for farm and other manual labor 
economic considerations also figure in libyas links with 
western european countries for example wanting to expand its 
economic base beyond crude oil sales libya recently opened up a 
chain of gasoline distributorships in italy 
as for west germany libya is its no 2 oil supplier after 
britain 
terrorism remains the biggest hurdle in gadhafis proclaimed 
quest for better foreign relations 
we hope that has changed for the better but we will have to 
wait and see said the foreign ministry official last week 
west berlin authorities have said they have no concrete 
indications that libya was involved in the disco attack and said 
they suspect syria instead 
the reagan administration is firm on holding gadhafi to blame 
for many major terrorist attacks 
its no 1 counterterrorism official l paul bremer said last 
week that the 1986 us bombing raids and western pressure has 
caused libya to drive the terrorism into different channels 
so that instead of using diplomats and business gadhafi is 
doing it more through surrogates like abu nidal and the japanese 
red army a terrorist group which claimed the bombing a club in 
naples italy in april a us servicewoman was killed 
gadhafi denies he sponsors terrorism but abu nidal is reported 
frequently in tripoli

president roh taewoo today hailed the 
olympic games as a major turning point in koreas history and 
declared he would launch new efforts to reunite the peninsula and 
build full democracy 
in a speech to the national assembly roh said he would keep an 
election promise to let voters pass judgment on how well his 
government has kept its promise of democratic reforms but he did 
not say what form the assessment would take 
roh said the olympics which ended sunday were a major success 
for south korea and would help provide impetus for further progress 
we are opening a new chapter of history in which korea should 
achieve both unification and prosperity and emerge as a major 
player on the world scene in the 21st century he said 
the peninsula was divided into communist north korea and 
ussupported south korea at the end of world war ii north korea 
invaded south korea in 1950 and a truce in 1953 reestablished a 
demilitarized zone dividing the country 
north korea boycotted the olympics after its demand to cohost 
the games was rejected 
roh in the nationally televised speech said it was time to 
overcome the divisions of the past and called for a major effort to 
build a democratic system and share the nations prosperity 
he said he would present a new plan to build ties with the north 
but gave no details 
roh repeated an offer made in july to visit pyongyang the 
capital of north korea for a summit meeting with president kim il 
sung to discuss all pending issues 
the two koreas are to resume talks oct 13 on trying to reduce 
tension negotiations in august failed to make any progress 
i will endeavor to bring about a spring of reconciliation 
between the south and the north which have remained in a deep 
freeze for 40 years roh said 
the soviet union china and most other communist nations 
participated in the olympics and roh said that provided an 
opportunity for south korea to build ties with the communist world 
that ease tension with the north 
he also said south korea would maintain its close ties with the 
united states japan and other allies the united states is an 
ally with whom we have been defending the peace and freedom of the 
korean peninsula he said 
but roh also said the threat of war with the north still existed 
and the security situation on the korean peninsula and in 
northeast asia remains as grave as ever 
roh vowed to introduce full democracy the authoritarian rule 
that caused public anxiety tension and distrust and strife for the 
past four decades has unmistakably been abolished he said 
he said radical students that have staged frequent 
antigovernment demonstrations were seeking a violent class 
revolution 
they are thus attempting to overthrow our free democratic 
system through violence and other illegal acts such activities 
cannot be tolerated anymore he said 
the president expressed confidence in the countrys economy and 
predicted exports would reach 90 billion by 1992 compared to 
473 billion last year he announced a budget for 1989 of 27 
billion an 11 percent increase

congress is moving to break a decadeslong 
stalemate with legislation that would allow veterans to go outside 
the veterans administration to appeal denial of benefits 
the house voted 4000 monday for a bill that would allow 
veterans for the first time in 170 years to appeal va denials to 
a federal court 
rep don edwards dcalif said arrangements have been worked 
out with the senate to write a compromise bill in a conference 
committee the senate has passed its own version of the legislation 
rep gv montgomery dmiss the chairman of the house 
veterans affairs committee said his panel has been trying to 
change the appeals process since 1952 
standing in the way he said was a lack of consensus among 
veterans groups who are now in agreement 
the house legislation would establish a new court of veterans 
appeals as passed monday the house bill would abolish the 
existing board of veterans appeals part of the va and currently 
the last resort for veterans unhappy with decisions to deny them 
benefits 
edwards said the compromise would retain the board but make it 
independent of the va the court would be established but the 
number of judges would decrease from the 65 envisioned in the house 
bill to seven under the proposed compromise 
decisions of the new court could be appealed to the existing 
us court of appeals for the federal circuit on any legal matter 
but not on factual findings 
the legislation also would end a civil warera law that limits 
attorneys fees for veterans claims to 10 per claim making it 
difficult for veterans to hire lawyers other than those provided by 
the va 
the house bill would prohibit attorneys from charging any fee in 
connection with an application for benefits however once the va 
denies a claim a veteran could hire and pay a reasonable fee to a 
lawyer 
a copy of the fee agreement must be filed with the new court 
which could order a fee reduction if a judge finds the amount 
excessive

employers must have proof of potential fetal 
damage before they can fire or refuse to hire pregnant or fertile 
women in jobs with exposures to toxic chemicals or radiation under 
new federal guidelines 
a policy that expressly excludes women on the basis of 
pregnancy or capacity to become pregnant on its face discriminates 
against women on the basis of sex in violation of a 1982 
amendment to the civil rights act the equal employment opportunity 
commission said monday 
to justify such exclusions the eeoc said employers must support 
their decisions with reputable objective scientific evidence 
that a hazard adversely affects the potential offspring only 
through the female parent and not the male 
this approach prevents unnecessary limitations on womens 
employment opportunities while preserving the employers and 
societys legitimate interest in protecting the health of 
offspring the commission said in an 11page policy directive to 
its enforcement officials 
the commission addressed the issue amid a growing log of court 
cases and estimates that as many as 15 million to 20 million jobs 
in the country expose workers to chemicals that might cause 
reproductive injuries 
in addition new high tech industries are posing previously 
unsuspected hazards video display workers and semiconductor 
manufacturers in particular are suspected of being at risk from 
exposure to reproductive hazards the commission said 
while evidence so far of reproductive risks is largely 
inconclusive the commission said the same impulse that has led 
some employers to exaggerate the risks of employing handicapped 
workers can also lead to exaggeration of risks to offspring 
citing estimates that 58 percent of all women in the country 
will be employed by the year 1990 the eeoc said less than 9 
percent of those fertile will be pregnant in any given year and 
for women over age 30 in bluecollar jobs the pregnancy rate is 
less than 2 percent 
moreover even some fertile women for a variety of reasons 
including celibacy sexual orientation or relations with a 
nonfertile male are at little or no risk of becoming pregnant 
the commission said 
the commission told its enforcement officers that employers can 
be excluded from sex bias charges if their exclusion policies are 
limited only to the extent necessary to protect employees 
offspring from reproductive or fetal hazard 
for example some mutagens can be equally hazardous to 
reproduction whether it is the father or mother who is exposed 
before conception a policy prohibiting employment of women but 
not men because of potential exposure to mutagens would thus be 
illegal 
furthermore most toxins pose the greatest risk during the first 
eight weeks of pregnancy but others such as lead pose the greatest 
risk after the first trimester because the placenta is not yet 
operating the commission said 
those types of factors relying on other agencies such as the 
occupational safety and health administration and the nuclear 
regulatory commission for guidance should be taken into account 
in weighing sex discrimination complaints the commission said 
it also instructed its investigators to weigh on a casebycase 
basis whether there were less discriminatory alternatives such as 
protective equipment or temporary job transfers available to reduce 
a fetal hazard

george bush suffered his deepest 
embarrassment at the very beginning of the campaign in a 
humiliating thirdplace showing in the snows of iowa but 
politicians of both parties concede hes rebounded and has become 
competitive 
its a horse race now said iowa republican chairman michael 
mahaffey voicing a general consensus that the race with democrat 
michael dukakis is a virtual tossup in the state 
george bush is very highly competitive there is no doubt in 
my mind about that said democratic sen tom harkin 
dukakis is still favored in iowa minnesota and wisconsin in the 
upper midwest according to an associated press survey of political 
leaders independent analysts and public opinion polls 
but the degree to which bush has gained momentum in iowa is 
remarkable in a state where gop strategists only a couple of months 
ago were publicly worrying that a bush disaster would ripple down 
the ticket and damage congressional and legislative candidates 
his poor showing in the feb 8 precinct caucuses coupled with a 
droughtstarved farm economy caused democratic glee and even 
brought three campaign stops from dukakis though the state has 
only eight electoral votes 
the tenor has changed 
republicans are euphoric said larry pope a drake 
university law professor who maps gop legislative election tactics 
our candidates chances are improving because of bushs chances 
from a more than 21 deficit in june the latest poll published 
by the des moines register showed bush trailing only 47 percent to 
42 percent just after the republican convention 
that comeback caps a drive that began in the winter when bush 
was crushed by senate minority leader bob dole and even ran behind 
television evangelist pat robertson 
politicians offer a variety of reasons for bushs resurgence 
with many reminding that dukakis didnt fare all that well in the 
precinct caucuses either running third behind missouri rep 
richard gephardt and illinois sen paul simon 
bush they argue is no longer running against midwesterner 
dole but faces easterner dukakis 
george bush and the republican party are a pretty known 
quantity and mike dukakis isnt said george wittgraf who runs 
bushs efforts in the state 
others argued that the wounds are only now beginning to heal 
among gop activists who waged an intense and occasionally bitter 
campaign but pope said bush is recovering from the bashing 
inflicted by the democrats not his fellow republicans 
others argued that bush suffered because his close attachment to 
president reagan whose farm policies have drawn criticism in iowa 
reagan is not popular in iowa and bushs attachment was a real 
problem during the winter pope said as bush has developed his 
own persona hes gotten stronger in iowa 
that strength is even more visible in the farm states of kansas 
and nebraska which borders on iowa according to the ap survey 
democrats also concede dukakis is probably slightly behind in 
neighboring missouri dukakis seems to be favored in the dakotas 
democratic consultant paulee lipsman argued that the bush forces 
in iowa were jolted into a new campaign style by their winter 
surprise they werent going to make the same mistake twice 
she said 
mahaffey however noted that iowa hasnt backed a democratic 
presidential candidate since the 1964 lyndon johnson landslide 
there is still some inclination of iowans at the presidential 
level to vote for republicans mahaffey said i dont want to 
say its a republican state

in what could be a major step toward gene 
therapy a federal advisory board recommended that researchers be 
allowed for the first time to inject genetically altered cells into 
human patients 
if this protocol were to work id expect that within six to 
12 months there could be a proposal to do a gene therapy 
experiment said dr william j gartland the executive secretary 
of the recombinant dna advisory committee to the national 
institutes of health 
the goal of gene therapy a much more controversial matter is 
to treat a genetic disease by replacing a defective or missing gene 
that causes an inherited illness the proposed experiment would not 
be gene therapy but would use many of the same techniques 
the advisory committee on monday voted 165 in favor of the 
proposal to inject genetically altered cells into patients to 
determine how well a certain form of cancer therapy is working a 
socalled marker gene would be put into a patients cells in the 
lab and then placed back inside the patient the experiment would 
not attempt to fight the cancer but would track the genetically 
altered cells carrying the altered genes gartland said 
the experiment would be limited to 10 patients and those 
patients would have life expectations of only about 90 days due to 
the advancement of their cancer he said 
nih director dr james b wyngaarden and the food and drug 
administration still must approve the proposal before it is carried 
out 
due to the split in the vote a decision from wyngaarden will 
probably take a couple of months gartland said the nih 
director will probably want to know why those five people voted 
against it 
the main concern for those who opposed the experiment he said 
was what theyre using is a virus to infect the patients cells 
and put the marker in the patients cells the concern is that the 
virus itself could make the patients sick even though the virus 
ability to be infectious would be removed before it is placed in 
the cell 
the people who submitted the protocol feel it is not dangerous 
and that theyve completed enough of the safety testing to say 
that gartland said there are some people on the committee who 
have some reservations about it but these are very terminally ill 
patients with cancer so its probably a safe procedure in these 
circumstances 
under an already established procedure researchers can remove 
tumor cells from a cancer patient and grow them in the laboratory 
he said when the cells are put back in the patient they tend to 
return to attack the tumor they used to be a part of 
in the past these cells have been labeled with a radioactive 
isotope so researchers could track them when they are inside the 
patient 
the problem is the radioisotope is a shortlived isotope and 
they would like to be able to follow these cells that they put back 
into the patient for a longer period of time he said 
the radioisotope has a halflife of 11 days he said by 
comparison the proposed antibiotic resistant gene would be 
traceable for months he said 
to trace those genes researchers would use a probe to biopsy 
the tumor and see if the cells removed included those marked with 
the different gene he said 
theyre trying to find out how well the tumorfighting cells 
go back to the tumor they were taken from and how long they 
persist he said with this technique they could monitor them 
for longer periods of time 
although the notion of gene therapy has triggered controversy 
gartland said the proposal at nih is in some ways less 
controversial because the gene here is just a marker its a 
more benign step than gene therapy 
the proposal by dr w french anderson of the national heart 
lung and blood institute would be carried out by that institute 
along with the national cancer institute

thousands of american coal miners are not 
compensated for black lung disease because the labor department 
used an arbitrary cutoff in deciding who can get benefits a lawyer 
for the miners said 
the denials were contrary to the intent of a 1977 federal law 
intended to make it easier for miners to receive disability 
payments attorney paul march smith told the supreme court on 
monday 
smith asked the justices to uphold a march 1987 ruling in which 
the 8th us circuit court of appeals ordered the labor department 
to review claims of some miners who were denied benefits in the 
late 1970s and early 1980s 
the order applied to black lung disease victims who had worked 
less than 10 years in the mines and who had failed to exhaust 
administrative remedies or had missed deadlines for filing court 
appeals 
coal mine operators have said the appellate court ruling could 
cost the industry 136 billion in additional payments if it is 
applied nationwide 
the government estimates that 94000 cases could be 
reviewed smith said not all of those would get black lung 
payments but it is in the several tens of thousands that would 
benefit 
miners afflicted with black lung disease or pneumoconiosis a 
lung disorder caused by breathing coal dust for a long period of 
time receive compensation for their disability through a special 
fund administered by the federal government 
smith argued that congress ordered the labor department in 1977 
to come up with new criteria for determining eligibility for 
benefits because too many claims were being denied and ordered it 
to review using the new standards claims which it rejected 
previously 
some longtime miners then received benefits but smith said the 
department refused to approve claims for less experienced miners 
unless they provided indisputable evidence that their disability 
was caused by onthejob exposure to coal dust 
the reviews were meaningless he said if they didnt have 
10 years in the mine they were categorically excluded from 
benefits it was giving with the right hand and taking away 
with the left 
lawyers representing the federal government and mining companies 
argued that no miners who deserve benefits are being denied black 
lung disease payments 
the department of labor delivered billions of dollars of 
benefits to hundreds of thousands of claimants many of whom do not 
have black lung disease said mark e solomons a lawyer for the 
coal companies 
donald b ayer the deputy solicitor general for the justice 
department said congress wanted miners to get fair treatment but 
it opposed payment of benefits unless the disability was proven 
through a careful medical review 
the supreme court is expected to announce a decision sometime 
next year

chileans stocked up on foodstuffs 
candles batteries and other basics before wednesdays referendum 
on rightwing gen august pinochets presidency fearing that 
violence may follow the vote 
i know nothing and dont care about politics but i dont want 
to go hungry said delia maluf a middleaged housewife at a 
supermarket in providencia a fashionable residential neighborhood 
several supermarket managers reported a steep rise in buying in 
recent days but said the situation did not seem extreme 
id call it worry buying not panic buying alejandro baeza 
manager of the unimarc supermarket in the southern santiago 
middleclass neighborhood of la florida said 
shoppers were reported purchasing mostly nonperishable 
foodstuffs fearful they will be left without refrigerators since 
blackouts are a common occurrence in chile in times of political 
tension 
candles flashlights and batteries were in high demand the 
managers said at least one manager reported his store had run out 
of candles by the weekend 
opposition leaders and roman catholic church sources said monday 
they are afraid that progovernment agents may provoke violence 
during the referendum in which pinochet seeks eight more years in 
power 
several polls have put the opposition ahead of the former coup 
leader 
in washington us state department spokesperson phyllis oakley 
expressed the reagan administrations serious concern over the 
alleged plans to call off the balloting 
a 16party opposition coalition said in a written statement that 
it had evidence pinochet supporters planned blackouts and clashes 
with the people to interfere in the delivery of voting results 
church officials who spoke on condition of anonymity also said 
they learned of possible plans for violence in a bid to make the 
votes results invalid 
in addition the military government has repeatedly warned of 
purported plans by communists and other radical leftists to trigger 
disruptions on the day of the vote but it gave assurances it will 
maintain order 
the government has also stressed the acute food shortages that 
occurred during the leftist government ousted by the military in 
1973 hinting that a similar situation may develop in the event of 
an opposition victory in referendum voting 
in the referendum 74 million registered voters are to vote 
yes or no on a proposal by the military commanders that 
pinochet remain in power until 1997 
if a majority vote yes the 72yearold ruler will start a 
new eightyear term next march if most vote no an open 
presidential election will be called and he must hand power over to 
the winner in march 1990 
several shoppers in santiago supermarkets admitted they were 
worried over what may happen and were doing some emergency buying 
in the stores 
some shopkeepers said the date at the beginning of the month 
may also be a factor in increased shopping activity since most 
workers were just paid their salaries but they acknowledged the 
increase was well above previous months 
supermakets reported sales increased from 25 to 100 percent in 
recent days 
sales in our stores have doubled since midlast week said 
ivan jara manager of marmentini letelier a chain of lowprice 
supermarkets with five stories in middle and workingclass 
neighborhoods 
marta bueno a mother of six buying at one supermarket said 
im worried you hear so many things im especially worried about 
the children among other supplies she bought six twokilogram 
44 pound cans of powdered milk 
lautaro alvarez a 44yearold computer specialist said he was 
making additional purchases because if things get ugly afterward 
i dont want my wife to go out in the street 
several supermarket operators said they had to reorganize their 
stocking schedules but were having no supply problems 
suppliers are speeding up deliveries when necessary said 
ricardo ulloa executive of one of chiles largest supermarkets he 
said his sales have gone up by 30 percent during the last 10 days 
or so

most food prices stayed fairly level this 
summer despite the drought that hammered us croplands but 
sizeable increases were recorded for a few products according to 
consumer advocates 
our survey suggests that in late july and early august there 
was no extensive price gouging stephen brobeck executive 
director of consumer federation of america said in a statement 
released monday but he said there were heavy increases in june 
the group along with washingtonbased public voice for food 
health and policy released initial results of price monitoring they 
said was designed to try to head off droughtrelated price 
gouging 
the agriculture department has been moving to ease concern about 
possible steep price increases as a result of the dry spell 
assistant secretary ewen m wilson has been estimating a 3 percent 
to 5 percent increase in the food price index this year compared to 
a forecast of 2 percent to 4 percent before the picture was altered 
by the broiling sun and shortage of rainfall 
for next year the department has been forecasting 
droughtrelated increases of perhaps 2 percent on top of an 
expected rise of 2 percent to 4 percent in the consumer price index 
for food 
some members of congress have been skeptical the general 
accounting office has been monitoring food prices at the request of 
rep byron dorgan dnd and senate agriculture committee 
chairman patrick leahy dvt 
in unveiling the survey by the consumer groups ellen haas 
executive director of public voice said the first price checks 
give us some reason to be concerned that some food prices may be 
rising contrary to economic experts opinions 
in particular we question recent beef price increases and the 
rapid increase in some wheat products she said 
brobeck said the good news is that between july and august 
most surveyed prices stayed the same or declined 
the bad news is that 29 percent rose and typically these 
increases were quite large he said 
in the survey 14 consumer federation member groups monitored 
prices at major supermarket chains in 16 areas of the country the 
organizations said that comparisons of two sets of prices revealed 
more beef prices rose than fell sirloin prices rose at 35 
percent of the markets and declined at 25 percent of them the 
median increase was 141 cents a pound and the median decrease 90 
cents economists say beef prices should have been falling because 
skyrocketing feed prices accelerated the slaughter 
milk and butter prices were raised more often than lowered in 
the period but the increases were in the range of 3 percent to 5 
percent eighty percent of the stores in the sample did not 
change their price of ice cream 
prices of some wheat products went up faster than expected as 
did those for fresh fruits and vegetables but median price 
decreases for corn and broccoli were typically larger than 
increases even though more stores hiked them than reduced them

it said honduran forces attacked the border observation post in 
murupuchi in northern nuevo segovia province last saturday using 
50mm machinegun fire fal rifles and 10 discharges from m79 
grenade launchers 
there was no immediate response from honduras 
acting foreign minister javier chamorro mora on thursday accused 
honduras of six border incursions and three violations of

the regional peace agreement signed in august 1987 
on saturday vice president sergio ramirez proposed that the 
commission suspend further meetings until after a summit meeting of 
the five central american presidents tentatively scheduled for 
november 
in a letter to obando y bravo ramirez said the commission 
lacks precise definitions and protested an august visit to 
miami by two opposition representatives on the commission to meet 
with rebel officials 
ramirez said that visit was made without the approval of the 
government 
on sunday obando y bravo said he would reflect on ramirezs 
proposal but noted that the commission could continue its work 
without waiting for the presidents to meet 
ferrey told the associated press in miami that the government 
wanted to suspend commission activity in order to curtail 
cardinal obandos voice as a witness to the regimes constant 
violations of the esquipulas ii accords 
the usbacked rebels and the government halted offensive 
military operations on march 21 and concluded a temporary 
ceasefire agreement two days later but each side accuses the 
other of frequent violations and highlevel negotiations on a 
permanent truce to the 7yearold civil war reached a stalemate on

west germans concerned about soviet popularity 
among their fellow citizens have launched a campaign to convince 
young people on both sides of the atlantic of the value of 
uswest european ties 
germanamerican efforts to bridge differences since world war ii 
and stand up to soviet aggression in europe have been an 
unbelievable success story guenter diehl former bonn government 
spokesman and diplomat told key members of congress on monday 
however diehl said younger germans appear oblivious to the 
importance of the accomplishments 
things that we have done are taken for granted including 
the establishment of freedom in much of western europe he said 
the united states is carrying a tremendous burden by 
continuing to station 200000 troops in germany said johannes 
steinhoff a decorated luftwaffe fighter pilot during world war ii 
who subsequently served as an adviser to the north atlantic treaty 
organization 
even though europeans contribute to their own defense us 
support is vital steinhoff said 
steinhoff said there is little appreciation among young people 
for the daring and sacrifice of the american airlift that broke the 
194849 soviet attempt to cut off west berlin from western europe 
diehl and steinhoff at a luncheon announced a newspaper 
advertising campaign in west germany and the united states under 
the slogan friendship in freedom 
the ads featuring criticism of the communistbuilt berlin wall 
and praise for nato for fostering peace and prosperity in western 
europe are aimed at both young people and at reassuring their 
parents who may be suffering from doubts in the wake of soviet 
publicrelations successes 
the ads are to start oct 11 
this initiative was founded by concerned citizens who after 
suffering dictatorship and war came to experience the values of 
friendship in a very personal way said a statement from the 
group 
lee hamilton dind chairman of the house foreign affairs 
subcommittee on europe said he had been startled by public opinion 
poll results from west germany indicating widespread belief that 
the soviet union rather than the united states was the peacemaker 
in europe 
polls in west germany also show that soviet leader mikhail s 
gorbachev draws far more favorable ratings among the general public 
than president reagan 
gorby as we like to call him has been making a 
disarmament proposals every two months and appealing to a natural 
human desire for change said diehl 
gorbachev is following an old soviet strategy of trying to 
neutralize germany he said 
but diehl said the soviets have problems in their public 
relations because of the vast deployment their forces in east 
germany estimated at 380000 troops no one believes the soviet 
claim that they are there to defend against an attack from the 
west he said 
among the founding members of freundshaft in freiheit 
friendship in freedom were diehl the chairman department store 
owner alphons horten vice chairman and banker gernot ernst

transmission of a television documentary about britains elite 
antiterrorist army unit that was to have been aired monday night 
the film will be broadcast in the coming weeks after changes 
are made said a bbc spokesman 
it was approved by eight senior executives and lawyers in the 
bbcs news and current affairs team but was withdrawn saturday 
night after bbc director general michael checkland and his deputy 
john birt decided it needed more work a bbc spokesman said 
the documentary on the topsecret special air services or sas 
was pegged to last months inquest into the march 6 killings by sas 
commandos of three unarmed irish republican army members in the 
british colony of gibraltar the bbc said 
the trio were on a carbomb mission and a gibraltar coroners 
jury in gibraltar ruled friday that the killings were lawful

transmission said the spokesman requesting anonymity he would 
not say what changes were envisaged 
the program by panorama the bbcs premier current affairs 
show considers the issues raised by the gibraltar inquest but 
examines the accountability of the sas primarily in northern

president reagans veto of textile and apparel 
import curbs is headed for a test of muscle in the house with bill 
opponents and supporters both ready for a battle 
we have the best chance that weve ever had for a veto 
override rep butler derrick dsc said monday but he added 
im not sure textile forces have galvanized enough support in 
the face of an energetic administration lobbying campaign 
bill supporters planned to initiate their override attempt today 
reagan described the bill as protectionism at its worst and 
vetoed it on sept 28 industry supporters are now attempting to 
override that veto and pass the bill into law over the presidents 
objections 
designed to protect american industry from foreign competition 
the bill would freeze textile and apparel imports at 1987 levels 
this year and limit growth to 1 percent annually thereafter 
it also would freeze nonrubber footwear imports at 1987 levels 
with no provision for growth later it would guarantee higher 
quotas to countries that buy american farm goods establish a 
oneyear pilot program under which the government would auction off 
import licenses and create a special quota for foreignmade silk 
neckties 
textile forces would have to rally twothirds of the lawmakers 
present and voting to their side to be successful in their override 
effort if they succeeded in doing so in the house they would then 
have to repeat the accomplishment in the senate 
reagan vetoed a similar measure in 1985 and the house the 
following august was unable to muster the twothirds needed to 
override indeed the industry has never been able to obtain such a 
margin in years of skirmishing 
critics of the legislation say they are completely confident 
there will be no override of the presidents veto 
i think it will be sustained said rep sam gibbons dfla 
the chairman of the house ways and means committees trade 
subcommittee and one of the fiercest critics of the legislation 
its a lousy stinking bill that weve voted on five times 
already gibbons said in a telephone interview monday night 
its a lousy stinking piece of selfish economics 
he said the bill is being kept alive by a lobby that lives on 
the myth that foreign competition is driving them out of business 
sponsors of the measure point to a 17 percent growth in imports 
since the start of the decade and add that the situation is getting 
worse they say 29000 jobs were lost in the textile and apparel 
industries last year while textile producers earnings sank 12 
percent in the first quarter of 1988 
opponents say the industry already is heavily protected by 1400 
quotas covering 42 countries and that earnings were up 9 percent 
last year with 21000 new jobs created in an industry that is just 
emerging from a wave of modernization they say import restraints 
would merely trigger retaliation against us exports while raising 
prices and narrowing consumer choices 
the final round of the longrunning battle is being fought 
against a backdrop of presidential and congressional elections in 
the textileproducing areas of the south it is punctuated by 
warnings from some of the bills sponsors that voters fearful of 
losing textile industry jobs will exact a price at the polls for 
the veto 
in any case sen ernest f hollings dsc has already said 
that if the override effort fails he will introduce a new version 
of the import restrictions next year

democratic strategists say the public will 
decide that lloyd bentsen is a better candidate than republican dan 
quayle even if he has trouble getting that across in wednesday 
nights vice presidential debate 
most people have already decided that bentsen is more 
qualified than quayle i dont really believe thats the issue of 
this debate said george christian former press secretary to 
president johnson and a longtime bentsen adviser 
christian was one of about a dozen people prepping bentsen 
monday at an austin hotel for his meeting with quayle bentsen 
planned to travel to the debate city of omaha neb tonight 
bentsen was kept mostly away from reporters his only public 
appearance monday came when he tossed around a football with some 
former university of texas stars at a picture session for the news 
media 
i think were relaxed for it i think were ready for it 
bentsen said was he nervous im not nervous he said 
his staff while expressing great confidence in bentsen said he 
was stuck with the burden of expectations for quayle that are so 
low and quayle is so telegenic that bentsen cant win 
we have enormous confidence that while dan quayle has good 
television skills when it comes to the judgement of which of 
these two men lloyd bentsen and dan quayle and which of these two 
tickets is best qualified bentsen as the advantage said susan 
estrich campaign manager for the democratic ticket 
sure i expect that sen quayle will acquit himself reasonably 
well in this debate format christian said but i dont think 
thats going to detract from the fact that sen bentsen is far more 
qualified by experience and judgment to be a better vice 
president than dan quayle 
campaign press secretary mike mccurry expressed dissatisfaction 
with what he said would be a low standard for measuring quayles 
success 
wed hope the high bar would be set a little higher than being 
passively coherent for 90 minutes he said 
bentsen held a dress rehearsal for the debate on monday with 
rep dennis eckart playing quayle and staffers playing reporters 
he planned to work most of today and part of wednesday reviewing 
and working on strategy for the session mccurry said 
hes clearly very comfortable with the substance of his 
answers said mccurry 
estrich mccurry and others said one of the biggest efforts was 
to get bentsen to boil down his statements to fit into the 
restricting format of a television debate but not a lot of time 
was spent concocting oneliners they said 
i think one thing we found in the last debate frankly is 
that the oneliners were not what made the difference for those 
watching the debate said estrich

rep pat swindall has made the unusual move of 
requesting that he be indicted on all charges that may be under 
consideration by a grand jury in atlanta that is investigating 
drug money laundering 
swindall a republican seeking his third term in congress from 
the suburban atlanta 4th district said he made the request monday 
in a letter to attorney general dick thornburgh because news 
reports based on unnamed federal sources have made it impossible to 
defend himself 
simple justice and fairness demand that i be allowed to prove 
my innocence in a court of law rather than in the media swindall 
said simple justice and fairness also demand that i be allowed 
to prove my innocence before rather than after the nov 8 
elections 
swindall who is locked in a tight reelection battle with 
democrat ben jones said he told thornburgh he is ready able and 
willing to go to trial on the day following the indictment which i 
now request 
justice department spokesman john russell said thornburgh would 
have no response to swindalls request beyond a statement us 
attorney robert barr issued friday in atlanta after swindall 
criticized the investigation and suggested it might be politically 
motivated 
barr said decisions by his office and grand juries in his 
district have never been are not and will never be influenced 
or made on the basis of statements by or pressures from third 
parties including persons who may be subjects of investigations 
he said swindall is free to make any statement he desires 
but all decisions of this office will continue to be handled 
according to well established principles of law 
swindall first was linked publicly to the federal money 
laundering investigation earlier this year when it was disclosed 
that his aug 28 1987 meeting with an undercover federal agent 
posing as a money launderer for underworld figures had been 
videotaped 
swindall was introduced to the undercover agent by charles 
lechasney a former atlanta businessman who was active in 
republican circles lechasney was indicted in january on multiple 
moneylaundering charges stemming from the federal investigation 
swindall testified before the grand jury in february but he has 
not been charged with a crime 
in june atlanta newspapers obtained several tape recordings 
from the investigation and published excerpts from a series of 
conversations between swindall lechasney and the undercover agent 
the tapes showed that swindall continued to pursue negotiations 
for a 850000 home construction loan after being told it might be 
financed with drug money he would be helping to launder he ended 
the negotiations after being told he would have to accept the money 
in person in cash and sign a receipt 
swindall later apologized for his role in the negotiations 
calling it a mistake in judgement but he denied any wrongdoing and 
vowed to continue seeking reelection 
he also asked the house ethics committee to determine if he had 
violated any law or house rule the panel agreed to investigate 
but has not issued a ruling

prospects appear bleak for enactment of a 
legislative package promising parental job leaves child care and a 
crackdown on child pornographers despite its survival of a 
critical test in the senate 
republicans loath to take responsibility for killing the 
childrens agenda joined democrats monday in voting to allow 
the senate to proceed with action on the package 
sen orrin hatch rutah told his gop colleagues they would 
have other chances to halt the triplebarrelled package 
anyone who wants to stop the process can do so he said 
senate republican leader bob dole of kansas said drug abuse and 
tax corrections bills are more urgent priorities for congress to 
complete before it adjourns in a week or two 
but dole added i dont want tomorrow mornings headlines to 
report that republicans are frustrating the efforts of democrats on 
child care legislation or parental leave 
sen christopher dodd dconn sponsor of two of the three 
parts of the package said strengthening the family could help 
lessen drug problems among children later in their lives and he 
described the tax bill as little more than a candy store filled 
with corporate goodies 
im a recipient of some of those goodies in my state but 
youll never convince me that that bill is more important than 
parental leave or child care dodd said 
senate majority leader robert byrd dwva said he was trying 
to get an agreement for quick action on the childrens package 
despite a multitude of gop amendments in the wings 
the elements of the package include 
dodds parental and medical leave bill guaranteeing employees 
of firms with more than 50 workers at least 10 weeks of unpaid 
jobprotected leave on the birth adoption or serious illness of a 
child or the serious illness of the employee the us chamber of 
commerce and other business interests opposed to mandated benefits 
are waging a fierce drive against the bill 
a child pornography and obscenity measure creating new crimes 
and punishments in those areas in order to help prosecutors crack 
down on people who sell distribute produce or possess such 
materials sponsored by sen strom thurmond rsc it was added 
to the dodd measure 970 last week 
a 25 billion child care bill aimed at helping lowincome 
americans pay for child care expanding the supply of child care 
and assuring minimum standards of health safety staff training 
and staff ratios at child care homes and centers a compromise 
reached by hatch and dodd it would later include an increase in 
the earned income tax credit for poor families 
once approved the package would have to go the house if the 
house didnt pass the same version negotiators would have to work 
out the differences but byrd insisted there was still time for the 
childrens bills to clear the 100th congress due to adjourn this 
weekend or next weekend

the department of energy in a turnaround 
acknowledged it had received reports from du pont co about nuclear 
reactor accidents at the savannah river plant in south carolina 
over a 28year period 
on friday department officials had said they hadnt known about 
the accidents 
c anson franklin assistant secretary for congressional 
intergovernmental and public affairs at the energy department said 
monday that du pont had notified the energy department and its 
predecessor agency the atomic energy commission of the incidents 
the issue here was whether some information had been withheld 
from the department of energy and there had been some suggestions 
that it had been franklin said we looked into that today and 
found that any such suggestions would be incorrect 
the new york times reported in todays editions on the new 
energy department positions 
the safety of the savannah river reactors operated by du pont 
for the department of energy came under heavy criticism at a 
congressional hearing friday 
a 1985 memorandum disclosed at the hearing listed 30 incidents 
at the five savannah river reactors between 1957 and 1985 they 
included one in which fuel rods melted and another in which a chain 
reaction nearly went out of control 
energy department officials said friday that they had not been 
aware of the series of incidents but du pont issued a statement 
sunday saying it had notified the government of the incidents 
through the formal reactor incident reporting system 
du pont said it has provided daily and monthly operations 
reports to doe maintained a formal reactor incident reporting 
system since 1957 provided semiannual summary reports of reactor 
incidents to du pont and doe management for the past 20 years and 
shared reactor incident report information with the news media 
franklin said the reports on the incidents were filed with the 
regional office in aiken sc but the information apparently 
never got to the energy secretary or other top energy officials in 
washington 
its hard to say at this point this many years after the 
events how the information was handled at the department of 
energy franklin said 
asked whether such a problem could occur today franklin said 
all significant incidents would be reported to headquarters

with discovery back from the first 
postchallenger mission nasa is aiming to accelerate its launch 
schedule to 14 flights by 1993 when it hopes to begin building a 
space station 
but the agency insists it will never again put schedules ahead 
of safety 
the rogers commission that investigated the challenger explosion 
in 1986 criticized nasa for putting too much pressure on itself to 
meet a tight launch schedule and said that could lead to lapses in 
safety 
the shuttle missions are booked up to the horizon shuttle 
director richard truly said following discoverys return to earth 
on monday our job is to safely build the launch rate up so we 
can meet that challenge 
but if we find its not safe to launch 14 we wont do it 
he said 
the next shuttle flight is set for late november when atlantis 
will be launched on a secret defense department mission 
seven flights are planned next year 10 in 1990 9 in 1991 and 
13 in 1992 
starting in 1993 the national aeronautics and space 
administration hopes to launch the first of 22 flights over four 
years to carry up segments of a permanent manned space station 
the schedules in 1992 and beyond will require a fourth shuttle 
now being built to replace challenger destroyed in an explosion 32 
months ago 
discoverys flight received intense worldwide attention because 
it was the first postchallenger mission it will be far different 
for the atlantis liftoff in late november 
because the spacecraft will be carrying a classified defense 
department payload the pentagon will try to shroud it in as much 
secrecy as possible but as officials learned on two earlier 
military shuttle missions its difficult to do that when thousands 
of people who are used to an open nasa policy work on a program 
that is highly visible 
discovery will be returned here sunday ferried atop a boeing 
747 jetliner to be readied for a flight scheduled for feb 18 it 
will carry a tracking and data relay satellite identical to one 
deployed from its cargo bay six hours after launch last thursday 
here is the rest of nasas schedule for 1989 
april 28 crew of atlantis to dispatch the magellan spacecraft 
which is to orbit venus and map its surface 
july 1 columbia on a classified defense department mission 
aug 10 discovery on a classified defense department mission 
oct 12 crew of atlantis to dispatch the galileo spacecraft to 
orbit the planet jupiter and drop a scientific probe into its 
atmosphere 
nov 13 crew of columbia to deploy a communications satellite 
and retrieve for return to earth a research satellite placed in 
orbit on a 1984 shuttle mission

when he retired from the state 
police last december lt robert l beadle was a 23year veteran 
with expertise in child abuse cases 
four months later he found himself on the other side of the 
fence charged with raping two girls one 11 years old the other 
13 
two juries acquitted beadle in august and september but the 
verdicts havent ended his personal trial 
beadle 52 says being accused of the very crime he dedicated 
part of his life to solving will always haunt him 
the only way im going to clear my name is to go out and catch 
the guy who committed these crimes and ive already started my 
investigation he said in an interview friday at his home in this 
northern michigan city 
state police investigators say that although the case is closed 
they still have serious questions about beadle who also has faced 
two indecent exposure charges in the past year 
i still believe hes the culprit detective lt richard n 
coleman said at state police headquarters in lansing 
beadle became a suspect in the rapes last november after he was 
involved in a car accident troopers investigating the accident 
who worked with him in traverse city found a composite sketch of 
the rape suspect in his car and thought it odd because the rapes 
occurred 200 miles to the southeast in lapeer county 
beadle said the sketch was given to him by the commander of a 
state police post in caro who asked beadle to be on the lookout 
for the suspect while visiting relatives in lapeer county his 
claim was upheld at trial 
the troopers also noticed a resemblance between the sketch and 
beadle and asked him to be photographed for a photo lineup both 
girls independently identified beadle as their assailant from the 
lineup 
when i retired i thought i was cleared beadle said i 
was shocked when they called me up a few months later and said they 
had two threecount warrants waiting for me 
you cant imagine the humiliation of having to go down to the 
same police post where i had gone in as an expert in police report 
writing and now going in to be fingerprinted and mugged with 
everybody staring at me saying how could you do such a horrible 
thing to two little girls 
beadle claims the other individuals in the photo lineups looked 
nothing like the description the girls gave of their assailant 
after the rapes in october 1986 and april 1987 
police deny that but concede beadles photo was the only one 
that appeared in both lineups 
besides the victims identification there was little else to 
connect beadle to the crimes several witnesses most of them 
relatives testified that beadle was at home on the weekends of the 
attacks 
the lapeer county prosecutor declined to comment but state 
police detectives in charge of the case said they believed both 
juries would have convicted beadle had there been evidence placing 
him in lapeer county 
we had two eyewitnesses that say he is the one that assaulted 
them and the law says in a rape situation thats enough 
detective sgt chet wilson said 
beadle said he retired in december because he was frustrated 
with his job 
two months earlier he was charged with exposing himself to two 
young girls near a school in portage in southern michigan he 
pleaded no contest in january to a reduced charge of disorderly 
obscene conduct and paid a 1000 fine kalamazoo county prosecutor 
mark courtade said 
in february beadle was charged with indecent exposure in 
wexford county which is near traverse city the charge was dropped 
due to insufficient evidence and the pending charges in lapeer 
prosecutor david hogg said 
beadles defense attorney roger wotila said beadle was 
undergoing counseling at the time the rape charges were brought 
against him but declined to elaborate 
beadles wife shirley 54 and three daughters have stuck by 
him throughout the ordeal some 80 friends have written letters of 
support but others have turned their backs on the family

a crowd approaching half a 
million people the secondlargest ever to witness a shuttle 
landing became mired in a traffic jam of galactic proportions as 
they headed home after discoverys triumphant return 
an estimated 109000 cars motor homes trailers and trucks 
carrying about 410000 discovery watchers churned clouds of 
talcumfine dust into the desert air monday as they inched toward 
the only exit from the public viewing area 
it took vehicles 4 hours or longer to cover the mile to the 
exit from the dry lakebed from there traffic crawled along a 
twolane blacktop road at 20 mph 
in addition to the huge crowd at the public viewing area air 
force spokesman lt col george neiss estimated another 15000 to 
20000 viewers watched the landing at a separate vip section 
bringing the total crowd to 425000 or more 
the only larger crowd to watch a shuttle land was on july 4 
1982 when an estimated 500000 turned out as president and nancy 
reagan greeted columbia 
this is crazy said ellery sabin 66 who drove his 33foot 
motor home from ludington mich to see the landing on the mojave 
desert floor ive been around crowds but this is really 
something 
like many shuttle watchers he said discoverys return would 
reinvigorate americas space program 
theres such a sense of pride here sabin said 
two sonic booms announced the shuttles return at 934 am 
eliciting gasps and screams from the crowd 
it sends chills up my spine said 26yearold steve bestwick 
of port hueneme 
vice president george bush california gov george deukmejian 
and famed pilot chuck yeager also were on hand to welcome 
discoverys crew home 
commander rick hauck noted that since waking up monday he had 
circled the globe eight times and crossed the coast of california 
at 120000 feet and traveling eight times the speed of sound 
then he turned to the first man to break the sound barrier and 
said eat your heart out chuck yeager

discovery lost six 
heatshield tiles and sustained some dings during its fourday 
mission one of the most successful flights in the shuttle program 
nasa officials said 
work on the shuttle continued today in a roundtheclock effort 
to prepare the orbiter for its return to cape canaveral fla and 
its next trip into space the piggyback ride home aboard a modified 
boeing 747 is scheduled for saturday 
discovery landed monday morning on the hard clay bed of rogers 
dry lake at this mojave desert air base capping a nearly flawless 
flight that was americas first manned space mission since the 
challenger tragedy in 1986 
six tiles on the right wing are missing they were no problem 
not critical said ted ayers deputy site manager for the 
national aeronautics and space administrations dryden flight 
research facility here 
everythings great because lost tiles only pose a danger if 
they are in an area that undergoes intense heating during reentry 
ayers said 
weve got some normal dings in the tile under the vehicle 
he added these are nicks from dirt particles on the lakebed 
preliminary inspection showed no damage to the shuttles landing 
gear tires or brakes which were improved because of brake and 
tire damage during previous missions he said 
ayers said the shuttle took 7451 feet to roll to a stop when it 
landed at 937 am monday 
after hours of initial work on the lakebed a vehicle towed the 
discovery to the area where nasa workers began preparing it for its 
return to florida 
some of the first efforts included removing experiments from the 
shuttle and shipping them to researchers around the nation ayers 
said 
nasa shuttle boss richard truly said earlier monday that he 
walked around the shuttle after it landed 
it looks beautiful he said there is not a lot of tile 
work to be done 
discovery commander rick hauck said that during the flight the 
shuttle was like a welloiled machine 
tasks to prepare discovery for the trip home include 
deactivating fuel cells photographing tile damage and replacing 
missing tiles purging main engines and orbital maneuvering 
engines attaching locks to prevent control flaps from fluttering 
and lifting the orbiter 60 feet in a matedemate device that 
places it atop the boeing jet

angolan rebel leader jonas savimbi offered to halt 
armed attacks on the estimated 50000 cuban troops in angola if 
cuba ceased hostilities against his forces the british 
broadcasting corp reported 
savimbi head of the national union for the total independence 
of angola or unita also proposed a swap of cuban and unita 
prisoners taken in the rebels 13yearold civil war against the 
marxist government in luanda according to a unita press statement 
reported by the bbc on monday 
the statement quoted from a radio broadcast in which savimbi 
urged cuba to pressure the angolan government to negotiate directly 
with the rebels for the formation of a government of national 
unity in angola 
savimbi whose south african military allies withdrew from 
angola last month as part of a ussponsored regional peace 
settlement has said he fears a cubanangolan offensive will 
destroy his strongholds in the southeastern portion of the country 
it would be bad if cuban troops who came to angola under the 
pretext of being internationalists are one day branded as 
colonialists who came to replace the portuguese to kill 
defenseless angolans the bbc quoted savimbi as saying 
the angolan government took power with cuban assistance after 
portugal withdrew from the country in the mid1970s it has since 
refused to talk with the unita rebels 
unita backed by south africa and the united states is not 
party to peace talks in brazzaville congo among angola south 
africa and cuba 
pretoria has called on cuba to join it in a total troop 
withdrawal and has held out the promise of independence for 
namibia or south west africa which south africa has ruled since 
world war i the angolan government has insisted that the cubans 
remain for four years 
a revolutionary government such as that of cuba cannot say 
that its forces are in angola to fight against south african troops 
when the south africans are no longer in angola the bbc 
quoted savimbi as saying

indian foreign secretary kps menon arrived 
today for talks expected to pave the way for the first sinoindian 
summit in 28 years 
indian embassy officials speaking on condition of anonymity 
said bilateral issues including a proposed visit by prime minister 
rajiv gandhi will be on the agenda during menons fiveday stay in 
beijing 
chinas official xinhua news agency in an earlier report from 
new delhi said gandhi would come to china before the end of the 
year 
relations between the worlds two most populous nations have 
long been cool because of indias prosoviet slant chinas close 
ties with indian rival pakistan and an unresolved border dispute 
the disagreement over large tracts of mountainous sparsely 
populated land along the 2400mile border erupted into fighting in 
1962 and has been a primary source of strain since 
border talks begun in 1981 have been largely fruitless but the 
two sides now appear ready to play down the territorial issue in 
the interest of better allround relations 
the chinese have toned down their public comment on the 
border dispute one indian official said we have seen improving 
relations in the past year 
the late premier chou enlai was the last chinese head of 
government to visit new delhi in 1960 no indian prime minister has 
visited beijing since the late jawaharlal nehru in 1954

longtime rivals bill gunter and rep 
kenneth buddy mackay vied today for the democratic nomination 
to succeed sen lawton chiles dfla who is leaving the senate 
after three terms 
florida republicans were picking three congressional candidates 
the winner of the bitterly contested democratic senate runoff 
will meet republican connie mack iii in the nov 8 general election 
both mackay and gunter men say the race is close an assessment 
reinforced by a newspaper poll last week showing mackay with a 
slight lead heading into the final week 
but the close race was not expected to pack voting booths 
dot joyce of the florida division of elections predicted an 
overall voter turnout of 25 percent 
the election was gunters third try at the senate and the second 
for mackay who is in his third congressional term 
gunter floridas insurance commissioner since 1976 
unsuccessfully sought his partys nomination in 1974 but won the 
democratic primary and runoff in 1980 before losing to republican 
paula hawkins in the general election gunter 54 defeated mackay 
55 in the 1980 party battle 
voters also were chosing party candidates to run for a variety 
of other posts including insurance commissioner secretary of 
state and federal and state house seats 
la skip bafalis and former lee county commissioner porter 
goss sought the gop nomination in the 14th congressional district 
where mack vacated the seat once held by bafalis to run for the 
senate 
the gop runoff victor faces democrat jack conway a retiree who 
was the first national president of the government watchdog group 
common cause 
clifford stearns a hotel and restaurant operator met jim 
cherry former head of the state farmers home administration in 
the 6th district gop race 
the winner faces democratic state legislative veteran jon mills 
in the general election to succeed mackay 
in the 11th district republicans chose between bill tolley or

the white house said today that us pleasure 
at the release of an indian hostage in beirut was tempered by the 
knowledge that nine innocent americans are among those still held 
hostage in lebanon 
mithileshwar singh a beirut university professor who is a legal 
resident of the united states was turned over to the us 
ambassador to syria in damascus today after being freed in lebanon 
on monday 
bob hall a white house press duty officer said president 
reagan has been kept aware of events during the night 
in a prepared statement read to reporters hall said we are 
pleased at the announcement that mr singh has been freed by his 
captors 
we are obviously happy for him his family and friends our 
pleasure at his release is tempered by the knowledge that nine 
innocent americans are among those still held hostage in lebanon 
the statement read 
singh in a brief session with reporters at the syrian foreign 
ministry in damascus today said the three american educators who 
were abducted with him were the only other hostages he saw in his 
captivity 
american diplomats who took custody of singh were hoping the 
freed hostage could give them information about the nine americans 
still held in lebanon 
we are anxious to talk to him and learn if he has any 
information to share with us about the welfare of the hostages who 
remain state department spokeswoman phyllis oakley said on 
monday 
nine americans and eight other westerners including terry 
waite an emissary of the anglican church in england are believed 
living in captivity in lebanon 
sources in syrias foreign ministry who spoke on condition of 
anonymity said singh was greeted at the ministry at 11 am edt by 
us ambassador edward djerjian and syrian minister of state for 
foreign affairs nasser qaddour 
mrs oakley said singh would be questioned in damascus by 
djerejian and other american diplomats they also were to determine 
if he wanted to be treated at an american military hospital in 
wiesbaden west germany she said 
we join with mr singhs relatives in rejoicing in his release 
and call for the urgent unconditional release of all hostages in 
lebanon mrs oakley said 
mrs oakley steadfastly denied the united states had negotiated 
with iran 
however she said the united states tried to maintain contact in 
lebanon with as broad a group as possible mrs oakley refused 
to elaborate saying i am not getting into the details on all the 
exact contacts 
syrian forces are in effective control of areas of lebanon a 
wartorn country in which americans have been the target of 
terrorists except for a few diplomats us citizens are under 
strict instruction from the state department to keep away 
singh was believed to have been held by the islamic jihad a 
proiranian group mrs oakley said she could not provide any 
details of his captivity condition or circumstances of his release 
until he was questioned by us diplomats in damascus 
the us official said syria had notified the us embassy in 
beirut and secretary of state george p shultz who is at the 
united nations in new york of singhs release 
singh is a 60yearold visiting professor at beirut university 
college 
asked if there were indications other hostages would be 
released mrs oakley said no this is all we have 
singhs wife lalmoney was in beirut 
although he is an indian citizen singh was connected to the 
united states because he was a permanent resident and was 
associated with the americans who taught at the beirut college 
the release came after kidnappers holding singh and three 
american teachers said they would free one of their captives at the 
west beirut headquarters of the un relief and works agency for 
palestinian refugees 
the announcement that a hostage would be freed from islamic 
jihad for the liberation of palestine came in a 36word handwritten 
statement in arabic delivered to a western news agency in beirut 
president reagan created a stir in new york last week when he 
suggested that something was in the works regarding the nine 
americans held hostage by various proiranian elements in lebanon 
he said at the time that he could not say anything further 
because you dont talk while a nohitter is being pitched 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said later that the 
president had no special information and was merely saying he 
didnt want to cast bad luck on the situation 
neither reagan nor fitzwater would speculate on possible motives 
behind such a hostage release

the cia organized a wideranging domestic 
propaganda and disinformation campaign aimed at winning public 
support for administration policies in central america the boston 
globe reported today 
the campaign was conceived by william casey the late director 
of the cia and implemented by veteran cia propaganda specialist 
walter raymond jr the globe said citing information gathered by 
congressional investigators the general accounting office and the 
state department 
the campaign included several projects associated with boston 
universitys college of communications the newspaper said 
the newspaper quoting a recent report by the house foreign 
affairs committee said the campaign was conducted through an 
intricate network of organizations including the national security 
council and an obscure state department bureau called the office of 
latin american public diplomacy the apparatus also included the 
participation of us army psychological operations specialists 
the globe said 
in a letter accompanying their report house investigators 
recommended further probes into the extent to which the cia and 
intelligence components of the army conspired to use the 
state department as a cover for a domestic operation far beyond 
the legal and ethical scope of their authority the newspaper 
said 
according to the globe the nsc allegedly succeeded in placing 
governmentfunded columns in major newspapers arranged media 
interviews with nicaraguan contra leaders by government surrogates 
who were not identified as such booked speaking engagements for 
administration advocates and placed large amounts of 
governmentsponsored material in college libraries 
in a recent article in foreign policy magazine peter kornbluh 
and robert parry wrote 
by running the operation out of the nsc the reagan 
administration apparently sought to sidestep restrictions on the 
cia that prohibit the agency from influencing political 
processes public opinion or the media 
both raymond and otto reich who headed the state departments 
office of latin american public diplomacy denied the existence of 
a covert ciainspired propaganda effort in the united states 
raymond who is now deputy director of the united states 
information agency termed the house report and magazine article a 
conspiracy theory lacking any truth 
the globe said he also denied in a telephone interview that 
casey sent him to the nsc and that in his special capacity as 
special assistant to the president for national security he 
reported to casey 
i completely severed all ties to the agency in 1983 after 
being transferred to the nsc raymond said 
raymond said that in 1986 he casey and cia counsel peter 
dailey discussed the establishment of an independent private 
group to advocate administration policies but the idea was 
subsequently dropped because there may not have been sufficient 
support for administration policies 
reich who is now us ambassador to venezuela was reached by 
telephone in caracas last friday the globe said he called the 
house report and magazine article fantasy and libelous and 
said his office used army psychological operations specialists only 
to identify and collate central american data for use in government 
presentations and publications 
however the globe said a number of documents cited in the house 
report appear to contradict raymonds assertions about cia 
involvement in the project 
the globe said gao and state department investigators found that 
the propaganda campaign was partially financed by a number of 
solesource noncompetitive contracts granted by the public 
diplomacy office to private foundations and companies active in the 
private contrasupport network a number of those contracts 
involved sums of slightly less than 10000 to avoid the limit for 
financial reporting requirements according to the investigators 
h joachim maitre dean of the boston university communications 
school told the globe that a burun project to provide journalism 
training to afghan resistance fighters and a documentary he 
produced on the contra rebels contras could have been part of a 
covert campaign to influence media and public opinion bu is no 
longer affiliated with the project

the internal revenue service has subpoenaed 
documents on electronic transfers to california banks as part of a 
nationwide crackdown on money laundering by drug dealers and tax 
evaders it was reported today 
the irs and the department of justice hope to penetrate the 
multibilliondollar moneylaundering operations of drug kingpins 
and uncover the methods used by tax evaders to conceal 
transactions according to documents obtained by the los angeles 
times 
records from banks including bank of america were subpoenaed as 
part of the effort to trace funds transferred between us banks 
and hong kong panama the bahamas the cayman islands and the 
netherlands antilles five known tax havens where laws protect 
against disclosure bank account information 
the banks are not targets of the investigation but the subpoena 
noted that bank of america paid a 475 million fine in 1986 for 
failing to report 17000 cash deposits and nonelectronic transfers 
in excess of 10000 as required by law there is no law covering 
wire transfers 
irs officials with the san francisco district office which is 
conducting the california portion of the investigation said 
numerous criminal and civil investigations are under way as a 
result of the records obtained from the banks over the past several 
months 
they refused to identify the targets of the investigations or 
name other banks involved in the subpoenas other irs offices are 
conducting similar inquiries they said but declined to name them 
the wiretransfer records enable the irs to construct a pattern 
of transactions by those seeking to get around the us law that 
requires banks to notify the government of transactions of 10000 
or more in cash said alexander d seddio irs criminal 
investigations agent 
to evade the law they make a series of smaller deposits 
consolidate the money in one account and wire it to an offshore 
bank seddio explained any amount of cash can be deposited in an 
offshore bank and wired to a us bank evading the 10000 us 
reporting requirement and making the money appear to be legitimate 
bank of america officials declined to comment on the subpoena or 
the volume of records requested as did wells fargo which recently 
acquired barclays of california bank another reported target of 
the subpoenas 
bank of america is considered particularly vulnerable to money 
laundering because the large number of its branches offers 
anonymity to launderers said the subpoena issued this summer by 
the us attorneys office in san francisco 
the subpoena obtained by the times requested copies of all wire 
transfers to and from the five offshore locations for 1986 and 1987

three men and a woman have been charged in 
the 1983 killing of new york theatrical producer roy radin who 
authorities said was embroiled in a soured finance deal for the 
movie the cotton club 
deputy district attorney david conn said the murder was a 
contract killing and that movie producer robert evans whose 
credits include chinatown and the marathon man was a key 
figure in the films financial negotiations 
the prosecutor said evans testimony is going to become 
important at some point and his participation in the deal remains 
under investigation however sheriffs homicide capt robert grimm 
stressed that evans is not a suspect in radins death 
charged with radins may 13 1983 murder were karen de layne 
greenberger described by one sheriffs spokesman as a former 
cocaine dealer and william molony mentzer also charged were alex 
lamota marti and robert ulmer lowe the complaint alleged they 
killed radin for financial gain 
the complaint alleged special aggravating circumstances which 
could result in the death penalty if the defendants are convicted 
at the time of radins death there were rumors the slaying was 
linked to cocaine but conn said monday that will not be the 
subject of our prosecution 
conn alleged the radin slaying resulted from a dispute between 
radin and ms greenberger about a plan to raise 35 million from 
investors in the puerto rican government for production of the 
the cotton club 
the 1984 film about a harlem speakeasy starring richard gere 
reportedly cost 47 million to produce and was met with generally 
lukewarm reviews 
the prosecutor said radin was introduced to evans by ms 
greenberger and radin became a middleman in the puerto rican 
negotiations but a dispute developed between radin and the woman 
over a finders fee she demanded conn said 
on may 13 1983 he said radin stepped into a limousine rented 
by ms greenberger with the intention of going to a restaurant 
and discussing the business arrangement further he never arrived 
at the restaurant 
on june 10 a forest ranger discovered radins body in a stream 
bed at the end of a road in a rural part of los angeles county 
about 65 miles north of los angeles he had been shot in the back 
of the head 
the complaint based on new evidence was issued sept 22 but 
was sealed for fear of the safety of an informant who has since 
been relocated conn said

the pentagon has rejected for now a plan to 
provide the american people with details of the supersecret 
stealth jet fighter defense officials said today 
the officials who insisted on anonymity said the idea of 
acknowledging the airplanes existence for the first time was 
debated at the highest levels of the defense department and on 
capitol hill before being rejected for the time being 
its not going to happen right now said one of the sources 
there were concerns at the top of the military heirarchy and 
there was a bipartisan view that this was not the most auspicious 
time for this maybe later 
asked if the reference to bipartisanship meant the plane might 
be unveiled after the presidential election the source replied 
possibly 
according to military and industry sources the united states 
secretly began building stealth or radarevading jet fighters 
in the mid1970s and now maintains more than 50 of the singleseat 
planes at a tightly guarded facility in nevada 
the plane has been dubbed the f19 by various industry officials 
but reportedly also carries the military designation of f117a 
the pentagon and air force have never acknowledged the 
airplanes existence even when pressed about mysterious crashes 
over the years 
according to the sources the planes are flown only at night and 
are kept at a high state of readiness for use as aerial shock 
troops capable of slipping behind enemy lines without being 
detected and creating confusion with unexpected bombing runs 
the defense officials said today the proposal to finally unveil 
the plane to the public was considered for a number of reasons 
first explained one official was an issue of logic the air 
force already has announced it will unveil its new stealth bomber 
next month and that plane is based on more recent technological 
developments than the stealth fighter 
its general knowledge that the technology of the fighter is 
older than the bomber and were about to let everybody see the 
bomber the official said 
secondly pentagon officials have concluded that even if they 
wanted to keep the program secret upcoming court fights are likely 
to shatter security production line workers at a lockheed corp 
plant in burbank calif where the stealth fighters are thought to 
be made have gone to court with charges they are being sickened by 
exposure to dangerous chemicals

fresh threats of a possible price war among opec 
nations have pushed oil futures lower in a test of price levels not 
seen in more than two years 
the november contract for west texas intermediate the benchmark 
us crude skidded 31 cents to settle at 1306 a barrel on the 
new york mercantile exchange on monday the move follows a 55cent 
plunge in the previous session 
crude prices which had not closed that low since august 1986 
over the past five weeks have slumped by about 2 a barrel 
experts say consumers probably will not benefit significantly 
unless crude holds at those depressed levels for an extended period 
on the exchange wholesale unleaded gasoline prices fell 025 
cent to settle at 4198 cents a gallon heating oil fell 095 cent 
to end the day at 3778 cents a gallon 
prices moved slightly higher in early trading today but richard 
redoglia a trader with merrill lynch energy futures said the 
advance was due to technical factors and that market fundamentals 
are bearish 
november west texas intermediate picked up 18 cents a barrel 
rising to 1324 while gasoline rose 042 cent to 4240 cents a 
gallon and heating oil was up 047 cent to 3825 cents a gallon 
mondays slide in crude intensified after saudi arabia opecs 
largest producer and the worlds biggest exporter issued a sharply 
worded statement that analysts said was intended to pressure other 
members of the organization of petroleum exporting countries to 
curb their output levels or face continued sharp declines in 
prices 
saudi arabia said it believes returning to prescribed production 
levels is the best way for restoring full stability to turbulent 
oil markets but it will not freeze its own production while others 
continue to violate their ceilings 
analysts said the saudis are intent on boosting their output to 
drive prices lower and make other oil producers suffer narrowing 
profit margins 
opec nations are pumping an estimated 3 million barrels a day 
beyond their 175millionbarrel daily quota 
theres a certain strategy within the saudi camp that they 
will demonstrate that you cant win by overproducing said bob 
baker senio energy analyst at prudentialbache securities inc 
indeed the saudis threatened that other opec members will now 
feel the harm of deterioration that overproduction has on the 
market 
the statement said certain unidentified opec members had 
perhaps forgotten the benefits of when they abided by the 
cartels december 1986 pricing and production agreement which 
helped send oil prices at least briefly to levels around 20 a 
barrel 
the saudis claim to have lost as much as 19 billion over the 
years from repeatedly lowering their own output to bolster opec 
with substantial resources the saudis can tolerate lower oil 
prices more easily than other nations 
with a series of opec committee meetings scheduled to begin 
later this month analysts caution that oil prices could rebound if 
there is any hint that members of the 13nation cartel might reach 
a new accord to rein in production 
crude prices would have to be depressed for quite some time 
before it works through to gas at the pumps and to heating oil 
said james steel an analyst with refco inc 
gasoline stocks are low almost 10 million barrels behind 
last years level and demand is picking up slightly said 
andrew lebow an energy analyst at edamp f man international inc 
that may help to keep gas prices at current levels in the face of 
falling crude prices 
but experts say price stability alone is beneficial because 
consumers incomes are rising stable prices can mean a cheaper 
product in real terms steel said

look good im hurt because im in love im still in love 
police said that they handled sundays incident like any other 
such case and that as far as they were concerned the matter was

title defense against frank bruno of britain which is scheduled 
for december

forcing the postponement of a boxing match and sparking news 
reports that the boxer threatened to kill himself prior to the 
accident in august tyson broke a bone in his hand during a street 
fight with boxer mitch green

president reagan ruled out again today 
negotiations with the captors of nine american hostages and said 
liberating them from their lebanese captors remains a great 
problem despite the release of an indian prisoner 
the white house meanwhile tempered expressions of pleasure at 
the release of the indian in beirut with the knowledge that nine 
innocent americans are among those still held hostage in lebanon 
mithileshwar singh a beirut university professor who is a legal 
resident of the united states was turned over to the us 
ambassador to syria in damascus today after being freed in lebanon 
on monday 
singh who is a diabetic will fly to a us military hospital 
in wiesbaden west germany for medical treatment in the next few 
days l paul bremer us ambassador for counterterrorism said 
today 
reagan in an exchange with reporters did not explain how 
singhs freedom was obtained but he again ruled out any us deals 
with the captors believed to be an proiranian islamic group 
he said trying to secure the release of the nine americans held 
in lebanon has been a great problem for us and its very much on 
our minds 
reagan declined to speculate on what move the united states 
might make to win the release of the nine american hostages 
weve done no negotiating on that at all he said and im 
not going to hazard a guess as to why they turned him loose not 
as long as weve still got hostages there he said while posing 
for pictures with republican congressional leaders in the cabinet 
room 
asked if he thought iran was attempting to manipulate the 
outcome of the us presidential election reagan smiled and said 
well if they are i hope theyre on the right side 
senate republican leader bob dole asked about the political 
implications of the situation said i just hope for the sake of 
the hostages they are released today without any reference to the 
election every day they stay there is another day of hell and i 
assume that we are not concerned about the outcome of the election 
but with the hostages 
in an interview published today in the new york times the 
spiritual leader of a group believed to be an umbrella for captors 
of foreign hostages was quoted as saying it was not yet the right 
time for the american hostages to be freed 
sheik mohammed hussein fadlallah spiritual head of the 
iranianbacked hezbollah or party of god also was quoted as 
saying the fate of the hostages would have to wait for the 
outcome of the american presidential election he said iran 
preferred to deal with the republicans 
pressed to discuss what options are available for us officials 
attempting to get the hostages released reagan said i can just 
tell you that this has been a big problem for us its something 
very much in our minds i just cant talk any further about 
it 
in 1985 the president secretly approved us weapons sales to 
iran in an arrangement that was supposed to encourage moderation in 
tehran and free captive americans 
when the plot surfaced in 1986 it produced the greatest uproar 
in reagans eightyear presidency 
in a prepared statement read earlier in the day to reporters 
white house spokesman bob hall said we are pleased at the 
announcement that mr singh has been freed by his captors 
we are obviously happy for him his family and friends our 
pleasure at his release is tempered by the knowledge that nine 
innocent americans are among those still held hostage in lebanon 
the statement read 
in television interviews today bremer reiterated reagan 
administration statements that weve not made any deals and were 
not going to make any deals to gain the hostages freedom 
bremer said on the cbs this morning that american officials 
have spoken to singh only briefly and have no indication that he 
was carrying any messages from his captors 
singh in a brief session with reporters at the syrian foreign 
ministry in damascus today said the three american educators who 
were abducted with him were the only other hostages he saw in his 
captivity 
american diplomats who took custody of singh were hoping the 
freed hostage could give them information about the nine americans 
still held in lebanon 
we are anxious to talk to him and learn if he has any 
information to share with us about the welfare of the hostages who 
remain state department spokeswoman phyllis oakley said on 
monday 
nine americans and eight other westerners including terry 
waite an emissary of the anglican church in england are believed 
living in captvity in lebanon 
sources in syrias foreign ministry who spoke on condition of 
anonymity said singh was greeted at the ministry late this morning 
by us ambassador edward djerejian and syrian minister of state 
for foreign affairs nasser qaddour 
syrian forces are in effective control of areas of lebanon a 
wartorn country in which americans have been the target of 
terrorists except for a few diplomats us citizens are under 
strict instruction from the state department to keep away 
singh was believed to have been held by the islamic jihad a 
proiranian group 
singh is a 60yearold visiting professor at beirut university 
college 
asked if there were indications other hostages would be 
released mrs oakley said no this is all we have 
although he is an indian citizen singh was connected to the 
united states because he was a permanent resident and was 
associated with the americans who taught at the beirut college 
the release came after kidnappers holding singh and three 
american teachers said they would free one of their captives at the 
west beirut headquarters of the un relief and works agency for 
palestinian refugees 
the announcement that a hostage would be freed from islamic 
jihad for the liberation of palestine came in a 36word handwritten 
statement in arabic delivered to a western news agency in beirut

a us navy diver testified today 
he feared confessed hijacker mohammed ali hamadi was about to shoot 
him before a flight attendent intervened 
he hamadi had a chromeplated automatic pistol in his hand 
he pointed it directly in my face and pulled back the hammer 
tony daniel watson told hamadis air piracy and murder trial 
hamadi a lebanese shiite moslem is accused in the june 1985 
hijacking of a twa jetliner in which navy diver robert stethem was 
killed and 39 americans were held captive for 17 days 
watson 30 told the court that hamadi took him to the front on 
the plane after it was hijacked and threatened him with a pistol 
i was very afraid i would be shot but uli derickson pleaded 
with him in german watson said 
mrs derickson the chief flight attendant has been credited 
with negotiating with hamadi in german in attempts to prevent 
mistreatment of the passengers 
watson also told the court that he recognized the picture of a 
man now jailed in france as one of the men who came aboard the 
plane during a beirut stop and held him hostage 
watson was shown the picture of a man identified in court 
records as fuad ali salah 
i saw him twice while we were being held captive in beirut 
watson said 
salah was arrested march 27 1987 in france on suspicion of 
taking part in bombings in paris according to evidence introduced 
in court 
watson dressed in a gray suit said he was still in the navy 
but did not give his rank or residence in keeping with court 
guidelines intended to protect witnesses 
hamadi listened intently to the testimony with one arm propped 
on the desk in front of him his chin resting in his left hand 
earlier today american physician michael clark told the court 
that he performed a second autopsy on stethem at the request of the 
fbi in 1986 
clark said he was asked to perform the autopsy to find out 
whether other injuries to the 23yearold sailor had been 
overlooked during a preliminary autopsy done after his death in 
june 1985 
he said his 1986 autopsy did not find injuries that had been 
overlooked but confirmed previous testimony that stethem had lived 
between three and 10 minutes after he had been shot in the head 
other witnesses have testified that stethem of waldorf md 
was thrown onto the runway immediately after being shot 
flight 847s pilot john testrake told the court several weeks 
ago that he believed hamadi was the gunman 
other witnesses have said they believed the other hijacker 
identified by a us indictment as hassan ezzeddine was the killer 
hamadi who has admitted being one of the hijackers has denied 
killing stethem 
hamadi was arrested at the frankfurt airport in january 1987 
after customs officials found explosives in his luggage 
in the week that followed his arrest two west german businessmen 
were kidnapped in beirut both have since been released 
hamadis older brother abbas hamadi is imprisoned in west 
germany he was convicted earlier this year by a duesseldorf court 
of conspiracy in the abduction of the two west germans in an effort 
to pressure the west german government to release his brother 
west germany denied a us request for the extradition of 
mohammed hamadi saying he would be tried on the same charges here

president reagan today exhorted the senate to 
approve housepassed antidrug legislation saying hell consider 
the business of congress finished for the year once that has been 
accomplished 
meeting with republican congressional leaders in the cabinet 
room of the white house reagan complained that the housepassed 
drug bill has been sitting on the senate calendar for days 
he said that since congress has enacted the 13 appropriations 
bills necessary for continuing government operations into the 
fiscal year which began last saturday the antidrug legislation is 
the lone major business that has been left unfinished 
i think its time for congress to go home the president 
said i want to urge the senate to pass a responsible drug bill 
so that it can be quickly conferenced and enacted and then ill 
wish the 100th congress a hearty adieu 
reagans statements came as senators were negotiating privately 
on crucial timelimiting agreements that could enable congress to 
pass the antidrug bill before adjournment 
senate republican leader bob dole of kansas said the bill was 
being held up by democrats playing games with parental leave and 
child care and minimum wage if theyd stop playing games and be 
realistic we could do a drug bill this week but we cant carry on 
this charade on the senate floor we could be here another two or 
three weeks 
a bipartisan group of sponsors introduced the drug measure 
monday but they agreed the senate will run out of time if long 
debates ensue over controversial issues such as user penalties and 
admission of illegally seized evidence 
even if the senate overcame its own time obstacles it still 
would need to agree to a compromise with the house which approved 
its own drug measure this month 37530 
sen warren rudman rnh said no senator wants to be held 
responsible for preventing the drug bill from coming to a vote 
sponsors said they were working on arrangements to limit amendments 
to about a halfdozen from each party 
even if a drug bill is enacted this year it would face serious 
financing problems 
the senate bill is a twoyear package that would authorize about 
2 billionin new spending but only 450 million may be available 
immediately according to 14 sponsors who discussed the bill at a 
news conference 
about 250 million of that figure would come from expected 
revenue increases from tougher internal revenue service tax 
enforcement 
rudman said he would propose an amendment to a technical tax 
bill that would increase taxes on alcohol and tobacco products to 
pay for the drug bill other lawmakers said the proposal would 
fail and suggested taking the money from existing programs 
in a strategic decision that might prevent some delaying 
tactics sponsors decided to include a death penalty provision as 
part of the original legislation this could prevent a long debate 
by capital punishment supporters to win inclusion of the provision 
sen phil gramm rtexas said he will offer amendments for 
strict user penalties such as denial of federal benefits for anyone 
convicted of drug sales or use 
other senators are expected to offer an amendment to allow 
admission in federal court of evidence seized illegally but in 
good faith 
key provisions in the senate bill would 
make substance abuse treatment on request an explicit goal and 
finance increased treatment capacity

thirtyfive graduates of a police academy 
that is under investigation for an epidemic of illness among cadets 
gathered today to defend their instructors and institution 
this is where you separate the men from the boys and the women 
from the girls said michael gonnello of the west springfield 
police force gonnello was among alumni who met at the academy to 
show their support 
he and others criticized the state for removing the two state 
police instructors accused of overworking cadets and discouraging 
them from drinking water after 16 cadets required medical attention 
last month for dehydration and related problems the two 
instructors were running their first course although they had 
assisted in others 
these troopers know their job said jerry millar of the 
amherst police force the only problem we had was that they 
didnt have time to teach us the last few weeks they had to cram 
in a lot 
one of the rally organizers colleen griswold said earlier that 
women trainees who accused instructors of calling them pregnant 
sows couldnt possibly be telling the truth 
ill eat my combat boots if one of the females can come to me 
and say that is true said griswold an amherst police officer 
and a 1988 graduate of the academy in this city just south of 
springfield 
the school was closed for a time after the cadets fell ill the 
most seriously ill timothy shepard 25 of pittsfield required a 
liver transplant after collapsing on his first day sept 19 and 
remained in critical condition today the others suffered 
dehyrdration and kidney failure doctors said 
shepards sisterinlaw said this morning that there were signs 
he was coming out of a coma she said he started to turn his head 
monday and appeared to recognize his mother and his pregnant wife 
weve seen some good signs she said were praying and 
hoping 
some cadets said they went through 10 hours of exercise with 
relatively little water their police chiefs have said water was 
available but the cadets may have hesitated to break ranks to ask 
for it 
on monday the state department of public safety ordered its 
police academies to stop using pushups and other exercise as 
punishment in training cadets 
john barrett iii mayor of the small western massachusetts town 
of north adams and chief critic of the training program has said 
an investigation indicated that instructors had taunted women 
cadets by calling them pregnant sows and baby makers 
singled out two male trainees as class idiots and meted out 
excessive punishment forcing cadets to walk like ducks and lie 
like cockroaches with their arms and legs in the air for long 
periods 
academy officials have said that training was meant to be 
stressful but not abusive to prepare recruits for the insults and 
other stresses that go along with police work 
griswold defended her instructors including john richardson 
i find it very hard if not impossible to believe he 
richardson would ever have said something like that said 
griswold whose class at the academy ran from october 1987 to 
january 1988 
she denied there had been any abuse of cadets 
all i know is what happened to me griswold said i never 
missed a day and i was never sick 
as the only woman in her class she said i never felt 
discriminated against for a second 
richardson and another instructor trooper charles gilmore bade 
farewell to their class monday as they prepared to turn the cadets 
over to another pair of state troopers 
the two men asked to be reassigned friday because of the 
attention the academy has received since members of their class 
began collapsing two weeks ago

an appeals court today reversed a state 
order that princeton universitys two remaining allmale eating 
clubs admit women ruling a procedural error several years ago 
denied the clubs a fair hearing 
a threejudge panel of the appellate division of superior court 
ruled the clubs were entitled to a hearing before an administrative 
law judge in 1985 prior to a determination of whether they fell 
under new jersey antidiscrimination laws 
in the circumstances of this case the clubs have not been 
afforded due process the court said this is a hotly contested 
case despite the fact that the parties have stipulated 230 facts 
many material factual disputes remain 
much of the social life at princeton university revolves around 
13 clubs where most juniors and seniors eat the clubs are in 
privately owned houses near the campus since princeton began 
admitting women in 1969 all clubs except the ivy club and the 
tiger inn have changed their rules to admit women the ruling comes 
nearly a decade after princeton graduate sally frank began fighting 
to gain admission to the clubs when she was a junior at the ivy 
league school 
of course im disappointed that the court decided to reverse 
on a technicality and that as a result the clubs will be able to 
continue discriminating for several years said ms frank now an 
associate clinical professor at new york law school but i remain 
as committed as ever to eliminating the clubs policies barring 
women 
lawyers for the clubs hailed the ruling 
the court has ordered what we have sought for quite a while 
due process said barbara strapp nelson a lawyer for the ivy 
club now ivy will finally receive the fair hearing it is 
entitled to as to whether it is a private or public accommodation 
the ruling reverses a 1987 order by state civil rights officials 
that the two clubs must admit women 
pamela poff director of the state division of civil rights had 
rejected an earlier ruling by an administrative law judge who said 
the clubs did not have to admit women as long as they severed their 
ties to the university 
ms poff said the clubs were public accommodations subject to 
antidiscrimination laws and could be required to admit women 
a month after ms poffs ruling the tiger inns board of 
governors voted to cut any ties to the school rather than be forced 
to admit women 
officials said they eliminated official ties with the schools 
intramural sports program pulled out of the intraclub council and 
even went so far as to ask that collegeowned sidewalk snowplows 
lift their blades as they pass the clubs building

democrat michael dukakis said today that 
republican rival george bush had failed every assignment as vice 
president and that american business has suffered as a result 
we cannot build a strong and vibrant economic future for 
america on a mountain of debt and the american business community 
knows that dukakis said in a speech at northwestern university 
the democratic nominee also said he supports reasonable 
limits to curtail what he called a merger and acquisition binge 
that continues to sweep the country 
the massachusetts governor voiced confidence that he is 
beginning to turn this race around after trailing bush in most 
national polls but said the contest was tough and competitive 
he compared the upcoming election with the outcome of the 1960 
race in which john f kennedy won a narrow victory over republican 
richard nixon 
suggesting that history might repeat itself dukakis reminded 
his audience that illinois had gone for kennedy by a mere 8800 
votes or about one vote per precinct in a state of 10 million 
the democratic candidate highlighting trade issues accused 
bush of embracing an economic policy of drift which permitted large 
us trade deficits to accumulate unchecked 
george bush thinks we need a president who blames american 
workers and corporations for the trade deficit dukakis told a 
receptive audience of about 1000 students and business leaders 
if elected he said he and running mate lloyd bentsen of texas 
would work with labor and management to ease the trade deficit and 
make the label made in america a symbol of quality and value 
and durability all over the world 
dukakis said the country is losing business and trade markets to 
foreign competitors at a record rate cite these facts and 
george bush will say youre downgrading america he said my 
friends if we disregard these facts we endanger america 
dukakis said the vice president had failed his assignments on 
promoting us sales in japan regulatory reform drug 
interdiction international terrorism and banking reforms 
mr bush was given five important missions by this 
administration and he failed every one and that was before they 
asked him to pick a running mate in this election dukakis said 
referring to gop vice presidential nominee dan quayle 
in chicago on monday dukakis promised to enforce civil rights 
laws provide sameday voter registration and work for statehood 
foer the district of columbia 
speaking to a mostly black audience at the regal theater on 
chicagos south side the democratic nominee accused the reagan 
administration of turning back the clock on civil rights 
were going to aim high and enforce the civil rights laws of 
this country not veto them were going to have a justice 
department that will inspire us not embarrass us and were going 
to have an attorney general who understands what the word justice 
means dukakis said 
a democratic administration according to dukakis would 
support the affirmative action programs that republican vice 
presidential candidate dan quayle voted against 
in his speech dukakis paid tribute to the late mayor harold 
washington and praised former rival jesse jackson as a great son 
of chicago whose sun still shines brightly over all of 
america 
dukakis spokesman dayton duncan said jackson who was 
campaigning for the democratic ticket on the east coast was unable 
to join dukakis however the aide said a dukakisjackson joint 
appearance was planned for later this month 
from here dukakis headed for a tour of a jeep plant in toledo 
ohio and was attending a private fundraising dinner in 
washington dc tonight he was returning to boston where he 
will spend all day wednesday

to critics who criticize a party policy review designed to move 
the party closer to the center kinnock said there is no 
concession to thatcherism as great as letting it win again

successive election defeat in 1987 
on the issue of unilateral nuclear disarmament kinnock said 
today

policy for fighting the next general election that policy must be 
serious about nuclear disarmament serious about defense

generation of trident sealaunched missiles will be completed and 
deployed and in addition other systems will be multiplied under 
the guise of modernization

police arrested almost 200 antiabortion 
activists at two atlanta clinics today as the opening round of what 
protest organizers say will be a fourday siege of atlanta got 
under way 
theyre blocking the street theyre failing to disperse so 
were locking them up said police capt ww holley 
more than 100 demonstrators arrived at one midtown abortion 
facility about 1040 am many of them crawling up the street 
toward the small brick building when some tried to go beyond a 
temporary fence installed outside the clinic police began dragging 
the protesters away toward waiting buses and vans about 75 were 
arrested 
a mile away another protest began at another clinic there were 
two groups demonstrating one which made attempts to get inside 
the building and another which sat on the ground singing hymns 
as police dragged demonstrators toward buses and vans many 
protesters let their bodies go limp police pleaded with the 
protesters to get up so they would not have to drag them away 
in all more than 100 people were arrested at the second site 
earlier city officials had braced for the expected 
demonstrations by arresting the protest leader and filing suit 
against others claiming they were engaged in a criminal conspiracy 
about 800 demonstrators some of whom attended a predawn mass 
assembled this morning at a motel on the edge of town protest 
leaders distributed plastic bags to collect the identification of 
those who planned to be arrested so that authorities could not 
determine their names 
that approach was used during a series of antiabortion 
demonstrations in atlanta this summer then hundreds were arrested 
over several weeks and many refused to give their names to 
authorities in solidarity they said with anonymous victims of 
abortion 
operation rescue a new yorkbased antiabortion group has 
vowed to send hundreds of demonstrators to blockade the citys 
seven clinics that perform abortions this week 
abortion rights groups have trained about 300 volunteers to 
escort women through the demonstrators the volunteers plan to use 
black umbrellas emblazoned with choice in large blue letters 
to shield the faces of women seeking to enter targeted clinics 
the prochoice groups held their own church rally monday night 
but have said they wont stage counterdemonstrations because that 
would make things more difficult for patients 
before this mornings protests began police were already 
watching the clinics and metal barricades were up around at least 
one clinic that was a frequent target of demonstrators this summer 
randall terry operation rescues leader was arrested monday 
charged with conspiracy to commit a crime and jailed said police 
sgt dorothy smith terry was on the scene as the demonstrators 
gathered this morning after an unidentified person posted his 
75000 bond 
this is clearly preventive detention terry said earlier in 
a statement they want to stop us from attempting to save the 
lives of endangered babies in atlanta 
the city on friday filed a lawsuit asking a fulton county 
superior court judge to declare operation rescue leaders and others 
a public nuisance and issue a permanent injunction against the 
demonstration a hearing on the lawsuit was set for this afternoon 
terry mcmonagle and five other operation rescue leaders were 
named as defendants as well as baby jane doe and baby john 
doe the names used by dozens of demonstraters arrested this 
summer 
the lawsuit seeks a 500aperson fine for each violation of the 
injunction it claims that operation rescue and its members 
constitute a continuing criminal enterprise violating the states 
racketeer influenced corrupt organizations act 
speakers at monday nights operation rescue rally at suburban 
st jude the apostle roman catholic church said the protests were 
dictated by their christian beliefs 
a smaller but equally enthusiastic crowd of about 200 abortion 
rights advocates gathered at downtown central presbyterian church 
heard the antiabortionists labeled as immoral and unamerican 
more than 700 people were arrested in demonstrations that began 
during the democratic convention in july many remained in jail for 
as long as 68 days giving their names only as baby jane doe or 
baby john doe as the city refused to release them unless they gave 
their real names

the federal funds would be set up as a matching program to 
generate the same amount in provate donations 
the best of the existing volunteer programs will be expanded 
and new programs will be developed the end result i hope is that 
citizen service will become a real and living part of every young 
americans life bush said 
he suggested awarding high school or college credit for youth 
volunteerism under the program 
as examples he said young people could help poor children 
women with abusive husbands or immigrants who dont speak english 
i want our affluent to help our poor he said i want our 
young to help our elderly i want the young men and women of our 
treelined suburbs to get on a bus or the subway or the metro 
and go into the cities where the want is 
the yes to america program mostly would work in partnership with 
community efforts and programs already in place such as peace 
corps the california conservation corps and other communitybased 
volunteer programs according to bush campaign adviser loret ruppe 
director of the peace corps 
bush pledged monday to commit the nation to development of a 
manned space station by 1996 telling an outdoor rally in 
picturesque northern california the space program brings us 
together 
the speech in redding deep in timber country followed a 
highvisibility trip to the california desert monday that let the 
vice president share the spotlight with the returning discovery 
space shuttle and five astronauts 
the journey from washington to california to welcome the 
discovery back from its fourday voyage was officially billed as a 
vice presidential trip but bushs campaign paid for the travel to 
voterich california a crucial battleground in the november 
election 
bush told the crowd of about 5000 that he would commit this 
nation to the development of an operational space station by the 
year 1996 
this goal is achievable sensible and we will meet that 
goal bush said 
though taking a few customary swipes at his democratic opponent 
michael dukakis bush said he mostly wanted to talk about space he 
said he is fully and utterly committed to the us space program 
and utterly committed to the peaceful exploration of near and far 
space 
bush noted president reagan had said that space is a place 
where mankind may be liberated from hunger and want and 
oppression 
but i would add that it has long seemed to me that while the 
higher purpose of our space program is science and progress there 
is another purpose he said the us space program gives us a 
lift it brings us together 
he also reiterated his proposals for a national space council 
to be chaired by the vice president that would make 
recommendations on the future of space exploration 
he said the national aeronautics and space administration should 
be looking toward mars the way i see the logical order is this 
first the shuttle then the space station he said first the 
moon then perhaps mars 
the madefortv scene at redding was the kind his campaign 
stages with near perfection 
when singer lee greenwood closed the rally by singing im 
proud to be an american cheering people waved american flags as 
the sun sank in the background bush a wide smile across his face 
as he sang along with the refrain god bless the usa standing 
with a little girl in a brownie outfit and in front of high school 
cheerleaders clad in white and purple 
but one large banner raised briefly at the back of the crowd 
testified to a cash crop that has brought considerable wealth in 
surrounding california areas legalize marijuana it said 
bushs welcoming handshake to the shuttle crew as they stepped 
off discovery gave the vice president a chance to share in the 
positive publicity generated by the first shuttle mission since the 
deadly challenger explosion close to three years ago 
he watched the landing from a high wooden platform constructed 
on the dry lake bed where the shuttle touches down 
because of you our space program is back in the game bush 
told the returning astronauts at edwards air force base 
bush said the seven members of the challenger shuttle crew were 
cheering from above at the successful mission

workers scrambled tuesday to erase the last 
vestiges of a professional wrestling match to set the scene for 
wednesday nights highstakes grapple between vice presidential 
candidates lloyd bentsen and dan quayle 
we do this every day of the year said terry forsberg 
manager of the omaha civic auditorium its not even as massive 
as some of the concerts we do were used to it 
how big a job is it asked phil schaefer of the freeman 
decorating co so big it cant be done 
but that didnt deter workers who hurried to remove the 
wrestling ring left over from saturday nights match and replace it 
with platforms for television cameras and anchor booths for the 
nationally broadcast 90minute campaign debate starting at 830 
pm edt wednesday 
work orders strewn about the auditoriums lower level called for 
400 feet of blue carpet and 100 feet of red and white rope 
to turn the building into a patriotic showcase places were 
designated for potted plants in living green 
the stage for the quaylebentsen confrontation will be familiar 
to millions of tv viewers it will be the same stage used for the 
sept 25 debate between republican nominee george bush and his 
democratic rival michael dukakis at winstonsalem nc 
the hall ordinarily seats more than 10000 people but space was 
being trimmed to create in effect a gigantic tv studio 
were turning an arena into a hall forsberg said 
although the bulk of the transformation was completed tuesday 
workers were ready to perform some finetuning after bentsen and 
quayle visit the hall wednesday and negotiate changes with the 
nonpartisan commission that is sponsoring the debate 
theyve told us to be ready for lastminute changes said 
work foreman stan benis 
details such as the height of the lecterns being used by the 
candidates awaited their personal inspection the lectern height 
can be adjusted said stan mitchell a technical adviser to the 
commission 
schaefer said 20 employees of his decorating company which also 
helped prepare the republican convention hall in new orleans in 
august were busy laying carpet hanging the bunting and setting up 
tables for an expected 1500 reporters 
extra workers were flown in from denver as reinforcements 
partly to help with debaterelated events elsewhere in omaha 
forsberg said the biggest hassle was not getting the hall ready 
but making arrangements for tv debate coverage 
this is routine he said pointing to workers hanging 
spotlights and stringing wires then you go outside and 
downstairs and its no longer routine 
officials have installed about 500 telephone lines and made 
arrangements for additional electrical power to accommodate the tv 
satellite trucks lining the streets outside the auditorium 
when you add the television city outside we had to bring in 
extra power forsberg said 
the challenge was doubled for the debate commission which took 
on sponsorship of the second bushdukakis debate in los angeles in 
midoctober when the league of women voters withdrew as sponsors on 
monday 
im thrilled with the way things are shaping up said janet 
brown executive director of the commission i didnt really 
realize when i got on a plane this morning that wed be working on 
two of them right now instead of one 
omaha city officials cleared parking spaces around the 
auditorium for reporters and debate organizers and set up shuttle 
buses between the omaha airport and downtown the city denied 
charges that the homeless were being driven away from downtown 
streets to avoid embarrassing outoftown visitors

president roh taewoo on tuesday 
renewed his proposal for talks with his north korean counterpart 
kim il sung and said he was ready to cooperate to end the 
confrontation on the divided korean peninsula 
i make it clear that i am willing to visit the north korean 
capital of pyongyang to meet with kim il sung if the north is 
agreeable roh said in the nationally televised speech to the 
national assembly 
roh also announced an annual budget of 27 billion up 109 
percent 
rohs speech drew cool response from the main opposition group 
kim daejungs party for peace and democracy which accused the 
government of continuing to hold political prisoners 
about a dozen opposition members boycotted rohs speech others 
remained seated and refused to clap their hands when the president 
walked into the hall 
opposition leaders criticized the government for releasing what 
they said was just onetenth of political prisoners under a special 
amnesty monday more than 1000 prisoners were released including 
52 political offenders 
the government says all political prisoners have been freed 
except for dissidents convicted of violent crimes or communism 
hailing as a turning point south koreas successful role as host 
for the olympics roh said he would renew efforts to improve 
relations with north korea during his single fiveyear term in 
office which ends in 1992 
during my tenure i will endeavor to bring about a spring of 
reconciliation between the south and the north which have remained 
in a deep freeze for 40 years he said 
the 56yearold president who was elected in december did not 
disclose unification proposals but said he was willing to meet kim 
at any place and at the earliest possible date to discuss any and 
all issues 
the korean peninsula was divided into communist north korea and 
prowestern south korea in 1945 at the end of world war ii the 
two sides fought a war in the 1950s and the united states still 
maintains 42000 troops in the south parliamentary officials of 
the two koreas are to resume unification talks oct 13 at the truce 
village of panmunjom near the border the last round of talks in 
august ended without any progress 
in early september kim said he would not meet roh unless the 
south accepts north koreas unification formula which calls for 
the two korean states to keep their different political and social 
systems while operating as one nation under a confederation the 
north korean leader also demanded that the two countries 
legislatures issue a joint nonaggression agreement 
seoul officials rejected the demands as a ploy to weaken south 
korea and eventually unify the peninsula under communist rule 
roh said his country would soon propose a new unification 
formula which would be practicable and acceptable to both 
sides but he gave no details 
roh also said south korea which has recently exchanged trade 
offices with hungary and yugoslavia would continue trying to 
improve relations with the soviet union and other communist 
countries

nbcs coverage of the summer olympics dominated 
two weeks of prime time but concluded sunday with an average rating 
below the guarantee nbc gave advertisers and that will cost the 
network millions 
nbc which paid more than 300 million for the rights to the 
olympics wont comment on the loss but the wall street journal 
reported the network will have to give as much as 70 million in 
commercial time to advertisers who didnt get as high a rating as 
they were promised 
the 15 nights of olympics coverage from seoul not counting the 
opening and closing ceremonies averaged a 179 rating nbc had 
promised advertisers 212 the 1984 summer games on abc had 
averaged 232 
each rating point represents 904000 households with televisions 
nbc began giving advertisers free spots during the second week 
of the olympics a 30second spot during primetime coverage cost 
330000 
nevertheless six nights of olympics coverage took up six places 
in the top 10 in the ac nielsen ratings for the week ending oct 
2 and gave nbc a decisive win for the week with a 175 rating to 
abcs 123 and cbs 112 
the actual performance by the olympics in key groups of 
viewers was a really dominant performance whether it was as 
dominant as anticipated thats something else said gerald 
jaffe nbc vice president for research projects 
he said nbc intended to research the reason for the lowrated 
performance but would not likely make the results public the time 
difference between the united states and korea the late september 
timing of the event and a general decline in network ratings are 
likely contributors 
cbs and abc rebounded against the olympics on sunday when the 
closing ceremonies had a lowly 123 rating nbc had expected closer 
to 200 cbs 60 minutes murder she wrote and the

radioactive fallout that drifted over 
isle royale decades ago is helping researchers learn more about the 
moose and wolves that inhabit the island in lake superior 
atmospheric tests of nuclear weapons before 1963 in the western 
united states and the soviet union left traces of radioactive 
carbon 14 in vegetation on the island 
moose that consumed that vegetation began bearing traces of 
carbon 14 in their bones and teeth giving scientists a way to 
track the migration of herds said rolf peterson leader of a 
michigan technological university research team 
weve collected the bones from almost 1900 moose that have 
died from various causes on isle royale over the past 30 years 
peterson said 
we want to measure the amount of carbon 14 in their teeth and 
use it as a marker to determine each individuals year of birth and 
the herds survival patterns and population age structure 
the study might help researchers better understand the role of 
michigans estimated 1600 moose in a food chain that includes 
timber wolves peterson said 
we believe the nutritional state of moose in winter largely 
determines their lifelong ability to survive he said that in 
turn determines the amount of food available for wolves and 
ultimately wolf density 
we hope the information were gathering now will not only tell 
us more about the moose herd but when combined with existing data 
will also help us explain longterm fluctuations in the wolf 
population on isle royale 
peterson said the atmospheric bomb tests banned since 1963 
doubled the amount of carbon 14 in the atmosphere todays level is 
still about 20 percent higher than before the tests began he said 
its a reminder of how longlasting this stuff actually is 
he said weve got it in our teeth too 
peterson said the studies might also determine if the 1986 
reactor accident at the soviet unions chernobyl nuclear power 
plant affected michigans moose 
peterson who has studied moose and wolf populations for 18 
years said the threeyear study is being financed by a 150000 
grant from the national science foundation

the frustration of israeli soldiers 
in southern lebanon is reflected by a sentence scrawled in blue ink 
on the walls of an outpost living in a dangerous area until the 
end of time 
but a relative calm has settled in south lebanon in recent 
months and there are indications of change in the israeli 
involvement israeli media reports say some army units have been 
withdrawn and hint more cuts may be in the offing 
israel invaded lebanon in 1982 to strike at plo forces and ended 
three years of occupation in june 1985 it withdrew the bulk of its 
forces but left behind what foreign reports estimated to be about 
1200 troops to help the south lebanon army patrol a security zone 
north of the israeli border 
the israeli commanders attribute the improved situation to a 
reorganized and better trained south lebanon army or sla a 
2000member force of lebanese militiamen 
lt col shraga kurz an israeli liaison officer spoke 
glowingly of the slas performance in recent battles with 
iranianbacked hezbollah fighters 
we are reducing israeli units to the degree that the sla can 
take control of the area you find less and less israeli 
soldiers he said confirming published reports that an 
unspecified number of troops had already been withdrawn 
sla commander antoine lahad 61 a christian who studied at the 
ecole de guerre in france and at ft benning ga claimed 
hezbollah was losing influence as his force was building 
the strength of hezbollah is not something of its own but 
imported from iran irans failure to win the war with iraq has 
resulted in a weakening of morale of the hezbollah forces in 
lebanon he said 
the sla underwent a similar collapse in 1985 after israel 
withdrew the bulk of its troops from lebanon in the face of an 
increasingly violent shiite guerrilla campaign hezbollah overran 
seven sla positions capturing men and weapons 
but since march 1986 the sla has not lost a single position 
despite 38 attacks that have killed 160 sla men and wounded 550 
lahad said the number of attacks on his forces fell from 90 to 
about 15 a month on average and hezbollah guerrillas were no 
longer launching frontal assaults on sla positions 
his predominantly christian force has also had success in 
recruiting shiites who make up about 22 percent of the fighters 
in the last induction lahad said 80 of 170 recruits were shiite 
reporters were later introduced to a shiite officer named fuaz 
perhaps the most striking sign of israeli confidence was that 
reporters were allowed for the first time to visit the shiite 
sector where sla influence has been the weakest in the past 
in this shiite town of 10000 about five miles north of the 
border children ran to the side of the road to wave at army jeeps 
escorting journalists townspeople smiled but journalists were not 
allowed to stop for interviews 
the sla has been considered by many observers to be a token 
force but kurz said it has improved vastly in the past 18 months 
sla recruits now undergo a 12week training course three times 
longer than previously some have studied artillery infantry and 
communications at israeli bases kurz said 
economic incentives were provided to allow relatives of sla 
militiamen to take jobs in israel where 1700 work and annual 
bonuses were paid to fighters who reenlist 
within certain guidelines kurz said sla units were operating on 
their own against iranianbacked hezbollah guerrillas and israeli 
advisers were spending most of their time teaching this wasnt 
the situation a couple of years ago he said 
maj eitan commander of a unit operating in southern lebanon 
told reporters he exercised tight control over sla units and said 
it might be several years before the militiamen can be fully 
independent in accordance with israeli army regulations he did 
not give his first name 
they are given strict orders not to go into houses or shoot 
carelessly we remember sabra and chatilla he said a reference 
to the 1982 massacre of more than 800 palestinian civilians by 
israeliallied christian militiamen in beirut refugee camps 
the israeli army has refused to specify how many soldiers are in 
south lebanon now or how many have been withdrawn recently 
deputy army spokesman renaan gissin said units are sent in on 
missions that can or a few days and that very few 
are permanently stationed in lebanon

a 17yearold nigerian girl has lost her 
court fight to stay in the united states and will be returned to 
her native country despite her claims that her father will abuse 
her 
us district judge william cambridge on monday denied a court 
order sought to prevent omalara oyesijis deportation she was 
taken into custody as she left court 
her courtappointed guardian attorney susan koenigcramer had 
sought the court order cambridge also declined to delay the 
effective date of his decision so mrs koenigcramer could appeal 
miss oyesiji came to the united states in march 1987 with her 
stepmother after her father a doctor from lagos nigeria enrolled 
in courses at the university of nebraska medical center 
the girl ran away from home in september 1987 alleging her 
father had abused her physically according to court records she 
was placed in a youth group home in bellevue and remained there 
after her father and stepmother returned unexpectedly to nigeria 
last december 
the us immigration and naturalization service began 
deportation proceedings in march contending she had entered the 
country only because her father was studying here when he left 
she also should be required to leave immigration officials said 
miss oyesiji appeared at a deportation hearing in april and was 
given until july to depart voluntarily in july immigration 
officials declined her request for an extension of time to appeal 
mrs koenigcramer filed two actions in federal court to delay 
the deportation and the action was held up until mondays hearing 
during the hearing miss oyesiji testified that her father had 
beat her and her younger brother when they lived in nigeria and in 
omaha 
assistant us attorney paul madgett said miss oyesijis 
attorney failed to prove immigration officials abused their 
discretion when they denied her request for an extension of time to 
leave voluntarily that is the only basis which the judge had to 
block the administrative decision madgett said 
james m cole immigration service district director said the 
us consul general in lagos has been notified of the case and told 
about the abuse reports the consulate was asked to notify nigerian 
authorities so she will not be placed in an abusive situation

the fight over a second presidential debate 
that erupted this week between the league of women voters and the 
candidates could lead to no debates at all in 1992 
in 1976 1980 1984 and now 1988 facetoface confrontations 
between the presidential candidates have highlighted the fall 
campaigns 
it is that very success that may spell an end to the encounters 
debates are so important that campaigns do everything they can 
to control them in this grab for control the campaigns of george 
bush and michael dukakis crushed the fragile institutional 
structure that had grown up around the debates 
the campaigns moved forcefully this year to dictate every detail 
of the debate process down to the height of the lecterns and the 
seating of reporters in the hall 
there was a report in the washington post on tuesday that this 
control extended to a bush campaign effort to strongarm moderator 
jim lehrer in the middle of the first debate last month to change 
the line of questioning 
league president nancy neuman said monday her group could not be 
a party to such manipulation of the debate process and withdrew 
its sponsorship of the debate scheduled next week in los angeles 
the campaigns are now scrambling to line up the debate there 
anyway using the screen of the debate commission they control 
through the party committees 
but control of podium height and camera angles is not the key 
element of a campaigns influence on debates 
whether to debate at all is the key 
incumbent presidents and candidates leading in the polls 
often dont want to debate knowing that a single misstep can 
derail a campaign that was otherwise headed for victory 
i think were probably lucky as americans that this race is 
as close as it is said democratic consultant robert squier on 
nbcs today show because if this race were not close i 
think whoever was ahead would not be showing up in los angeles 
debates have occurred in four straight presidential elections 
because the pressure for debates was so strong that even the 
candidates could not resist it 
part of this pressure came from the media editorializing for 
debates part of it came from campaigns that decide they can 
benefit from debates 
and part of the pressure has come from those institutions with a 
stake in the debates the primary institution has been the league 
sponsor of the debates in 1976 1980 and 1984 
the television networks have also had an institutional stake 
they sponsored the 1960 debates and offer frequently to take on the 
role again the league had barely withdrawn on monday before the 
networks offered to take on the sponsorship role 
the political parties tried to grab an institutional role in the 
debates setting up a commission that sponsored the first one last 
month and which is trying to put together the second one now 
but that commission is a creature of the parties and thus of 
the campaigns its continued existence is very much in doubt 
depending on the political needs of the winner of the november 
election 
and after the experience of 1988 it is by no means certain that 
the league will want to dive back into the debate morass again 
in 1992 there will be an incumbent president named bush or 
dukakis running for reelection 
the challenger will call for debates early and often 
the question is whether the incumbent can be forced into a 
debate by a drumbeat of pressure from a neutral entity such as 
the league

the us postal service announced a 129 
billion program tuesday for investment in new facilities buildings 
and equipment over the next five years 
the spending including nearly 450 million for new vending 
machines lobby equipment and other customer service projects was 
approved by the agencys board of governors meeting in richmond 
va

and 1989 fiscal years in an effort to lower the overall total of 
the federal budget 
the new fiveyear plan includes 42 billion for new automated 
mail processing equipment to help cope with the rising tide of mail 
mail volume currently about 160 billion pieces annually is 
expected to top 225 billion by the year 2000

repair of several major mail facilities across the country 12 
billion for customer service and administration projects and 443 
million for purchase of new vehicles 
while the governors approved the overall plan for the fiveyear 
period individual projects will still require review by the board

vice presidential debate has fallen more than 200000 short of its 
goal city officials said tuesday 
kevin collison a spokesman for mayor walter calinger said 
officials had raised only 540000 toward the minimum cost of 
750000 expected for the debate between democrat lloyd bentsen and

he said the worst case cost of the debate has been estimated 
at 900000 but that city officials have no idea whether costs are 
staying within budget 
collison has said funds left over from a defunct citycounty 
lottery could be used to cover debate costs if the fund drive fails 
to meet its goal

day off tuesday after the first shuttle mission since the 
challenger disaster but go back to work wednesday for a week of 
debriefings on what nasa calls one of its most successful flights 
the astronauts returned home monday night to welcomehome 
festivities at ellington field airport that rivaled those given to 
earlier space heroes the redcarpet rally included bands balloons 
and speeches celebrating americas first manned spaceflight in 32 
months 
commander frederick hauck told the crowd of about 5000 
flagwaving wellwishers the challenger accident made us resolved 
to recover from that and we have done that 
hauck guided the 97ton shuttle to a pinpoint landing on a dry 
lakebed runway at edwards air force base calif at 937 am pdt 
monday 
discoverys fourday flight a test of the space agencys 
massive effort to redesign the shuttle after challenger exploded 
was nearly flawless from takeoff to touchdown and the shuttle 
itself suffered only some minor wear nasa officials said 
after resting for a day and visiting with their families the 
astronauts return wednesday to the johnson space center to begin 
briefings with management and ground controllers about the fourday 
mission spokesman steve nesbitt said 
they will go over all the details of the flight while their 
memories are still fresh nesbitt said 
the other crew members are pilot richard covey john m lounge 
david c hilmers and george d pinky nelson 
nesbitt said the astronauts later will make public appearances 
across the country to discuss the flight 
the flight followed more than 400 changes to the shuttle system 
many for safety reasons in one of the biggest redesign and testing 
programs ever attempted by nasa 
more than 800 million was spent on renovating the solid fuel 
rocket boosters alone it was a flawed rocket that caused 
challenger to explode 73 seconds after liftoff from cape canaveral 
fla on jan 28 1986 killing its seven crew members 
discoverys boosters were recovered from the sea and are being 
carefully disassembled at cape canaveral preliminary checks have 
showed that the boosters held up real well there were no signs 
of leaks or failures kennedy space center spokesman karl 
kristofferson said tuesday 
after the boosters are taken apart the pieces will be sent to 
utah to morton thiokol inc the manufacturer for a more detailed 
examination of their performance kristofferson said 
the shuttle was being readied tuesday for a piggyback ride back 
to florida aboard a modified boeing 747 that flight is scheduled 
for saturday 
ted ayers deputy site manager for nasas dryden flight research 
facility at edwards said discovery lost six heatshield tiles but 
this poses a danger only if they are in an area that undergoes 
intense heating during reentry 
in addition ayers said weve got some normal dings in the 
tile under the vehicle these are nicks from dirt particles on the 
lakebed

federal health authorities have decided to 
focus on allegheny county pa the pittsburgh area in their 
efforts for a voluntary doortodoor aids survey that could lead to 
a more comprehensive national survey an official said today 
public health service jim brown said the centers for disease 
control a part of phs turned their attention to pittsburgh after 
district of columbia health officials and other community leaders 
complained that the sampling planned for the capital city appeared 
to be unfairly targeted at black neighborhoods 
the plan is for federal and local health officials to approach 
residents to ask for a blood sample to test for aids in an effort 
to get a more scientific handle on how much the virus has spread 
the idea is to do the sampling much the way polls are conducted 
so a representative portion of the population is tested but 
instead of being asked questions the people selected for the 
survey will be asked to let their blood be tested for aids 
the blood samples would not be identified by name 
top federal health officials have been skeptical that enough 
people would submit to the voluntary testing to enable them to get 
a representative sampling on a national basis 
the pittsburgh study is designed not so much to learn the extent 
of aids infection in that area as to determine whether sampling 
techniques can be developed that would make a national survey 
worthwhile

the house on tuesday killed a move to 
establish procedures to review the continued detention of cubans 
who entered the united states during the 1980 mariel boatlift 
under legislation defeated by a 271144 vote mariel aliens 
denied parole would have been given the right to a hearing before 
an administrative law judge 
the hearing would have been required within 90 days after the 
end of a justice department review or within 90 days of the 
aliens detention by the immigration and naturalization service 
the legislation provided that to continue detention the 
department would have to prove that the detainee would pose a 
threat to the community or would violate reasonable conditions of 
release 
aliens released under the legislation would only have been sent 
to a halfway house or to a suitable sponsor 
mariel cubans not released under the procedures would have had 
annual reviews to determine whether circumstances justified 
reopening hearings 
more than 125000 cubans came to the united states between april 
and october 1980 when cuba opened its port of mariel for citizens 
wishing to leave the group included many people with criminal 
records and mental illness 
last year cuban detainees rioted at the oakdale correctional 
facility in louisiana and the federal prison in atlanta after the 
united states and cuba agreed to resume a migration agreement at 
the time there were 2500 cubans waiting for repatriation 
in the wake of the riots a new justice department review 
program was started for detainees designated for repatriation and 
those denied parole by the ins

amnesty international criticized the united states 
on wednesday for executing a man diagnosed as mentally retarded and 
for jailing a church worker who smuggled salvadoran aliens into the 
country 
in its annual global survey the international human rights 
organization said 25 murderers were put to death by lethal 
injection electrocution or in the gas chamber in eight states last 
year 
a total of 1982 prisoners were under sentence of death in 34 
states in december 1987 it said 
the londonbased group opposes the death penalty on grounds it 
is inhuman punishment 
its annual report said that john brogdon who was executed in 
louisiana on july 30 1987 for the rape and murder of a child had 
been diagnosed as mentally retarded with a mental age of 10 
billy mitchell executed in georgia on sept 1 1987 also was 
reported to have been suffering from a serious mental disorder the 
report said 
it said edward earl johnson a black youth convicted of killing 
a white police officer was executed despite substantial doubts 
about his guilt raised by defense lawyers further evidence in 
support of johnsons innocence has emerged since his execution in 
mississippi on may 25 1987 the report said 
amnesty international said it wrote to the governors of georgia 
and nine other states to protest marked racial disparities in 
death sentencing after a supreme court ruling on the issue in 
april 1987 
the court voted 54 to deny an appeal on behalf of a black 
prisoner warren mccleskey which cited a study showing black 
defendants convicted of killing white victims in georgia were 
several times more likely to receive death sentences than those 
convicted of killing blacks 
amnesty said it adopted church worker stacey merkt as a prisoner 
of conscience after she was convicted in 1985 of transporting and 
conspiring to transport illegal aliens 
merkt started serving an 18month sentence in janaury 1987 but 
was released in april to serve the rest of her sentence under house 
arrest which was lifted three months later it said 
amnesty international which defines a prisoner of conscience as 
a person imprisoned for nonviolent political activity said it 
believed the salvadoran aliens were in danger of being imprisoned 
tortured or unlawfully executed if sent back to their homeland 
amnesty said it found serious inadequacies in the 
investigation of alleged mistreatment of prisoners at marion 
maximumsecurity prison in illinois in november 1983 it 
recommended that the authorities conduct an independent inquiry

the united states must revamp outdated 
government regulations and tax policies to boost the ability of 
american businesses to compete internationally a new study 
concluded tuesday 
the committee for economic development a group of 200 us 
business leaders and educators said that too often american 
politicians characterize increased global trade as a threat rather 
than an opportunity 
as a result they do not recognize the need to reform outmoded 
policies that were developed in an era when most americans felt 
they had little stake in foreign economic developments the 
report said 
the study said that an increasingly integrated world economy 
posed problems for american businesses and workers it said special 
attention was needed for retraining workers in declining industries 
and improving the us education system 
in a highly integrated global economy a nation that falls 
behind in the education and training of its labor force will not 
remain a leading economic power the report said 
the group singled out the 1986 tax reform act as one example of 
legislation enacted with little attention to its impact on the 
ability of us companies to compete abroad the group criticized 
the elimination of various tax benefits for business investments 
saying these changes had raised the cost of capital in the united 
states 
tax overhaul supporters argued that the changes eliminated 
loopholes and lowered overall tax rates thus creating a fairer tax 
structure 
the study said that a host of us budget and tax policies as 
well as federal regulations need to be revised 
in addition to changes in the tax code to boost capital 
investment the report recommended changes in the international 
regulation of financial markets better protection for us 
copyrights and patents and a review of the impact antitrust laws 
have on the ability of american corporations to compete 
internationally 
the study titled new dynamics in the global economy was 
written by isaiah frank an economics professor at johns hopkins 
univeristy and william j beeman a vice president at the council 
for economic development 
owen b butler retired chairman of the proctor amp gamble corp 
is head of the nonprofit council the council receives support

a regional air traffic control center 
covering an ovalshaped area stretching from denver to indianapolis 
lost contact with about 150 planes for 27 minutes during a 
communications center flood last week federal aviation 
administration officials said 
the heavy rains sept 28 caused the outage from 723 pm to 
750 pm at southwestern bells telephone repeater station in 
shawnee a suburb of kansas city mo 
the station serves the faas kansas city air route traffic 
control center in olathe another kansas city suburb the outage 
occurred at a time when controllers were working with 250 aircraft 
many seeking instructions to avoid the heavy thunderstorms 
the controllers switched to backup radio frequencies and 
notified officials in washington who control the national airspace 
flow there officials either delayed or rerouted planes from 
across the nation that were scheduled to fly through the centers 
airspace more than 30 airliners were held on the ground at 
airports across the midwest for up to 45 minutes 
however controllers lost contact with some planes already in 
the sky because some backup radio systems failed the faa said 
monday 
it was a serious and significant outage said bob 
raynesford spokesman for the faas central region in kansas city 
he said however that there were no near collisions or other 
problems 
felton lancaster chief of the olathe center said that in many 
sectors controllers were able to switch to emergency transmitters 
but in some cases the backup lines went through the station in 
shawnee as well 
the more complicated technology gets the least little error 
can have disastrous consequences lancaster said but with 
enough backup systems built in im certain we can handle anything 
that comes along 
officials said there was a similar incident involving the 
shawnee repeater station last year faa and phone company officials 
have met to determine what might be done to prevent another outage

a michelangelo drawing of the suicide of 
cleopatra discovered only last august will go on display for the 
first time on sunday at the national gallery of art director j 
carter brown said tuesday 
the new drawing had not been noticed before because it was on 
the reverse side of a better known work that had been pasted onto a 
backing conservators decided that the wellknown drawing which 
also depicts the ancient egyptian ruler was not being preserved 
properly on the backing so it was removed 
when they did to everyones great delight they were able to 
reveal the fact that there was this drawing on the reverse which 
was also of cleopatra but in a very different mood said brown 
the wellknown drawing on the front illustrates the traditional 
story of her suicide in which she had an asp brought to her in a 
basket of figs and put it on her arm it shows the snake biting her 
breast cleopatras hair is carefully dressed and her expression is 
calm and melancholy 
the newlyfound drawing much less finished shows her hair in 
disorder her eyes staring out at the viewer and her mouth open as 
if in a scream 
bernard berenson the american critic spent much of his life in 
florence italy studying michelangelo and other painters of the 
period at the turn of this century he questioned whether the 
drawing on the front was by michelangelo suggesting that it might 
be by a collaborator he called andrea di michelangelo 
later critics have become convinced that michelangelo himself 
did the drawing 
there is no such person as andrea di michelangelo said 
giuseppina ragionieri director of the casa buonarotti the 
florence museum lodged in what was once the painters home 
she has come to washington for the exhibit michaelangelo 
draftsmanarchitect the largest showing of his graphic work ever 
mounted in this country it will be at the gallerys west building 
until dec 11 
cleopatra killed herself in the year 30 bc to avoid being 
taken to rome and put on display by the man who later became the 
emperor augustus he had defeated cleopatra and her lover mark 
antony in the great naval battle of actium the year before 
her story has been told many times in art and literature 
including shakespeares antony and cleopatra 
michelangelo drew her some time before 1534 about 70 years 
earlier than shakespeares play

fourday voyage john tip talone the shuttle processing 
director said today 
he said officials werent yet sure if the debris was ice that 
formed on the outside of the cold external fuel tank discovery had 
fewer dings to other tiles than first thought talone said

good or better as any vehicle weve brought in here

lawyers for the bible speaks fundamentalist church 
told a court tuesday the first amendment should have protected it 
from a bankrupting order to return 66 million to an heiress who 
claimed the pastor exploited her 
attorney norman roy grutman told the us 1st circuit court of 
appeals that elizabeth dovydenas was a healthy welleducated 
woman with a long history of charity and religioninspired 
giftgiving 
mrs dovydenas whose father heads the daytonhudson department 
store chain was depicted by her attorney gordon walker as a 
susceptible trusting person who formed dependent attachments 
and relied heavily on her psychotherapist 
walker said that mrs dovydenas was so enamored of her 
grandfather a presbyterian minister that she was confused to 
learn he was not part of the holy trinity 
grutman argued that mrs dovydenas was no more manipulated by 
the bible speaks pastor the rev carl h stevens jr than she was 
by the many other controlling influences in her life 
grutman termed mrs dovydenas an apostate who had been 
fully committed to the church before she became a faith 
breaker he called her donations of money to bible speaks an 
expression of religious solicitation that should be protected 
under the first amendment like all free speech 
mrs dovydenas sued the church for donations she made as a 
parishioner from 1982 to 1986 contending she was lied to and that 
her unquestioning trust was exploited by stevens the churchs 
founder the us bankruptcy court ordered the church to return her 
money in april 1987 and the 66 million award was upheld by a 
federal court judge 
walker described stevens as plotting a vicious scheme 
designed to foster mrs dovydenas dependence on him and create an 
atmosphere of fear walker said that stevens told mrs 
dovydenas that her family was demonic 
last march mrs dovydenas won ownership of the churchs 65acre 
headquarters in lenox with a 323 million bid at an auction in 
federal bankruptcy court she and her husband jonas dovydenas 
have said that they plan to sell some of the church property to 
developers and turn some of it into a school and a community center 
for the wealthy town the summer home of the boston symphony 
orchestra 
the bible speaks had claimed 1200 members worldwide until it 
disbanded in the summer of 1987 stevens has since moved to the 
baltimore area where the church has been revived under the name 
the greater grace

a white policeman who said his firing 
by riviera beachs blackdominated government was racially 
motivated has won a 450000 settlement 
the city council agreed monday night to settle a lawsuit filed 
by steven j langevin who was dismissed in 1983 
langevin who is white claimed the city used him as a scapegoat 
after complaints about a june 1983 traffic stop involving the son 
of an influential city official the complainants city manager 
police chief and all five members of the council were black 
a palm beach county circuit court jury agreed in 1986 with 
langevins claim and awarded him 540000 an appellate court last 
year upheld the decision but the state supreme court said last 
week it would hear the citys appeal 
that encouraged langevins attorney to negotiate the settlement 
city attorney thomas palmer said at palmers urging the council 
unanimously approved the settlement 
it was all something that happened long ago councilman 
james goode said the question now is to settle it in the 
cheapest way 
palmer said the council should approve the settlement because if 
the city lost the appeal it might have to pay more than 1 million 
langevin and other officers stopped a car driven by derrick 
mccray son of an influential city official and civil rights 
activist while searching for a robbery suspect 
thencity manager william wilkins fired langevin on july 13 
1983 he was rehired briefly because the case had not been 
referred to a police review board and was fired again aug 27 
wilkins citing several incidents besides the traffic stop said 
he dismissed langevin because of actions that contributed to the 
tarnishing of the professional image of the department 
langevin did not seek reinstatement to the force

about 5000 yugoslav workers 
demanding the resignation of the government demonstrated tuesday in 
front of the parliament and tried to force their way inside 
protesters chanted we are going in but hundreds of police 
stationed in front of the building stopped them from entering 
the protesters marched about 10 miles from an industrial 
belgrade suburb to the legislature to protest low wages and falling 
living standards 
demonstrators booed and jeered deputy premier milos 
milosavljevic and parliament president dusan popovski when they 
tried to address the crowd the workers dispersed peacefully after 
four hours following an address by serbias communist party chief 
slobodan milosevic 
your demands are the demands of the entire yugoslav working 
class said milosevic who promised that personnel changes would 
be demanded at an oct 17 central committee session you can be 
sure that we will not betray you 
workers of several enterprises including an engine and tractor 
factory at rakovica six miles south of belgrade put down their 
tools and staged the march demanding a 100 percent wage increase 
according to a statement read by one of their leaders 
demonstrators also demanded an urgent session of the parliament 
which should unseat the government of premier branko mikulic 
yugoslavia has been faced with increasing social and labor 
unrest in the face of the worst economic crisis in the countrys 
postwar history inflation is running at 217 percent and the 
foreign debt is 21 billion 
the labor unrest has worsened since may when government 
austerity measures imposed hefty wage cuts and allowed substantial 
price increases 
according to figures published by the state tanjug news agency 
tuesday salaries in yugoslavia have dropped by 24 percent this 
year and living standards of yugoslavs have plunged to the level of 
mid1960s the rakovica workers earn about 100 a month 
before being interrupted milosavljevic only managed to say i 
understand the grievances of the workers and that the government 
was willing to resign if parliament decides accordingly 
you dont understand anything how much is your salary 
the crowd yelled back at him 
officials claim there is no alternative to the marketoriented 
program worked out together with the international monetary fund if 
the country wants to lower inflation and revive its faltering 
economy 
adoption of the program was a condition set by the imf and other 
creditors for rescheduling yugoslavias foreign debt and obtaining 
new credits 
however the government is negotiating with the imf on ways to 
amend the program by allowing wage increases for profitable 
companies 
the demonstrators calmed down after milosevic urged them to 
return to work they agreed chanting we believe you slobodan 
and workers are with you

the government tuesday warned that 
political demonstrations could hinder talks between authorities and 
labor leaders demanding the legalization of solidarity 
about 1000 students and university employees rallied at warsaw 
university in support of legalization of the banned trade union 
federation and of the independent association of students 
the students raised the solidarity banner on the main gate of 
the university and chanted solidarity 
university employees and faculty members also demanded pay 
raises of 60 percent to compensate for inflation and complained 
about poor teaching facilities 
in his weekly news conference government spokesman jerzy urban 
said demonstrations and announcements of new solidarity chapters 
run counter to building a climate of reason realism and mutual 
trust 
organizers of such events demonstrations should ask the 
question do they make the process of agreement easier or more 
difficult if they bother to think they should conclude they make 
it more difficult and will play a role of blockers urban said 
authorities agreed to hold talks with labor representatives on 
the future of solidarity after a wave of strikes ended sept 3 
urban said progress had been made in preparing for the talks which 
mediator andrzej stelmachowski said will probably begin oct 17 
solidarity led by lech walesa was crushed by security forces 
in 1981 and outlawed in 1982 
the demonstration took place on the university grounds in front 
of the library where university rector grzegorz bialkowski told 
the demonstrators i am here together with you not only because i 
thought employees have the right to gather legally and express 
their opinion about their problems but also to prove to you i want 
to be together with the university community 
the protesters dispersed peacefully after about an hour

the interior department on tuesday said its 
agents had destroyed 51 percent more marijuana plants this summer 
than they did in all of 1987 
a department announcement said law enforcement officers were not 
sure whether the increase meant that drug activity actually is 
increasing on federal lands or whether it merely reflects the 
departments intensified enforcement efforts 
the department is in charge of the national parks battlefields 
monuments seashores and recreation areas indian reservations 
wildlife refuges and other public land mostly in the west 
the statistics do not include the national forests of the 
agriculture departments forest service all spokesmen for law 
enforcement officers of the forest service were out of town their 
office said 
interior agencies seized and destroyed 166000 marijuana plants 
from midjune to midseptember this year compared with 110000 
plants in all of last year the department said 
department officers eradicated plants at 432 sites this summer 
a number spokesman alan levitt said represented a substantial 
increase over activity in 1987 though he did not have a comparable 
departmentwide figure for the previous year 
by way of example he said the bureau of land management dealt 
with 234 sites this summer vs 232 in all of 1987 
the statement quoted interior secretary donald p hodel as 
saying he was delighted by the interior departments contribution 
to the antidrug campaign 
hodel said visitors deserve credit for increased detection and 
were directly responsible for many cases including the largest 
one the destruction of 20000 plants just outside the boundary of 
hawaii volcanoes national park in august 
agents are finding fewer large open fields but many smaller 
wellconcealed plots consisting of a few dozen to several hundred 
plants often hidden under a forest canopy to avoid detection 
from the air or camouflaged with netting hodel said 
for the first time interior agents are using the landsat iv 
satellite to locate high potential areas for enforcement the 
department said 
the agents report that growers seemed to be suffering from the 
drought just like legitimate farmers 
one site in yosemite national park in california yielded 1500 
feet of polyvinyl chloride tubing that was feeding water from a 
makeshift dam to five separate plots

american samoas former delegate to congress 
drew a fiveto15month prison term tuesday for participating in a 
payrollpadding scheme that prosecutors say earned him 39000 
fofo if sunia a democrat who served almost four terms in the 
house was sentenced on his guilty plea to conspiring with his 
chief aide matthew iuli to defraud the government of 130920 
through false payroll claims 
us district judge stanley harris rejected a defense contention 
that sunia passively accepted proceeds from a scheme started by 
iuli without his direct knowledge 
it is inconceivable to me with your obvious abilities that 
you werent familiar with what was happening the judge told 
sunia what happened here is a very serious matter the padding 
of a congressional payroll over an extended period of time 
before he was sentenced sunia told the judge i have come to 
understand the meaning of shame and fear i have made apologies 
to my people and i hope they will forgive me 
sunia who said he was prepared to accept whatever punishment 
the judge imposed offered to teach in american samoa as community 
service in lieu of imprisonment 
sunia 51 said he wanted to help continue to build a better 
community and begin to atone for the wrong that i have done 
the former lawmaker who could have received a fiveyear 
sentence and a 250000 fine has agreed to pay restitution of 
65000 under the terms of the plea bargain he made with 
prosecutors 
under federal parole guidelines sunia would become eligible for 
parole after serving five months 
according to the charge to which both sunia and iuli pleaded 
guilty on aug 3 78 paychecks were issued between february 1983 
and august 1986 to people falsely listed as members of sunias 
staff 
prosecutors said iuli who received a threemonth prison 
sentence on monday used some of the proceeds to reimburse himself 
for expenses he incurred working for sunia 
other money was used to entertain constituents who expected 
sunia to pay for their hotel accomodations and meals while they 
were visiting the nations capital according to prosecutors 
assistant us attorney robert andary said sunias case was 
different because the former lawmaker did receive a very 
substantial personal benefit from this scheme 
andary said sunia betrayed the trust that was put in him by 
the people of american samoa by approving the scheme and 
pocketing some 39000 from the ghost employee scheme 
the money sunia took helped him purchase a house a car and pay 
for air travel for his family to and from samoa andary said 
defense attorney earl j silbert urged harris to take into 
consideration sunias passive personality which he contended 
explained the defendants failure to question the source of the 
money he received from the scheme 
quoting from a letter written to the judge by a samoan silbert 
said a high chief never questions where things come from 
but andary said this explanation was a way to avoid 
responsibility by way of putting the full blame on mr iuli 
sunia is consciously trying to avoid his own involvement in the 
offense 
sunia resigned his seat in congress on sept 6 the day before 
the house ethics committee was to hold a disciplinary hearing on 
his case as a delegate he was allowed to vote in legislative 
committees but not on the house floor

the state department said tuesday it had 
received and welcomed assurances from chile that the outcome of a 
plebiscite on president augusto pinchoet will be respected 
we are of course very hopeful spokeswoman phyllis oakley 
said we will continue to closely monitor events in chile 
the voting on wednesday is on whether to accept or reject the 
generals bid for another eight years in the presidency if he 
fails to get a majority pinochet is supposed to call free 
elections at the end of next year 
secretary of state george p shultz met last week in new york 
with chilean foreign minister ricardo garcia and underscored the 
united states favored a free and fair election 
other us officials have made similar statements 
mrs oakley at the state departments daily briefing tuesday 
said an official commitment had been provided by the chilean 
embassy in washington and the ministry of interior in santiago 
that the plebiscite will be carried out as scheduled and that its 
result will be respected 
but she said concerns expressed by her monday about the 
circumstances surrounding the voting were based on sound 
information 
meanwhile us ambassador harry g barnes jr who will end his 
assignment in november told the new york times in an interview in 
santiago that he would leave happier if pinochet were defeated in 
the plebiscite 
i look forward to coming back in march 1990 when the first 
democratically elected president would be inaugurated if the no 
wins rather than having to wait until 1997 the 62yearold 
ambassador was quoted as saying 
barnes who was an alsoran last year in the selection of a new 
us ambassador to the soviet union is nearing the end of a 
38year diplomatic career 
at this point he said i think the no will win if the 
process doesnt get interrupted that opens the way to free 
elections our whole approach has been to promote a rapid return to 
democracy so it would be a nice way to leave knowing that step 
had been taken 
the times said barnes was credited with helping to make 
possible through continued us pressure a relatively free 
campaign environment and reasonable assurance of an honest 
proceeding on wednesday 
mrs oakley asked about the interview said i simply am not 
aware of those remarks 
she also reiterated that what we have said all along is that 
we are in favor of a process of a plebiscite of a free expression 
of the chilean people we have never expressed in any way our 
opinion on what that vote ought to be that remains clearly our 
position

president virgilio barco withdrew a 
peace proposal to leftist guerrillas because of a wave of rebel 
attacks a cabinet minister said tuesday 
it is incomprehensible that the answer by subversive groups to 
a generous peace proposal would be so violent and criminal the 
minister of government cesar gaviria trujillo said in a broadcast 
interview 
trujillo is in charge of internal security in colombia 
last month the president offered a ceasefire negotiations 
pardons to guerrillas who surrendered and a chance for rebel 
leaders to speak before congress 
all six of colombias leftist guerrilla groups rejected the plan 
gaviria was particularly critical of the countrys largest 
guerrilla group the colombian revolutionary armed forces known by 
its spanish acronym as the farc 
farc attacks killed 12 soldiers six policemen and three 
civilians on sunday and monday the defense ministry said 
the government authorizes full institutional support for the 
armed forces to confront the guerrillas because weakness or 
complacency doesnt result in peace gaviria said in an interview 
with the bogota radio station caracol 
justice minister guillermo plazas said the guerrillas answer to 
the olive branch offered by president barco has been attacks on 
the army blowing up of pipelines and setting off bombs 
the farc has used a ceasefire during the last four years to 
cheat the government by increasing its strength plazas said in a 
broadcast interview with the bogota radio station rcn 
leftist guerrillas have been fighting the government since 1960 
the farc signed a truce with the government of former president 
belisario betancur four years ago there has been sporadic fighting 
between the farc and government security forces during the truce 
another guerrilla group the national liberation army has blown 
up the countrys main oil pipeline 85 times in the last two years 
on saturday the guerrilla group blew up the pipeline which 
carries 225000 barrels of oil a day from the canon limon field in 
the northeast state of arauca 
on sept 28 the national liberation army set off a bomb in 
bogota as the car of a texaco executive passed by the executive 
john buttle a canadian was not injured 
in july the national liberation army kidnapped the owner of 
general pipe co of houston jake gambini there has been no word 
on gambinis fate

convicted rapist gary dotson should be pardoned 
because new scientific evidence proves he was imprisoned for a 
crime that never happened his lawyer said tuesday 
in 1985 his accuser now a new hampshire housewife said she 
lied in 1977 when she said dotson raped her 
new hightechnology dna tests of blood and semen have 
concluded positively that mr dotson is eliminated excluded from 
the forensic sample found in cathleen crowell webbs panties his 
attorney thomas breen told the illinois prisoner review board 
during a clemency hearing 
but the cook county states attorneys office said a pardon 
should not be granted because the tests were not reliable and would 
not be admissible in illinois courts 
it is important that dotson not be given the extraordinary 
measure of pardon without more information on this new scientific 
technology said assistant states attorney gayle shines 
paul klincar chairman of the prisoner review board said the 
panel would make a recommendation to gov james thompson in two to 
three weeks and the governor would make the final decision 
the governor commuted dotsons 25 to 50year rape sentence in 
1985 to time served but rejected a request for clemency saying he 
did not believe mrs webbs recantation 
dotson was released from prison in august after serving six 
months for a parole violation and is enrolled in a residential 
alcohol rehabilitation program he was not at the hearing tuesday 
but his attorney said the new tests prove mr dotson was in 
fact arrested convicted and sentenced for a crime that never 
happened 
dotson was convicted of rape in 1979 he had served six years 
when mrs webb came forward and said she had made up the story 
while a suburban teenager to conceal a sexual encounter she had 
had with her boyfriend 
genetic tests conducted by dr edward blake a california 
forensic expert on dotsons sperm and blood and semen on mrs 
webbs underwear showed the semen could have come from 5 percent of 
the male population but not from dotson breen said 
blakes tests were different than dna examinations performed on 
the underwear earlier this year in england breen said the british 
tests were inconclusive because the 11yearold sample was too old 
to yield results 
mark stolorow director of research and development for the 
illinois state police division of forensic services and 
identification said he agreed with blakes findings 
but shines argued that dotson might not have left semen in the 
underwear 
if the board determines that dotson was not the donor of the 
semen that does not mean that mrs webb was not raped she said 
just as you dont need fingerprints to prove a robbery occurred 
you dont need semen to prove a rape occurred 
breen rejected the idea saying prosecutors had never before 
suggested the theory 
since dotson was first released from prison he has had several 
scrapes with the law he was jailed in 1987 for violating parole 
and being convicted of drunken driving 
on christmas eve thompson freed dotson again in what the 
governor called a lastchance deal 
two days later dotson was arrested in a bar fight and in 
february the prison review board ordered him to serve six months 
for a second parole violation

a supreme court justice on tuesday rejected an 
emergency request by the burlington northern railroad co designed

justice harry a blackmun refused to reinstate an antistrike 
injunction that was lifted on sept 30 by the 8th us circuit

the interstate commerce commission 
the union threatened to strike after failing to block the sale

former miss america bess myerson and her 
codefendants in a divorcefixing conspiracy trial decided they 
could buy and sell justice a federal prosecutor claimed tuesday 
this is a case about money greed and abuse of power 
assistant us attorney david lawrence told the jury in his opening 
statement 
miss myerson 64 miss america 1945 was the citys cultural 
affairs commissioner before the scandal known locally as the 
bess mess forced her resignation 
describing miss myerson as one of the celebrities of new 
york lawrence told the jurors this case is about whether such 
privileged people are above the law 
also on trial are miss myersons boyfriend carl andy 
capasso 43 and former state supreme court justice hortense gabel 
75 who presided over part of capassos bitter divorce from his 
wife nancy 
the three face five counts each of conspiracy mail fraud and 
briberelated charges for an alleged scheme to slash capassos 
weekly child support and alimony payments 
miss myerson is accused of giving a 19000ayear city job to 
mrs gabels daughter sukhreet who was then 34 to get the judge 
to reduce capassos temporary support payments to his wife 
miss myerson also is charged with obstructing justice for 
allegedly trying to keep sukhreet gabel from testifying truthfully 
before a federal grand jury 
capassos attorney insisted in his opening that the case was 
unjustified stemming from a scorned wifes allegations 
there was no fury as intense and meanspirited as that of 
nancy capasso lawyer jay goldberg told the jury 
miss myerson was named a corespondent in the capasso divorce 
they are not on trial because of their affair said 
lawrence they are not on trial because of mr capassos divorce 
they are on trial because of the use of a city position of the 
city payroll to pay for a bribe 
ms gabel who has been described in court papers as emotionally 
fragile will testify for the government said lawrence 
at times ladies and gentlemen sukhreet gabel may not be a 
pretty picture in fact some of the things she has to say will 
shock you said lawrence without elaborating 
he said ms gabel initially refused to cooperate with 
prosecutors but eventually agreed to testify even if that meant 
her testimony might be damaging to her mother 
lawrence described capasso and miss myerson as a millionaire 
sewer contractor and his mistress who readily shared his wealth 
once a leading city sewer and water contractor capasso is serving 
a threeyear prison term for an unrelated tax conviction 
mrs gabel he said sold the courthouse not for money but 
out of concern that she had for her 34yearold daughter her 
only child 
myerson and capassos obsession with the divorce coincided 
with judge gabels obsession for finding employment for her 
daughter said the prosecutor 
if convicted of all charges miss myerson would face a maximum 
penalty of 30 years in prison and 513000 in fines capasso and 
mrs gabel would face up to 25 years in prison and 263000 in 
fines

serious mishaps over 28 years at a government 
plant in south carolina that produces materials for nuclear weapons 
were kept secret for national security reasons and not reported to 
washington federal officials said tuesday 
but the situation is changing in part due to pressure from 
congress they said 
one senior energy department official has compared the attitude 
toward safety at the savannah river facility near aiken sc to 
that which led to the explosion of the shuttle challenger on jan 
28 1986 
there has always been a mind set a culture that we are doing 
work that is important for national security and perhaps that may 
override any obligation toward public accountablility will 
callicott a spokesman for the department of energy said tuesday 
since taking office in 1985 said callicott energy secretary 
john herrington has given heightened attention to the area of 
environmental safety and health for the first time placing these 
issues in the hands of an assistant secretary 
ei du pont nemours amp co runs the savannah river facility 
under contract for the energy department the plant which has five 
reactors produces plutonium and tritium which are used in making 
nuclear weapons 
according to a 1985 memorandum 30 reactor incidents of the 
greatest significance occurred there and were not disclosed to 
the public 
one of the most serious was the melting in november 1970 of a 
rod used to start an atomic chain reaction causing radioactive 
contamination of an adjacent room it took 900 people three months 
to clean up the contamination according to the memo which does 
not specify whether radioactivity escaped from the facility 
energy department officials said on friday that they had not 
been informed of the incidents but on monday senior department 
spokesman c anson franklin said those statements were incorrect 
and that the incidents had been reported to the departments 
regional office in aiken 
he said that the information apparently had not been relayed to 
headquarters from the regional office 
the reactors at savannah river were closed after the most recent 
incident in august and had been scheduled to reopen on tuesday 
but energy department officials assured members of congress last 
week that production would not resume until safety was assured 
possibly after 30 to 45 days 
if they restart those things without having briefed us and 
without having convinced us they have solved the safety and health 
issues they will be in serious trouble in the congress said 
rep mike synar dokla 
synar chairman of the energy environment and natural resources 
subcommittee of the government affairs committee held hearings on 
the savannah river facility last friday 
he reacted angrily tuesday to assertions that national security 
considerations ever justified keeping mishaps secret at savannah 
river 
just because they claim it is national security doesnt make 
it national security he said i didnt know that the health 
and safety of the workers and the surrounding citizens was a 
national security issue 
synar challenged assertions that herrington had improved the 
energy departments system 
they have set up a system that rewards managers in the field 
for keeping the lid on bad news said synar 
i think that there are good people at the energy department 
that want to make safety a priority he said that attitude 
starts at the top and i havent seen it it is very clear that 
headquarters has not been supportive of that there has not been a 
system set up that made the operational or field offices 
accountable 
sen john glenn dohio chairman of the senate governmental 
affairs committee also held hearings on problems at savannah river 
last week and sharply criticized the energy department and du pont 
officials at the energy department which builds nuclear weapons 
for the pentagon said that the penchant for secrecy began in the 
days of the manhattan project the program to develop atomic 
weapons during world war ii 
although the attitude has changed at the top the message has 
not percolated down said the officials 
discussing the power pulse at savannah river in august richard 
starostecki deputy assistant secretary for safety health and 
quality assurance wrote that the issue was not whether the 
reactor was out of control this time it was not 
the more serious issue deals with an institutional problem and 
attitudes toward safety starostecki said in a sept 16 memo that 
was released at the house panels hearing on friday 
there are currently some managers within the department with 
an attitude toward production reactor safety which on the face 
seems to be similar to that which existed in the space program 
prior to the challenger accident he said

virus 
during a contentious town hall meeting with homosexual leaders

president reagan on tuesday signed emergency 
congressional legislation that extends by six months a federal 
program providing costly medicine for indigent victims of aids 
the white house said in a brief statement that reagan had 
approved the bill which authorizes appropriations of 15 million to 
continue supplies of the drug azt to such victims through next 
march 31 the program would have expired at midnight last friday 
but the house passed the senate bill and sent it to the white house 
the legislation avoids an interruption in the federal program 
providing azt to victims who cannot afford the treatment which can 
cost more than 600 a month azt is the only drug approved by the 
food and drug administration for use in combating aids 
the bill doesnt provide money specifically for azt but 
authorizes federal spending of 15 million for the next six months 
health and human services secretary otis bowen has indicated he 
would find money in existing programs until the next congress can 
act and the only supplier of the drug burroughs wellcome co has 
said it would provide 5 million of the drug at no cost 
a year ago the average cost of azt for an aids victim was 850 
to 900 a month the price dropped early this year to about 600 a 
month 
the drug which is taken by 5000 to 6000 indigent aids 
sufferers is believed by some scientists to stop the aids virus 
from multiplying inside a cell 
aids or acquired immune deficiency syndrome is a contagious 
disease that attacks the bodys immune system rendering it 
incapable of resisting other diseases and infections the virus 
most often is spread through close contact with blood blood 
products or semen from infected persons 
as of sept 26 1988 aids had been diagnosed in 74447 
americans of whom more than half or 41925 have died since june 
1 1981 according to the federal centers for disease control no 
one is known to have recovered from aids

after nearly 65 earth 
orbits discoverys postflight condition was as good or better 
than any space shuttle although debris gouged six heatshield 
tiles apparently during liftoff a nasa official said tuesday 
there were few dings to other tiles and no damage to the 
orbiters brakes landing gear or tires john tip talone said 
discovery sat inside the 100foottall matedemate device a 
framework where it gets serviced for a piggyback jet ride home 
saturday to florida 
the crews are working and they will work round the clock 
until the orbiter leaves said ted ayers deputy site manager for 
the national aeronautics and space administrations dryden flight 
research facility here 
discovery landed monday on the hard clay bed of rogers dry lake 
at this mojave desert air base capping a nearly flawless flight 
that was americas first manned space mission since the challenger 
tragedy in 1986 
the vehicle looks beautiful talone the shuttle processing 
director said during a news conference it looks probably as 
good or better as any vehicle weve brought in here 
six tiles near the right wing must be replaced because of a 
12inchlong 6inchwide 1inchdeep gouge apparently caused by 
debris during the shuttles launch last thursday talone said he 
added that the tiles werent missing as ayers said earlier 
talone said officials werent yet sure if the debris was ice 
that formed on the outside of the shuttles external tank which 
contains supercold liquid fuel 
theres a minor number of traditional dings on some other 
tiles caused by the impact of tiny particles during liftoff and 
landing he added 
after preliminary inspection found no damage the shuttles 
brakes were shipped to bf goodrich in ohio for a closer look he 
said the brakes were improved because of brake and tire damage 
during previous missions 
talone said nasa workers havent identified the cause of the 
trouble with discoverys cooling system flash evaporators a 
problem that made the astronauts endure temperatures in the 80s 
during their flight 
nasa plans for discovery to leave edwards early saturday 
arriving at kennedy space center before dark following a single 
stop near san antonio texas talone said 
the matedemate device is a redpainted steel trusswork 
structure in which the 193000pound orbiter is serviced then 
hoisted 60 feet and placed atop a modified boeing 747 jet that will 
fly it back to cape canaveral fla 
tasks to prepare discovery for the trip home include 
deactivating fuel cells photographing tile damage and replacing 
the gouged tiles purging main engines and orbital maneuvering 
engines and attaching locks to prevent control flaps from 
fluttering during the piggyback flight 
discoverys next mission is scheduled to start feb 18 three 
months after atlantis planned nov 17 liftoff with a classified 
defense department payload on its fiveday february flight 
discovery will deploy another communications satellite like the one 
it placed in orbit last thursday

george bush on tuesday proposed 
creation of a federally supported foundation to encourage americas 
youth to volunteer their help for the less fortunate 
i want our affluent to help our poor the republican 
presidential candidate said in a speech unveiling his proposal for 
a yes to america foundation i want the young men and women of 
our treelined suburbs to get on a bus or the subway or the 
metro and go into the cities where the want is 
bush blended his proposal with a dose of the liberalbashing 
rhetoric that marks his campaign for the white house he predicted 
that his critics would sneer that a national voluntary effort 
just wont be as good as a new multibillion dollar program 
bush outlined his proposal for a youth in service to america 
foundation as he worked to cement support i northern california a 
region that advisers say is up for grabs in the white house 
campaign 
bush dusted off his familiar attack style of campaigning later 
in the day when he blasted the liberal governor of masachusetts 
at a sundrenched rally on the steps of the riverside county 
courthouse in southern california 
he said dukakis had criticized the threeyear 25 percent income 
tax cut enacted during the reagan administration but promised 
im not going to let them take that away from us 
he arranged a stop for later in the day in new mexico 
bushs sacramento speech marked an effort to flesh out his 
campaign call for a kinder gentler nation and also combat the 
democrats portrayal of him as an uncaring member of the upper 
class 
he said some kids have 40 jeans and 50 sneakers while 
others live lives of utter desolation in the poorest 
neighborhoods one group should help the other he said 
expressing the hope that the work itself the labor of love is 
the reward 
bush said that a quarter century of massive federal spending 
programs has demonstrated that we cant buy our way out of the 
problem 
bush said he would serve as chairman of his proposed a youth in 
service to america foundation 
an aide to bush deborah steelman said the vice president 
envisioned a 100 million annual federal contribution for the 
program she said the foundation would set broad guidelines for 
community activities but local leaders would have discretion in the 
types of programs they set up she said some activities could 
involve payment 
bush said current volunteer programs that work well could be 
expanded and others could be created he suggested that some 
participants would travel to the inner city ghettos to read to 
children there 
some of the poor dont speak english and cant fill out forms 
for their children to go to school some women need help and advice 
on what to do about a repeatedly abusive husband they dont know 
that there are private organizations that can help he said 
government we must finally admit isnt the answer bush 
said and it isnt enough to say im a republican and life is 
imperfect 
he conceded he may have been confusing when he spoke in his 
campaign debate of a thousand points of light and used 
tuesdays speech to explain himself 
in a national movement such as yes to america i am saying 
add your light to the sum of light he said give to those 
who cross your path and enter your life

police in laos have captured two 
americans who said they planned to distribute dollar bills stamped 
with a reward offer for any us military personnel still held 
captive in indochina 
ross petzing a us embassy spokesman said donna long of 
jacksonville nc and another american were being held at ban 
sing samphan in the southern laotian province of champasak 
jerry kiley of the national steering committee for american war 
veterans identified the second american as jim copp of hamstead 
nc another committee member john nevin said in washington that 
neither american had a visa to enter laos 
state department spokeswoman phyllis oakley told reporters in 
washington that the us consulate in udorn thailand confirmed 
that lao authorities detained two americans monday on the thailao 
border 
the americans had rented a boat and were on the mekong river 
the thailao border does not run along the middle of the river but 
evidently follows a varying line and the americans may have 
accidentally floated into lao territory said mrs oakley we 
are waiting for the lao authorities to inform us whether the 
americans will be held and charged or released our counsel has not 
yet met with them 
they looked so sad said pornthipa vajarabukka a thai hotel 
manager who crossed the mekong river into laos to see them tuesday 
ms pornthipa said she took the americans clothing food and 
cigarettes but was not allowed to speak to them 
petzing said we have advised our embassy in vientiane of the 
arrest and our embassy is checking with lao authorities to 
determine what has transpired 
on sunday ms long told the associated press she and copp 
planned to drop plastic bags containing stamped dollars and other 
currency into the river and pass out money in villages along 
laotian bank of the mekong she revealed the plan on condition it 
not be revealed until the two left laos or were captured 
each bill bears a message offering a 24 million reward to 
anyone delivering an american prisoner of war to the international 
red cross 
ms pornthipa said the americans were held in a small house in 
ban sing samphan she said laotian authorities told her monday they 
would be freed within three days 
she said the management of her hotel in ubon felt some 
responsibility because the americans made contact with it before 
starting the trip to the mekong which forms a boundary with 
thailand and flows to both cambodia and vietnam 
the reward is being offered to cambodians laotians and 
vietnamese through the national steering committee for american war 
veterans a private group the committee says the money was pledged 
by 21 congressmen and the american defense institute another group 
concerned with missing soldiers 
the united states lists 2393 americans as still missing in 
action in the indochina war which ended in 1975 the governments 
of vietnam laos and cambodia say no americans are held in their 
countries 
kiley project director for american war veterans claimed 600

graduates of a police academy that is under 
fire for a recent rash of cadet illnesses met tuesday to defend the 
institution against accusations of abusive physical training 
the training is necessarily tough said a spokeswoman for 
the group amherst patrolman colleen griswold it brings out your 
inner strength it does not turn you into a gestapo henchman 
griswold read from a statement while 28 other graduates from a 
halfdozen classes stood behind her on the steps of the agawam 
academy 
at least 16 cadets were hospitalized for dehydration and 
exhaustion after one trainee collapsed on the first day of 
training sept 19 the academy was closed on the third day of 
training and classes were moved to a national guard armory because 
of suspicions surrounding the drinking water 
the water has been declared untainted by state environmental 
officials and attention has turned toward the degree of physical 
exertion demanded of the cadets 
one of the cadets timothy shepard of pittsfield remained in a 
coma at a pittsburgh hospital tuesday 15 days after his collapse 
and a week after a liver transplant although his sisterinlaw 
said he appeared to turn his head and recognize his mother and 
pregnant wife 
he may be starting to come out of the coma said becky 
shepard 
the former cadets said they were mystified by the maladies that 
hit a third of a class of 50 cadets under the leadership of one 
state trooper who had formerly served as secondincommand and an 
assistant who had previously taught water safety at the academy 
the commandant john m richardson and his assistant charles 
blake gilmore were reassigned tuesday at their request 
griswold called gilmore as a qualified sensitive individual 
i am terrified of water and he made me feel comfortable in it 
she also had no complaints about richardson from her 14week 
class which ended in january she was the only woman to graduate 
from her class which lost a dozen cadets during the course from an 
original group of 42 
a cadet who dropped out of the current training program said 
last week that the recruits exercised for more than 10 hours the 
first day on only a few small cups of water cadets who dropped out 
of previous classes spoke of being pushed to their emotional and 
physical limits 
griswold defended the academys socalled stress training and 
said she was never denied water or pushed beyond her limits the 
training is physically demanding but not physically abusive she 
said 
some people come here young and immature never having been 
yelled at on the street or in their lives griswold said the 
training helps us to be able to have patience at trying moments 
as police officers she said we know how much patience it 
takes not to lash out when people call you vicious names insult 
your mother spit on you or strike you we learned to stand fast 
and tolerate that in this very program that has come under fire 
the academys training practices will come under review later 
this week by a panel of doctors exercise researchers and law 
enforcement administrators appointed by gov michael s dukakis 
a team of investigators from the state attorney generals office 
already is questioning witnesses about the case

the minister of a 218yearold church 
says hes deeply disappointed his parishioners have decided to go 
ahead with plans to cover the historic building with vinyl siding 
they might as well polyurethane the tombstones or put 
astroturf in the front yard the rev john n svendsen of 
westminster congregational church said after monday nights 93 
vote 
but i also realize that the most important thing is that 
the gospel of jesus christ will be preached whether the church is 
vinyl or painted svendsen said and that will not change 
church members decided in august to put vinyl siding on the 
quaint white church the fourtholdest church or meeting house in 
connecticut as a way to preserve the building without the expense 
of painting so often 
but historians contend the move will harm the churchs 
appearance and could ultimately be destructive by hiding structural 
problems such as moisture damage 
work is expected to begin in november and will cost about 8000 
the church was founded in 1770 by capt sherebiah butts and his 
seven sons forty to 50 people attend services regularly today 
although only about 12 are voting members 
four large pillars grace the portico and a cross sits atop a 
squared steeple the church has been altered significantly several 
times since it was built but retains many original touches 
including a hanging balcony wideboard flooring and handhewn 
details in wooden pews 
outside stands a granite whipping post once used for public 
discipline behind the church more than two dozen revolutionary 
war soldiers are buried 
representatives of the canterbury historical society and the 
connecticut historical society urged the churchs voting members 
monday night to abandon the vinyl plan svendsen said 
the canterbury historical society had offered to donate 5000 
toward a paint job svendsen said 
were not destroying the church were preserving it for 
future generations said a earl macleod the churchs deacon 
emeritus he said vinyl siding would cost about half as much as 
painting and last as many as 40 years a paint job lasts seven to 
10 years 
but christopher p bickford director of the connecticut 
historical society and a resident of canterbury said serious 
historical and aesthetic damage would be wrought by vinyl siding 
eastern connecticut is changing so very rapidly we ought to 
try to hold onto those historical sites that are more or less 
intact bickford said anyone who looks at a historical 
building that has been covered with siding it just isnt the same 
building it becomes encased and mummified 
susan chandler a historical architect with the connecticut 
historical commission said vinyl siding can ultimately lead to the 
destruction of historical buildings 
there is a high potential for structural deterioration due to 
the impervious nature of the new materials moisture rot 
infestation chandler said she said the siding can mean such 
damage is undetected and you can get to the point of almost total 
structural failure

the debate between vice presidential 
candidates will go a long way toward determining whether george 
bush was wise when he picked dan quayle for a running mate and 
whether michael dukakis was wise to make a major issue of it 
not that democratic vice presidential candidate lloyd bentsen 
isnt sharing top billing in the 90minute encounter in omaha with 
all the potential political profits and perils that go with it 
but after a campaign of controversy and criticism quayle is the 
man in the spotlight 
a positive performance by the 41yearold indiana senator and 
bushs bid to spice his ticket with a handsome representative of a 
younger generation will seem vindicated bentsen could seem every 
bit of the 26 years older that he is 
republicans would then breathe a sigh of relief and hope nothing 
happens before election day to reverse their seeming edge in the 
campaign for the white house 
a poor performance by quayle and the postdebate debate will 
turn on whether bush can somehow contain the resultant damage 
dukakis would step up the steady drumbeat of criticism that bush 
had picked a man not fit to be a heartbeat away from the white 
house and trumpet the steady mature experience of his man bentsen 
bush took his lumps earlier in the campaign for picking quayle 
his senior aides went to pains to tell reporters that the vice 
president made his choice without their approval a sure sign that 
he wouldnt have gotten it the controversy over quayles 
vietnamera service in the national guard his mediocre academic 
record and the general furor produced a few suggestions that he 
should consider leaving the ticket 
he didnt and bush stood by his man 
dukakis hasnt let up though in a lessnoticed but still risky 
campaign gamble 
traditional political tactics dictate that a candidate avoid 
public disputes with a staff aide to a rival and that the man at 
the top of the ticket not be drawn into a dispute with someone 
further down 
the reason is obvious as walter f mondale found out in 1984 
when he sought to brutalize bush for offering blind loyalty to 
ronald reagan bush then the understudy on the gop ticket was 
delighted to maintain a public quarrel with the leading democrat 
leaving reagan free to remain above the fray 
dukakis aides insist that quayles selection gives them an 
excellent issue a window on the type of decision bush would make 
as president but if quayle performs well in the debate it could 
well be that they missed their issue all along 
televised vice presidential debates are a relatively new 
phenomenon in presidential campaigning the first one was in 1976 
when republican bob dole trying to deflect a question about the 
watergate scandal blurted out that world war i world war ii and 
korea were democrat wars 
democrat walter f mondale replied that dole had richly earned 
his reputation as a hatchetman and the controversy that followed 
was blamed by some republicans for contributing to the narrow gop 
defeat that fall 
four years ago a vice president named bush debated his rival 
democrat geraldine ferraro the session is best remembered for 
bushs morningafter boast that hed kicked a little ass 
bush and the republicans would be quite happy if this years 
debate produced nothing particularly memorable and if quayle 
avoided the temptation to brag about it afterwards

the defense department decided at the last 
moment tuesday to cancel an unveiling of its stealth jet fighter 
forcing a senator to scrub a news conference and the pentagons 
spokesman to reassert an official shroud of secrecy over the 
radarevading plane 
by the time the behindthescenes maneuverings ended there was 
little doubt an airplane that officially doesnt exist does 
doug fuller a spokesman for sen chic hecht rnev said the 
senator had planned to discuss the stealth fighter program with 
reporter tuesday afternoon after the pentagon released details 
about the plane for the first time according to defense sources 
the stealth fighters built for the air force are based at a tightly 
guarded facility in hechts state 
he was going to discuss the program as a whole said fuller 
but the news conference was canceled after hecht received a 
telephone call from the pentagon 
we really havent received much in the way of an explanation 
other than word from dod that the departments release of 
information has been put on indefinite hold fuller said the 
senator will respect that of course hes not going to release 
information on his own 
the washington times had reported in tuesday editions that the 
pentagon planned to release a short detail sheet and photograph of 
the stealth fighter this week possibly as early as tuesday 
dan howard the pentagons chief spokesman found himself unable 
to acknowledge the department had been close to releasing 
information on the jet to explain why a public unveiling had been 
canceled or to confirm there is such a thing as a stealth fighter 
i do not know of any briefing that is currently under 
consideration to take place at any time in the foreseeable future 
with regard to any special aircraft howard told reporters i 
cant provide any additional information to you im sorry 
at another point though without referring to a stealth 
fighter howard said i think you all understand that there are 
proposals that arise from time to time from various levels within 
this building and within the services to do briefings on this or 
that weapon system and the like and not all those proposals are 
ultimately approved 
in this case i think the results are fairly obvious 
according to military and industry sources the united states 
secretly began building stealth jet fighters in the mid1970s and 
now maintains more than 50 of the singleseat planes at the nevada 
base the plane has been dubbed the f19 by various industry 
officials but reportedly also carries the military designation of 
f117a 
the pentagon and air force have never acknowledged the 
airplanes existence even when pressed about mysterious crashes 
over the years 
according to the sources the planes are flown only at night and 
are kept at a high state of readiness for use as aerial shock 
troops capable of slipping behind enemy lines without being 
detected and creating confusion with unexpected bombing runs 
defense sources who requested anonymity said tuesday the idea of 
unveiling the plane had been debated at the highest levels of the 
defense department and on capitol hill before being rejected for 
the time being 
there were concerns at the top of the military hierarchy and 
there was a bipartisan view that this was not the most auspicious 
time for this maybe later said one official asked whether the 
plane be unveiled after the presidential election he replied 
possibly 
the sources said a proposal to show off the plane had been 
advanced for several reasons 
first explained one official the air force already has 
announced it will unveil its new stealth bomber next month and that 
plane is based on more recent technological developments than the 
fighter the planes use special designs and materials to reduce 
their exposure to radar 
it doesnt make sense to let people see one and not the 
other the official noted 
moreover the source continued disclosing the fighter and its 
successful record could help strengthen support on capitol hill for 
the new wing of bombers 
the sources said another factor supporting disclosure involved 
an upcoming legal fight production line workers at a lockheed 
corp plant in burbank calif where the stealth fighters are said 
to be built have gone to court with charges they are being 
sickened by exposure to dangerous chemicals 
pentagon officials have concluded the court fight is likely to 
shatter the secrecy surrounding the plane 
howard appeared to lend weight to that argument tuesday again 
without referring specifically to the plane or to lockheed he 
said the litigation is one of the problems but i just cannot 
take this further

the reagan administration citing continuing 
attempts to liberate nine american hostages in lebanon sought 
tuesday to dampen speculation about why an indianborn us 
resident was freed 
in the wake of mithileshwar singhs release president reagan 
again ruled out negotiating with proiranian elements holding nine 
americans although he said dealing with the situation has been a 
great problem for us 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said the us government 
was doing everything possible to get the hostages out but 
were not negotiating and were not holding discussions that could 
be construed as that he said 
under intense questioning fitzwater declined repeatedly to tell 
reporters what steps were being taken but he acknowledged that 
us officials were bewildered by the circumstances behind the 
release of singh believed to have been held by islamic jihad for 
the liberation of palestine a proiranian group 
we continue to maintain various channels of communication 
he said you may assume that we would undertake all the analysis 
possible 
fitzwater would not say whether us officials were attempting 
to learn through other governments and thirdparty contacts in the 
middle east the reasons for singhs release after 20 months in 
captivity 
we attribute no motives to his release we dont know why they 
did it or what they were seeking the spokesman said but he made 
clear that engaging in public speculation about irans intentions 
would be a disservice to the americans still held captive 
we simply wouldnt speculate on those kinds of things 
fitzwater said were not making any offers not making deals 
were not offering incentives 
i guess our only point is that if improved relations with the 
united states are desired there are avenues to do that and the 
first step is to release all the hostages today 
saying hostage relatives in this country have frequently been 
discouraged and disappointed over false signals of imminent 
prisoner releases fitzwater said i would say to these people 
that were working to get these hostages out 
fitzwater mentioned specifically peggy say the sister of 
associated press middle east correspondent terry anderson and 
virginia steen wife of alann steen anderson has been held longer 
than the other hostages since march 1985 and mrs steen had her 
hopes falsely raised with public reports of her husbands imminent 
release monday 
the state department meanwhile thanked syria for facilitating 
singhs departure from lebanon and also thanked those who played 
a part in gaining his release 
spokeswoman phyllis oakley declined to specifically include 
iran although she said it has influence with the hostageholders 
in lebanon 
we do not know why he was released and not the others mrs 
oakley said he does not have any information on it either 
singh a business professor told american diplomats in damascus 
he had seen the three other educators held by the islamic jihad 
but provided no information about their condition we have no 
indication about the fate of the other hostages mrs oakley said 
singh who is diabetic will be questioned more thoroughly at a 
us military hospital in wiesbaden west germany a debriefing 
team headed by assistant secretary of state michael newlin will 
meet with him mrs oakley said 
the administration has steadfastly denied that it has undertaken 
any talks directly with iranian officials to get the hostages 
released 
the disclosure of clandestine arms sales to iran aimed at 
securing the release of the prisoners during 1985 and 1986 led to 
the irancontra affair and ultimately led to the administrations 
worst foreign policy controversy 
while fitzwater said us officials did not know why singh was 
set free he also said i think its an intentional attempt to 
manipulate the american news media 
i would just hope that as we go through this the media should 
remember some of the lessons they learned through irancontra just 
as we did and that is that everyone is subject to manipulation 
here 
reagan asked whether he thought american hostages might soon be 
set free replied i havent seen any indication of that 
i just cant talk about it any further he told reporters 
during a cabinet room picturetaking session with republican 
congressional leaders 
asked if he thought iran was attempting to manipulate the 
outcome of the us presidential election reagan smiled and said 
well if they are i hope theyre on the right side 
according to records kept by the state departments office for 
counterterrorism nine americans and three britons including 
terry waite an emissary of the anglican church in england an 
italian an irishman and a belgian are held in captivity in 
lebanon however other sources give other numbers 
in a related development abolhassan banisadr the former 
president of iran said that secret hostage release negotiations 
were conducted with iran by an aide to republican presidential 
candidate george bush and that a new channel for usiranian 
links has been opened up 
banisadr said that according to his information a man named 
richard lawless negotiated singhs release 
bush campaign spokeswoman alixe glen said those assertions are 
absolutely false absolutely no one is representing the vice 
president the office of the vice president or the campaign in any 
dealings with the hostages or any other dealings with iran 
fitzwater said there is a fellow named lawless he is over 
there what hes up to nobody knows but he doesnt represent the 
united states he does not represent the vice president or the 
president or anybody else

conrail cannot seek indemnification from 
amtrak for damage claims arising from the deaths of 16 people last 
year when a conrail engine was hit by an amtrak passenger train a 
federal judge ruled 
us district judge oliver gasch ruled that the indemnification 
agreement between amtrak and conrail cannot be enforced because of 
evidence that gross and willful negligence by the conrail crew 
caused the jan 4 1987 accident near chase md 
the collision occurred north of baltimore after the conrail 
engineer and brakeman ignored a series of railroad signals before 
the freight engine entered the path of an oncoming highspeed 
amtrak passenger train 
if upheld the ruling signed late monday means that conrail 
would be solely responsible for defending more than 60 wrongful 
death and personal injury suits that seek millions of dollars in 
damages 
conrail is studying the decision and has no comment 
spokeswoman pat linskey said tuesday 
conrail had sought to force amtrak to defend the suits and pay 
any damages awarded under the terms of the northeast corridor 
freight operating agreement that provides that amtrak pay for 
claims irrespective of any negligence of fault of conrail 
gasch said that it was unclear based on the language of the 
agreement and the negotiating history whether the parties intended 
it to apply to cases of gross negligence 
but even if the agreement were clear public policy will not 
allow enforcement of indemnification provisions that appear to 
cover such extreme misconduct because serious and significant 
disincentives to railroad safety would ensure gasch said 
gasch noted that the conrail engineer ricky lynn gates who 
pleaded guilty to manslaughter and received a fiveyear prison 
term admitted the crew had used marijuana before the accident and 
violated a number of safety procedures

recommendation from a federal advisory 
committee that researchers be allowed to inject genetically altered 
cells into humans for the first time as a diagnostic tool is a 
precursor to the inevitable and more controversial question of 
using similar techniques for experimental treatment 
despite the exotic aura and inevitable controversy surrounding 
most cuttingedge medical research such mainstream organizations 
as the march of dimes are firmly in favor of pressing forward with 
gene therapies 
the recommendation from a national institutes of health advisory 
committee monday involves allowing researchers to place genetically 
altered cells in terminally ill cancer patients to help them better 
judge the success of ongoing experimental treatment that does not 
use gene therapy directly 
if this protocol were to work id expect that within six to 
12 months there could be a proposal to do a gene therapy 
experiment said dr william j gartland executive secretary of 
the nihs recombinant dna advisory committee 
although the panels recommendation would have to be embraced by 
nih director james b wyngaarden and the food and drug 
administration before the experiments could be carried out 
gartlands remarks indicated that is likely to be forthcoming 
but because the panel split 165 on the question wyngaarden is 
likely to take several months to review the matter before making 
his own recommendation said gartland 
gadfly jeremy rifkin has conducted a decadelong battle to get 
the federal government to adopt safeguards on genetic research but 
he said tuesday that he did not oppose the nih committees action 
i do not oppose this experiment he said in a telephone 
interview this experiment is a precursor to the first genetic 
engineering of a human being 
it is that next step he said that has more profound 
longterm ethical implications than any technology in history 
rifkin head of the foundation on economic trends renewed his 
call for the government to set up a permanent oversight mechanism 
at nih or elsewhere to deal on a casebycase basis with each 
potential genetic engineering experiment as it comes up 
he said he does not automatically oppose all genetic therapy 
you want to find those things that work and accept them he 
said the key he said is we dont want the technology to rush 
ahead of the social and ethical implications 
meanwhile the march of dimes is marking its 50th anniversary 
year with a plan to focus money and attention on gene therapy 
opera star beverly sills outlined the program last november in a 
speech to the national press club 
miss sills general director of the new york city opera and 
mother of two children with birth defects acknowledged that 
advocating gene therapy is likely to be more controversial than the 
foundations successful fight against polio 
but she said that is largely because gene therapy is surrounded 
by much misconception 
one fact must be made clear she said what we are talking 
about is fixing or replacing genetic material for the lifetime of 
one desperately ill person 
the characteristics of the transplanted gene will not be 
passed on to future generations the goal of gene therapy is that 
of any other medical treatment the reduction of suffering and the 
restoration of health in individual patients 
the march of dimes has helped finance genetic research for years 
and foundation president charles l massey acknowledged that a main 
purpose of the campaign planned for the coming year will be to lend 
the groups credibility to the potential of gene therapy 
gene therapy is not yet a reality but it will be probably 
far sooner than expected only a year or so ago and the march of 
dimes will be there miss sills said last november

a pennsylvania couple is asking a florida 
judge to order a genetic blood test to determine if a 9yearold 
sarasota girl is theirs 
the girl who ernest and regina twigg of langhorne pa suspect 
is their daughter is living in a broken home without an ongoing 
stable home environment the couple said in a motion filed monday 
in sarasota circuit court 
the twiggs charged in court papers that the girls father 
wrongfully retains custody and has failed to provide a caring 
home 
in response a lawyer representing the girls father contends 
the twiggs intend to disrupt the happiness and wellbeing of 
the child 
the search for the child the twiggs maintain was kidnapped at 
birth and switched in a tiny central florida hospital nursery took 
a bitter turn with the latest motion said arthur ginsburg who 
represents the girls father 
we went to them with an olive branch and they came to us with 
a sword they really dont know anything about this father and 
daughter he has a deep love for his child ginsburg said 
sarasota circuit judge andy owens has agreed to schedule an 
emergency hearing friday to consider a request for courtordered 
genetic testing designed to determine the girls biological parents 
the father insists the child does not belong to the other couple 
neither side has identified the sarasota girl or her relatives 
to protect her privacy 
the twiggs say they left hardee memorial hospital in 1978 with a 
sickly child who they subsequently learned was not their own they 
have filed a 100 million lawsuit in federal court in tampa 
claiming that the hospital swapped their healthy girl for one with 
heart problems in order to facilitate an adoption 
the twiggs discovered this summer through genetic blood tests 
that the baby they named arlena was not their daughter but never 
told her before her death on aug 23 
the couple suspect their daughter is the sarasota girl a 
blueeyed blonde who was the only other white child reported to 
have shared the hospital nursery with baby arlena 
the father consented to genetic testing to put the matter to 
rest but both sides never agreed on conditions the legal father 
wanted to choose the facility and keep the results confidential 
so voluntary testing is off attorneys said

under the house plan drafted by a bipartisan coalition of east 
coast lawmakers sludge dumpers would be forced to stop by the 1992 
deadline or face stiff penalties 
these penalties will add up to tens of millions of dollars in 
a very short time theres no question but that the fines will make 
it financially prohibitive for municipalities to continue dumping 
in the ocean beyond the deadline said rep william hughes 
dnj a prime sponsor of the ban 
rep h james saxton rnj called the bill a vitory in the 
continuing fight for clean oceans 
some eight million wet tons of sludge a year are dumped by the 
nine agencies at a site about 106 miles east of new jersey 
congress closed a site just 12 miles offshore in 1987 
experts differ on the environmental threat posed by the dumping 
of sludge 
the new bill imposes fees to dumpers of 200 a ton beginning 
jan 1 1989 
dumpers meanwhile would be required to negotiate individual 
timetables for ending their dumping with federal authorities 
those agencies that cannot strike a deal will pay staggered fees 
through 1992 of up to 400 a ton 
any authority still dumping sludge in the ocean by 1993 would be 
forced to pay penalties over and above the fees those fines begin 
at 800 per ton and more than double that by 1999 
new york alone would be liable for more than 13 billion if the 
state is still dumping by the year 2000 
the proposed ban was at first opposed by new york lawmakers and 
new york mayor edward i koch who complained that the deadline 
would be impossible to meet 
proponents countered that congress orginally banned ocean sludge 
dumping as of 1981 a deadline suspended in a successful lawsuit by 
new york the original deadline was set in a 1978 law after which 
some 300 industries and 100 municipalities stopped dumping 
the compromise was reached after inclusion of a system of trust 
funds under which fees and fines would be used to develop 
alternatives to dumping 
the political climate became right for the bill this year after 
repeated and widelypublicized incidents of beach pollution

president reagan argued tuesday that even 
though voters might be a little cautious about voting 
republican this fall the election will ultimately be a referendum 
on the future of the democratic party 
its way too early to say that this is the realignment 
election reagan said in remarks prepared for a speech to the 
governors club a group of gop state chief executives but i do 
think many rankandfile democrats are getting in a mood to say to 
their party leadership youve gone too far to the left return to 
the political mainstream 
the president addressed the clubs fundraising dinner expected 
to glean 750000 for the republican national committee 
he cited gop gains from 1984 in states like texas and north 
carolina this year he said ive been out on the campaign trail 
lately and im just starting to wonder if this year there isnt 
something in the air 
since the convention reagan has gleaned millions of dollars for 
the gop with his speaking appearances on behalf of vice president 
george bushs quest for the white house 
a onetime democrat himself reagan acknowledged that its 
difficult to get people to change their loyalties 
theres plenty of disenchantment out there with that other 
party but we have to realize that people are still a little 
cautious about our party reagan said 
the president did not detail what might make voters tentative 
about the republicans but he argued that many democrats have been 
attracted by his partys longtime antitax and antibig government 
stands as well as a whole range of social issues from the pledge 
of allegiance to school prayer to the radical agenda of some 
farleft legal groups 
bush has repeatedly criticized democratic presidential candidate 
michael dukakis for vetoing a state law that would have forced 
massachusetts teachers to lead their students in reciting the 
pledge each day 
reagan said this campaign may be starting to break out as a 
referendum on liberalism itself a referendum on the direction in 
which the liberals have taken the onceproud democratic party 
the public agrees with us when we say we are for the death 
penalty school prayer tough law enforcement and against liberal 
organizations like the aclu that always seem to be searching for 
technicalities to exonerate criminals reagan argued echoing 
bushs criticism of dukakis for being a selfproclaimed 
cardcarrying member of the american civil liberties union 
rankandfile democrats are going to say no to the liberal 
leadership of the democratic party by saying yes to george bush 
and the republican party reagan told his partisan audience

a national poll tuesday said the democratic 
presidential ticket was benefiting from doubts about republican 
vice presidential nominee sen dan quayle it put the race at 
essentially a dead heat 
the republican ticket of george bush and quayle drew the support 
of 48 percent of the probable voters in the cbs newsnew york times 
poll while the democrats michael dukakis and sen lloyd bentsen 
got 46 percent 
when the 1034 respondents were asked what if they were voting 
only for the presidential nominees without their running mates 
the support for dukakis declined to 43 percent cbs reported 
bushs remained at 48 percent 
that finding indicated that quayle while not cutting into 
bushs own support was pushing some undecided voters to dukakis 
quayle of indiana and bentsen of texas meet in their only 
debate of the campaign wednesday night 
in another measure of concern about quayle respondents were 
split evenly on whether he understands the complicated problems a 
president has to deal with fortyone percent said he does but 40 
percent said not 
on bentsen by contrast 71 percent said he does understand the 
problems a president must confront and only 13 percent said not 
the 4846 race was a statistical dead heat given the polls 
margin of error or plus or minus three percentage points a 
cbstimes poll done sept 2123 put the race at 49 percent for bush 
and quayle to 44 percent for dukakis and bentsen also a 
statistical tie given the error margin 
the new survey was conducted saturday through monday

israels election campaign began in earnest 
tuesday with both major parties trading accusations about an 
israeli watergate and running television ads to woo undecided 
voters 
politicians came out swinging at the end of the jewish holiday 
period ending weeks of lowkey campaigning for the nov 1 election 
the campaigns first confrontation between the rightwing likud 
bloc and the leftofcenter labor party focused on what has been 
called the israeli watergate after the scandal that forced 
president nixon to resign in 1974 
likud accused labor of bugging likud campaign headquarters and 
of tapping the home phone of campaign chairman moshe arens a 
cabinet minister and former ambassador to the united states 
this is a serious affair said likud spokesman danny naveh 
we have serious suspicions that this is an israeli watergate and 
that labor is responsible 
asked about evidence naveh said arens heard clicking in his 
line and the ministers wife saw prowlers in her yard last week 
shimon peres the labor party chief and foreign minister in the 
coalition government formed with likud after a 1984 election 
stalemate denounced the allegations as ridiculous and without 
foundation 
this is puppet theater and i dont see any real person there 
on stage peres during a campaign swing in northern israel 
added ezer weizman labors campaign leader they are in a 
panic because our campaign is better than theirs 
naveh also said that labor hired two former agents of israels 
shin bet security service to spy on likud labor officials denied 
the allegation saying the two were consultants providing security 
for party facilities 
likud officials asked attorney general yosef harish to 
investigate labor israel radio said harish said he would consider 
the request 
israeli commentators predicted the affair would not have a 
farreaching impact 
this mutual mudslinging is just part of the campaign heating 
up said emanuel gutmann a political science professor at hebrew 
university in jerusalem i wouldnt get excited about it 
earlier in the campaign a squabble broke out over a recorded 
labor party telephone message with the sounds of sirens and 
breaking glass that suggested shamirs policies would lead to war 
shamir said no to the peace with egypt he said no to king 
hussein shamir said yes to the inflation yes to the 
intefadeh he will say yes to the next war the announcer said 
enraged likud activists kept the telephone line busy 
intefadeh is the arabic term used to describe the 10month 
palestinian uprising in israels occupied territories 
also tuesday the parties launched television campaign ads 
designed to sway undecided voters estimated by polls at more than 
25 percent of the electorate 
the ads will play a particularly important role because the 
stateowned israel tv and radio stations are banned from 
broadcasting interviews with candidates in the final 30 days before 
the vote 
in their television spots shamir and peres referred to the 
palestinian uprising only briefly although both parties have 
called middle east peace the crucial issue of the campaign 
both men laid claim to israels economic recovery and peres 
took credit for israels withdrawal from lebanon in 1985 
likud presented slick spots with an upbeat jingle flagwaving 
children and shamir calling for a fair campaign little mention was 
made of labor or its policies 
labor was more aggressive contrasting its positions to likuds 
a sternvoiced announcer said hyperinflation and entanglement in 
lebanon came after likud had been in the government seven years 
israel radio said each side had prepared uncomplimentary film 
clips and would use them if the other side engaged in character 
assassination 
israeli voters will be exposed to about 1000 minutes of 
television campaign spots before the election clusters of ads are 
run in a 45minute period after the evening news 
each of the 28 parties running for 120 seats in the knesset is 
allotted 10 minutes of television time in addition parties now 
represented in parliament get six minutes for each seat labor and 
likud have more than four hours each of free television time 
radio ads begin wednesday 
elihu katz a pollster and founding director of israel 
television criticized the ban on tv and radio coverage of 
candidates saying voters were being deprived of valuable 
information 
but he said the campaign ads waste a huge amount of money the 
large parties have so much time they could run quiz shows and soap 
operas

honduras which has been a key us ally 
in central america asked the un tuesday to set up an 
international peace force to evacuate usbacked nicaraguan and 
leftist salvadoran rebels from honduran territory 
in a speech delivered to the general assembly foreign minister 
carlos lopez contreras of honduras recommended that un 
secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar oversee creation of a 
peace force comprised of troops from canada spain and west germany 
the forces duties would include relocating honduranbased 
nicaraguan rebels known as contras and salvadoran rebels to costa 
rica and guatemala initially and then resettle them elsewhere 
lopez contreras said 
he said the force would guarantee the nonuse of honduran 
territory by foreign armed insurgencies 
lopez contreras underscored his apparent disassociation from 
us policy by describing the united states along with the soviet 
union as a hegemonistic power one with a policy or practice 
of aggressively expanding its influence over other countries 
his proposal represents a revised and updated version of a plan 
honduras unveiled last november and seemed aimed primarily at the 
thousands of contras based in southern honduras along the 
nicaraguan border 
the number of contras in honduras has increased substantially 
this year as fighting in nicaragua has subsided 
leftist rebels from el salvador who have been trying to oust 
the ussupported government there since 1980 have made far less 
use of honduran territory 
honduras has been a major element in reagan administration 
strategy to prevent through support for the contras nicaragua 
from becoming a soviet beachhead 
but honduras always has been wary of the contras use of 
honduran territory as their main base of operation washington has 
sought to soften that reticence by giving honduras substantial 
economic help 
lopez contreras also tore into nicaraguas leftist sandinista 
government tuesday accusing it of failing to comply with peace 
agreements it signed and of pursuing policies that forced hundreds 
of thousands of nicaraguans to flee their homeland he accused it 
of engaging in an irrational arms race 
it is a universally recognized truth that the central american 
crisis is a complex international problem and as a consequence 
the international community must assume the responsibility of 
maintaining peace and regional security without excluding an 
international peace force he said 
such a unit lopez contreras said should be authorized to use 
force if necessary to carry out its mandate 
the people and the government of honduras cannot continue 
carrying the burden they have been suffering for nine years caused 
by the presence of tens of thousands of central american 
refugees the honduran minister declared 
reagan administration officials have been receiving signals for 
weeks that honduran patience with the contras was wearing thin 
under an agreement signed by the sandinistas and the contras last 
march the insurgents were to be allowed to receive us 
humanitarian aid inside nicaragua 
because of political disagreements and other problems the 
united states has not sent any aid to contras in nicaragua as a 
result thousands fled to the border area where the us agency 
for international development has been operating a program that 
includes food shelter clothing and medical services for the 
rebels 
last february congress defeated an administration proposal for 
military aid for the contras and little prospect remains that such 
aid will be renewed raising the possibility of the rebels staying 
in honduras indefinitely 
honduran officials repeatedly said that would be unacceptable

police carried or roughly dragged about 360 
antiabortion demonstrators at three clinics to jailbound buses 
tuesday making good on a threat of glovesoff treatment for a 
planned week of similar protests 
some of the sitin protesters screamed or cried as they were 
hauled off and left in piles by jail bus doors to be carried aboard 
by other officers many supporters watching the arrests sobbed or 
prayed quietly others sang hymns or songs from the civil rights 
movement 
police asked the demonstrators if they would walk to the buses 
and dragged them there when they would not 
they were still being processed at atlanta jails late tuesday 
afternoon a police spokeswoman myrna may said most were being 
charged with criminal trespass although she did not have a 
specific breakdown on the charges she said none of the charges 
were felonies 
since summer hundreds of antiabortion protesters in atlanta 
have identified themselves upon arrest as baby john doe or baby 
jane doe since authorities will not release people on bond without 
identification those arrested have crowded jails three summer 
demonstrators remained jailed one for more than 70 days 
the stated aim of the protests tuesday was to close the clinics 
for the day although some women entered at least one clinic during 
the protests the demonstrators did not enter the buildings 
the protests were organized by operation rescue a new 
yorkbased group that started demonstrating in atlanta on july 19 
during the democratic national convention and continued to do so 
through the summer landing more than 750 people in jail 
at two locations police used disposable plastic handcuffs on 
those arrested and in one case tackled a man who had been loaded 
into a van but tried to escape 
some were urged along by police putting thumbs under the ears 
and lifting the demonstrators offered no resistance and most 
remained limp while they were carried off 
a few officers were in riot gear or on horseback 
operation rescue which has opened what it says is a permanent 
office in atlanta charged that excessive force was used 
gene guerrero executive director of the state chapter of the 
american civil liberties union who watched the arrests said 
ive been to a lot of demonstrations and ive seen a lot of 
police brutality i havent seen that today 
police officials announced last week that they would not use the 
relatively gentle arrest methods they used during the convention 
police tactics already had grown rougher during the summer as a 
series of antiabortion sitins taxed city and county resources 
costing more than 500000 in police overtime jail expenses and 
court time 
late tuesday fulton county superior court judge joel fryer 
barred operation rescue from harassing or assaulting anyone 
going to or from any abortion clinic or from recruiting others to 
do so with a 500 fine for each violation 
the judge ordered lawyers from both sides to agree on how close 
demonstrators can go to the clinics operation rescue lawyer bob 
fierer said he would not negotiate because his clients do not 
intend to obey the order 
tuesdays demonstrators crawled under portable metal barriers 
erected at the clinics by police and were arrested when they got to 
the other side 
police called an ambulance for a pregnant woman who lay by a bus 
door in apparent pain after others had been loaded but she got on 
the bus after the ambulance arrived 
we got plenty room left if any yall want to go along 
shouted one officer through a bullhorn to sympathizers on a 
sidewalk across a narrow side street from one clinic no one did 
aside from an occasional insult from a passing car there were no 
counterdemonstrators 
operation rescue founder randall terry arrested monday evening 
on charges of conspiracy to commit a crime was freed before the 
demonstration tuesday after an unidentified family posted a 75000 
property bond 
terry appeared tuesday morning as about 800 abortion opponents 
gathered at a motel on the edge of atlanta before heading for the 
clinics even the demonstrators were not told to which of the seven 
clinics that perform abortions in atlanta they were going to until 
shortly before they arrived 
they went from the motel to the area where the clinics are by 
public transportation in an apparent attempt to avoid being stopped 
ahead of time by police 
the blood is on our hands terry told the group we are 
here 15 years too late there are no heroes here 
cries of hallelujah and oh yes lord came from one 
large group some of whose members were speaking in tongues one 
woman passed out plastic rosaries

the district of columbia department of 
corrections closed the citys crowded prison system to new inmates 
tuesday to comply with a court order 
city corrections director hallem williams said the policy means 
that the federal government is responsible for finding places to 
incarcerate new prisoners he said he could provide no specifics 
about arrangements 
but a spokesman for the us marshals service steve boyle said 
officials from the justice department were still trying to decide 
how to resolve the problem 
the city stopped admitting new inmates to its jail because of an 
order issued last thursday by us district judge william b bryant 
that the district reduce its jail population to under 1694 
prisoners that order took effect at noon tuesday when there were 
1942 prisoners at the jail according to williams 
at this juncture we have no remaining alternatives to deal 
with todays crisis said williams we are in a crisis 
situation everywhere we step there is a minefield 
the action also meant that new inmates were also being barred 
from the citys lorton correctional complex in nearby fairfax 
county va 
a separate appeals court ruling also issued last thursday 
requires the city to reduce the population at lortons central 
facility to 1166 by nov 1 there were 1406 inmates at lorton on 
tuesday 
corrections officials were scheduled to present their plan for 
alleviating overcrowding to bryant on wednesday morning 
on monday district mayor marion barry authorized the early 
release of 350 prisoners from the entire system by nov 11 
williams announced at a news conference tuesday 
about 130 inmates will be sent to other jurisdictions such as 
the state of washington over the next three weeks 
and the city is setting up a program in which it pays 
contractors to post bond of 2000 or less and then monitor certain 
poor inmates awaiting trial at a cost to the district of up to 
300000 
williams said the city had not choice but to take the actions 
its not a situation where theres a winner or a loser he 
said its a situation where there are lots of losers

a former mayoral candidate who was the 
citys chief administrator for 10 years has been indicted with 13 
others for having sex with teenage girls at a brothel 
the indictments monday followed a 16month investigation into an 
operation police say earned 20000 a week by providing prostitutes 
as young as 14 to customers in the san francisco bay area los 
angeles idaho and washington 
roger boas chief executive under former mayors george moscone 
and dianne feinstein was allegedly identified by five underage 
prostitutes as the regular client they knew as george the 
67yearold car dealer and politician later was picked out of a 
photo lineup in front of a grand jury 
boas who also served from 1962 to 1973 as a city supervisor 
ran for mayor last year coming in a close third 
in a threeminute appearance before reporters tuesday boas did 
not deny involvement with prostitutes and refused to answer 
questions on the subject he hinted he was being targeted unfairly 
by district attorney arlo smith 
during my entire life i have always done my utmost to be 
constructive honest and productive he said for my familys 
sake i am truly saddened that someone in the criminal justice 
system tried to convict me in the media using leaks rumors and 
innuendo in advance of the legal process 
his attorney john keker said he expected boas to be acquitted 
of all charges 
boas his attorney and smith would not disclose specifics of the 
indictment the san francisco chronicle and the san francisco 
examiner reported on the indictments extensively quoting 
unidentified city hall sources 
boas reportedly faces 18 counts of unlawful sex with minors 
during the last three years 
those indicted faced possible felony charges that could carry up 
to three years in prison 
the girls told police they had been coached to act as young as 
possible with their clients who they were told paid a premium for 
sex with minors 
a 32yearold police officer patrick miyagishima reportedly 
faces two counts of having unlawful sex with a minor 
im not even admitting my client was there at the brothel 
said miyagishimas attorney william murphy 
a prominent jeweler john azevedo 46 was charged with four 
counts of having unlawful sex with minors according to his 
attorney patrick hallinan 
hallinan acknowledged that azevedo had sex with prostitutes 
four or five times at his store during the past four years but 
the lawyer said his client had no idea they were so young 
this is a terrible terrible personal tragedy for my client 
thats motivated so clearly only by the district attorneys desire 
to cover the fact that he is really out to get boas hallinan

the government tuesday tentatively settled a 
lawsuit by eight canadians who claimed they suffered psychological 
trauma from ciafinanced mindcontrol experiments that included 
doses of lsd sources said 
the lawsuit claimed 8 million in damages the plaintiffs said 
they suffered from behaviormodification treatments administered in 
the late 1950s by a montreal psychiatrist whose research was 
financed covertly by the cia 
the case was scheduled to go to trial this week before us 
district judge john garrett penn but justice department attorneys 
tentatively have agreed to settle the case by paying the plaintiffs 
a total of 750000 according to one source familiar with the case 
who spoke on condition of anonymity 
justice department lawyers plan to ask penn on wednesday to 
postpone the trial while their superiors review the proposed 
outofcourt settlement according to other sources familiar with 
the case 
the justice department must formally approve all settlements for 
more than 200000 that are negotiated by government lawyers 
the 1980 lawsuit filed under the federal tort claims act 
originally sought 1 million for each of nine plaintiffs penn 
dismissed one of the plaintiffs ruling that her claim was barred 
by statute of limitations 
but under the terms of the tentative agreement she will share 
in the settlement according to a source 
the mindcontrol experiments were conducted by the late dr d 
ewen cameron who headed the allan memorial institute of mcgill 
university in montreal 
cameron received nearly 60000 over three years from a 
ciafront organization called the society for the investigation of 
human ecology according to a government summary of the case in 
court records 
there is no evidence that cameron ever knew that the grants he 
received were financed by the cia the summary states 
only two of the nine original plaintiffs were given lsd therapy 
during the time the cia financed camerons research according to 
court papers but they underwent other forms of treatment such as 
unusually intense electroshock therapy or a technique known as 
psychic driving in which patients listen to a recorded message 
repeatedly for up to 16 hours 
several patients were given lsd therapy during other treatments 
by cameron before or after the threeyear period he received cia 
money 
the research organization was part of a project started in 1953 
by thencia director allen dulles to finance mindcontrol research 
including experiments with lsd on unwitting subjects 
project mkultra was begun at the height of the cold war out of 
concern that the soviet union and china had obtained a stock of 
lsd according to former cia officials who gave depositions in the 
case 
former cia director richard helms who was the agencys 
operations director in the late 1950s recalled there was 
concern that the russians or the chinese might use this on our 
people might use it on our public officials 
in his deposition helms recalled an incident when george 
kennan the us ambassador to moscow flew to berlin and made a 
most extraordinary series of statements which were regarded as 
quite uncharacteristic of mr kennans normal behavior 
there was therefore a feeling that perhaps he had been 
administered something of this kind which caused him to act in an 
aberrant way helms testified 
this incident prompted dulles to order research into lsd helms 
recalled 
the research organization that financed cameron was set up in 
1955 after the suicide of frank olson who was among a group of 
scientists who were given afterdinner drinks laced with lsd after 
olsons death the cia decided that experimentation on unwitting 
subjects could be conducted only under closer medical supervision 
the plaintiffs informally lowered their demands for payment to 
175000 apiece during earlier negotiations the cia offered to pay 
only 25000 to each plaintiff during aborted talks several years 
ago

automakers posted their thirdbest sales year in 
history tuesday as car and light truck buyers in the united states 
drove away more than 156 million vehicles during the 1988 model 
year the companies reported 
with a few of the smallvolume foreign makers holding sales 
figures until wednesday companies selling cars and light trucks in 
the united states said they sold 07 percent more vehicles in 1988 
than the 155 million vehicles sold during the 1987 model year 
thats pretty good all things considered when they were 
expected to be flat or down a bit said analyst mary anne sudol 
of fitch investors service inc of new york 
i think its particularly surprising in light of what the 
initial expectations were postoct 19 of last year when the 
stock market crashed said analyst douglas laughlin of bear sterns 
amp co of new york i was looking more for 14 million in that 
period i had to consistently raise it through the period 
the 1988 model year ran behind 1986 when 161 million vehicles 
left showrooms and 1985 when 157 million cars and light trucks 
were sold 
while the annual total was upbeat sales during the last 10day 
period were sharply lower than a year ago when endofmodelyear 
fire sales and lingering incentives attracted people to dealerships 
sales of usmade cars fell 91 percent to 250416 from 275461 
during the sept 2130 period this year compared with the same 
period last year there were nine selling days in both periods 
usmade truck sales meanwhile gained slightly in late 
september rising to 131915 in the period this year compared with 
130144 at the same time last year a 14 percent increase 
for the month sales of domestically made trucks rose 53 
percent to 319326 vehicles compared with 303202 during september 
1987 the boost in usmade trucks apparently came at the expense 
of foreign truck makers 
sales of light trucks made overseas slipped 274 percent last 
month compared with the same month last year 
clearly there are some sales that are showing up as truck 
sales that used to be car sales laughlin said minivans are in 
particular a replacement for station wagons 
at the same time there seems to be a growing consumer trend 
to sport utility vehicles in much the same way there was toward 
muscle cars in the 60s and 70s he added 
foreign and domestic automakers said they sold 792295 cars last 
month a 81 percent decrease from the 862391 cars sold during 
september of last year 
general motors corp showed the largest car sales decline in 
late september dropping 15 percent to 116028 cars this year 
compared with 136483 during the same period last year ford motor 
cos late september sales fell to 70813 cars down 143 percent 
from 82606 during the period last year 
chrysler corp showed the smallest lateseptember decline 
falling 45 percent to 33314 cars this year compared with 34898 
last year 
for the calendar year chrysler has reported an 116 percent 
sales increase compared to the first nine months of last year 
during that same time fords sales have risen 72 percent and gms 
have fallen 07 percent 
but sudol said the chrysler figures may be a little deceiving 
in 1987 they had a lot of down time for plant retooling so 
that makes it a little easier to show increased sales in 1988 
compared to the year before

this central african country is using 
everything from comic books to theater to make its population more 
aware of aids and the program seems to be working officials said 
although the deadly incurable disease is most common among male 
homosexuals in the west the incidence is high among heterosexuals 
in africa doctors disagree about the reasons 
dr ngaly bosenge director of zaires national aids committee 
said zaire is preparing its first major random survey of the aids 
infection rate 
in an interview monday ngaly said a pilot study may begin in 
late october to determine whether enough blood samples can be 
obtained to permit a representative survey 
acquired immune deficiency syndrome or aids is caused by a 
virus that attacks the bodys immune system leaving victims 
defenseless against infections and cancer 
it is spread most often through sexual contact needles or 
syringes shared by drug abusers infected blood or blood products 
and from pregnant women to their unborn offspring 
zaire began a national aids education program last year using 
comic books popular music theater and television 
until then officials had been reluctant to talk with western 
journalists about the disease or publicize the danger among their 
own people 
dennis chandler of the us agency for international development 
praised zaires education program and said a survey found 
knowledge of aids in the kinshasa region was as high as that found 
in the united states 
condom sales have increased from virtually nil to 100000 
monthly according to a survey in kinshasa and a few other 
regions chandler said 
ngaly said zaire had cooperated with scientists researching the 
aids problem but claims that the disease originated in zaire and 
descriptions of this country as the aids epicenter made 
officials wary of publicity 
when we first reported that from 68 percent of the people 
surveyed in kinshasa were seropositive it was regarded as a 
national catastrophe he said 
authorities also hesitated because they lacked verifiable data 
ngaly said that explained why zaire had reported only 300 cases to 
the world health organization while health authorities were 
convinced the total was many times that 
the new random survey of 10000 kinshasa residents will seek to 
determine the true aids rate he said 
previous surveys have found rates ranging from 68 percent among 
the staff of a kinshasa hospital to 34 percent at a large factory 
and a bank ngaly said he could not explain the difference and the 
rates could not be considered representative of the general 
population which he said probably was somewhere between 
according to ngaly a principal aim of the new study is to 
evaluate the success of our aids education program the most 
important thing is to check the rate of aids infection we are 
confident that people understand the need for change but it is a 
longterm effort 
current studies of pregnant women and blood donors suggest the 
incidence is not rising among the general population because 
comparisons with surveys taken several years ago found differences 
statistically insignificant ngaly said 
he said a survey in one remote village indicated the aids 
infection level remained under 1 percent and did not change in 10 
years 
tests of prostitutes in kinshasa however indicated an increase 
in the infection rate from 27 percent to 40 ngaly said

a prison officer accused of 
mistreating irish republican army guerrillas was killed tuesday by 
a bomb that destroyed his car as he was driving through belfast 
hours later an estimated 500 pounds of explosives inside a car 
blew up outside a building in belfast used by the inland revenue 
tax service starting a fire and causing extensive damage but no 
injuries according to police 
the ira asserted responsibility for both bombings 
police said brian armour 48 was killed when a bomb exploded in 
his car as he drove near his home in mainly protestant east 
belfast an ira statement said it was the second attempt to kill 
the officer 
officials said armour was vice chairman of the prison officers 
association a professional group and worked at the maze prison 
outside belfast where dozens of ira inmates are held 
in a statement to the local news media the ira claimed armour 
had a central role in organizing and carrying out the systematic 
torture and brutalization of hundreds of republican prisoners 
during a period of maze prison protests that included the deaths of 
10 inmates in hunger strikes in 1981 
it also said armour had recently advocated harsh treatment of 
ira inmates at the maze and at crumlin road jail in belfast 
the statement said ira members planted a 2pound charge of 
plastic explosives in his car but it failed to explode a second 
packet of 1 pounds of explosives then was placed in the car and it 
exploded according to the statement 
a police spokesman said a telephoned warning gave security units 
30 minutes to evacuate the area around the inland revenue building 
no casualties were reported but the spokesman said an elderly 
woman was treated for shock 
armour was the 81st person to be killed this year in northern 
irelands sectarian violence the known death toll since the ira 
began its violent campaign in 1969 is 2699 
the ira is fighting to unite northern ireland a british 
province where protestants outnumber roman catholics 32 with the 
predominantly catholic republic of ireland 
it was announced tuesday that sir john hermon will retire in may 
after a decade as chief constable of the royal ulster constabulary 
the provinces police force no successor has been named 
during his tenure the 13000member constabulary supplanted 
british army units as the provinces main security force 
british officials have said hermon 59 molded an effective 
antiterrorist force but 85 percent of the constabularys members 
are protestants and efforts to win support from catholic leaders 
have failed

the soviet union said tuesday it has 
dropped a demand that blocked agreement on a new forum for 
negotiating reduced conventional military forces in europe 
yuri b kashlev chief soviet delegate to the helsinki review 
conference said in an interview that the kremlin has agreed that 
tactical nuclear weapons need not be among weapons included in new 
talks between nato and the warsaw pact 
kashlev said the soviets also have agreed not to make a 
distinction between attack aircraft and air defense forces in the 
written mandate for the new negotiations 
we will make the difference in the talks but we decided to 
meet nato halfway kashlev declared he said agreement came in 
conversations last week at the united nations in new york between 
eduard a shevardnadze the soviet foreign minister and 
counterparts from nato countries 
american officials said moscow had not formally presented its 
position in protracted bargaining for new talks among 23 nations 
designed to replace the mutual and balanced force reduction 
negotiations which have dragged on in vienna without agreement for 
nearly 15 years 
negotiations on the new forum are being conducted at the vienna 
conference one of several held to review compliance with the 1975 
helsinki agreements on european security and cooperation signed by 
the united states canada and all european nations except albania 
such a forum cannot begin work until a mandate is agreed upon by 
the eastern and north atlantic alliances and until the 35 helsinki 
signatories produce a final document at the vienna review session 
which began in november 1986 
also remaining to be settled is a formula for liaison with the 
12 neutral or nonaligned nations that signed the helsinki accords 
but are not included in the arms negotiations 
kashlev predicted tuesday the mandate can be completed in the 
next two to three weeks 
in order to produce a final document for the vienna conference 
east and west must find mutually acceptable language on human 
rights and economic copoperation and agree on how many more review 
meetings to hold 
western diplomats say a major problem is soviet insistence on 
holding a followup conference on human rights in moscow 
in kashlevs view refusing to do so would constitute a 
boycott of soviet democratization being carried out by mikhail s 
gorbachev 
the united states and britain argue that the soviet union still 
does not meet criteria for the host of a human rights conference 
it is difficult to think of a human rights conference in 
moscow while there are political prisoners in the soviet union 
us ambassador warren zimmermann said an interview

the house on tuesday narrowly sustained 
president reagans veto of tightened textile and apparel import 
curbs bowing to claims that the legislation would mean price 
increases amounting to a fresh tax on consumers 
stand up for consumers stand up for america support your 
presidents veto declared rep william frenzel rminn minutes 
before the house voted 272152 in favor of overriding the veto 
the total in favor was 11 votes short of the support from 
twothirds of the lawmakers present and voting that textile 
industry supporters had needed 
textile and apparel workers bused in from various points along 
the east coast watched grimfaced from the galleries as the house 
with at most two weeks before congressional adjournment appeared 
to end the battle for textile import legislation for the rest of 
the year 
reagan however was pleased by the house vote according to a 
statement released tuesday evening by the white house 
with the defeat of this protectionist legislation we remain 
committed to expanding the business investment and consumer 
opportunities for americans the statement said 
by sustaining the veto the house has once again reaffirmed 
americas commitment to the free market and free international 
trade reagan added 
the bill designed to protect american industry against foreign 
competition would freeze 1988 textile and apparel imports at last 
years level and limit growth to 1 percent annually beginning in 
january 
it also would clamp a similar cap on nonrubber footwear imports 
with no provision for future increases 
countries that increased purchases of american farm goods would 
get larger shares of the us textile and apparel market the bill 
also would establish a pilot program under which the government 
would auction off import licenses and it would create a special 
quota for imported silk neckties 
waving american flags and holding up multicolored umbrellas 
textile and apparel workers rallied under murky skies on the 
windswept steps of the capitol at noon chanting save our jobs 
save our jobs 
some watched the debate from the galleries later and rep ken 
gray dill the presiding officer warned them to be quiet when 
they applauded some prooverride oratory after that they looked on 
in silence 
i cry out for our country said rep butler derrick dsc 
chief sponsor of the bill he said free trade was leading the 
nation down the same economic path that eroded the financial power 
of the british empire 
rep sam gibbons dfla one of the bills fiercest critics 
contended however that it would prove costly to consumers 
it imposes a tax on american consumers of about 20 billion a 
year he said 
rep olympia snowe rmaine whose homestate shoe plants have 
been hammered hard by imports appealed to the house to ignore 
the ideological rot of an obsolete freetrade policy and enact 
this sensible trade bill 
a democratic critic of the measure rep tom downey of new york 
said that if the house were to do this by secret ballot there 
would be no doubt about the outcome to override the presidents 
veto makes no sense 
open markets make everybody richer he said 
in vetoing the measure sept 28 reagan said it represented 
protectionism at its worst would raise prices narrow consumer 
choices and invite retaliation against american exports some of 
the most prolific producers of textiles and apparel are among the 
top customers of us agriculture 
textile industry supporters say their goods are being squeezed 
off store shelves by a flood of imported goods produced by asian 
textile mills and apparel plants they point to a 17 percent 
increase in imports in the 1980s and wide layoffs including 29000 
lost last year 
textile industry earnings fell 12 percent in the first quarter 
of this year sponsors say 
critics however say the textile industry is flourishing 
largely because of a wave of automation over the last few years 
that sharpened its competitive edge they say that facelift more 
than overseas competition is responsible for layoffs 
manufacturers already are protected by 1400 quotas covering 42 
countries plus high tariffs 
reagan vetoed a similar measure in december 1985 and sponsors 
were unable to muster the support they needed in the override 
attempt in august 1986 
the house approved the current bill 263156 a year ago and the 
senate approved it 5936 two weeks ago the house voted 248150 
last week to accept senate changes in the legislation and send it 
to reagans desk 
joining the administration in its opposition to the measure were 
an array of importers and retailers as well as industries wary of 
trade protectionism lest it unleash retaliation against the goods 
that they send overseas 
supporters included the textile apparel and shoe industries and 
the labor unions that represent their employees the amalgamated 
textile and apparel workers union and the international ladies 
garment workers union 
support for the measure cuts across partisan lines not only 
within congress but among rankandfile supporters 
stella mcgovern an employee of a philadelphia upholstery plant 
for the last 12 years arrived for the capitol rally wearing 
campaign buttons not only for the dukakisbentsen democratic 
presidential ticket but for sen john heinz rpa 
i like heinz and i also like republican sen arlen 
specter she said because he heinz is for the people and he 
votes for the trade legislation its the bills he votes for

democratic vice presidential candidate 
lloyd bentsen received a texas sendoff from cheering supporters in 
front of the state capitol and headed tuesday for his omaha 
showdown with republican dan quayle 
tomorrow is a big day for us and a big day for this 
campaign bentsen told the crowd of about 1500 people at the 
austin rally and i cant think of a greater way to start it than 
surrounded by friends here on the capitol steps of texas he said 
i have 90 minutes to explain to america why mike dukakis and 
lloyd bentsen should lead this country he said ninety minutes 
to describe our vision of america to tell the voters how lloyd 
bentsen and mike dukakis plan to keep our economy and our military 
number one 
blasting the republicans for trying time and time again to 
cut social security he also touched on democratic themes of 
education and health and on what he said was proven and tested 
leadership 
george bush and dan quayle hear no questions and offer no 
answers he said they tell us to lower our sites to live on 
our past rest on our laurels 
the texas senator left the scene beneath a cloud of red and 
white balloons and with the speakers shouting the theme from the 
old television show rawhide 
before heading for nebraska bentsen spent most of tuesday in an 
austin hotel drilling for wednesday nights vice presidential 
debate with informal runthroughs and private study aimed at 
getting ready for a primetime audience 
susan estrich michael dukakis campaign manager who was helping 
bentsen in his final preparations said of the preparattions 
were not teaching him new positions on issues i think 
thats what the quayle people have to do 
you certainly dont have to teach him scripts on the issues 
which i assume they are doing on the other side 
rep dennis eckart dohio played quayle in mock debates on 
monday he injected some humor into the session by leaving the 
room returning in a ronald reagan mask and wishing bentsen luck 
from a 3by5 card said campaign spokeswoman ellen moskowitz 
eckart had to return to washington on monday night for a vote in 
the house and mike mccurry bentsens campaign press secretary 
was playing quayle on tuesday 
mccurry said bentsen was looking for the best way of making a 
point memorable or punchy but was having trouble with the time 
limits 
the red light goes off frequently he said 
its all a matter of getting ready to present it in twominute 
answers and oneminute rebuttals estrich said our counsel to 
him has been to be himself 
some of dukakis top advisers were helping bentsen prepare 
including estrich and media adviser tom donilon campaign chairman 
paul brountas planned to meet bentsen in omaha moskowitz said 
the texas senator also will have a crowd of capitol hill 
colleagues supporting him in omaha 
the democratic campaign has chartered a jet from washington to 
fly in about 40 members of congress including many of his senate 
friends some of them will also work afterward to get out the 
democratic viewpoint or spin on the results of the 90minute 
debate moskowitz said

a federal judge bypassed a defiant yonkers city 
council tuesday and designated a site for lowincome housing to 
replace one the roman catholic church did not want to give up 
should the council fail to come up with an alternative by oct 
12 and should the new location pass muster by the us department 
of housing and urban development the judge ordered the city to 
acquire it under penalty of contempt 
us district judge leonard sand previously used a contempt 
order to force the council to endorse a plan to build 800 units of 
affordable housing throughout the states fourthlargest city he 
imposed fines that doubled daily until reaching 1 million 
confronting the city with layoffs and cutbacks 
despite the endorsement vote a council majority still opposes 
the 800 units as well as 200 units of lowincome housing in a 
predominantly white area sand intended the construction as a 
remedy to his 1985 finding that the city intentionally segregated 
housing and schools for 40 years 
isnt it a fact that the council assumes no responsibility 
but to take a purely negative position to be against whatever it is 
the parties or court proposes sand repeatedly asked city 
attorney michael sculnick at a hearing tuesday 
sculnick replied that there was neither a sufficient majority on 
the council to designate a site nor was there a desire to 
participate in choosing an alternative site for 22 units of 
lowincome housing to replace property located on st josephs 
seminary 
it is hypocritical for the city to proclaim its desire not to 
use the seminary site against the wishes of the archdiocese while 
refusing to take any positive action that would obviate the 
problem sand said 
sand gave the city a week to choose alternative sites and 
ordered hud to do a preliminary review of any property the council 
proposes to determine its suitability 
a very preliminary review of the site designated by sand 
indicated it was feasible said john herald huds attorney 
sand did not immediately threaten the city council with contempt 
for failing to choose an alternative site but he openly expressed 
anger as he has not done through eight years of the case 
what perhaps is the most distressing and offensive aspect of 
the position taken by the city is its willingness to use the 
seminary site and the churchstate issue as a ploy to defeat or 
indefinitely delay the fulfillment of the citys obligation to 
build affordable housing sand said 
the church challenged condemnation of its property and a 
federal appeals panel told sand to hold a hearing to determine 
whether there were other sites the council argued that until the 
churchstate issue was resolved it would do nothing to cooperate 
with the desegregation order it said if another site were chosen 
to replace the seminary site that would invalidate the whole plan 
it had agreed to 
the site designated by sand had been proposed by yonkers mayor 
nicholas wasicsko at a city council meeting last week but the 
council refused to vote on it after court wasicsko said there was 
a chance the council would choose another site but he wasnt 
optimistic

police sealed off sections of 
cape town tuesday blocking streets with armored vehicles while 
detectives searched pedestrians and vehicles in a streetfreeze 
operation 
a policeman using a loudspeaker told pedestrians the action was 
routine and that officers were searching for suspicious parcels 
authorities began streetfreeze operations following an increase 
in the number of bombings in whiteruled south africa 
in other developments tuesday 
a policeman fatally shot a black worker who allegedly attacked 
another man with a screwdriver outside the luxury sun hotel in 
johannesburg police identified the slain man as john mhkize and 
said he was a member of the hotel and restaurant workers union that 
has been on strike at the hotel 
at the united nations in new york secretary of state george p 
shultz criticized congressionally imposed sanctions against south 
africa saying the main victims have been black businesses and 
workers he spoke to representatives of the organization of african 
unity attending the general assembly session 
four bombings in south africa over the past four days prompted 
police to respond with the streetfreeze plan last month bombings 
averaged about one a day 
the government has blamed most of the bombings on the outlawed 
african national congress saying the black guerrilla organization 
is trying to disrupt the october 26 municipal elections 
government opponents have noted some of the bombing targets were 
organizations or individuals opposed to the policy of apartheid and 
bombs have exploded in areas frequented only by blacks they said 
that indicated white vigilantes or secret units of the security 
forces might be responsible 
by law and custom apartheid establishes a racially segregated 
society in which south africas 26 million blacks have no vote in 
national affairs the 5 million whites control the economy and 
maintain separate districts schools and health services 
police gave few details about mhkizes death they said he was 
shot after he attacked a man near the entrance of the hotel and 
then went into the lobby 
about 3000 employees of the southern sun hotel chain are 
striking to protest the dismissal of some workers who did not show 
up for work on june 16 the anniversary of the 1976 riots in the 
black township of soweto many blacks observe june 16 as a memorial 
holiday 
the southern sun management began a lockout of striking workers 
on monday and said they would be dismissed on friday if they did 
not return to work 
shultz in his address to the oau delegates repeated his stand 
that mandatory sanctions deprive the united states of the leverage 
it needs to press for an end to south africas apartheid system 
he said american businessmen forced to sell their holdings in 
south africa have done so at bargain prices to the south 
african industrial and financial elite and that is the wrong 
signal for the united states to be sending 
we believe that a more fruitful approach is to help the 
victims of apartheid build their bargaining power through 
assistance for education economic opportunities and community 
development for south africans shultz said 
the secretary said the political outlook for south africa is not 
encouraging 
we remain deeply concerned that unless the accelerating cycle 
of violence practiced by both the government and its opponents 
is stopped south africa will continue its descent into a siege 
mentality and garrison state in which all south africans become 
losers he said

political killings torture and detention without 
trial are widespread in asia amid civil and ethnic conflicts in 
large parts of the continent amnesty international said wednesday 
in its annual report on a global survey the organization cited 
24 asian countries for alleged human rights violations in 1987 
it said soviet and afghan troops often in reprisal attacks 
against anticommunist rebels killed dozens of unarmed civilians 
in afghanistan unlawful killings by government forces also were 
reported in the philippines indonesia sri lanka and india 
the report from the londonbased international human rights 
group included these allegations 
in the philippines security forces or governmentbacked 
vigilante groups killed more than 100 leftwing political 
activists members of labor unions and peasant organizations 
several thousand political detainees were held in india without 
charge or trial under antiterrorist laws and a government inquiry 
into the massacre of scores of unarmed moslems produced no results 
there were continued killings in sri lanka of tamil civilians 
often in reprisal for attacks by militant tamil groups fighting for 
a separate state 
between 1983 and the end of 1987 more than 680 tamils 
disappeared in sri lanka and it is believed many were shot or 
tortured to death by security forces most tamils are hindus and 
claim discrimination by sri lankas buddhist sinhalese majority 
amnesty international said governments used a variety of methods 
to suppress criticism 
it said singapore and malaysia imposed press laws allowing the 
government absolute authority to restrict any publication deemed to 
have engaged in domestic politics or to have alarmed public 
opinion 
in south korea it is against the law to give information to 
foreigners that officials judge could insult or slander the 
state the report said 
it also said a majority of asian countries carried out 
courtimposed executions amnesty international opposes the death 
sentence as inhumane punishment 
the report said that in china more than 200 convicted criminals 
were put to death for offenses ranging from murder and rape to drug 
smuggling theft and showing pornographic movies but that 
figure represents only a fraction of the total number of death 
sentences and executions it said 
at least 70 people were sentenced to death in pakistan but the 
real total may have been considerably higher the report said

voters decided tuesday to let the sale of 
alcohol continue in the county where a church bus crash blamed on a 
drunken driver killed 27 people most of them children 
the voter turnout was one of the highest ever recorded in the 
northern kentuckys carroll county with groups on both sides of 
the issue providing rides to the polls for voters 
the referendum was made up of two votes one on whether to ban 
the sale of alcohol in carroll county and a separate vote for 
carollton one could be dry and the other wet 
in carroll county 1173 voted for the status quo while 750 
voted against it in the city of carrollton 1211 voted to retain 
legal liquor sales while 450 voted to ban them 
chuck webster leader of citizens for the legal sale of alcohol 
said the bus crash influenced some people to vote on the side of 
the wets 
a lot of people took it personally they felt by voting no it 
would be accepting some responsibility for the bus crash webster 
said 
trudy mahoney a spokeswoman for the prodry organization 
citizens for a better life said the group accomplished its goal of 
letting the people decide 
we did accomplish what we set out to do we gave the people 
the chance to vote she said im sorry we didnt win but we 
gave the people the opportunity to say what they wanted 
earlier tuesday debbie roeder a member of citizens for a 
better life said the vote has been wanted for many years the 
bus crash probably did prompt people into action whereas before 
they thought whats the sense 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the issue has burned in the county since may 14 when a pickup 
truck driven by larry mahoney collided headon with a church bus on 
interstate 71 twentyfour of the victims of the fiery crash were 
children 
authorities said mahoney was drunk at the time he has been 
charged with murder drunken driving and other counts 
ms roeder said opponents of alcohol elsewhere had a keen 
interest in the results of the carrollton voting 
if a little town the size of carrollton that has as many 
liquor establishments as its got can actually vote it dry its 
like hey maybe we can do this she said 
there are 37 places in the county selling beer including gas 
stations and convenience stores according to the carroll county 
chamber of commerce 
the county has about 9200 residents including carrolltons 
population of about 3900 
this vote has been wanted for many years said ms roeder 
the bus crash probably did prompt people into action whereas 
before they thought whats the sense 
the problem here is the majority of drinkers have been 
very irresponsible she said 
at the opposite extreme the wets led by citizens for the 
legal sale of alcoholic beverages argued that banning alcohol sales 
would be both a financial and moral burden 
i voted wet i dont mind telling you i firmly believe in it 
my 88yearold mother believes in it said louise fitzpatrick 
54 there would be a lot of bootleggers and more accidents if 
liquor were banned 
the dry forces estimated they spent less than 1000 on 
newspaper advertisements but no radio commercials 
the wet forces spent about 6000 on an extensive newspaper and 
radio campaign 
the carroll county clerks office said 520 new voters had been 
registered boosting the total eligible for the referendum to 
6039 the largest number of registered voters in a decade

the iraqi foreign minister said tuesday 
that the latest iraniraq peace talks have gone well but insisted 
the shattalarab waterway and persian gulf must be navigable if 
negotiations are to progress 
the talks that ran aug 25 to sept 13 in geneva and shifted to 
new york last weekend 
foreign minister tariq aziz of iraq told the 43rd general 
assembly that iran accepted the security councils peace 
resolution only because of a crushing military defeat and in the 
context of a struggle for power inside iran 
he said this made baghdad suspicious of irans motives as to 
whether iran sincerely wanted a lasting peace treaty with iraq 
this suspicious position was followed by the iranian 
delegations insistence on provisions which impose a de facto arms 
embargo on iraq at sea said aziz referring to irans searches 
of neutral ships in the gulf for war cargo bound for iraq 
iraq insists the shattalarab waterway which forms part of the 
two countries southern border must be cleared of sunken ships and 
silt accumulated during the eightyear war 
shattalarab is iraqs only outlet to the high seas said 
aziz 
he denied this was a precondition saying the demand was spelled 
out to the security council throughout proceedings that led to 
peace talks opening in geneva on aug 25 a unmonitored 
ceasefire went into effect on aug 20 
baghdad says irans policy of searching ships violates the 
ceasefire which calls for a halt to all military actions on air 
sea and land 
iran insists it has the right as a nation at war to search the 
ships and says peace talks should be limited to the issues in 
resolution 598 with no extraneous concerns such as shattalarab 
aziz met with secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar before 
addressing the general assembly he said both hope that a date will 
be decided soon on resuming peace talks in geneva 
asked if perez de cuellar introduced new proposals he answered 
we are discussing all possible ideas on how to make further 
progress and the discussions went well with his excellency 
last saturday aziz met with iranian foreign minister ali akbar 
velayati for direct peace talks but the session soon shifted to 
indirect talks with the secretarygeneral and his special 
mediator swedish un ambassador jan k eliasson 
on friday and monday aziz and velayati met separately with the 
secretarygeneral and their aides met monday 
from the statements made by both delegations during the weekend 
and from azizs speech tuesday no indication emerged of progress 
on the major issues

president jose sarney told the nation 
tuesday night that the enactment of a new constitution will 
complete brazils transition to democracy 
the constitution is to be adopted wednesday replacing 
authoritarian laws handed down 20 years ago by the military chiefs 
who ruled brazil from 1964 to 1985 
in a nationwide television address sarney said this is a 
historic date for our country the enactment of the new 
constitution brings us to the end of a long path my mission of 
helping the country through its transition to democracy is 
fulfilled 
but brazilians dont know how their life will be affected by the 
new charter a 245article document that touches on issues ranging 
from interest rates to mining rights and land reform 
sarney had fought some measures included in the charter but he 
said tuesday he would be the constitutions greatest servant 
the president of the constituent assembly rep ulysses 
guimaraes said the constitution will consolidate a 
representative and participatory democracy the 559member 
twochamber congress that was elected in 1986 worked for 19 months 
as a constituent assembly to produce the charter 
it decentralizes the governments power abolishes the 
presidents power to impose laws by decree ends censorship makes 
torture a crime and broadens workers rights to unionize and strike 
it also regulates education divorce the rights of native 
indians and the activities of oil and mining companies 
foreignowned mining companies will have four years to hand over 
majority control to permanent residents of brazil while domestic 
companies will receive unspecified privileges from the 
government those measures were seen as a victory for leftists 
but rightwing members of congress scored with landreform 
provisions that make productive land not subject to 
expropriation 
one of the most controversial articles limits real interest 
rates to 12 percent a year but it doesnt specify what real 
interest rates are and it has been suggested another law will be 
needed to make the limit effective 
some legislators say the real interest is above the inflation 
rate which the government has said will register 800 percent this 
year many banks and credit associations now charge more than 1000 
percent interest 
guimaraes considered the architect of the constitution said 
monday the charter would be respected by all including the armed 
forces 
the military period left deep marks he said there is an 
awareness that the regime is good and from the armed forces we 
have heard only words of support and confidence in the stability of 
democracy

an 8yearold girl was awarded more than 7 
million by a jury that concluded she suffered brain damage 
cerebral palsy and blindness because of city hospital negligence 
around the time of her birth 
what made this case so tragic was the fact that the hospital 
had several opportunities to save the child from her dreadful fate 
but it failed so obviously and miserably thomas a moore the 
lawyer for the childs family said 
moore said bellevue hospital and its physicians made mistakes 
and misdiagnoses in caring for the girls mother ora stewart 
two days before her child was born ms stewart visited the 
hospitals emergency room complaining of a vaginal discharge but 
was sent home the lawyer said the next morning she returned to 
bellevue with labor pains five minutes apart but again was sent 
home he said 
ms stewart gave birth to the child shavon skinner the 
following day in her apartment because of complications the 
newborn had trouble breathing and after she was rushed to 
bellevue went untreated for more than 24 hours even though she was 
having seizures the lawyer maintained 
fred winters a spokesman for the city health and hospitals 
corp said the agency had not yet closely examined the jurys 
finding but there appeared to be grounds for an appeal and the 
award may be excessive 
after deliberating for three days the manhattan state supreme 
court jury awarded 4945 million for medical expenses and other 
care for shavon skinner 750000 for her pain and suffering and 
15 million for shavons loss of enjoyment of life for a total 
award of 7195 million moore said 
during her pregnancy ms stewart was an employee of the city 
department of social services which entitled her to free medical 
care and hospitalization in a city hospital moore said 
ms stewart received regular prenatal care at a city clinic she 
was 29 years old when shavon was born and was considered a 
highrisk patient because of hypertension and an overweight 
problem moore said 
since the girls birth ms stewart has been on an extended 
leave of absence to take care of shavon the lawyer said 
the negligence suit was filed against the city in 1980 several 
months after shavons birth moore said

franks place has been canceled but the 
restaurant that inspired it is still cooking 
thats sad chef austin leslie owner of chez helene said 
tuesday after learning that the critically acclaimed cbs comedy had 
been canceled it wont hurt us though im still a star around 
here 
leslie said the on againoff again series provided him with more 
fun than customers or fame it did well for me and we had some 
good times over it but i was on a roll before it and im still on 
a roll he said 
chez helenes creole soul french and cajun food has appealed 
to black and white new orleanians for a long time but leslie said 
he did see an increase in tourists because of the television show 
i think it showed some people from around the united states 
that they could come into the black community and enjoy 
themselves he said it also gave the taxi drivers another 
place to tell people about they would tell tourists to try the 
real franks place he said 
leslie said he never tried to copy the show that had copied him 
some people said why dont you change the name of the 
restaurant but i didnt i did use the franks place theme during 
the republican national convention but were still the same as 
we ever were he said 
franks place brought more than excitement to chez helene 
however leslie said star tim reid visited the restaurant several 
times after his original scouting trip when it was selected as a 
model for the fictional restaurant 
he came in a couple of more times including the time they shot 
lifestyles of the rich and famous here and hugh wilson the 
producer brought all the writers in after carnival he presented me 
with a jacket he said 
leslie said news of the cancellation by cbs surprised him since 
everyone he talked to said they liked the show they said they 
liked to watch it but could never find it because the network moved 
it around so much he said 
chez helene which has been in operation since 1942 will 
continue to dish out everything from fried chicken to gumbo he 
said 
im just glad i kept my head through it all glad i kept my 
perspective it didnt put me on the map i was already on the map 
it made us a little bit more famous but i always thought wed have

social democratic prime minister ingvar 
carlsson installed his new government tuesday pledging lower 
taxes six weeks annual vacation for workers and a streamlined 
national defense 
his policy speech to parliament expanded on his campaign themes 
for last months election in which his party retained office as a 
minority government 
the social democrats have led sweden for 50 of the last 56 
years they took 156 of the 379 seats in parliament and govern with 
the tacit support of the communist party which holds 21 seats 
carlsson said every worker male or female will be entitled to 
double the current amount of parental leave by 1991 and may take 
18 months off work with full pay 
new legislation will guarantee everyone an extra week off for a 
total of six weeks annual vacation a privilege now enjoyed only by 
workers over 40 years of age 
carlsson who inherited the premiership after olof palmes 1986 
assassination introduced a largely unchanged 21member cabinet 
one addition was laila freivalds 46 a latvianborn woman who 
becomes justice minister 
carlsson promised to introduce a bill to lower the tax rate next 
year by 3 percent easing a situation which discourages overtime 
and slows the national growth rate 
the top tax bracket would drop to 72 percent an average swede 
with a salary of 23000 will lose 47 percent of his paycheck to 
taxes instead of half of it a finance ministry spokesman said 
lack of workers and the low level of saving is limiting 
growth pushing up prices and costs carlsson said specific 
measures will be implemented to increase saving and make better 
use of peoples will to work 
corporate taxes and the 235 percent value added tax a form of 
indirect sales tax will be reviewed he said 
the prime minister moved to defuse criticism from his armed 
forces commander and the rightwing opposition that the military 
lacked funds to carry out government defense strategy 
the army will be reformed and made more efficient he said 
without elaboration the policy of neutrality is supported by a 
strong defense to protect our independence

wounded by police gunfire died tuesday after a fivehour police 
interrogation hospital officials said 
raimundo conceicao whom officials described as a psychopath 
shortly after the piracy died of kidney failure according to a 
medical report released by santa genoveva hospital in goiania 850 
miles northwest of rio 
on sept 29 conceicao burst into the cockpit of a brazilian 
airliner on a flight from the western amazon regions to rio and 
demanded that the plane fly to the federal capital of brasilia he 
reportedly told negotiators he wanted to crash the plane into a 
government building to settle accounts with the government 
because of what he called its recessive economic policies

goiania where conceicao shot and killed the copilot and wounded

said the cause of the sudden deterioration in his condition were 
not known 
a hospital doctor who spoke on condition that he not be 
identified said however that the upward surge in blood pressure 
could have been caused by a buildup of intestinal gases during the 
lengthy interrogation

saying his health had deteriorated the contents of conceicaos 
police deposition were not made public 
on monday government officials announced that passengers at 
major brazilian airports now will have their baggage checked before

a blackout blamed on the bombing of power 
pylons hit the capital and other areas in a 1300 mile stretch of 
chile tuesday night the eve of a referendum on rightwing gen 
augusto pinochets presidency 
at least eight loud explosions were heard in the capital city of 
santiago moments after the outage hit at 1030 pm 9 pm edt 
but police spokesman luis retamal said no immediate reports came in 
of damage or injuries 
the indication was that the later explosions may have been 
caused by explosives intended to produce noise but do little damage 
retamal in an interview broadcast by radio mineria of santiago 
said he could not confirm the cause of the blackout but police 
sources said terrorist bombs toppled at least three power 
transmission towers 
cities from tal tal 690 miles north of santiago to puerto 
montt 650 miles to the south were hit by the outage authorities 
said some communities in between were unaffected or suffered only 
a flickering of lights in some sectors of santiago power was 
restored in a half hour other areas remained without power an hour 
later 
a similar blackout struck chile saturday night and also was 
accompanied by explosions that caused no apparent damage or 
injuriees the government blamed that outage on bombing of three 
power towers by leftist terrorists even though chiles small 
leftist urban guerrilla groups have declared a unilateral truce 
until after the referendum 
voters declare on wednesday whether they want pinochet as 
president for eight more years and his opponents predict the 
decision will be no authorities say they will keep strict order 
alberto cardemil an interior ministry undersecretary dismissed 
fears expressed by the political opposition and roman catholic 
church officials of violence by pinochet supporters on election day 
he accused the opposition of spreading unfounded rumors and 
told a news conference any violence would be organized by the 
extreme left 
opposition leaders the church and the us state department 
said monday they had information that progovernment provocateurs 
might carry out attacks to create a pretext for declaring an 
emergency and curfew perhaps with the goal of annulling the 
results 
cardemil said there were no plans to declare an emergency or as 
some people fear to require that television and radio stations 
broadcast only official information but he added i cant make 
any assurances 
pinochet the 72yearold army commander who seized power in 
september 1973 trails in most polls 
his name is alone on the ballot chiles 74 million registered 
voters are asked to respond yes or no to a proposal by the 
general and other military chiefs that he remain in power until 
1997 
if a majority says yes pinochet will begin a new eightyear 
term in march if the result is negative an open election is to be 
held next year with power being turned over to the winner in march 
1990 
on tuesday us ambassador harry barnes was summoned for a 
private meeting with foreign minister ricardo garcia who was 
evidently angered by a newspaper article in which barnes was quoted 
as saying he prefers an opposition victory in the referendum 
the embassy issued a statement denying that barnes publicly took 
sides in the vote saying barnes reiterated in the article the 
wish of the united states for a rapid return to democracy as well 
as its firm support for basic human rights 
neither barnes nor garcia commented publicly after the meeting 
the new york times on tuesday quoted barnes as saying in an 
interview in santiago i look forward to coming back in march 
1990 when the first democratically elected president would be 
inaugurated if the no wins rather than having to wait until 
1997 
at this point i think the no will win if the process 
doesnt get interrupted barnes was quoted as saying 
congressional elections are planned for 1990 whatever the 
referendums outcome the last legislature was disbanded 
immediately after the military ousted the elected government of 
president salvador allende an avowed marxist who died during the 
coup 15 years ago 
the new congress will be virtually powerless to amend pinochets 
1980 constitution which gives the military both autonomy and a 
supervisory role in making national policy because of provisions 
written into the charter 
patricio aylwin president of the centrist christian democratic 
party and spokesman for a 16party opposition coalition said the 
referendum was certain to go against pinochet 
we are going to vote and we are going to win he told 
reporters 
polls open at 8 am 7 am edt and close at 5 pm 4 pm 
edt but will be allowed to stay open longer to accommodate lines 
of voters 
both the interior ministry and the opposition coalition plan to 
make unofficial tallies but the official count by the national 
election board is not expected until friday 
wednesday has been declared a holiday and sale of alcoholic 
beverages will be prohibited

in public affairs ordered two new publications established to 
provide more information about the communist party and government 
tass reported tuesday 
the official news agency reported the politburo also reviewed 
plans for a central committee meeting devoted to agriculture but 
did not say when the conference would be held 
it said the politburo ordered plans drawn up for an overhaul of 
management in the farm sector traditionally one of the weakest 
performers in the soviet economy 
tass said one publication will cover the activities of the 
communist partys policymaking central committee and the other 
will be produced by the council of ministers the soviet cabinet 
it said the 12member politburo made the decision during a 
meeting monday no reason was given for the delayed report 
at a nationwide communist party conference in june and july some 
delegates said they were told little about the actions of the 
central committee and they did not even know the responsibilities 
of individual party leaders 
tass reported the politburo ordered the publication of a journal 
to be called news of the cc of the cpsu central committee of 
the communist party of the soviet union 
it is planned that it will officially publish the decisions of 
top party organs and draft resolutions on major issues of party and 
public affairs the agency said 
a newspaper to be called government news will be established 
to inform the public on how the governments economic social and 
cultural decisions are being carried out and on the progress of 
perestroika president mikhail s gorbachevs drive for reforms 
according to tass 
it was stressed at the politburo meeting that the 
publication of the journal and the newspaper will be in line with 
the partys policy of deepening the democratism of the political 
system of our society and promote greater openness in state 
affairs tass said 
it did not say when the publications would first appear how 
often they would be published or the number of copies to be 
printed it was unclear how their content would differ from 
existing soviet publications many of which are controlled by the 
central committee or government 
tass said the journal will report periodically on the activities 
of the central committee and print transcripts of important party 
meetings and conferences information about party elections 
biographies of leaders and historical material from party archives

pillsbury cos stock skyrocketed tuesday 
after britains grand metropolitan plc launched a surprise 517 
billion tender offer and the food conglomerate moved to block the 
proposal in state courts 
the bid which caught the nations fourthlargest food company 
off guard offers pillsbury stockholders 60 cash for each of 862 
million common shares outstanding 
on wall street pillsbury stock soared 18 a share to 57 in 
heavy trading composite new york stock exchange trading 
pillsbury said in a statement late in the day that its board 
would review the offer at an appropriate time a spokesman said 
pillsbury was not approached by the british liquor food and 
retailing giant before the takeover offer was announced 
pillsbury also said in a later statement it had sued to block 
the acquisition in 13 states contending a buyout by grand met 
would violate state liquor laws prohibiting liquor manufacturers 
from owning retail liquor outlets namely some of pillsburys 
restaurants 
courts in the states of texas oklahoma new mexico michigan 
kansas pennsylvania and missouri already have issued temporary 
restraining orders enjoining grand met from acquiring any pillsbury 
stock and a delaware court has rejected grand mets effort to stop 
those actions pillsbury said 
ian a martin grand metropolitans chief executive for us 
operations said he tried unsuccessfully to contact pillsbury 
chairman philip l smith after arriving in minneapolis tuesday 
morning he said he did not want the offer to be interpreted as a 
hostile takeover 
we are very interested in doing this thing in a gentlemanly 
manner he said the sooner we get in a conversation with them 
the happier well be 
although the bid came as a surprise pillsbury had been viewed 
as a potential takeover target because of its lackluster 
performance and turnover in its top management 
in july smith then chairman of rival general foods corp 
replaced william h spoor as pillsburys chairman spoor came out 
of retirement earlier this year to run the company on an interim 
basis after the former chairman john stafford resigned under 
pressure 
the company has been trying to rebound from the effect of a 
restructuring that caused its profit to fall to 693 million in 
fiscal 1988 on sales of 62 billion 
analysts called the grand metropolitan offer a fair price 
its going to be a bid that pillsbury management is going to 
have difficulty defending against said john m mcmillen an 
analyst for prudentialbache securities inc in new york i think 
theyll fight it initially attempt to fight it but i think its 
a losing battle 
stephen carnes an analyst with piper jaffray amp hopwood in 
minneapolis said grand metropolitan indicated its offer was 
negotiable and he predicted the price would rise 
we put a top price at 70 a share not higher than that 
carnes said 
i think pillsbury management is going to have a tough time 
snubbing this offer off he said this is a premium price 
grand metropolitan said in a filing with the securities and 
exchange commission that if the bid succeeded it planned to sell 
off pillsburys steak amp ale and bennigans restaurant operations 
distron distribution pillsburys inhouse distribution system for 
its burger king restaurants also would be sold the filing said 
the struggling restaurant division provides about half of 
pillsburys revenues 
pillsbury management has been under pressure to either boost 
revenues at burger king the worlds secondlargest restaurant 
chain or sell it but grand metropolitan executives are bullish on 
burger kings prospects 
we believe burger kings problems have been overrated said 
martin 
the londonbased grand metropolitan maker of smirnoff vodka and 
jampb scotch is intent on focusing on its foods liquor and 
retailing operations and expanding its operations in north america 
on friday it announced it was selling its intercontinental 
hotel chain to a japanese concern and earmarked the 227 billion 
in cash it received for acquisitions 
with annual sales of about 10 billion grand metropolitans 
businesses also include hotels alpo petfood and pearle vision 
centers 
analysts speculated grand metropolitan was most interested in 
pillsbury for its green giant vegetable haagendazs ice cream and 
van de kamps frozen fish operations 
martin agreed there were good prospects for marketing 
pillsburys food products overseas especially its microwavable 
foods 
grand metropolitan also is embroiled in a contested bid for 
irish distillers group plc irelands leading whisky maker for 
which grand metropolitan has offered around 465 million

the young quartet singing songs from the 1930s 
and 40s on the pbs special the all night strut could not 
have been praised by a more authentic source 
i got quite carried away it had been a long time since id 
seen a revue like that said maxene andrews onetime member of 
the singing andrews sisters and host of the 90minute special 
airing friday 
the quartet didnt do the 28 songs just like they were done in 
those decades though said miss andrews who does not sing on the 
special 
i think interpretations werent as theatrical then they do a 
couple of very exciting theatrical things in this show our 
interpretations were more musical she said 
there was so much wonderful energy that they gave the show i 
sat there and thoroughly enjoyed it 
the singer who now tours the country more than half the year 
with her onewoman show said even though the 30s had the 
depression and the 40s had world war ii the songs were mainly 
cheerful she tells the audience we were a nation of optimists 
full of confidence sure that the future was bright and the songs 
of the time reflected those feelings 
in the years before world war ii miss andrews said benny 
goodman came in and he started the swing era it seemed like the 
depression was coming to an end and jobs were more plentiful 
everybody wanted to tap their toes it got to be a bit of a frenzy 
nightclubs were busy there was lots of talent around and lots of 
places to go to see the talent 
fran charnas on the faculty of boston conservatory created the 
review the all night strut which had its premiere in 1975 in 
cleveland since then various singers have toured with it the 
present quartet katharine buffaloe janet hubert lance roberts 
and jim walton played for two weeks at penn state university and 
one of those concerts was taped for pbs 
three of the songs were andrews sisters records the 
boogiewoogie hit beat me daddy eight to the bar shoo shoo 
baby and youre a lucky fellow mr smith 
the andrews sisters sang some of the others too miss andrews 
said but after other singers or bands had made them popular 
brother can you spare a dime coming in on a wing and a 
prayer ill be seeing you and in the mood 
the andrews sisters had 19 hit records starting with bei mir 
bist du schoen in 1937 it was important to have a hit 
record miss andrews said after that did you have a good act 
after that it was i hope they pick me up for motion pictures 
there wasnt much chance for groups in pictures we were one of the 
lucky ones i think we did 21 movies 
for the last nine years miss andrews has sung alone the oldest 
sister laverne died of cancer in 1967 maxene and patty were on 
broadway in over here in 1974 after the show my 
brotherinlaw kicked me out of the nest maxene said he said

if corporate america is in the midst of chaos 
asks professor eugene jennings why is it earning so much 
jennings rhetorical question was provoked by the popularity of 
a current best seller managing chaos by tom peters who 
several years ago captured the fancy of readers with in search of 
excellence 
if corporate america is in a period of chaos said jennings 
then it is indeed managing it well since return on equity for the 
first half of 1988 was more than 20 percent the first time thats 
been done since 1950 
besides he wondered if you manage chaos well do you still have 
chaos or do you have a contradiction 
what is seen as chaos by some says jennings who himself has 
written many analytical books about corporations and is a 
confidential adviser to chief executive officers is the emergence 
of a new way of doing things 
in this transitional period he says old ideas have not totally 
lost their usefulness while the credibility of emerging ideas has 
not been fully evaluated 
in this emerging world jennings states each corporation is 
seeking an optimal meld of old and new practices and policies 
especially in regard to people and technology 
some companies he observes moved too quickly toward intensive 
hightech manufacturing as a way of remaining globally competitive 
general motors for example had to pull back because its people 
system was not yet rebuilt 
ford chose the reverse schedule stressing its people system 
first and letting hightech warm on the back burner until it could 
be accommodated 
once corporate america has its optimal meld of the two then 
look for it to move ahead aggressively parked on the doorstep are 
some hightech equipment and processes that when introduced will 
make the past 20 years look puny 
some companies will go too fast he warns and they will create 
the semblance of chaos but he adds 
for the most part business history shows that once we get a 
workable relationship between people and hightech we can stick to 
it for several decades 
these are some of the people transitions that jennings sees 
as under way 
old ideas of respect for authority being replaced by respect 
for the idea 
central decision making giving way to problemdriven decision 
making 
rewarding for results rather than simply for corporate loyalty 
machine systems in which individuals performed almost as cogs 
evolving into peopleoriented operations that stress human skills 
once an optimal working relationship is established says 
jennings it still might be as demanding as the old conveyor belt 
people will have to keep up he warns a system built 
around human qualities can turn out to be just as coercive as one 
built around the assembly line or a machine master 
but he adds there will be a major difference with regard to 
the introduction of technology the melds made today between old 
and new allow for much more flexibility than the machine systems of 
the past 
he believes the evolution of such concepts as lifetime 
employment for example are likely to lessen opposition to 
changing work styles which in the past have caused upheavals in 
business and personal lives 
if you know how to read the changes youll find that this 
emergent world is not chaotic said jennings instead it is 
carefully slowly evolving and will lead to stability when new and 
old notions are melded at their optimum 
the professor who teaches business at michigan state 
university suggested that a lot of popular notions about business 
might be in the minds of the viewer rather than in the reality of 
the marketplace 
five years ago he said several dozen companies were extolled 
in in search of excellence twothirds of them said the 
professor later got into financial difficulties

on a recent weekday the rev 
alphonse stephenson is chainsmoking and still managing to talk at 
a rapidfire pace filling the air with cigarette smoke and waving 
arms 
even in church on sunday parishioners accustomed to a quiet 
mass are either delighted or somewhat taken aback when the 
38yearold priest bounces down the aisles filling his sermons 
with humorous stories and priesttoparishioner banter 
stephenson throws himself into the priesthood with a joyful 
abandon but its not his only devotion 
im a professional musician called to be a priest he said 
ive seen too many priests who are burned out because they look 
at the priesthood as a profession 
from 1980 to 1986 stephenson took a fulltime leave of absence 
from the ministry to serve as conductor for a chorus line both 
on the national tour and on broadway 
after his performances he relaxed at his grandparents home in 
point pleasant beach a cottage where a black concert piano 
dominates the living room and a talkative gray parrot rules the 
dining room 
he became involved in religious life again by making friends 
with priests at the local church st peter by the sea soon he 
found himself helping the shortstaffed parish by celebrating 
sunday mass 
the return to a religious atmosphere came at the same time that 
stephenson felt a need to do different kinds of music something 
beyond a chorus line 
i wanted to do a concert he said 
he called upon a local musicians union and found 42 very 
interested colleagues in april 1986 they gave their first concert 
at st peter by the sea it was an instant success stephenson 
said inspiring people who were surprised to hear beethoven and 
other classical composers in a church setting 
a church is where the origin of majestry begins he said 
its a very different religious experience 
and after paying the musicians the church was able to realize 
a nice profit stephenson said 
soon afterward the musical priest met roger bernier a local 
financial consultant who now serves as the orchestras business 
manager 
together we began thinking if the orchestra makes such a 
profit for one pastor why cant it have the same effect for other 
parishes stephenson said 
in its first year as a formal group the orchestra of st peter 
by the sea raised more than 250000 for charitable organizations 
in the new jersey area bernier said 
organizations needing money hold raffles bingo pot luck 
suppers a typical 1950s dance to raise funds but then they start 
to run out of ideas stephenson said 
at first many are skeptical of a classical concert in a church 
setting because they expect a religious flavor he said the 
concerts do have a religious bent but i talk to the audience 
describe the music and how the musicians are feeling and the 
emotions of the composer at the time he wrote the piece 
many symphony orchestras have lost audiences because they fail 
to teach the finer points bernier said 
the orchestra of st peter by the sea is looking to expand its 
audience bernier said perhaps by performing at colleges and in 
other states stephenson would also like to perform in large 
churches he fondly recalls a concert at st pauls church in new 
york city that was absolutely majestic 
stephensons next project is to create a sacred music program 
for large acoustically perfect beautiful cathedrals that have 
never heard this music in years 
the music would be along the scope of a production such as the 
wellknown handels messiah he said but would concentrate on 
longlost religious works that modern orchestras would probably 
never consider 
ideally the priest hopes to find benefactors who would 
financially support such a venture to open it to the public for 
free 
id be looking for older people who feel the church needs this 
again people concerned about the arts who see that the church was 
always a preserver and promoter of the arts he said 
another challenge will be to persuade a prospective audience to 
listen to a sacred music performance stephenson said 
people will not leave the church and say oh ive been 
converted he said im suggesting that it could be used as a 
motivator of faith whatever your faith may be 
stephenson maintains that his concerts could move even a 
17yearold fan of new wave rock music 
parents make a big mistake in the united states when they say 
things like oh thats their music he said twisted sister 
might be jolly to teenagers now but i wonder when they turn 80 if 
theyll get the same enjoyment out of it and if it will refresh 
their soul

an interdenominational organization 
that works to uphold the nations religious qualities the 
religious heritage of america has named the rev charles r 
swindoll as clergyman oot enough 
schools pass the extra costs on to parents and because parents 
have little money to the parents work units 
most work units go along because if they dont the school may 
refuse to take their workers children said one beijing worker 
with a 7yearold daughter 
the state education commission opposes charging fees but the 
situation is quite complicated a commission spokesman yuan 
yongtang told the associated press in many cases he said the 
schools have no other choice if they want to stay open 
yuan said the commission does not keep track of what schools 
charge but a spate of reports in the official press in recent 
weeks hints at the extent of the problem 
the liberation road primary school in the eastern city of 
lianyugang for example panicked parents when it demanded their 
work units supply 1000 to 3000 yuan 270 to 810 for each 
student china youth news said some units refused and many students 
were kept from class 
this is overt extortion it quoted one parent as saying 
the peoples daily the communist party newspaper published a 
picture of a dozen elementary school children in the central city 
of wuhan standing outside their school gate with signs around their 
necks reading we want to study they had been banned from 
class after their parents work units refused to pay school fees 
the size of which was not given 
an official at the wuhan foreign affairs office who identified 
himself as comrade yang said other schools in wuhan also barred 
students because of inability to pay fees that he said generally 
range from 30 yuan 8 to 100 yuan 27 
yang said the wuhan city government ordered schools in september 
to accept all schoolage children he added that he believed all 
students were in class by months end 
the state education commission also declared in september that 
excessive fees would not be permitted but set no specific 
ceilings there is no limit on the donations a school can accept 
so schools that have good relations with parents work units agree 
quietly on what is needed and call it a donation 
problems arise only when the work units balk 
we have good relations with several work units said mrs 
gao of hujialou primary school they fix windows or doors or give 
us a little money one unit donated cooking equipment for the 
cafeteria she said she refused to give the amount of annual 
donations 
many schools also set up small factories on their grounds with 
teachers and staff as workers 
no 80 middle school assembles calculators mrs gao said 
with envy our teaching staff here is very small so we cant 
spare anyone to do this sort of work 
but hujialou does send a teacher to a nearby factory to keep its 
books with most of the teachers factory salary going to the 
school

it was the summer of the great drought the 
worst dry spell since dust bowl days the ground baked crops 
sagged and hopes withered under the blistering sun with autumns 
arrival many farmers face a bitter harvest wondering if theyve 
produced enough to keep them on the land another year for a few 
fortunate farmers where rain has fallen it will be a bountiful 
harvest a time to celebrate one of their best years ever 
sidebyside stories look at two counties in iowa at harvest time 
carroll blessed by rain and washington cursed by drought 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
in the waning days of the searing summer the 
hundling family journeyed to a nearby farm festival hauling 
10foot corn stalks that hung out the back of their pickup truck 
they left with two blue ribbons 
its been that kind of year 
while farmers across the midwest have cursed mother nature for 
delivering a devastating drought the hundlings sing sweet praises 
to her their new lady luck 
were really blessed to get what we got here said shelley 
hundling who farms with her husband david and their two children 
amid the rolling hills outside this rural hamlet 
what they got was rain plenty of it in a year when the soil 
was sucked dry crops collapsed and farmers in much of the nations 
heartland cursed the blue skies overhead carroll county has seen 
an embarrassment of riches 
how would i describe it extremely fortunate that weve got 
the rainfall said dennis molitor county extension adviser 
farmers are realizing its just a stroke of luck theyve got it 
here its kind of an oasis in the midwest 
on a scale of 10 itll be an 8 or 9 breda farmer roger 
nieland said in describing the coming harvest 
the county recorded 2105 inches of rain from april through 
august slightly above the normal 195 inches in the same period 
though a few dry pockets can be found molitor said 80 percent of 
carroll county is in good shape 
for farmers in this pocket of westcentral iowa it will be a 
bountiful harvest theyve got the best of both worlds molitor 
said theyve got an excellent crop and excellent prices very 
rarely does that occur 
corn for example he said has increased from 262 a bushel 
from 142 a bushel a year ago soybeans are about 8 a bushel 
compared with 496 a bushel a year ago if a farmer produces 150 
bushels of corn an acre he said it could mean an additional 174 
per acre 
were reaping the benefits molitor said and other 
farmers are suffering the consequences 
farming prospects in general have improved in recent years after 
the worst financial crunch in agriculture since the depression in 
1987 net cash farm income the yearly amount farmers have 
available to spend was estimated by the government at a record 
571 billion 
the agriculture department is forecasting 1988 net cash income 
could reach 55 billion to 60 billion 
when it comes to iowa experts say its too early to determine 
the impact of the drought on the state economy but early signs are 
encouraging experts say august sales tax revenues were 105 
percent higher than in the same period in 1987 but last august had 
two more working days than the same month in 1987 
and though much of carroll county made briefly famous in 1959 
when soviet leader nikita khrushchev paid a visit is a picture of 
prosperity with lush green fields and rich black soil not many 
farmers are boasting about it 
its almost kind of embarrassing said paul de shaw a 
broker who also farms and expects to his yields to be as good as 
1987s bumper crop 
you feel guilty about saying how good the crop looks sai 
hundlings brother and farming partner charles its nothing you 
did you feel you cant be happy even though youre happy 
but merchants in carroll the county seat are relieved 
when the weather is bad farmers may have the same amount of 
money but may not be as willing to let go of it said cj niles 
executive vice president of the carroll chamber of commerce when 
its good business is good 
carroll is also luckier than many other rural towns business 
leaders say because it has an industrial base and isnt totally 
dependent on the farm economy its location in the center of 
western iowa attracts thousands of shoppers from scores of nearby 
towns 
today theres plenty of reason for optimism here land values 
molitor said are up 24 percent in the last two years and county 
yields on the average should match those of last year 115 
bushels of corn an acre 38 bushels for soybeans the county also 
is a big hog producer 
hundling also predicts a harvest that should equal last years 
when he reaped as much as 150 bushels of corn an acre 
my dad said itll be your best or one of your best ever the 
lanky softspoken farmer said modestly you trust the 
oldtimers 
iowa farm country has long been good to the hundlings they live 
in the home that belonged to hundlings greatgrandfather a 19th 
century presbyterian minister who published and printed a german 
language newspaper from a building behind his house 
hundling followed in the footsteps of his grandfather and father 
in tilling the soil outside this tiny town of 450 even in the 
darkest dust bowl days the family always had a harvest 
despite that record hundling plays down his repeated good 
fortune 
molitor said thats typical for a farmer 
farmers are always extremely reluctant to admit success or 
prosperity he said they feel theyre going to be exploited 
its just a very shrewd business decision 
and this season wasnt troublefree a may hail storm ripped 
across the farm and forced hundling to replant nearly 100 acres 
weve paid a price this year too in lost soil and lost time 
he said almost defensively 
but the rains came they fell steadily and no one dared grumble 
one 5inch rain fell in july 
we woke up the morning of july 17th we were walking on air 
hundling said it was relief it was kind of a holiday 
with corn youve got to have the rain at pollination time it was 
there right when you needed it 
his crop shows it the soil is smooth and the golden corn with 
fat kernels ears touching one another towers well above the 
6foottall hundling 
in august the hundlings proudly displayed three giant stalks at 
a small farm festival in wall lake their two children won two 
contests the best corn and the tallest and walked off with blue 
ribbons no surprise to their father 
when we brought them in he said people just knew we were 
going to win

no one looks or sounds quite like sade so it 
should come as no surprise that her entry into show business came 
under unusual circumstances 
i was driving along with a friend in london and we both said 
god its misty we went to visit somebody and misty was 
playing on the radio someone than asked me if i was going to see 
misty in roots a reggae band tomorrow 
i went and i met these boys that i was at school with they 
said theyve got a group was i interested in singing do i know 
any singers who could just rehearse they pursuaded me that i 
should join them 
the rest as they say is pop history three platinum albums 
five top 10 singles and total record sales of over 20 million but 
in the beginning 
i remember my first concert she recalled our stage was 
built on empty beer crates i had to stand still because my heels 
got stuck in the cracks its not easy 
but how many singers make it seem as easy as sade her relaxed 
vocals influenced by marvin gaye and nina simone among others 
helped make smooth operator a hit single in 1984 while 
diamond life became the alltime bestselling debut album for 
a female british singer 
sade the singer should be distinguished from sade her 
group composed of stuart matthewman on guitar and saxophone 
andrew hale on keyboards and paul s denman on bass 
sade won a grammy in 1985 for best new artist 
i think anybody who is the least bit interested really knows 
its not just coming from me the singer said rather than me 
with a backing band of musicians were talking about a group of 
people 
one problem at first was songwriting no one in the group had 
any experience 
stewart and andrew are musically welleducated paul and i are 
ignorant sade said it isnt hard to find the ability it does 
take a lot out of you you fight with the songs you fight to get 
how you want it to feel or sound the ability isnt that special 
sade was typically lowkey about her success 
the ultimate goal is to simply get pressed onto vinyl there 
are not that many people who approach it that way 
she also downplayed the impact of her unique appearance 
occasionally i get marriage proposals from women as well 
sade said with a laugh you dont get to peoples hearts by the 
way you look i dont think success can be sustained on an image 
alone once someones got a photograph of you thats the end of 
it 
diamond life was just the beginning the next album 1985s 
promise was an even bigger seller and yielded the hit single 
sweetest taboo 
sade has been active politically as well appearing at 
antiapartheid concerts and a benefit for nelson mandela the 
imprisoned leader of the african national congress 
ive got a conscience sade said ive been brought up to 
be concerned not only about what affects me immediately its more 
a question of compassion or consciousness the oppression of any 
people is important to me 
the latest album stronger than pride took about a year to 
make although the songs written in spain and london have the 
same gentle rhythms as the previous records sade insists that 
pride is the groups most upbeat record 
i thought it was a lot harder than the other albums she 
said it depends on the volume the context in which you listen 
turn my back through big speakers in a club may sound hard and 
loud 
all four members contributed to the songs on stronger than 
pride the title track a top 10 single was inspired by a 
conversation sade had with a friend 
we were talking about pride i said one thing is stronger than 
pride and thats love the sentiment is something i always felt 
sade was born helen folasude adu in 1959 the daughter of a 
nigerian teacher and his british wife her parents separated when 
she was 4 and sade moved with her mother to londons north end 
at st martins college in london she studied fashion and had 
created her own line of menswear before pursuing a career in music 
joining a jazzfunk band pride in 1982 
she has come a long way since performing on beer crates and 
recently played to sellout crowds here at radio city music hall 
its easier for me to sing in front of the audience she 
said in the studio weve only just written the songs once you 
start rehearsing you actually do better youre stimulated by the 
audience your singings more heartfelt

as he labored on the life of george bernard 
shaw michael holroyd had an advantage not available to earlier 
biographers he had no help from shaw 
what i discovered was that the major biographies of him 
certainly archibald hendersons frank harris had actually been 
written to a considerable extent by shaw himself in the third 
person holroyd said he had ghosted his own life 
indeed it is possible to say that some of the more severe 
passages are actually written by shaw 
holroyd has just completed bernard shaw the search for love 
random house 2495 which takes shaw from childhood in dublin 
to his early years in london his first romantic affair with a 
friend of his mother and his marriage to charlotte paynetownshend 
in 1898 
two more volumes are to follow next year and in 1991 
the amount of material to cover was enormous shaw was a 
novelist a music critic a playwright whose works included 
pygmalion man and superman and st joan a fabian 
socialist a militant vegetarian a reformer of spelling and a 
tireless writer of letters 
at the end of a 50page letter he once wrote forgive this 
long letter i didnt have time to write a short one 
it has been 13 years since holroyd began the project which was 
initiated by shaws residual legatees the british museum the 
royal academy of dramatic art and the national gallery of ireland 
holroyd a 53yearold londoner who is married to the novelist 
margaret drabble did not go to college he says the subjects of 
his biographies lytton strachey in 1968 augustus john in 1974 
and now shaw have been his professors 
since the last major biographies were published in 1956 the 
centenary of the great mans birth many letters diaries and 
manuscripts have come to light holroyd said 
so rather than having old gbs recollections of himself at age 
20 as earlier biographers had holroyd said he had access to 
letters shaw wrote at the time 
what shaw wanted from biography was an endorsement for his 
political opinions he didnt want to seem freakish eccentric 
odd with an illegitimate background which might make his socialism 
merely a tributary or an eccentric growth or itself 
illegitimate the british writer said on a recent visit to new 
york 
illegitimacy was a gnawing issue in shaws childhood in dublin 
his father george carr shaw was a drunken neerdowell the 
family household was run by george vandeleur lee a voice teacher 
and choral conductor who had befriended shaws mother the menage 
was doubly scandalous because lee was a roman catholic while the 
shaws were protestants 
shaw grew up unloved by father or mother a circumstance he 
later said admirably equipped him for the world 
he himself said he had the choice to make a tragedy of them or 
a comedy he made a comedy people laughed but they didnt 
understand always that shaws ideas came in the form of jokes and 
then you have to unravel the joke to find the serious content 
holroyd said 
my theory was that he orphaned himself from his parents and 
made himself the child of his writings he believed that he 
inherited from his parents qualities that were so incompatible as 
to drive them to live in different countries and that his quest in 
life was to find some reconciliation for those opposites that he 
had inherited 
i believe that the great debates in his plays are the 
negotiations for that peace treaty in himself as it were 
holroyd began the shaw project by immersing himself in the 
subjects works 
it took me i would say at least two years to break the code 
of his language of his jokes to understand to attune myself 
after 18 months i was in some despair about this would i could 
i tune in to him or he to me 
the research is now mostly done holroyd said and hes relieved 
to be in contact with readers once again if he attempts another 
biography after this he said he would prefer someone who didnt 
live so long shaw was 94 at his death 
there have been times when i would have been tempted to kill 
him off at the age of say 75 a very reasonable age rather than 
go on to his mid90s holroyd said 
ive been tempted to think that when he went to russia in 1931 
i could when i come to that point suggest that the russians 
substituted a replica shaw filled this replica shaw with a great 
deal of soviet propaganda which i neednt bother about because 
its not the real shaw 
i could stop my narrative then on his 75th birthday which he 
celebrated i think in moscow and just add an appendix which 
would appeal to john le carre fans and get me extra sales

obscure country music performer bobby 
joe ryman says he was honored as a little country boy to be 
picked to do an album as the lone american singer on the only 
soviet record label 
the 47yearold ryman who performs nightly at a nashville 
restaurant recorded the album country boy in moscow in the 
soviet union in early september 
hes been told the record could sell up to 5 million copies when 
it is released in the soviet union early next year thats 
considerably more than he sells at the melrose house restaurant 
where he peddles his cassette tapes for 6 to audiences no larger 
than 200 per meal 
his pictures sell for 2 he has a tip hat at the front of 
the stage for customers to show their special appreciation of his 
music 
for a little country boy like me i felt honored he said as 
he reflected on his eightday visit to the soviet union 
melodyia records of moscow chose him in january to become the 
only united states singer on the soviet record label melodyia 
officials heard him perform at a music industry convention in 
cannes france where he was singing to try to stir up some 
overseas bookings 
within a few days the soviets had decided to add the 
silverhaired former building contractor to their roster eight 
months later he traveled to the soviet union under his first 
recording contract with a record label 
it feels wonderful great he said about his selection 
its a dream i couldnt sleep you just dont have the words to 
explain it or why it happened 
he and a dozen american musicians backup singers and record 
producer stan cornelius flew to moscow where they were joined by 
soviet singer laima vaikule who also performed on the album 
songs on the album include to all the girls ive loved 
before singin the blues we could and shes not you 
to all the girls ive loved before was a hit by willie 
nelson and julio iglesias singin the blues was recorded by 
the late country star marty robbins we could was a hit by 
little jimmy dickens and later charley pride and shes not you 
was one of elvis presleys records 
it has not been determined yet if the album will be available in 
this country 
ryman and vaikule also did a music video to accompany the song 
we could 
that was the highlight of the trip ryman said as he counted 
proceeds at the restaurant my heart pounded 
he also remembers with special fondness the remarks of the 
soviet video crew the greatest thing said to me was when they 
said i should be the ambassador of love and goodwill that was an 
honor 
he recorded mostly in english but learned a little russian the 
new language was one of the difficulties of the joint project 
it was hard for me ryman recalled i cant speak english 
too well let alone russian 
an interpreter was provided to aid communication 
i found that if you get the younger russians looking at you 
and you talk pretty good to them theyll understand 
ryman a native of nashville personally financed his previous 
album the seven faces of bobby joe prior to that he spent 28 
years remodeling homes one of his goals is to sing on nashvilles 
grand ole opry the country music show thats been presented since 
1925 
the trip to moscow left him with memories far surpassing any he 
developed as a contractor he visited red square and was the 
subject of a documentary on soviet television he may return next 
year to do a sixweek concert tour with vaikule 
it was a beautiful experience he said the people were so 
warm and loving no one can come up with the words to describe the 
russian people when they come up and put their arm around you and 
say i love you its amazing 
they hated to see us leave people were crying at the 
airport 
vaikule described by cornelius as a pop singer and dancer 
plans to come to nashville later this year to record 
shell take the spotlight here like i did there ryman said

oil futures prices have declined to levels not seen since august 
1986 and the government has reported a strong rise in factory 
orders signaling what some experts say will be continued 
noninflationary growth for the us economy 
the jump in factory orders reported monday by the commerce 
department indicates the economy continues expanding at a healthy 
clip while lower oil prices should dampen the inflation that 
accompanies rapid growth economists said 
but experts cautioned that consumers probably would not benefit 
significantly from the drop in crude oil prices unless they 
remained at the currently depressed levels for an extended period

forces trying to keep rp scherer corp off the 
auction block may have have lost a round in their fight as the 
companys board of directors takes a step toward a possible sale 
on monday the gelatin capsule maker announced its board voted 
unanimously friday to hire the investment banker goldman sachs amp 
co to look into a variety of alternatives including sale of the 
company to a third party or to management 
for months the board has been involved in a fight over control 
of the company split between forces backing president and chief 
executive officer peter fink who has opposed any sale and 
dissident shareholders led by his estranged wife karla scherer 
fink who also is the daughter of the companys late founder 
the dissident group also successfully blocked several management 
stockoption proposals mrs fink controls about 33 percent of the 
companys shares 
a proxy fight over the issue last august in which the 
dissidents ousted at least one director who opposed their plans 
has spilled over into the court of chancery in delaware where 
scherer is incorporated 
scherer spokeswoman jayne colombo declined to say monday whether 
the vote by fink and others to explore a possible sale represented 
a shift in their positions 
analyst dean gulis of william c roney amp co of detroit said the 
decision could represent such a move but he also said recent 
action in the overthecounter market where scherer stock is 
traded represented a very attractive price for this stock 
during the past several months while the corporate wrangling 
has been going on scherer stock has been trading in the mid to 
upper20 range 
scherer stock closed at 2875 a share on monday up 25 cents 
from fridays close in national overthecounter trading 
i think it fridays decision is just a recognition that 
ok we have a big chunk of the stock that wants to sell the 
company and fine lets see if we can sell the company gulis 
said 
fridays vote by 10 board members did not include a ballot from 
one board member whose seat is in dispute 
in addition to sale the board said in a news release the firm 
would look into merger and recapitalization fink said the decision 
to hire goldman sachs did not mean necessarily that the company 
would be sold 
the board is to meet again oct 25 and will review findings of 
the firms investigation 
pending before the court in delaware are complaints by directors 
john scherer frederick frank and theodore souris who have said 
they favor selling the 2800employee company and peter a dow 
who has backed keeping the company dow who was running for 
reelection said some votes for him were not counted in the august 
board election 
also on monday fink announced that scherer chairman wilber 
hadley mack 78 had retired after serving as the companys 
chairman since january 1980 in the announcement fink said mack 
would remain on the companys board and a member of its executive

the us exportimport bank by guaranteeing 
commercial banks loans to third world countries may be able to 
encourage banks to step up financing world trade the government 
banks president john a bohn jr told congress 
us commercial banks have turned away from supporting 
exports to large segments of the globe he said in remarks 
prepared for delivery today to the subcommittee on exports of the 
house committee on small business 
some bankers say they will only make more loans to the third 
world which already owes over 12 trillion to banks and has 
fallen far behind on repayments if they get government guarantees 
at last weeks meeting of the international monetary fund in 
berlin treasury secretary nicholas f brady and other western 
leaders came out strongly against shifting responsibility for risky 
loans to the shoulders of governments and their taxpayers 
for the year that began oct 1 congress has authorized the 
exportimport bank to make only 695 million worth of direct loans 
but to guarantee 102 billion in loans by private banks 
bohn explained that commercial banks now have more stringent 
rules to make sure that they have enough capital for international 
loans and that they have set aside enough reserves to protect their 
depositors so commercial banks have little appetite or capacity to 
take risks in some countries he added 
many banks have dropped out of trade finance altogether others 
will only help their biggest and best customers he noted bohn 
would like to encourage small american businesses to export more 
he said a los angeles commercial bank recently approved a 15 
million line of credit for the los angeles local development corp 
to make working capital loans that may be guaranteed by the 
exportimport bank 
we believe this may show the commercial banking community 
a way to participate once again profitably in trade finance bohn 
said

pillsbury co says it was caught by surprise 
when the british giant grand metropolitan plc launched a 
60ashare takeover bid for the food conglomerate 
the offer would be worth about 517 billion based on 
pillsburys roughly 862 million common shares outstanding 
it was first outlined in an advertisement in todays new york 
times and discussed later by grand met officials at a london news 
conference 
craig carver an analyst for dain bosworth inc in minneapolis 
said the bid was a heck of a good offer but other analysts 
predicted other offers might surface 
i would say top dollar is in the 70 a share range this 
just might be the first volley said stephen carnes an analyst 
wth piper jaffray amp hopwood in minneapolis 
pillsbury stock closed at 39 a share monday up 112 on new 
york stock exchange trading in pillsbury was delayed today but 
there were indications the stock would open above 57 a share 
johnny thompson a pillsbury spokesman said pillsburys 
management was not approached by grand met and that he only learned 
of the offer after being contacted by the news media late monday 
weve received nothing and weve been contacted by no one 
thompson said and until something like that happens were in no 
position to make a comment 
clive strowger chief executive of grand mets food division 
said the company launched the surprise bid because there was no 
indication that its pillsburys management was interested in 
receiving a friendly approach 
at the london news conference grand met officials said ian 
martin chief executive of grand mets us operations had 
traveled to minneapolis and hoped to meet with top pillsbury 
management later today 
we are prepared to enter into negotiations immediately with 
respect to all aspects of our proposal including price martin 
said in a letter delivered today to pillsbury chairman philip l 
smith 
pillsbury the nations fourthlargest food conglomerate 
produces green giant vegetables haagendazs ice creams and van de 
kamps frozen fish its restaurant operations include the steak amp 
ale and bennigans chains 
the offer by grant met a diversified food retailing and hotel 
company that is the worlds largest spirits company was 
conditioned on a majority of pillsbury shares being tendered on 
pillsbury shareholders approving the merger and the pillsbury board 
of directors invalidating the companys takeover defenses 
grand met said it began litigation on monday in delaware 
chancery court seeking to invalidate pillsburys poison pill 
takeover defense which would make an unsolicited merger 
prohibitively expensive 
pillsbury has been the target of lively takeover speculation in 
recent months due to management turmoil and sagging earnings that 
have helped depress its stock price 
the company which gets about half of its total revenue from its 
restaurant operations including the troubled burger king fastfood 
chain has been attempting to rebound from the impact of a 
restructuring that caused its profit to fall to 693 million in 
fiscal 1988 on sales of 62 billion 
the profit decline stemmed largely from a restructuring charge 
associated with the sale of its godfathers pizza chain and a 
number of other restaurant operations and consolidations 
pillsbury tapped smith the former chairman of rival general 
foods corp as its new chairman in july he replaced william h 
spoor who came out of retirement earlier this year to run the 
company on an interim basis after former chairman john stafford 
resigned under pressure 
in his letter to smith martin said grand met would make 
minneapolis the world headquarters of the companys international 
foods group 
he also said grand met sees great promise in the burger king 
business which has great prospects for improved profitability 
in the united states and for expansion in international 
markets 
pillsbury management has been under pressure to either boost 
sagging revenues at burger king or divest the unit which is the 
worlds secondlargest restaurant chain 
grand met with annual sales of about 10 billion makes 
smirnoff vodka and j amp b scotch and has interests in food 
retailing and hotels its other businesses include alpo petfood and 
pearle vision centers 
last friday the company announced the sale of its 
intercontinental hotel chain to seibu saison group of japan for 
227 billion in cash from which it expected to net about 845 
million after taxes grand met said it planned to use the procceds 
for further acquisitions 
pillsbury has strong powerful consumer brands and that is 
something very dear to our hearts grand met chairman allen 
sheppard told the london news conference 
the company has said its strategy is to focus on foods liquor 
and retailing and to expand its operations in north america 
grand met currently is embroiled in a contested bid for irish 
distillers group plc irelands leading whisky maker for which 
grand met has offered around 465 million

help shape positions and strategy 
when we hit an issue we think who are the best people we can 
turn to said robert j shapiro deputy issues director for 
economics on the dukakis campaign there are a couple of people 
who play a special role in that they are consulted on a wide range 
of issues certainly larry is one of them 
summers is a macroeconomic specialist who shares dukakis belief 
that government should play a larger role in encouraging 
investment promoting business and aiding the middle class what 
he calls a helping hands policy to replace the invisible 
hand of the reagan administration 
like other liberal economists summers contends that the 
enormous national debt amassed in the last eight years makes the 
economic prosperity so touted by republicans nothing more than a 
house of cards 
theres a sense of unease summers said in a recent 
interview in his harvard university office that sense i think is 
a more important thing than the feeling of prosperity people have 
at the moment theyre aware of the fragility of that prosperity 
and the fact that it is borrowed 
according to summers foreign acquisitions of us companies 
will triple this year over last median family income is around 
1969 levels government spending on the nations infrastructure is 
onefifth of 1960s levels support for university research has 
dropped 95 percent since 1980 38 million americans are without 
health insurance homelessness has tripled under president reagan 
as a nation we havent looked to the future and were in 
danger of not being ready when the future comes he said 
as a surrogate spokesman for the campaign summers has become 
politically more astute in recent months stepping up attacks on 
bush and toning down some earlier more candid pronouncements on 
economic issues where he once said reducing the deficit requires 
higher taxes now he says of the tword i think it would depend 
on the political and economic situation following the election 
just 33 years old summers credentials are daunting which 
shouldnt be a surprise considering his economics lineage 
summers parents anita and robert both are professors at the 
university of pennsylvania and two uncles paul samuelson at the 
massachusetts institute of technology and kenneth arrow at stanford 
university have won nobel prizes 
summers graduated from mit at age 20 and earned his doctorate 
from harvard in 1982 a year before joining the faculty at age 28 
last year he became the first social scientist to receive an annual 
500000 national science foundation award 
before coming to harvard summers spent 10 months on the staff 
of the president reagans council of economic advisers an 
experience he said left him disillusioned 
there was less emphasis on helping everyone in the country 
rather than meeting the needs of the privileged few he said of 
the republican assignment 
like other members of dukakis kitchen cabinet summers became 
involved in the campaign through harvard connections he had 
tutored jack corrigan the campaigns operations director who last 
year recommended tapping summers 
with just three economists and about 30 recent college 
graduates the campaigns economics staff relies on outside 
advisers in business government and the private sector on beacon 
hill capitol hill and wall street 
in addition to summers key figures include robert rubin vice 
chairman of the investment firm goldman sachs co rudy oswald 
head of economic research for the aflcio robert reich the 
iconoclastic professor at harvards kennedy school of government 
and dan tarullo a staffer on the senate labor committee 
the point of talking to larry and lots of other people is to 
be sure we get it right to be sure that weve seen all the aspects 
of an issue and that we understand it correctly shapiro said 
were looking for more than a sound bite on the news were 
thinking about how best to govern this country and thats serious 
business so we use serious people 
summers helped develop the financing features and then publicly 
explained the college loan plan proposed by dukakis last month 
designed to aid middleincome families the program allows students 
to repay loans by withholding a small fixed percentage of income 
over a lifetime 
larry was one of the people involved in pulling together the 
details said dukakis issues director christopher b edley jr a 
kennedy school graduate and harvard law professor he took a lead 
in getting in touch with people other economists and in thinking 
through the financing mechanisms 
edley said summers unlike other eggheads has an ability to 
push a button and stop being an academic professor 
hes been remarkably helpful at working on speech lines or 
thinking about events to communicate the message he said hes 
been surprisingly good in ways one might not think an academic 
would be 
moreover summers has been willing to take on assigned tasks 
answer calls at all hours and provide viewpoints that may differ 
from his own 
its easy enough to find somebody who has a lot of stature and 
smarts wholl be happy to spend a day briefing the governor on how 
to be leader of the free world edley said its harder to find 
someone who is willing to get their hands dirty

when ronald reagan was preparing to debate 
jimmy carter in 1980 stanford university economist michael j 
boskin had a background role as a practice questioner 
one administration later boskin is providing some answers for 
george bush in his drive for the presidency 
boskin 42 is by all accounts ready to follow bush to the white 
house in january to collect the reward due a highly regarded 
staunchly loyal republican economist the influential chairmanship 
of the presidents council of economic advisers may await if bush 
wins 
michael is right there at the top of the hierarchy of 
campaign advisers said mark goodin bushs deputy press secretary 
he is very heavily involved in advising the vice president on a 
wide range of economic issues 
boskins most notable contribution to the campaign is a proposal 
he helped to shape for dealing with the federal budget deficit the 
socalled flexible freeze would hold federal spending except for 
social security benefits to the levels of the 1989 budget plus 
inflation 
the political beauty of the plan is that it doesnt commit bush 
to any specific budget cuts individual programs would not have to 
be frozen but additional spending in any category would have to be 
balanced by reductions in other programs 
this summer boskin was quoted widely as saying it could 
eliminate the 150 billion deficit which he sees as the nations 
most pressing economic problem in four years but he contended in 
a recent interview only that it would achieve the task over the 
next few years 
it will depend partly on how the economy does he said i 
never said it would entirely eliminate the deficit by 1993 
it is that caution and sense of what is both eminently doable 
and sound economics as he describes the conditional freeze that 
has earned bushs trust 
as part of his growing campaign duties boskin now flies around 
the country briefing reporters and audiences on the vice 
presidents proposals he also prepares position papers and reviews 
the proposals of other economists 
last may he was one of a group of experts who visited bush at 
his home in kennebunkport maine to plot economic strategy among 
others at that meeting was martin s feldstein former chairman of 
president reagans council of economic advisers who also remains a 
highprofile economic adviser to bush 
boskin like his counterpart in the democratic camp lawrence 
summers of harvard university is at ease mixing economics and 
politics 
whats especially good about michael is that hes had some 
practical experience and has a good idea how the world works 
said martin anderson former domestic policy adviser to reagan and 
boskins colleague at the hoover institution 
he has an excellent reputation as an economist and he also 
has an idea of the reasonable political thing to do he said 
a native of new york boskin moved to los angeles with his 
family when he was 6 his father was working as a construction 
contractor his mother as a bookkeeper and then an accountant 
he studied economics at the university of california at 
berkeley where he was named the outstanding graduate of the class 
of 1967 
boskin wrote his dissertation on the effects of welfare and 
other incomemaintenance programs on the size of the labor force 
winning the national tax associations award for outstanding 
doctoral dissertation 
he is described by anderson as a hardline republican but at 
berkeley in the tumultuous 60s boskin was known as quite liberal 
i was sympathetic with the goals freedom of speech civil 
rights and i still am he said earlier this year but i was 
not sympathetic with the methods such as student sitins and 
strikes 
he went from berkeley to stanford where he has been ever since 
except for a year of teaching at harvard a decade ago and brief 
periodic consulting jobs for congress besides his unpaid work for 
bush this year he has been busy writing two books on economics 
teaching a graduate course in fiscal policy and an introductory 
economics course and acting as west coast director of the national 
bureau of economic research a think tank 
boskin minces no words in his criticism of the economic policies 
of bushs campaign foe he says massachusetts gov michael dukakis 
would foul up one of the best growth episodes in the 20th 
century that has occurred over the past five years 
that includes a huge reduction in inflation and interest rates 
and immense expansion of employment he said 
while he acknowledges that growth in wages has fallen behind the 
pace of the 1950s and 60s he contends thats a byproduct of 
rapid job growth and says overall living standards have not 
declined 
we have the beginning of some major transformations in the 
role of government in the economy weve had success in reducing 
marginal tax rates we have to build on what we have boskin 
said 
boskin was sharply critical of reagans early policies in his 
book entitled reagan and the economy the successes failures and 
unfinished agenda but like bush who eight years ago brass who 
appears on the new abc sitcom just the 10 of us 
commercials begin with the maxie doll at school or with friends 
then switch to theiss the reallife maxie in the same 
situations charness said calling it innovative advertising for 
a fashion doll 
the company expects to spend about 7 million on maxie 
commercials and live presentations through the end of the year 
charness said 
maxie comes in several variations three different making 
waves dolls a looking smart doll with skirt stockings and 
boots and a scented perfect prom doll with pink minigown 
prices range from 550 to 13 
she also has four friends ron her boyfriend carly another 
blonde ashley a redhead and kristen whos black she has a 
myriad of accessories from a cordless telephone to a locker with 
builtin shower 
hasbro is betting that barbie has outgrown some of the potential 
market among young girls 
barbie is older a yuppie if you will charness explained 
we felt there was a real need in the market for dolls that are 
younger 
maxie is a high school student who does the type of things 
girls would imagine doing charness said 
but mattel the no 2 toy company says maxie a longhaired 
perpetually smiling teen with lace stockings white boots and 
various hair dodads wont even put a dent in the solid success of 
barbie 
this year were selling tremendously more dolls fashions and 
accessories said jocelyn cartermiller director of marketing at 
mattel based in hawthorne calif 
she cited unprecedented growth but would not provide 
specifics 
i dont feel its a significant threat to barbies no 1 
position as a fashion doll mrs cartermiller said of maxie 
shes been in the no 1 position for 29 years and this year is a 
record year 
and barbie is not just an executive yuppie mrs cartermiller 
said but a teenager as well 
barbie represents everything from being a teenager up to a 
doctor she said 
barbie introduced as a teenage fashion doll in 1959 was an 
airline stewardess in the 1960s and 1970s a registered nurse 
fashion editor astronaut and skin diver in the 1960s and a doctor 
in the early 1970s 
she has been able to be ageless thats something that makes 
barbie very special and makes her existence difficult to compete 
with mrs cartermiller said 
industry analyst david liebowitz of american securities in new 
york although noting that maxie can wear barbies clothes said 
maxie could not survive if it were merely a barbie clone 
what we are seeing now are products that arent competing 
headtohead with barbie but are slightly differentiated 
leibowitz said 
steven eisenberg of bear stearns amp co in new york suggested 
that maxies lower price range could bolster its competitive 
position 
although basicissue barbies can be obtained for as little as 
4 the 13 topoftheline maxie is slightly less expensive than 
the comparable perfume pretty edition of barbie which sells for 
15 
what hasbro is attempting to do here is to capture a moderate 
share of the fashion doll market at a low price range eisenberg 
said

the stock market languished today in moderate 
trading as a key bluechip index edged higher while some broader 
market measures slipped 
the dow jones average of 30 industrials which fell 765 points

market stays here and dollar stays here we can probably hold at

gene jay seagle vice president and director of technical 
research at gruntal financial inc said the market may be 
drifting but there are a number of stocks that arent 
he noted pillsbury was the most actively traded issue on the new 
york stock exchange today rocketing 18 to 57 after it received a 
takeover bid at 60 a share from a british firm grand metropolitan 
plc 
seagle said the bid may remind investors that there are some 
sizeably undervalued stocks available 
this message ought to again be heard by the street that stocks 
in the united states are selling on a lower value basis than the 
rest of the world seems to consider fair he said 
stock investors here have taken a cautious approach to the 
market in recent weeks as they try to anticipate what lies ahead 
for the economy 
while recent economic reports have indicated growth is 
proceeding at a moderate pace some concerns remain that growth 
could stimulate inflation 
those concerns have limited stock price gains as it is widely 
expected that the federal reserve would encourage higher interest 
rates if inflation were to pick up 
higher interest rates make returns on fixedincome investments 
such as treasury notes and bonds more attractive compared with 
stocks

the european economic community gave a 
cautious response tuesday to a us offer to discuss shortterm 
measures on world agriculture reform 
a spokeswoman for the european commission acting for the eec 
said the us offer was an apparent effort to unblock the current 
impasse in the uruguay round of trade liberalization talks 
the spokeswoman who requested anonymity said that the eec 
welcomed any effort to undertake shortterm reforms in agriculture 
but it would have to study the us offer made at a meeting of 
trade ministers in pakistan and see what the us position 
means 
there will be additional discussions on this she said 
until now the us has argued for the longterm elimination of 
farm subsidies and resisted pleas for shortterm reforms 
the eec believes that ending subsidies is unrealistic and 
prefers a gradual and less radical approach which would also have 
some immediate effect in restoring order to markets in farm 
products

a group of consumer activists said today it is 
resuming a sevenyear boycott of the swissbased nestle corporation 
because of its promotion practices for infant formula and is 
extending the boycott to the usbased american home products 
action for corporate accountability accused nestle and american 
home products which it called the largest manufacturers of infant 
formula in the world of distributing free formula through 
maternity wards as a prmotional tactic that undermines the practice 
of breastfeeding 
representatives of nestle and ahp have rejected the accusations 
and said they were complying with world health organization and 
individual national codes on the subject 
after the world health assembly passed its resolution calling 
for an end to the industry practice of dumping formula supplies in 
hospitals and maternity wards almost 2 years ago we assumed that 
nestle and the other formula manufacturers would abide by the 
resolution janice mantell the executive director of action for 
corporate accountability said in a news release 
since that time we have been patiently meeting with the 
companies and writing to the companies and waiting for them to 
change the dangerous promotional tactic the hard fact is that 
babies are dying as the companies are violating the wha 
resolution 
she said her group asked nestle and ahp to present a plan for 
ending their supplies programs by today neither company has 
produced one she said we have no other recourse but to ask 
for public support of a boycott against these two companies 
the boycotts will focus on two products from each company aca 
said the nestle boycott will focus on tasters choice instant 
coffee and coffeemate nondairy coffee creamer coffeemate is a 
product of carnation which is a whollyowned nestle subsidiary 
the ahp boycott will focus on anacin aspirin and the advil brand of 
ibuprofin a pain reliever 
action for corporate accountability based in minneapolis 
minn is the successor of groups that organized a boycott against 
nestle from 19771984 in the united states and nine other 
countries the groups halted the boycott after nestle agreed to 
comply with the world health organization code 
action for corporate accountability said its evidence reveals 
systematic corporate dumping of large quantities of baby milk on 
third world hospitals which violates national law in some 
countries and defies world health organization restrictions on the 
marketing of infant formula 
through sophisticated promotional techniques the infant 
formula industry persuaded hundreds of thousands of 
povertystricken mothers in the third world that formula feeding 
was best for their children aca said as a result the 
industry created a nearly 6 billion market for a product that is 
inferior in every respect to breastfeeding in areas where sanitary 
conditions for cleaning bottles are unavailable water is impure 
and the level of income does not permit families to purchase 
sufficient quantities of formula for their infants use of the 
product is deadly 
janice mantell the executive director of aca said that in the 
poorest us communities women who have been persuaded not to 
breastfeed their infants overdilute the formula to make the 
expensive product last longer their infants are quite literally 
starving as a result 
a washington spokesman for nestle dr thad jackson insisted 
that the company is in total compliance with national and 
international codes he also specifically denied that the company 
is dumping infant formula in foreign hospitals 
we do not dump supplies in hospitals said jackson we 
only supply materials at their request and in appropriate 
amounts he said if the supplies requested by the hospitals for 
distribution seems excessive then we contact the hospital 
ahp spokeswoman carol emerling said this whole activity is 
based on allegations that we violate the who code and we flat out 
deny it 
the real issue is infant health breastfeeding is best for 
infants weve always said that she said but every infant who 
is not receiving breast milk has the right to the best alternative 
available that alternative is a scientifically formulated infant 
formula that is as close to breast milk as man can make it and 
that is what our infant formula products are 
the who code permits donations or concessionary sales of formula 
for distribution to infants needing breast milk substitutes and 
says it may not be used for sales promotion

a 479 millionpound 812 million rights issue and bid by grand 
metropolitan plc for pillsbury co of the united states and the 
governmentordered reduction of the kuwait investment offices 
stake in british petroleum 
several dealers were at a loss to pinpoint the drift higher 
but others said shares recovered amid a lack of selling pressure 
and because few bargain hunters took advantage of the markets low 
levels 
some dealers were encouraged by the fact share prices didnt 
fall even further in the morning 
i can see no reason why were going better except that weve 
simply reversed engines after this mornings slide one equity

pence to 454 pence on the news grand met shares were heavily

ramada inc plans to respond in court to a 
lawsuit filed by its secondlargest shareholder a company 
spokesman said tuesday 
joe cole ramadas vice president of corporate communications 
said the company was refusing further comment on donald callenders 
suit seeking 371 million in damages 
callender who sold his marie callenders pie shops to ramada in 
1986 for cash and stock charged in the suit filed monday in orange 
county superior court in santa ana calif that ramadas directors 
shortchanged stockholders and the company by rejecting a 
10ashare buyout offer from an affiliate of the hyatt hotel chain 
the 371 million is the same price hcc corp of chicago offered 
last month for all outstanding ramada stock that it did not own 
hcc is owned by the pritzker family of chicago ramadas largest 
stockholder 
on sept 16 the directors of ramada rejected that price as 
grossly inadequate and unfair 
randall waier an attorney in santa ana who represents 
callender said the suit would permit participation by ramadas 
more than 33000 shareholders 
my response is everyones entitled to their own opinion 
said john r norton iii a ramada director 
he said ramadas directors believed that their rejection of the 
hcc offer was in the shareholders best interests 
securities analysts have valued ramada at 11 to 13 a share in 
the past five years the high for ramadas stock has been 1188 
but ramada shares have traded as low as 4 in the past year 
earnings per share have suffered as operating income at ramada has 
fallen during three of the past four years 
waier said the suit charges that directors breached their 
fiduciary duty to stockholders in several ways 
we contend that some of the board members are in a conflict of 
interest in that they are officers of ramada and they took their 
interests over those of the shareholders he said we perceive 
their motivation is to perpetuate themselves in office 
three of ramadas 10 directors are executives at ramada they 
are richard snell chairman and president paul rubeli executive 
vice president of the gaming group and thomas martin executive 
vice president of the restaurant group 
the suit also says the directors used inadequate data in their 
decision 
the board said it based its decision in part on an opinion from 
salomon brothers inc a wall street investment company acting as 
ramadas financial adviser norton said that the advisers opinion 
was only one of the considerations but that he was unable to 
reveal other sources 
a securities and exchange commission filing by hcc on thursday 
said that ramada was considering restructuring and other 
alternatives to the pritzker offer 
if the companys mismanaged what are they going to 
restructure callender said in a telephone conversation from a 
marie callenders in newport beach calif 
the stockholders lawsuit is the fourth that callender has 
brought against ramada callender and ramada have been embroiled in 
bitter disagreements during the past year both sides are suing 
each other over pie royalties and charges of mismanagement 
in 1986 ramada entered a fiveyear contract with callenders 
consulting company to assist the marie callenders chain several 
weeks ago callender claimed ramada broke off the contract for the 
135 restaurants 
one of callenders suits based on what he calls the wrongful 
termination of that contract asks the court to drop restrictions 
that require callender to hold his ramada stock for five years 
waier said callender wants to sell the stock he received two years 
ago in the marie callenders deal

stockholders of the sun co the nations 
10th largest oil firm tuesday overwhelmingly approved a major 
restructuring proposal that spins off its 42 billion domestic gas 
exploration and production into a separate operation and cuts 1300 
jobs 
at the same time the new structure retains the refining and 
marketing of petroleum into a slimmeddown business 
under the plan adopted at a special meeting in nearby king of 
prussia shareholders will receive one common share of the new sun 
exploration amp production co for each common share of sun 
effective nov 1 
record date for distribution is oct 14 
stockholders representing less than 15 percent of suns 106 
million outstanding shares opposed the plan sun spokesman ray 
enderle said he could not provide specific figures 
in 1987 sun co reported more than 91 billion in revenues it 
had some 20000 employees in the united states and eight other 
countries 
both new firms plan to reduce employment within a year sun 
exploration trimming 800 from the 4000 workers it is getting in 
the restructuring and sun co cutting approximately 500 from its 
headquarters staff 
sun exploration in the spinoff will become the largest 
independent oil and gas producer in north america enderle said as 
an integrated company that combined exploration production 
refining and marketing sun co was the 10th largest us oil 
company 
sun stock has been selling at around 57 it had shot up above 
60 when the restructuring announcement was made last july 
the stock of each of the new firms is expected to start off at 
around 28 to 30 
we were attempting to achieve an increased value for our 
shareholders said fred huffman sun co director of investor 
relations by becoming two companies the total value of the stock 
together will be more than it is alone 
since july 1 we have outperformed in the stock market other 
major oil companies and it is anticipated that shareholder value 
will continue to be enhanced 
andrew gray iii an oil industry analyst said he thinks 
stockholders will benefit from the spinoff 
youll have two purertype companies and you will have a 
purer play he said 
under a previously announced internal revenue service ruling 
neither sun nor its shareholders will incur any federal income tax 
liability from the distribution 
robert hauptfuhrer sun president and chief operating officer 
will become chairman and chief executive officer of the new 
exploration firm that will be based in dallas texas robert 
mcclements jr remains chairman and ceo of sun co headquartered 
in the philadelphia suburb of radnor with assets of around 85 
billion 
sun officials expect the restructuring to produce about 65 
million in aftertax savings for sun exploration each year and 
around 15 million for sun co mostly through payroll reductions 
sun has five refineries in pennsylvania ohio oklahoma puerto 
rico and canada mines coal in five states and sells gasoline 
under the sunoco brand at more than 6000 stations in 23 states 
it will add another 1000 outlets and a philadelphia refinery

saudi arabias move to shock fellow 
opec members into cutting oil output by forcing prices down 
undoubtedly will affect venezuelas ability to service its foreign 
debt venezuelan energy and mines minister julio cesar gil said 
tuesday 
gil told a news conference the current price war could bring 
prices down temporarily to twoyear lows of below 10 a barrel 
we are arriving at price levels of 1986undoubtedly this 
will compromise the payment of the debt gil said 
he said any decision regarding debt payments would be made by 
the finance ministry 
i do not know what price level venezuela can bear gil said 
when oil prices fell in 1986 venezuela called for 
renegotiations on its 35 billion foreign debt and stopped making 
principal payments on its 2034 billion of refinanced public debt 
while talks were held 
perhaps prices will reach a level we havent seen in two 
years this could be encouraging for opec to arrive at an 
agreement on curbing output he said 
he said saudi arabia warned other opec members of its decision 
to force prices down during the sept2526 meeting in madrid of 
opecs price monitoring committee 
we understand saudi arabias desire to bring discipline to the 
market through shock treatment but the affects do not please us 
he said a joint meeting in the third week of october of opecs 
longterm strategy committee and the price committee is likely to 
last longer than the meeting of the price committee alone 
there are more countries and more matters to discuss he 
said he said the site of the meeting has not yet been decided

grain and soybean futures prices rallied tuesday 
at the chicago board of trade bolstered by continued optimism that 
a ussoviet grain agreement is near 
export demand also encouraged buying in the corn and soybean 
pits where the underlying strength came from high demand for 
soymeal as well as tight supplies said joel karlin an analyst for 
research department inc 
a forecast for cold weather for much of the corn belt led to 
anticipation of increased consumption and also helped support 
prices analysts said dry weather however was expected to allow 
the harvest to progress and that helped temper gains 
at the close wheat was 4 cents to 5 cents higher with the 
contract for delivery in december at 426 a bushel corn was 
cent lower to 3 cents higher with december at 293 a bushel 
oats were 4 cents lower to cent higher and soybeans were 6

eastman kodak co says the new 35mm color 
film for consumers introduced tuesday represents a major 
improvement in the quality of color photographs but stock analysts 
said they want some proof 
judging the quality of a photograph by looking at it is very 
subjective and thats the problem with the new ektar color 
film analysts said 
how much sharper is sharper without a technical measure i 
cant tell if its 1 percent better or 10 percent better said 
brian fernandez of brean murray foster securities in new york 
the new film was introduced at worldwide news conferences 
tuesday 
kodak has said only that the results from the new film have to 
be seen to be believed but for some seeing isnt always believing 
eugene glazer of dean witter reynolds in new york said the 
photos he studied taken with the new film look very good but how 
good is a difficult question to answer 
ive seen plenty of superb pictures and to a degree i can 
compare them in my head but without a sidebyside comparison its 
very tough to say this is the best glazer said 
kodaks chief competitor fuji photo film co of japan had 
little to say about the development 
it is our policy not to comment on our competition said 
fuji spokeswoman carol oloughlin in new york 
ektar is an effort by kodak to develop a color film that was 
considered the standard for serious amateurs who take about 20 
percent of the 40 billion pictures made each year worldwide 
were not suggesting that everybody use this film said 
wilbur prezzano group vice president and general manager of 
photographic products weve got a terrific film for the mass 
market he said of kodacolor gold which the company introduced 
two years ago 
in fact the ektar film is not available in the speeds that 
are most popular in the general market 100 200 and 400 its two 
speeds are 25 which is unusually slow and 1000 which is 
unusually fast 
other speeds may be added to the line company spokesman ronald 
roberts said 
and kodak suggests that only owners of 35mm singlelensreflex 
cameras use the film that suggestion is also printed on every box 
of ektar film 
but its clear that kodak believes it has made a significant 
advance in the field of color photography because the company has 
broken several longstanding traditions in its effort to sell 
ektar film 
the film comes in a mostly black box instead of the yellow box 
kodak has put all of its film in since about 1903 
the film has a new name since 1942 kodak has retained the 
kodacolor name on new and improved film choosing to highlight 
advancements by adding a number or letter after the name ektar 
will be sold along with kodaks kodacolor gold line of films 
the new film will be 15 to 20 percent more expensive than 
kodacolor which costs about 379 for a roll of 24 exposures 
the new film was made possible by several unique discoveries by 
kodak scientists that improved the performance of color dyes and 
reduced the number of color layers on the film the company said 
ektar film will be available later this month in europe and 
japan where kodak says a majority of the serious amateur 
photographers live and in the united states early next year 
prezzano said the new film also sends a message to the 
photography industry that the oldfashioned silverhalide method 
of making photographs isnt ready to be replaced by electronic 
photography 
stock analyst mark obenzinger of wood gundy amp co in new york 
said kodaks effort to introduce a premium line of film is a shrewd 
marketing measure 
theyre trying to differentiate themselves from good ol 
yellow and i think this is just the beginning of it obenzinger 
said this is another tool for the company in dealing with a 
maturing market

other oil producing nations that have ignored quotas by the

investment in the nations mass transit systems 
should be doubled and the best way to do it is to earmark more of 
the federal gasoline tax the head of the nations largest transit 
system said tuesday 
only 1 cent per gallon of the federal gasoline tax now goes to 
support mass transit and it needs to be at least 7 cents to create 
a stable funding base for transit systems nationwide according to 
robert kiley chairman of the metropolitan transportation authority 
in 1987 the auto industry spent 5 billion promoting itself 
through television advertising kiley said that my friends 
is nearly 25 percent more than we spent on capital improvements for 
public transportation 
he made his remarks in montreal at the annual meeting of the 
american public transit association whose members include the 
managers of virtually every transit system in this country and 
canada as well as representatives of the businesses that supply the 
transit industry 
the federal gasoline tax now at 9 cents per gallon raises 
about 9 billion a year 8 billion of which goes to the interstate 
highways the tax which was imposed 29 years ago at 4 cents a 
gallon was created solely to finance the building of the 
47000mile interstate system it was raised by 5 cents in 1983 and 
a penny was earmarked for mass transit 
with the interstates finished the federal gasoline tax is to 
expire in 1991 
that means that the 9cent gasoline tax will be up for grabs 
so to speak kiley said 
kiley speaking as chairman of the transit 2000 task force an 
apta committee developing longterm transportation initiatives 
recommended that 
the tax be extended 
mass transit retain the penny now reserved for public 
transportation 
two cents be added to the gasoline tax to replace the 2 
billion in 
transit aid that is subject to federal budget battles each year 
another 4 cents to pay for new buses subways and construction 
of new rail systems 
with dedicated taxes to replace the 2 billion that is 
appropriated each year that money could be used to reduce the 
federal deficit kiley said 
kiley said he would seek support for the transit 2000 
recommendation from the national league of cities and the us 
conference of mayors 
reapportionment of the federal gasoline tax will become a major 
issue for the next congress and president as the nations great 
road building era comes to an end he said

four of the largest financial 
institutions in the netherlands announced a plan tuesday to act 
together to help defend dutch companies against hostile tender 
offers deemed to be priced too low 
the four partners include the two largest dutch insurers 
nationalenederlanden nv and aegon nv the third lartest banking 
group amsterdamrotterdam bank nv and the collective pension 
funds of the big electronics concern nv philips 
gloeilampenfabrieken 
the aim of the venture is to prevent quoted dutch companies 
from falling victim to a hostile takeover priced at unacceptably 
low levels amsterdamrotterdam bank as spokesman for the group 
said in a brief statement 
the group would act only if requested by a company being pursued 
in a takeover fight 
a spokesman said the partners initiated the venture in part to 
help protect dutch companies from forays by foreign companies in 
advance of the 1992 deadline for creating a single market 
encompassing the 12 nations in the european economic community 
but the whiteknight service offered by the four institutions is 
not purely of an altruistic nature but also is seen as a 
potentially major profit source said hw wolf a spokesman for 
the bank 
the intention of the venture is to defeat hostile tender offers 
either through a competing tender offer or on the open market wolf 
said 
shares acquired in that process however would not be held as a 
longterm investment or for merger purposes by the group rather 
they would be fairly quickly sold back into the stock market with 
the intention of making a profit on the transaction wolf said

us companies are getting a growing proportion 
of their total sales from exports according to a survey released 
tuesday by the conference board 
exports from the united states accounted for 10 percent or more 
of total sales at 49 percent of the surveyed companies compared to 
about 40 percent of the surveyed companies in 1986 the conference 
board said 
exports accounted for 20 percent or more of the sales in 19 
percent of the companies up from 14 percent in 1986 
the survey is based on responses from the 277 companies that 
answered the survey out of the 1800 manufacturers that were 
approached the margin of error is 3 or 4 percentage points 
according to james greene who compiled the survey 
the export gains seem likely to continue greene said however 
he said us companies are also increasing their overseas 
investments those investments rose about 18 percent in 1987 to 35 
billion he said

the house banking committee voted 428 tuesday 
to abolish the muchcriticized federal agency created to manage and 
dispose of the assets of insolvent savings institutions 
the federal asset disposition association was formed by the 
federal home loan bank board in 1985 to assist the federal savings 
and loan insurance corp in the management of acquired assets 
fada has been accused by members of congress of favoritism 
conflicts of interest and mismanagement of the 39 billion in 
loans and real estate in its care 
the bill similar to a section of the omnibus banking 
legislation approved by the house in august would assign fadas 
activities to fslic since the wideranging banking bill has run 
into trouble and may not be approved before congress adjourns this 
month a freestanding measure has a better chance of being passed 
reps paul kanjorski dpa and tom mcmillen dmd introduced 
the legsilation which would dismantle fada within 60 days and 
return its functions to fslic the government insurance fund that 
backs savings and loan deposits up to 100000 
rep fernand j st germain dri banking committee chairman 
said the panel has been investigating fada a quasipublic agency 
for the past 15 months 
our findings clearly establish that this agency has become a 
wasteful bureaucracy lacking in accountability and providing an 
inefficient means of disposing of property acquired from failed 
savings and loan associations he said high salaries big 
expense accounts and cialike secrecy have become the agencys 
claims to fame during its threeyear existence 
he quoted the general accounting office in a draft report not 
yet released as concluding that fadas functions are nonessential 
the gao the investigative arm of congress said in 
conclusion we found no compelling evidence that fada is essential 
to the management and disposition of assets acquired by fslic 
such functions could be done by a combination of other private 
sector asset management firms receivership employees and fslic 
headquarters and regional employees the gao said

the stock market gave ground tuesday for the 
third consecutive session as concerns about interest rates weighed 
on prices and more than offset the scattered gains that resulted 
from takeover speculation 
the dow jones average of 30 industrial stocks off more than 14 
points over the past two sessions lost another 320 points to 
close at 210206

consolidated volume in nyselisted issues including trading at 
regional exchanges and on the overthecounter market totaled

market stays here and dollar stays here we can probably hold at 
2100 on the dow jones industrials 
bond prices held firm tuesday while the dollar finished mixed in 
foreign exchange trading 
rao chalasani chief investment strategist for prescott ball amp 
turben in cleveland said stock prices are suffering because of the 
near9 percent yields available on 30year treasury bonds 
he said investors also face the prospect of more modest 
corporate earnings gains for the forseeable future than they saw in 
the second quarter 
on the other hand he said stocks are drawing some support from 
proposed stock buybacks and buyouts and from demand from foreign 
investors 
that was clearly illustrated tuesday as pillsbury was the most 
active issues on the nyse rocketing 18 to 57 after receiving a 
takeover bid of 60 a share from britains grand metropolitan plc 
gene jay seagle vice president and director of technical 
research at gruntal financial inc said the bid may remind 
investors that there are some significantly undervalued stocks 
available 
this message ought to again be heard by the street that stocks 
in the united states are selling on a lower value basis than the 
rest of the world seems to consider fair he said 
stock investors here have taken a cautious approach to the 
market in recent weeks as they try to anticipate what lies ahead 
for the economy 
they are looking toward fridays scheduled release of the 
september unemployment report for the latest shred of evidence on 
the economys health 
while recent reports have indicated growth is proceeding at a 
moderate pace some concerns remain that even that could stimulate 
inflation and prompt the federal reserve to encourage higher 
interest rates

grain and soybean futures prices rallied tuesday at the chicago 
board of trade bolstered by strong demand for soymeal and optimism 
that a ussoviet grain agreement is near 
on other markets coffee prices fell further gold prices 
rallied oil prices reversed their decline live cattle and hog 
prices gained and feeder cattle and pork bellies were mostly lower 
soymeal remains the underlying strength in the soy market and 
helped soybean prices close sharply higher said joel karlin an 
analyst for research department inc in chicago 
domestic demand remains high for soymeal and tight supplies as 
well as an anticipated increase in exports helped keep prices firm 
he said 
export demand also encouraged buying in the corn pit karlin 
said 
wheat settled cent to 2 cents higher with the contract for 
delivery in december at 422 a bushel corn was cent lower to 
4 cents higher with december at 294 a bushel oats were 1 
cents lower to 1 cent higher with december at 249 a bushel and 
soybeans were 11 cents to 13 cents higher with november at 828 
a bushel 
at new yorks coffee sugar amp cocoa exchange coffee prices 
continued to feel pressure from the international coffee 
organizations compromise plan for 198889 
the plan which includes an initial export quota of 58 million 
bags allows concessions for producers of mild coffee the kind 
traded at the new york exchange and is expected to increase 
availability said kim badenhop an analyst with merrill lynch 
capital markets inc in new york 
the plan announced over the weekend calls for a 2millionbag 
reduction but traders had expected a quota of around 54 million 
bags badenhop said 
coffee settled 189 cents to 6 cents lower with the contract 
for delivery in december at 1244 a pound 
gold futures prices were higher and silver was mostly higher at 
the new york commodity exchange 
both responded to the higher crude oil price which had been 
down sharply for several days said bette raptopoulos a metals 
analyst with prudentialbache securities inc in new york 
the dollars weakness and the gains in grains and soybeans 
both causing a rise in inflationary expectations also supported 
gold prices she said 
gold was 30 cents to 60 cents higher with october at 39810 a 
troy ounce silver was 1 cent lower to 2 cent higher with 
october at 6248 an ounce 
crude oil futures steadied in trading at the new york mercantile

cent lower to 39 cent higher with november at 3817 cents a

with november at 4111 cents a gallon 
live cattle and hog prices rallied while feeder cattle and pork 
bellies were mostly lower 
higher cash bids from meatpackers for live cattle and hogs 
sparked a buying spree in the cattle and hog pits and had a 
spillover effect on pork belly prices through the middle part of 
the session said chuck levitt an analyst for shearson lehman 
hutton inc in chicago 
but early buyers turned out to be late sellers he said and 
profittaking later near the sessions close eased earlier gains 
live cattle settled 07 cent to 50 cent higher with the 
contract for deliver in october at 7242 cents a pound feeder 
cattle were 42 cent lower to 25 cent higher with october at

us bankruptcy judge warren bentz on tuesday 
signed an order accepting bethlehem steel corps 20 cash bid for 
a modern idled rail mill that federal lenders seized from 
financially troubled wheelingpittsburgh steel corp 
bethlehem officials have said they would operate the 
westmoreland county mill in conjunction with bethlehems rail mill 
in steelton but it is not clear when the monessen plant might be 
reactivated 
wheelingpittsburgh closed it because of slack demand for 
transportation rail 
the transfer of the property could face a legal hurdle however 
attorney ken simon said in pittsburgh that monessen and its school 
district will appeal to us district court to block the deal 
unless bentzs order provides for the payment of several hundred 
thousand dollars in delinquent property taxes 
the order addresses the tax issue but the exact terms will not 
be available publicly until the document is filed in bankruptcy 
court in pittsburgh as early as wednesday according to bentzs 
office 
the us economic development administration foreclosed on the 
rail mill after bondholders forced the agency to pay 90 million in 
principal and interest the eda had guaranteed a loan to 
wheelingpittsburgh for the construction of the mill and pollution 
controls at three sites including monessen said eda spokeswoman 
elaine dudley 
the monessen project was one of five steel industry projects 
that soured for the federal lending agency she said of five 
companies that participated in the steel loan program in the late 
1970s three no longer exist and the remainder wheelingpittsburgh 
and ltv steel co are reorganizing under chapter 11 of federal 
bankruptcy laws

language will be published five months from now and everyone who is

the second edition of the oxford english dictionary known 
to word buffs as the oed will have 22000 pages fill 20 volumes 
weigh 137 pounds 625 kg and be priced at about 2500 
we are sure we will sell a lot because the dictionary is the 
standard work of reference on the english language and any 
substantial library will have to have it said ludo craddock 
promotions executive of the oxford university press 
the publishing house founded in 1584 describes the dictionary 
as its most adventurous project since it started the first edition 
in the 19th century and completed it in 1928 
it has put the vocabulary of english since 1150 ad on a 
computer creating a data base for the language that can be 
continuously updated and eventually be made accessible to any 
subscriber with a home computer 
the cost was estimated at approximately 10 million when details 
were first announced in may 1984 
the 1100page first volume of the monumental work to be printed 
and bound was sent to the sevenday frankfurt book fair in west 
germany which opened tuesday 
the first volume we got ready is actually volume two volume 
one contains a 68page introduction which wasnt ready in time 
craddock said 
its a 12month production job just to print and bind the 
first run of the dictionary he said 
the first edition of the oed had 44 million words of text and 
the second has 59 million composed from 350 million printed 
characters 
there are 290500 main entries on different words an increase 
of 15 percent on the first edition 
in addition there are 157000 combinations and derivatives and 
169000 phrases making a total of 616500 word forms which are 
defined the 1928 edition had 414825 
the dictionary contains 2412400 quotations illustrating how 
writers used the words and the first known use of each word 
the oed was first published in parts between 1884 and 1928 and a 
supplement of new words and words missed the first time around was 
added in 1933 together they made up 13 volumes 
the last of four additional volumes including the 1933 
supplement and 69000 modern words added to the lexicon was 
finished in 1986 by new zealander robert burchfield who took 29 
years to finish it the publishers had expected it to take seven 
years 
since burchfields four volumes 5000 new words have been added 
most of them at the beginning of the alphabet as burchfield was 
continually adding as he progressed said craddock 
james murray a scottish village tailors son was the 
dictionarys original editor 
computerizing the new oed has taken five years under the 
supervision of the dictionarys coeditors john simpson and edmund 
weiner the computer science department of the university of 
waterloo in ontario canada helped to devise the software and the 
british arm of international business machines provided the 
hardware 
according to craddock the new oed is more than five times the 
size of any other dictionary of the english language

the investment firm of kohlberg kravis roberts amp 
co raised its takeover offer for kroger co to 503 billion 
tuesday surpassing a planned 46 billion defensive restructuring 
announced by the grocery giant last month 
kohlberg kravis said that based on its assessment of the 
restructuring proposal it was willing to pay 64 in cash and 
securities for each of krogers 786 million shares outstanding it 
had offer 5850 in cash and securities previously 
the announcement revived prospects for another round of bidding 
for kroger one of the nations largest supermarket chains that has 
long been identified as a takeover target 
the kroger companys management legal and financial advisers 
are reviewing the second unsolicited proposal from kkr said paul 
bernish a spokesman for the cincinnatibased kroger 
he said the company had no further comment 
kroger stock was among the most actively traded issues tuesday 
on the new york stock exchange falling 87 cents a share to 
5537 as more than 12 million shares changed hands 
the chain has been resisting takeover maneuvers from kohlberg 
kravis and the haft family of maryland two longtime adversaries 
who have battled for other supermarket businesses in the past 
kohlberg kraviss sweetened offer was announced after business 
hours and there was no answer at the offices of dart group inc 
the haftrun retailing concern in landover md 
as outlined in a brief press statement the sweetened offer is 
composed of 50 in cash 11 in debt securities and 3 in stock of 
the new company that kohlberg kravis would create from kroger the 
investment firms earlier offer contained the same cash portion of 
50 but only 850 in securities 
kroger announced an extensive restructuring plan on sept 13 
designed to foil bids from kohlberg kravis and the hafts who had 
offered 432 billion 
that restructuring plan which kroger valued at 46 billion 
also would leave shareholders with a continuing interest in the 
company but would reshape it into a smaller leaner and more 
heavily indebted business 
part of the plan included layoffs and the sale of operations 
including some food processing facilities as well as stores in 
alabama california florida north carolina south carolina texas 
and virginia 
the takeover struggle for kroger began earlier in the month when 
the hafts received clearance from federal antitrust regulators to 
buy at least 15 million worth of kroger stock 
kroger operates more than 1300 supermarkets 935 convenience 
stores and 15 membership warehouses in 29 states the company also 
processes food products for sale in its stores and to outside

congressional investigators have found price 
increases for bread pasta beef and poultry have been greater than 
should have resulted from the summer drought two lawmakers 
announced tuesday 
consumers should be aware of this situation and should use 
their clout through comparison shopping to fight unwarranted price 
jumps said sen patrick j leahy and rep byron dorgan in a 
joint statement 
they released results of a study of droughtrelated price 
increases made by the general accounting office an investigative 
arm of congress 
it showed that pasta prices have jumped more than 8 percent 
since april retail increases of only 4 percent to 5 percent are 
warranted by destruction of wheat said dorgan a north dakota 
democrat and leahy a vermont democrat and chairman of the senate 
agriculture committee 
comparing the prices of different brands and even prices in 
different stores can help prevent anyone from taking unfair 
advantage of consumers the two lawmakers said 
food processors and retailers need to know that we are all 
watching and they must be held accountable for any food price 
increases not directly attributable to higher costs they added 
the general accounting office reported that the price of ground 
beef has increased 3 percent while the price that livestock 
producers get for cattle actually has dropped 11 percent since 
april 
skyrocketing feed prices have accelerated the sale of cattle and 
thus created a buyers market 
the gao said fruit prices rose an average of 12 percent while 
bread prices increased 4 percent 
the two lawmakers said that the agency used the same data used 
to make up the consumer price index produced by the bureau of labor 
statistics they stressed that the figures involved represent 
national averages and that there could be differences from one 
region to another 
two consumer organizations issued a report on monday that 
consumer federation of america monitors around the country found no 
price gouging in july and august but substantial increases 
in beef and some other agricultural goods in june 
the report was issued jointly by the consumer federation and 
washingtonbased public voice on food health and policy whose 
executive director ellen haas was to be among witnesses when the 
senate agriculture committee holds a hearing wednesday on the gao 
findings 
the agriculture department has been trying to calm concerns 
about possible inordinate price increases in the wake of the 
drought it has estimated that the drought would add 1 percent to 
food prices this year and perhaps 2 percent in 1989 bringing an 
increase of no more than 6 percent in the consumer price index for 
food next year

former general electric co executive 
anthony l craig will succeed joe m henson as president and chief 
executive officer of prime computer inc after a transition of a 
few months prime said tuesday 
the company also said its board of directors has approved a 
stockholder rights plan aimed at thwarting any hostile takeover 
attempt 
henson 55 has been chief executive of the natickbased 
computer maker since november 1981 company officials described his 
departure as amicable voluntary and expected saying he had 
informed the board privately last year of his intention to leave 
craig 43 has been president of ges information services 
division he is stepping in immediately as primes chief operating 
officer executive vice president and a member of the board after 
a transition of a few months he will assume hensons posts 
according to prime spokesman richard eckel 
henson said he had no personal plans except to take a long 
vacation and possibly to pursue interests in government and 
community service 
prime has been facing some problems and has not been immune to 
the uncertainties affecting the industry as a whole 
primes profits rose 38 percent to a record 648 million in 
1987 but the company stumbled this year when aggressive pricing by 
its competitors forced it to pull out of the minisupercomputer 
market and take a 5 million charge against earnings 
in addition primes 435 million takeover of computervision 
corp in february has brought pressure from wall street to reduce
