a soviet demographer was quoted as saying 
wednesday that researchers have found the results of a 1937 census 
thought to have been destroyed by josef v stalin to hide millions 
of deaths caused by his policies 
demographer mark tolts said the census showed a population of 
162 million the official tass news agency said 
the weekly magazine ogonyok in a story about the census 
published in december said stalin claimed a population in 1937 of 
170 million even though statistics could not confirm it 
tolts did not say where the census results were found and said 
it was too early to use its figures to estimate how many people 
died in the purges collectivization of agriculture and forced 
industrialization stalin imposed in the 1930s 
current soviet reference books put the population at 163 million 
for 1917 the year of the revolution that brought the bolsheviks to 
power the current population is 284 million 
ogonyok blamed many of the deaths on a famine forced upon rural 
residents by government grain requisitions but tolts said stalins 
repressive policies also apparently were to blame 
he said the population of the saratov region on the volga river 
southeast of moscow declined by 20 percent between 1927 and 1937 
and the population of the kursk region south of moscow declined by 
14 percent in the same period 
stalin told a communist party congress in 1934 that the soviet 
population the previous year was 168 million although census 
officials put the figure at 1657 million and one scientist put it 
as low as 158 million

a new film talent has emerged from the satirical 
movie a handful of dust her name is kristin scott thomas 
the movie features alec guinness and anjelica huston in small 
but telling cameos but it is dominated by scott thomas as the 
elegant english rose lady brenda last who drifts into a 
destructive affair with the young roue john beaver rupert graves 
based on evelyn waughs savage 1934 novel the 6 million film 
costars james wilby graves costar last year in maurice as 
lady brendas hapless husband tony it opens in new york on june 
24 
im very pleased im afraid about the reaction that im 
getting its so nice to have ones work appreciated scott 
thomas said in an interview about her repeated raves from the 
british press 
while reviews were mixed for the movie as a whole critics 
hailed its female lead with the kind of accolades that banish 
anonymity forever 
alexander walker in the standard called the actress the films 
great find adding it will be criminal if british cinema 
doesnt make a great star of her 
hugh montgomerymassingberd in the daily telegraph and derek 
malcolm in the guardian both called her a revelation iain 
johnstone in the sunday times found the parisbased actress a 
singular sensation in a movie that has returned her in triumph to 
the country she left eight years ago 
i never really thought id be able to work in england so a 
handful of dust was an enormous pleasure and a great privilege 
said the 28yearold actress who dropped out of londons central 
school of speech and drama after a year to move to paris 
i was doing a teacher training course and hated it wanted to 
change and couldnt said scott thomas occasionally interrupting 
the interview to tend to the cries of her monthold daughter 
hannah 
i was told id never be an actress anyway and would never be 
able to play for real she said i thought it would be better 
to be totally miserable somewhere else and learn french at the same 
time 
in paris her life took a happier turn beginning with her 
marriage to a french obstetrician after drama training in french 
she began getting parts in theater and in movies and landed a role 
opposite the rock superstar prince in his second movie a bomb 
called under the cherry moon 
the film was not a financial success and was lampooned by 
critics however it enjoyed an international release charles 
sturridge the director of handful of dust and of the hit waugh 
tv adaptation brideshead revisited saw it and cast scott 
thomas as lady brenda 
she had studied the book at school and said she seized the 
chance to become part of the film 
i was sure it was going to be great she recalled before 
going back to the novel to immerse herself in lady brendas 
emotionally fatal attraction to the callow and cunning beaver 
she likes taking someone who is absolutely dreadful and 
turning him into this fascinating young man whom no one can 
understand what she sees in him scott thomas said explaining 
the fascination on which the films denouement depends it makes 
her different too 
in the end beaver is much worse than lady brenda ever thought 
he was really by then shes in too deep she said 
the daughter of an affluent naval officer who died when she was 
five scott thomas said she was bemused by the critique of the 
english class system that pervades the book and the film 
its quite sort of endearing really but it is ridiculous 
said scott thomas a graduate of the posh cheltenham ladies 
college its like some dear old piece of furniture that you like 
but you think is quite the most hideous thing in the world 
she hopes not to be typecast as aristocratic english swells and 
would like to do a french film next 
i live there and i want to work there you have to work hard 
and i really mean to work hard she said ive got to make sure 
that the revelation doesnt turn out to be a disaster

the commuter train zips along at 
50 miles an hour on top of a car a young man stands up and waves 
his arms like a bird in flight 
the slightest slip could mean a fatal fall the slightest jolt 
could mean contact with a 3000volt electrical wire overhead 
nevertheless paulo evaristo 15 and hundreds of other youths 
from rio de janeiros poor outlying suburbs risk their lives every 
day showing off their skills in what is known as train surfing 
some 150 train surfers were killed last year 40 in the first 
five months of this year 
the government company that runs the commuter trains has had to 
pay the equivalent of 700000 in claims filed by the survivors of 
youths killed or by youths who have been injured more than 400 
young men were injured in 1987 some permanently paralyzed 
these people are seeking new thrills but in my opinion 
theyre suicidal said helio barros spokesman for the railroad 
he added that efforts to discourage the train surfers have failed 
with the money we spent on claims we could have repaired 10 
trains he said he added that the railroad is trying to persuade 
judges not to validate claims in cases of trainsurfing accidents 
ive been doing this since i was 13 said paulo evaristo 
you get a feeling of freedom that is greater than any fear 
paulo evaristo is a gradeschool dropout and works as a 
messenger he declined to give his last name in an interview 
train surfers come from poor neighborhoods and some brazilian 
newspapers have speculated the young people are trying to emulate 
the sea surfers at wealthy beachfront districts such as copacabana 
and ipanema the newspaper accounts also have suggested the surfers 
ride train roofs because they cant afford the 15cruzado 8cent 
fare or that theres no room in the crowded trains which 
transport 12 million passengers daily 
but barros the railroad spokesman dismissed all these 
arguments 
its strictly for the fun he said in the first place 
you have to pay the fare to get inside the train stations and even 
when its not rush hour and there are plenty of seats you still 
see these kids on top of the cars 
the train company has assigned 200 guards a day to try to stop 
train surfers but the guards are not enough to cover the commuter 
systems 450 miles of track and 110 stations 
when they do arrest a train surfer the penalty is a fine 
equivalent to 1 and a lecture from a government psychologist 
the purpose is not to jail these people barros said it 
is to save their lives 
chief fernando rodrigues de almeida of the police precinct of 
the engenho novo neighborhood ordered 11 train surfers jailed 
without bail on charges of obstructing railroad traffic 
but a judge ruled that train surfing was not a crime but rather 
an act of selfinjury similar to attempted suicide and not 
dealt with in the brazilian legal code 
the judge reprimanded the chief for abuse of authority 
were not crazy and were not bums either said train 
surfer luiz claudio 18 an apprentice lathe operator who makes 70 
a month slightly more than the minimum wage were just looking 
for a little fun to pass the time during the train ride 
elizabeth 19 a maid who like luiz claudio would not tell her 
last name said she sometimes rides on top of the commuter trains 
because the atmosphere inside the cars is violent with 
frequent muggings but she added its a lot of fun too 
barros the railroad spokesman said train surfers have always 
been a problem but the practice reached an alltime high last year 
he added that the suburb of nilopolis has a train surfers 
association with three tests for membership 1 ride hanging from 
the outside of a window or door 2 climb up a car in motion and 
lie on the roof 3 stand on the roof of a moving car 
the founder of the association known as rambo was killed when 
he fell from a train 
another member of the group who was killed had a membership card 
in his pocket 
it said evanil dos santos passed his test and is authorized 
to hang from trains

portauprince haiti ap leslie manigat a political science 
professor with pride in his grasp of strategy apparently 
misunderstood the army and may have been duped into trying to 
exploit what he read as dissension within it 
his attempt didnt work and the general who handed manigat the 
presidency in february took it back and sent him into exile 
several versions are circulating of the overthrow of manigat 
this week by lt gen henri namphy who ran the ruling junta for 
two years after the duvalier dictatorship ended and proclaimed 
himself president monday 
all focus on miscalculations by manigat a civilian who was 
eager to assert control over the army after four months in power 
some say manigat overreached by trying to use what seemed to be 
a split between namphy and col jeanclaude paul a powerful 
commander to carry out a general purge of the army others say the 
dispute between namphy and paul may itself have been a sham and 
manigat walked into the trap 
the army has not explained 
a friend and sometime adviser to namphy said privately the 
high command tricked manigat using his desire to control the 
army as a tool to overthrow him 
namphys escape from house arrest sunday evening and his noisy 
takeover of the national palace seems to have been a wellsetup 
sham a western diplomat said also on condition of anonymity 
no one was killed and nothing destroyed at the palace the scene 
of most of the shooting sunday night and soldiers who allegedly 
were fighting one another at midnight stood together amicably on 
television early in the morning 
about 130 am only 55 minutes after the heaviest gunfire 
namphy appeared on television at the palace carrying an uzi 
submachine gun a military band played the national anthem 
when he announced a military government later in the morning 
also on television he was surrounded by paul and representatives 
of other units the 7000man army appears united behind him 
later monday he announced promotions of officers manigat had 
retired or transferred including col prosper avril to brigadier 
general and adjutant general of the military many observers 
believe avril who had been a military adviser to the duvaliers 
was a key figure in the coup 
political observers still are trying to piece together how 
namphy ended up in the national palace and manigat in a small hotel 
in santo domingo capital of the dominican republic on the other 
side of hispaniola island 
this is what is known 
namphy tried 10 days ago to transfer paul to an administrative 
post from command of the 700man dessalines battalion stationed 
just behind the national palace paul refused manigat sided with 
paul and dismissed namphy as army chief on friday 
when namphy appeared to accept manigat thought he had an 
opportunity to exert control over officers who had hampered his 
initiatives since he took office a diplomat said 
the portly 57yearold professor and linguist who has studied 
and lectured at some of the worlds major universities tried his 
own series of transfers and promotions sunday afternoon 
within hours he was arrested and sent with his family across the 
border to the dominican republic manigat admitted tuesday he was 
surprised by the coup had believed most of the military supported 
him and didnt understand why paul rejoined namphy 
us sen bob graham dfla who follows events in haiti 
closely said it appears manigat hoped to consolidate power by 
dominating the army as francois papa doc duvalier did 
the duvaliers were able to control the military for years by a 
divide confuse and conquer approach graham said from 
washington the duvaliers frequently dismissed officers they 
distrusted and they diluted the armys power with a private 
security force the feared tontons macoute 
jeanclaude duvalier son of papa doc fled the country feb 7 
1986 ending the 29year family dictatorship and the junta led by 
namphy took over 
graham said one interpretation of the namphypaul rift was that 
paul realized the namphy components of the army were stronger so 
he recognized he didnt have an alternative other than to cut a 
deal 
another theory is that manigat simply gambled and lost that a 
showdown with the army was inevitable and he moved when he thought 
his chances were best 
namphys brother joe a businessman has said the general did 
not know soldiers would free him sunday night a close friend of 
gen namphy said manigat put him up to transferring paul and turned 
on the general when paul refused to go 
paul has been indicted on drug trafficking charges by a federal 
court in florida he a dominant figure in haitis army which is 
topheavy with officers and so factionalized that a colonel can be 
more powerful than a general 
namphys justification for returning to the palace was that 
manigats attempted reorganization of the army was 
unconstitutional dangerously partisan and endangered democracy

goldenbrown in color

a falafel vendor is claiming victory in a food 
fight against hot dogs 
the ruckus started when david bonan who has sold falafel at 
south florida street festivals for nine years moved his sidewalk 
cart to a busy downtown street where hotdog carts have long had a 
monopoly 
the hot dog vendors complained and dade county health 
inspectors ordered bonan to close the business march 9 floridas 
health code limits mobile food units to frankfurters only they 
said 
thats because hot dogs are covered with a membrane that 
prevents pathogenic organisms from entering the food 
bonan claimed the code was unconstitutional sued the state in 
federal court and refused to budge earlier this month a health 
inspector and three police officers confiscated 100 of falafel 
doused it with liquid bleach and threatened to arrest bonan if he 
didnt stop 
an emergency hearing was held friday and us magistrate samuel 
smargon ruled in bonans favor 
just standing up for my rights through the legal system 
said bonan who vows to add two carts selling the mashed chickpea 
mixture on city streets by next week 
the state has 10 days to appeal al ros assistant county 
director of environmental health said he is worried that the 
falafel case will open the streets to everything from tacos to 
chicken wings

parliament has passed a law that will ensure the 
integrity of spirits labeled scotch by making the appellation a 
protected trademark 
under the law no whisky can be called scotch unless it conforms 
to standards set by the scotch whisky association matured for at 
least three years in oak casks with charred insides and using 
only scottish ingredients like highland water 
the law passed the house of lords tuesday and now awaits the 
formality of the queens signature said bill walker a scottish 
lawmaker for the ruling conservative party and sponsor of the bill 
walker said wednesday that the new law would empower whisky 
distillers to prosecute anyone violating scotch standards he said 
it was modeled on a law that prevents drinks being called champagne 
unless they come from the province of champagne in france and 
conform to its standards 
walker said more than 90 percent of scotch is exported and 
earns scotland 18 billion a year

into custody about 821 pm in a cornfield about 300 feet from a

wednesday night and praised australias strong ties with the united 
states 
he said the soviet union was posing new challenges in asia and 
the two allies must face the question how do we meet the 
challenge 
on cambodia where the sovietbacked vietnam is withdrawing some 
of its forces shultz said we must keep up the pressure now that 
we see things are going our way 
hawke paid tribute to shultz as a good friend of australia and 
joined him in calling for an end to agricultural subsidies its 
insane to spend 200 billion on them hawke said 
hawke told a television interviewer his message to congress and 
other us leaders will be australias familiar appeal against us 
farm subsidies that australia says are unfair competition and cause 
economic harm to a first class ally of america the best ally 
youve got 
in trade that first class relationship isnt reflected we 
dont like our farmers and our economy being hurt by action here 
which is against your own interests thats my message hawke 
said on abctvs good morning america 
its against the selfinterest of the united states to be 
spending the billions of dollars it is on farm supports and 
subsidies hawke said it doesnt get into the right hands it 
increases the cost and price structure of this country 
but australians with unsubsidized wheat and meat to export are 
the innocent people in the middle who get caught by the subsidies 
cross fire between the europeans and the americans hawke added 
the prime minister also branded as nonsense the new zealand 
antinuclear restrictions that barred american warships from 
visiting new zealand and led to new zealands ouster from the 
threecornered anzus alliance between the two south pacific 
countries and the united states 
seventyfour us warships visited australia last year with no 
restrictions hawke said weve got an alliance relationship 
with the united states and we dont buy the new zealand 
proposition that you can have an alliance relationship and say to 
your ally were allies but im sorry boys your ships cant 
come 
hawke will address a meeting of the two houses of congress on

a familiar ingredient was missing from this 
weeks economic summit in toronto no one did any japanbashing 
unlike past summits when the japanese sat quietly on the 
sidelines and other countries complained of surging trade deficits 
toronto was more like a corporate board meeting with japan an equal 
partner 
statistics talked on our behalf explained michihiko 
kunihiro chief cabinet counselor on foreign affairs 
he was referring to three interrelated developments in japans 
economy 
over the last three years the value of the yen has doubled 
against the dollar making japanese exports more expensive and 
american imports cheaper second japan has agreed it needs to 
develop its domestic market and thus increase its import most 
important the island nation has promised to work for a gradual 
narrowing of its record trade surpluses 
the performance of the japanese economy led several summit 
partners to compliment japanese prime minister noboru takeshita 
making his debut at the annual gatherings 
he was very pleased said kunihiro 
by fully cooperating with international efforts to coordinate 
economic policies japan now feels treated like an insider in 
the cliquish group of seven major industrialized democracies he 
said 
perhaps japanese leaders finally thought they can contribute 
more substantively than before i will leave the judgment to you 
kunihiro said of the toronto meeting 
jacques delors president of the european community commission 
referred to the gathering as a trilateral summit that balanced 
the interests of western europe north america and japan with 
asia behind it 
takeshita expressed satisfaction that action was taken on all 
three of his priorities there was a joint commitment to 
growthwithoutinflation a determination to fight protectionism 
and agreement on relieving third world debt 
japan used the summit platform to announce its waiving of 1 
billion in debt repayments from 17 of the worlds poorest countries 
over the next five years 
even on farm subsidies the result was to japans liking 
president reagan had proposed ending the 200 billion subsidy war 
by the year 2000 but the final communique merely targeted 
reductions provided such factors as social concerns food 
security and agricultural diversity are taken into account 
farmers in japan are a powerful political force and farm 
subsidies including tariffs that restrict competition from cheaper 
american goods are their life blood 
even as the summiteers gathered japan reached agreement with 
the united states in a longstanding dispute over raising quotas for 
us beef and citrus products reagan and takeshita also signed a 
pact to open up japanese laboratories to american researchers for 
closer collaboration in science and technology 
while not presuming to speak directly for asia takeshita said 
he was happy summit partners pledged a new dialogue with the newly 
industrialized nations of south korea taiwan hong kong and 
singapore there was even speculation that the socalled four 
tigers might be invited as observers at future summits and the 
suggestion japan might stage an asian economic summit 
the japanese have a growing sense that japan should play a 
greater role in affairs outside japan except for military 
activities that is something constitutionally we have to refrain 
from kunihiro said 
one future goal the official said is to help japans 122 
million people mix better with the rest of the world 
we should be better understood despite the difficult language 
of japanese and try to educate our people in other cultures 
he said 
this new outgoing japan was reflected in the summit briefings 
foreign journalists including japanese speakers were barred from 
briefings for reporters from japan a tradition but there were 
separate informative and goodnatured sessions in english 
kunihiro drew laughs when he sidestepped a question about vague 
freetrade language in the final communique this is the text my 
boss agreed to he said with a smile

the song of the sea is still music 
to the ears of five fishermen now home to family and friends after 
144 days adrift in the pacific ocean on a disabled boat 
were sea dogs the sea calls to us said one 27yearold 
joel omar gonzalez the sea is the source of life for us and our 
families 
the five headed by skipper gerardo obregon 33 received a 
heros welcome wednesday from dozens of people including first lady 
margarita de arias when they flew in from honolulu by way of los 
angeles 
relatives friends neighbors and fellow pescadores flocked 
in from puntarenas their home port 95 miles away to welcome them 
at san joses santamaria airport 
the engine of their 33foot fishing vessel the cairo iii was 
knocked out beyond repair during a storm jan 24 five days after 
they sailed out of puntarenas leaving them adrift in the pacific 
what was to have been an eightday fishing trip turned into a 
nearly fivemonth quest for survival gonzalez his eyes moist as 
he hugged his wife edith told reporters ships passed them twice 
but did not see them 
a japanese tuna boat finally ran into them about 700 miles 
southeast of hawaii on june 15 and took them to honolulu where 
doctors found them all in good health 
all in all it was a 3600mile journey 
the five said they survived by catching turtles and sharks 
collecting rainwater and cooking them on wood fires they made by 
tearing pieces of wood from the boat they said the pain was in the 
loneliness and not knowing when help would come 
we spent months and months without seeing anyone but we never 
lost our faith in god we knew he was with us and he finally sent 
us this japanese vessel said crewman jorge hernandez castillo 
22 
obregon gonzalez hernandez and their two mates juan cernas 
bolivar 47 and pastor lopez rojas 30 attended mass at a roman 
catholic church and gave thanks for their deliverance 
imagine our little boat in the middle of the ocean 
directionless the hot sun of the daytime the darkness of the 
night the stars and the cold they were truly terrible days 
obregon said 
once they had to go without water for four days because it 
didnt rain and gonzalez said there was a moment when were 
drinking the blood of a turtle and i looked at pastor and he was 
foaming at the mouth 
the cairo iii and its crew may have broken the record for 
survival at sea the guinness book of world records lists the 
record for survival on a raft as 133 days set by a hong kong man 
who was adrift in the atlantic ocean from nov 23 1942 to april 
5 1943 after his ship was torpedoed

expanded aids testing mandatory counseling 
and tough punishment for violations of patient confidentiality are 
prescribed in a bill that won house committee approval after a year 
of negotiation and compromise 
were going to move it as quickly as possible the chances of 
it passing are very very bright i expect it to become law this 
year rep henry waxman dcalif said wednesday after the 
energy and commerce committee sent the measure to the house floor 
by voice vote 
the bill authorizes 400 million to expand testing and 
counseling activities for each of the next three years half the 
money would go to states and the other half would go directly to 
clinics health centers and hospitals 
counseling would be required for anyone taking a test whether 
the results were positive or negative anyone who intentionally or 
negligently breached the confidentiality of test results could be 
charged a fine of up to 10000 an intentional violation could 
also bring up to a year in jail 
the bill bans use of federal funds for counseling that 
promotes or encourages homosexual sexual activity or unsafe 
heterosexual sexual activity or intravenous drug abuse but it 
also says counselors must provide the best information available on 
how to avoid getting or transmitting aids provided that any 
informational materials used are not obscene 
the major casualty of the many controversies stirred by the bill 
was a section banning privatesector discrimination against people 
with aids or the aids virus the federal government already has a 
ban 
waxman chairman of the energy and commerce health subcommittee 
called the omission unfortunate but said it would have been 
impossible to pass such a policy in the current political climate 
getting rid of the discrimination provision also makes it much 
less likely the bill will be blocked in the senate waxman said 
because it removes the biggest objection that some of the 
rightwingers have the counseling and testing bill is pending in 
the senate labor and human resources committee 
rep ron wyden dore said he may attempt to restore the 
antidiscrimination provision on the house floor he called its 
deletion a terrible public health mistake because the most 
likely aids victims without protection against losing their jobs 
insurance or housing would not volunteer for tests 
wyden said he would try to build bipartisan support for the 
discrimination ban on the grounds that the presidents commission 
on aids recently recommended precisely such a federal policy 
but waxman said the commission view is useless without president 
reagans backing without it i cant see that members are going 
to be willing to vote for it have the courage to vote for it in 
an election year he said if the president will stand behind 
his commissions recommendations we will join him in sponsoring an 
amendment 
before approving the aids testing bill the committee rejected a 
series of amendments sponsored by rep william dannemeyer rcalif 
among them were attempts to require testing of all prisoners 
marriage license applicants and hospital admittees 
dannemeyer also failed to win approval of a requirement that 
people with aids or the aids virus be reported to authorities by 
name the bill requires instead that cases be reported with 
statistical and demographic information 
another unsuccessful dannemeyer amendment would have required 
doctors to notify spouses sex partners or iv needle partners if 
the patient didnt notify them within a reasonable period members 
of both parties said the bill permits doctors to make such 
notifications but shouldnt require them to do so 
aids renders the bodys immune system incapable of resisting 
other diseases and infections the virus most often is spread 
through close contact with blood blood products or semen from 
infected persons its chief victims have been homosexual men and 
intravenous drug users

the drought that threatens us crop 
production also is sending shock waves through world markets and 
prospects for exports according to agriculture department analysts 
but it could be one of those good news bad news situations 
says tom kay administrator of the departments foreign 
agricultural service 
theres no question that the higher commodity prices we see 
today will likely raise the value of us exports kay said on 
the other hand you have to recognize that higher prices might 
reduce the total quantity traded 
in other words one bushel of wheat selling for 3 is worth as 
much as three bushels selling for 1 each 
kay and other usda and farm officials contacted wednesday agreed 
that it is too early for a realistic appraisal of the export 
situation no one can be sure what this years harvests of corn 
wheat and soybeans will be and until that is known the global 
supply and price situation is mostly guesswork 
the departments first overall crop production estimates of the 
season including total wheat corn and soybeans will be released 
on aug 11 
kay said there could be a tendency for foreign buyers to want 
to increase nearby purchases to cover their future needs and 
that could cause even further upward pressure on commodity prices 
are there indications now that foreign buyers might be getting 
leery of higher prices for us grain 
no there hasnt been much activity of late in the 
international market kay said not much is being sold 
anywhere there seems to be a general lull all over 
so its waitandsee what the drought will do at least for many 
foreign buyers meanwhile the usda has not revised its latest 
export forecast which showed the value of shipments in the fiscal 
year that began last oct 1 could rise to 335 billion from 279 
billion last season 
the actual volume of products in the monthold forecast is 
expected to rise to 1455 million metric tons from 1292 million 
tons in 198687 
except for soybeans which are in relatively scant supply the 
inventories of us wheat and corn are more than ample to take care 
of foreseeable export needs the big question which officials say 
cant be answered now is how much 1988 crop production will be 
reduced and how far prices will increase 
paul drazek of the american farm bureau federations washington 
office agreed that export prospects are undecipherable at this 
point 
any time you have a drought of the apparent magnitude that 
this is you have to start to be concerned about what it will do to 
our export volume he said my guess is that nobody quite knows 
what the effect will be on production so its going to be 
difficult to attach some kind of an estimate to the effect on 
exports 
but with the price going up the way it is drazek continued 
that alone will have a depressing effect on our ability to move 
products 
although there is a oneworld market for some commodities 
he said our prices are going to be less competitive and that 
could have an effect on where people buy 
bob denman of the national farmers union said the next couple 
of weeks are going to really make the determination as to what 
starts to happen in that export market 
denman said that he wouldnt be surprised to see some 
foreign buyers come back into the us market for corn and other 
feed grains to protect themselves against further crop 
deterioration and even higher prices 
regarding wheat denman said that a lot will depend on the 
quality of this years european harvest and also on canadas 
production 
its not just in the united states he said that canadian 
crop as i understand it is really being hurt pretty bad too

democratic platform writers borrowing a page 
from congressional procedures are putting a preliminary draft into 
a format that a party panel can mark up when it resumes 
deliberations friday in denver 
the democratic platform drafting committee headed by rep 
william h gray iii of philadelphia has already distributed a 
draft document to the campaigns of michael dukakis and jesse 
jackson 
michael barnes a former maryland congressman serving as michael 
dukakiss chief link to the platform committee said wednesday 
there will be a draft put before the members friday morning 
barnes said the draft incorporates the dozen separate issue 
working papers produced at an earlier meeting of the platform 
writers on mackinac island mich 
it pulls them all together he said 
but barnes said there has been no closing of the gap between the 
dukakis and jackson camps on whether the platform should embrace 
jacksons call for higher taxes on the wealthy and a freeze on 
pentagon spending 
rosemary freeman executive director of the democratic platform 
committee said the preliminary draft was still being finalized 
she called it a collective effort by the same people who 
hammered out the earlier issue papers 
the party released two final working papers on national security 
and political empowerment the former reflects the dukakis 
campaigns insistence that the platform call for stable defense 
budgets the latter in a nod to jackson commits the party to 
removing impediments to the oneperson onevote principle 
whatever emerges friday from grays 16member drafting committee 
will be subject to further discussion and revision when the full 
186member platform committee meets over the weekend in denver for 
the first time 
jackson has enough delegates to force a floor fight at next 
months democratic national convention in atlanta over any platform 
issue he chooses 
some dukakis backers have hinted they would welcome a chance to 
shoot down a plank promising a tax hike walter mondale the 1984 
nominee got nothing but grief from his promise to raise taxes 
gray the chairman of the house budget committee has had his 
staff put the draft in markup format with numbered lines to make 
it easier for the drafting committee to make additions and 
deletions 
although a jackson supporter gray has been handling his 
drafting role in an impartial fashion the 16 members include six 
each from the dukakis and jackson camps and four appointed by paul 
g kirk jr the party chairman who has asked the platform writers 
to produce a short visionary statement free of special interest 
boilerplates 
the new working paper on national security says the nations 
strength has been sapped by a defense establishment that has 
wasted money on duplicative and dubious new weapons instead of 
investing more in readiness and mobility 
we further believe that our strength is enhanced by stable 
defense budgets and by a commitment by our allies to assure their 
fair share of the costs and responsibilities required to maintain 
peace and liberty the paper says 
it says the democrats will promote peace and prevent war not 
by trading weapons for hostages not by sending brave americans to 
undefined missions in lebanon and honduras not by toasting a 
tyrant like marcos as a disciple of democracy but by maintaining a 
stable nuclear deterrent sufficient to counter any soviet threat 
in standing up to any american adversary whenever necessary and 
sitting down with him whenever possible 
the document calls for maintaining the special relationship 
with israel while promoting a middle east agreement that hews to 
the camp david accords it says a democratic administration would 
end all vestiges of the failed policy of constructive engagement 
and will declare south africa a terrorist state and impose 
comprehensive sanctions 
the paper would commit the party to sameday voter registration 
and registration by mail and calls for a removal of impedidents 
to the oneperson onevote principle it said 
jackson who won 29 percent of the primary votes but just 24 
percent of the delegates has complained about the way some states 
allocated delegates

the judge in the irancontra conspiracy case 
is setting up procedures for dealing with classified documents in 
an apparent effort to bring fired white house aide oliver l north 
to trial by fall 
us district judge gerhard a gesell ordered north to identify 
by july 11 which secret government documents the retired marine 
lieutenant colonel wants to disclose in court to rebut charges that 
he illegally diverted iranian armssale profits to the nicaraguan 
rebels 
in a ruling on wednesday gesell said that both the public and 
prosecutors would be barred from a july 14 hearing to determine if 
any of the documents are relevant to the case against north 
the judge also rejected a defense motion to declare the 
classified information procedures act unconstitutional as it 
applied to the case of north former national security adviser john 
m poindexter and arms dealers albert hakim and richard v secord 
the four defendants whom gesell has said must be tried 
separately contended that the law unfairly required them to tell 
the prosecution what documents they intended to make public before 
the trials 
such disclosures would give independent counsel lawrence e 
walsh an unfair tactical advantage the defense said 
acknowledging the problem gesell said strict application of 
the statute to this proceeding would not only be difficult but 
impossible to accomplish consistent with a fair and expeditious 
resolution of this case 
gesell noted that the large volume of classified documents 
collected by walshs investigation about 200000 pages by the 
latest count posed unique problems for a trial judge that were 
probably not envisioned when congress passed the classified 
information statute in 1980 
some of the witnesses and defendants particularly north 
operated from secure locations in the white house with full access 
to the most sensitive information and most critical national 
security intelligence methods and sources available to the 
government gesell said 
this information and even some methods and sources are 
inextricably enmeshed in the events challenged by the indictment 
he added 
but in enacting the law congress gave trial judges authority 
to fashion creative and fair solutions to difficult problems 
posed by such sensitive information gesell said 
lawmakers emphasized that the court should not undertake to 
balance the national security interests of the government against 
the rights of the defendant but rather that in the end remedies and 
sanctions against the government must be designed to make the 
defendant whole again 
while afforded this leeway the court is unable to determine 
definitively at this stage whether or not the classified document 
problems presented by this case can be resolved gesell said in 
the 16page opinion 
it proposes to make the effort but the complexity of the 
situation defies obvious answers final ruling on the defense 
motion must await further developments 
gesell said that he would exclude walsh from discussions of 
whether classified documents that north proposes to disclose are 
relevant to the case gesell will decide which documents are 
relevant and admissible as evidence 
only after an interdepartmental task force has identified 
relevant documents that pose national security problems will walsh 
be included in the process of how to present them in court gesell 
said 
indicating a desire to move the case to trial gesell gave the 
government secrecy experts until aug 1 to complete their review of 
the documents identified by north 
the task force composed of representatives of various 
government intelligence agencies is reviewing the documents that 
walsh collected during his investigation from the cia the fbi the 
national security council the state department and the defense 
department 
after the panels task is completed gesell said he would 
convene closed hearings to determine how to edit out portions of 
documents that cannot be declassified 
under the law the court has the power to order deletions of 
sensitive material or to substitute a statement of facts that the 
document would prove if it were shown to the jury 
if a sufficient number of documents cannot be disclosed in any 
fashion the court can dismiss charges against a defendant on the 
ground he could not get a fair trial 
gesells ruling follows his determination last week that walshs 
investigation was not tainted by impermissible use of the testimony 
that north poindexter and hakim gave to congress last year under 
limited grants of immunity from prosecution 
both decisions indicate that gesell has determined that barring 
unforeseen problems created by classified documents the case can 
move ahead to trial by september 
in a statement walsh said we appreciate the courts prompt 
ruling on the constitutionality of the classified information 
procedures act as it applies to this case and we are prepared to 
move forward as directed by the court

house taxwriters want to renew two targeted 
benefits of the type that were supposed to be wiped out when the 
tax law was overhauled in 1986 
the house ways and means committee agreed wednesday to renew for 
three years a tax benefit for employees who receive educational 
assistance from their bosses and to extend for one year a special 
credit for owners of lowincome rental housing 
the panel working on a package of miscellaneous tax items 
proposed by chairman dan rostenkowski dill is considering 
extension of a third special benefit taxexempt mortgage bonds 
used to help lowincome people buying their first home 
that exemption is a favorite of state and local government 
officials who administer the mortgage assistance the general 
accounting office the auditing arm of congress says the program 
does little to increase home ownership opportunities 
about 50 billion of such bonds were issued between 1982 and 
1986 at a cost to the federal government of about 75 billion 
gao estimated about twothirds of the homebuyers who benefited 
could have bought their homes without assistance the agency said 
congress wiped out several such specialinterest benefits when 
it revised the tax law two years ago contending that the tax 
system should not be used to provide subsidies when federal 
appropriations could do the job better but several still remain 
the committee hopes to complete work next week on this years 
tax bill which is designed mainly to correct hundreds of errors 
that found their way into the 1986 law the technical 
corrections bill is being used as the vehicle for a few 
substantive tax amendments including those proposed by 
rostenkowski 
the committee meeting behind closed doors voted wednesday to 
tighten and renew through 1990 an expired law under which 
employees could avoid tax on up to 5250 a year worth of 
educational assistance provided by their employers the benefit was 
designed to help lowerincome workers prepare for better jobs 
under the new version the exclusion would be reduced as income 
rises above a level that is yet to be determined and upperincome 
workers would receive no benefit no benefit would be available for 
postgraduate work the reagan administration opposes renewal of 
the exclusion which would cost the government about 540 million 
extend for one year the credit for owners of lowincome rental 
housing which is due to expire at the end of 1989 this would cost 
543 million 
write into law an internal revenue service decision that sick 
pay accumulated vacation leave and similar compensation received 
by employees of state and local governments and nonprofit 
organizations should not be taxed when earned 
exempt from social security taxes the wages of members of amish 
and other religious sects that have religious objections to such 
programs committee aides estimated this would affect about 10000 
workers about 750 selfemployed people most of them amish 
already are exempt 
deny social security benefits to any person who in the future 
is ordered deported as a nazi war criminal 
exempt from taxation a 10million trust fund created in 1985 
to finance rehabilitation of enjebi island in the enewetak atoll 
which the united states used as a target for testing nuclear 
weapons in the 1940s and 1950s a similar exemption was voted in 
1982 for the benefit of bikini island 
the biggest portion of the tax increase required to pay for the 
benefits in the bill would come from corporations that own shares 
of other corporations and from owners of singlepremium life 
insurance

state and local governments and other private 
employers have received some welcome news from the supreme court in 
a decision that could save them billions of dollars in pension 
benefits 
the court on wednesday used a case from florida to limit the 
application of two previous rulings which bar sex discrimination 
in determining retirement benefits 
were very happy and very pleased said andy mcmullian 
director of floridas division of retirement we really thought 
they would rule in our favor all along and thats why we took it to 
the supreme court 
by a 54 vote the justices said florida taxpayers do not have 
to pay 436 million to male state workers who retired between 
march 24 1972 and aug 1 1983 
the court said that it would be unfair to retroactively apply 
the antidiscrimination principles the court first established in a 
1978 ruling and greatly expanded in 1983 
imposing such extra costs on pension plans would threaten their 
existence and therefore the rights of other workers to collect 
benefits the court said 
a us labor department study estimates that the ruling will 
save public and private employers nationwide from 817 million to 
126 billion a year well into the next century 
the court in 1978 barred employers from requiring women to make 
higher contributions to pension plans based on their generally 
longer lifespans even though as a group they receive more 
retirement benefits as a result 
in 1983 the court made it illegal for women to receive smaller 
monthly retirement pay than men based on life expectancy when 
employees of both sexes contributed equal amounts that ruling took 
effect aug 1 1983 
both pension benefit rulings were based on the civil rights act 
of 1964 banning sex discrimination in the work place 
until wednesday the court had not said whether the sexneutral 
principles it established in the pension cases apply to a vast 
number of workers who retired sometime between 1964 and 1983 
the justices said wednesday that employers such as the florida 
government should not be penalized for failing to eliminate all 
sexbased pension options after the courts 1978 ruling 
that decision failed to place employers on notice that all 
pension options taking gender into account were illegal the court 
said 
some options in the florida state retirement plan continued to 
use sexbased mortality rates until 1983 
the state was sued by male workers on behalf of themselves and 
their wives who also were beneficiaries of the pension plan they 
said their benefits were reduced illegally because of the use of 
the sexbased life expectancy figures 
lower courts ruled in their favor and ordered the state to pay 
an additional 436 million in benefits to them 
in other decisions the court 
upheld by a 63 vote the way texas courts administer that 
states death penalty law dashing the hopes of about 260 death row 
inmates 
split 54 in upholding an oklahoma mans murder conviction and 
death sentence even though the presiding judge wrongly refused to 
exclude one potential juror the juror was disqualified when the 
defendants lawyer used one of the defenses limited number of 
automatic challenges 
ruled 81 in a case from denver that federal judges may not 
throw out an indictment because of a prosecutors misconduct unless 
the defendant can show there would have been no indictment without 
such misconduct

legislation requiring the nations railroad 
workers to undergo random drug testing has begun to make progress 
in the electionyear conscious house 
the house transportation tourism and hazardous materials 
subcommittee voted 130 on wednesday to send the measure to the 
full energy and commerce committee the committees chairman rep 
john dingell dmich who has been reluctant to support the 
measure is now expected to give the legislation prompt 
consideration 
i expect it to be called up right away said rep thomas a 
luken dohio the subcommittee chairman after his panel approved 
the bill 
luken cosponsored the measure with rep bob whittaker of 
kansas the subcommittees ranking republican who said public 
support for ridding drug and alcohol abuse from the transportation 
industry is simply overwhelming 
there has been growing support in congress for drug testing 
legislation since jan 4 1987 when an amtrak passenger train and 
three conrail locomotives collided in chase md the crash killed 
16 people and injured 175 others and two conrail crewmen have 
admitted to having smoked marijuana shortly before the disaster 
railroad labor officials have opposed proposals for random 
testing saying that the procedures would violate the privacy of 
the workers and unfairly threaten their careers because of the risk 
of inaccurate laboratory analysis 
that opposition has been diminishing however as electionyear 
pressures have increased for lawmakers to do something about drug 
abuse in addition the federal railroad administration proposed 
drug testing rules for railroad workers on may 5 that many union 
leaders consider harsher than the legislation 
the bill would require not only random testing which supporters 
say would deter alcohol and drug abuse but testing after 
accidents before hiring for reasonable cause and as a part of 
annual physical examinations 
workers who test positive would be given a second more 
sophisticated test to confirm the results if they test positive 
again they would be suspended without pay and required to complete 
rehabilitation programs to keep their jobs employees who refuse to 
take tests would risk being fired 
procedures would be established to certify the laboratories 
being used and to protect workers against harassment 
luken who had long expressed fears about erroneous test 
results resisted introducing legislation until june 3 that was 
five weeks after dr roger horn of hunt valley md whose daughter 
ceres 16 was killed in the chase crash visited newspapers and 
television and radio stations in lukens cincinnati district to 
argue that random testing was needed 
the senate has already approved legislation that would require 
random drug and alcohol testing for railroad airline and trucking 
industry workers 
rail workers involved in accidents are already subject to drug 
and alcohol tests but those rules are being challenged in court

under a new proposal 10 states in the upper 
midwest northeast and southeast are going to have to tell the 
environmental protection agency how they will protect ground water 
from contamination with the highly toxic pesticide aldicarb 
in its first action under a draft strategy aimed at protecting 
ground water from pesticides the epa said wednesday that it was 
considering an alternative that would require pesticide 
management plans from as many as 24 states 
only the 10 states in the main proposal chosen on the basis of 
their crops and the general vulnerability of ground water were 
identified pennsylvania michigan north dakota georgia alabama 
maine new york wisconsin minnesota and florida 
in the first five aldicarb has not been found in ground water 
in the second five it has been found in concentrations above 10 
parts per billion which is the amount the epa considers safe 
ground water which supplies drinking water to half the nations 
population was once thought safe from pollution but evidence to 
the contrary has accumulated in recent years the epa has found 63 
pesticides in ground water 
the agency reported that onethird of about 35000 ground water 
samples it tested contained some aldicarb 
aldicarb sold under the trade name temik by rhonepoulenc ag 
co of research triangle park nc is used on potatoes citrus 
peanuts cotton and other crops to protect them against scores of 
insects root worms and mites as much as 57 million pounds of the 
pesticide are used each year 
its use already is restricted and it is banned in a few areas 
like suffolk county on new yorks long island where 3100 homes 
must use expensive charcoal filtration to remove it from their well 
water 
in humans aldicarb can interfere with the transmission of nerve 
impulses high concentrations can cause digestive upset 
dehydration blurred vision disorientation seizures 
unconsciousness and death 
more than 1000 poisonings and two stillbirths were reported in 
western states and canada in 1985 from californiagrown watermelons 
contaminated with aldicarb 
the epa has been studying the pesticide for four years and 
still is investigating how much might be in typical diets the 
manufacturer said wednesday its latest survey showed residues 
were rarely present 
the agencys draft strategy leaves many key decisions to the 
states like banning aldicarbs use in certain areas and limiting 
frequency of application john a moore assistant epa 
administrator for pesticides told reporters wednesday that the 
agency probably would ban use of aldicarb in states that refuse to 
submit plans 
states might win epa approval to permit contamination of ground 
water that wouldnt be used for drinking water he said as long as 
residents of the state have had a chance to comment on the plan 
moore said the epa also is proposing to ban aldicarb use within 
300 feet of any well and to require state training programs for 
applicators to teach about ground water effects 
rhonepoulenc said in a statement that the epas proposal 
reflects sound principles for drinking water protection and 
said it would cooperate 
a company spokesman steve schmotzer said we are going to 
manage this product even more stringently than required as we are 
doing in some instances now 
in some counties in florida he said the company requires 
1000foot well protection zones elsewhere though 50 feet might 
suffice and rhonepoulenc might seek a variable zone in comments 
to the epa schmotzer said 
jay feldman coordinator of the national campaign against the 
misuse of pesticides criticized the epa for not considering 
nonchemical strategies such as crop rotations in calculating the 
costs and benefits of aldicarb use 
in addition to the five states from which epa wants management 
plans aldicarb also has been found in california massachusetts 
north carolina new jersey rhode island and virgina in 
concentrations above 10 ppb and in arizona arkansas oregon 
texas and washington in concentrations below that 
the epas proposal also would require rhonepoulenc to monitor 
ground water the agency considers highly vulnerable in connecticut 
hawaii idaho illinois indiana kansas massachusetts missouri 
montana nebraska new hampshire ohio rhode island south 
carolina south dakota and vermont

former defense secretary caspar w weinberger 
says hes afraid there will be a dangerous overreaction by congress 
and the public to disclosures of a massive pentagon fraud and 
bribery investigation 
you dont close a bank because theres been a bank robbery 
weinberger said in an interview wednesday 
and you dont conclude that we dont need a strong defense 
because of the actions of some faithless employees its important 
to bear in mind that the needs of defense havent changed at all as 
a result of these stories 
weinberger also said that he had no apologies to make for his 
management style while serving as secretary of defense he said he 
didnt know about the federal investigation until it was revealed 
last week nor he said did he have any suspicions of wrongdoing 
before he left office last november 
i think the contract procedures in effect are proper the 
former defense chief and presidential confidant said 
we needed to regain military strength quickly and we did but 
i didnt exercise any handsoff management technique i had 
briefings regularly once a week or every two weeks on the major 
weapons programs 
but no matter how careful you are youre not going to be able 
to eliminate dishonesty 
weinberger served almost seven years as secretary of defense 
before stepping down because of the ill health of his wife 
according to the justice department the ongoing fraud and bribery 
probe began during his tenure and involved at least to some 
extent contracting actions that occurred before his departure 
justice department officials say the inquiry centers on 
allegations that pentagon executives took bribes from private 
military consultants who were seeking classified contract 
information for their clients 
weinberger insisted he had seen nothing in news reports about 
the fbi investigation to call into question the contracting rules 
and regulations used by the pentagon he also complained that talk 
of scandal was prompting lawmakers to twist facts about the 
administrations performance 
we need to keep a sense of proportion without jumping to 
conclusions he said the pentagon awards 52000 contracts 
every single day and inevitably there may be some faithless or 
dishonest people 
now a lot of totally incorrect statements are being made in 
the heat of battle sen charles grassley riowa said 6 percent 
of defense contracts are awarded competitively its really 60 
percent sixty percent of the contracts by dollar value its 82 
percent by number of contract actions 
weinbergers defense of the pentagon came just one day after 
president reagan offered similar observations saying bribery and 
fraud were understandable within the huge bureaucracy of the 
pentagon and that no one could keep track of all defense employees 
and military contractors 
while echoing those views weinberger made clear he did not 
condone the misconduct 
i dont have any hesitancy in saying anyone found guilty of 
bribing or receiving bribes or giving out classified information 
ought to be administered full punishment he said

one of the defense lawyers in the burgeoning 
pentagon contractfraud investigation suggests not entirely in 
jest that this could become the most politically popular scandal 
in years 
this is the best thing thats happened to both the republicans 
and democrats in six months because for the republicans it gets 
everybodys mind off attorney general ed meese and for the 
democrats it gets everybodys mind off house speaker jim 
wright said this lawyer who was not interested in having his or 
his clients name further publicized 
so what you have is a natural tendency on the part of both 
parties to try to pump it up youve got a republican iowa sen 
charles grassley whos pumping it up and youve got the 
democrats too including sens david pryor of arkansas and sam 
nunn of georgia and rep les aspin of wisconsin the lawyer added 
all four have joined the public outcry over the affair 
its the one thing everybody can join in on because it gets 
reporters off their leadership the lawyer said its terrific 
a perfect opportunity 
this experienced attorney is among a dozen washington lawyers 
already hired by contractors consultants and pentagon officials 
who are named in government search warrants or grand jury subpoenas 
he was giving his admittedly selfinterested view of how 
government investigators had received such voluminous and favorable 
publicity for their side of the case through leaks speeches and 
news conferences even before bringing any charges or making any 
arrests 
meese who 365 days out of most years solemnly refuses to 
discuss ongoing investigations in public even held a news 
conference to outline the scope of the investigation and rebut 
grassleys complaints that the justice department had moved too 
slowly 
since the governments coordinated searches on june 14 the 
pentagon story has muscled two highprofile investigations off the 
nations front pages the special prosecutors imminent report on 
whether meese used his office to benefit himself and friends and a 
house ethics investigation of democratic speaker jim wrights 
finances and official actions 
the wellknown names meese and wright have been replaced by 
those of pentagon bureaucrats private consultants and contractors 
who are hardly household words berlin galvin gunn lackner 
paisley parkin and others 
even the congressmen whose names have been pulled in by justice 
department or investigative leakers as potentially of interest to 
investigators are not the best known on capitol hill democrats 
william chappell jr of florida roy dyson of maryland thomas j 
downey and samuel s stratton both of new york and republican 
andy ireland of florida 
aides to those five point out that even the leakers dont say 
theyre under investigation at this time federal prosecutor henry 
hudson publicly says no one on the hill is now a target 
this is as close as a washington scandal comes to catnip for 
politicians as texas gop chairman george strake told the dallas 
times herald every morning when i wake up i run out to get the 
paper and see what the scandal of the day is whether its on them 
or us 
the defense lawyer also offered some cautionary words for those 
tempted to translate leaks and fbi search warrant affidavits into 
automatic convictions 
its a specific federal crime if you trade inside information 
on wall street but there is a sensitive information flow between 
the pentagon and its contractors that is not only legal but even 
encouraged only in certain circumstances is that illegal he 
said 
the leakers have crowed over how unguarded their targets were as 
government agents secretly monitored their telephone calls and 
office conversations but this lawyer who has heard similar 
government tapes before said they may not have tapes that are 
that clear and what they are hearing may be legal or illegal 
depending on the intent involved 
the tapes may have showed a need to check further the 
lawyer said but he emphasized that further investigation is just 
beginning with last weeks massive seizure of records and the 
efforts to persuade targets to confess and cooperate 
even if the leakers are correct he said this would be dozens 
of separate small conspiracies that take time to investigate not 
one big conspiracy all the search warrants were done together 
so that one search did not alert other people who might be involved 
in separate similar schemes to begin shredding their documents 
based on his experience this lawyer said the people 
hemorrhaging information now are the ones who know the least the 
ones who know the most dont talk at this stage

congressional advocates of providing income 
guarantees for americas droughtplagued farmers concede that it 
will take weeks just to fashion a bill let alone push it through 
congress 
this is an ongoing process nothing is set in stone house 
agriculture committee chairman e kika de la garza dtexas 
said wednesday after a congressional task force approved broad 
outlines of a droughtrelief package 
the blueprint is short on specifics and bound to come in for 
changes in weeks ahead in fact one feature to allow growing 
oats on idled acreage was approved as part of the plan then 
quietly scuttled within the hour to keep peace with a skeptical 
agriculture secretary richard e lyng 
the general proposal calls for guaranteeing farm incomes but 
leaves the contentious task of developing a formula for later 
senate agriculture committee chairman patrick j leahy dvt 
had said earlier that task force members should sit down and stay 
in session until they worked out a blueprint for providing 
assistance 
he told the task force that at least some document was needed as 
a sign to farmers that congress means business about providing help 
what i saw in the northern plains i never would have 
believed said leahy who headed a visit by six senators to 
montana and the dakotas over the weekend he also noted that beef 
and pork prices are falling and he issued a sternly worded warning 
to food companies not to raise consumer prices 
lyng told the task force that president reagan did not mean to 
express opposition to drought assistance when he said at a toronto 
news conference that there was little he could do about the 
situation 
reagan merely exhibited some of the frustration that some of 
the rest of us have that you cant do anything to make it rain 
lyng said he said the president favors some form of assistance 
i accept your explanation de la garza said 
the task force called for speededup action by the agriculture 
department to allow farmers in droughtstricken counties to obtain 
92 percent of their normal deficiency payments even if they 
are prevented by drought from planting 
such a measure would come under the departments zero92 
program which ordinarily permits farmers to plant none of their 
acreage and still receive 92 percent of the payments 
deficiency payments are income supports representing the 
difference between market prices and target prices set by congress 
and adjusted annually by the secretary of agriculture 
the group urged maximum flexibility in applying a rule that 
farmers must plant socalled cover crops such as grasses on lands 
idled for conservation purposes sizeable amounts of land are idled 
for such purposes under provisions of the 1985 farm law that sought 
not only to prevent erosion but to take land out of production to 
combat surpluses 
other task force recommendations 
a search for ways to make sure producers will have sufficient 
herds to resume livestock breeding when the drought is over 
breeders are selling off stock because of lack of feed 
development of ways to expand participation in the federal crop 
insurance program 
use of all authority provided under last years bailout bill 
for the farm credit system a nationwide network of lending 
institutions to restructure loan payments for farmers hard hit by 
drought 
emergency loans for farmers if conditions worsen 
leahy and other task force members have been saying that a spate 
of electionyear drought aid bills would not help in passing an aid 
package but two michigan lawmakers pushed ahead wednesday saying 
there was no reason to delay 
sen don riegle dmich and rep bob traxler dmich 
introduced a measure that would use inkind payments to repay 
farmers up to 50 percent of drought losses traxler said his 
measure had no dollar limit and might not be the one that ends up 
passing but added that some form of aid would do so 
he said the chairman of the house appropriations committee rep 
jamie whitten dmiss will make certain that an aid measure wins 
approval 
jamie whitten has never met a disaster that he didnt 
tackle traxler said and i assure you that he will tackle this 
one

thirtysix cars of train derailed and one 
car filled with phosphorus burst into flames wednesday night 
forcing 2500 people to evacuate and bans on flights over four 
counties officials said 
no injuries were reported said don armstrong spokesman for the 
state disaster and emergency services in frankfort 
he said a phosphorus fire cannot be quenched and must burn 
itself out smoke from the fire could explode when temperatures 
reach 90 degrees he said 
youre talking about big big big trouble armstrong said 
water makes it burn hotter 
the evacuation was ordered for residents of nortonville graham 
and white plains downwind to the east of the burning car which 
derailed in christian county near the hopkin county line 
the federal aviation administration early thursday restricted 
all air travel over those counties and over muhlenberg and mclean 
counties two highways also were closed officials said 
the csx train derailed at 755 pm 3 miles north of crofton 
a community of 800 in western kentucky state police said

away 
no one in crofton population 800 was evacuated said novi 
mainire of the crofton police department 
officials were unable to determine if other chemicals were being 
transported on the train but armstrong said only one car was on

a study published today shows that the acne 
medicine accutane is the first treatment known to prevent skin 
cancer in humans but scientists caution the drug is too toxic for 
routine use 
accutane a vitamin a derivative that can cause birth defects in 
pregnant women sharply reduced skin cancer in a small group of 
people who were at extremely high risk because of an inherited 
genetic disorder the study shows 
while accutane cannot be taken for long periods by most people 
other synthetic forms of vitamin a may someday be routinely used to 
prevent skin cancer in people whose skin has been damaged by years 
of exposure to the sun the researchers said 
in addition vitamin a drugs may someday be used to treat other 
tumors of epithelial tissue such as cancers of the lung stomach 
colon bladder cervix and breast said dr harley haynes of 
brigham and womens hospital in boston 
the odds are that within the lifetime of many people we may 
well be able to develop treatments that reduce the risk of cancer 
in highrisk people he said 
the treatment is an example of the young field of 
chemoprevention until now medicines have been given almost 
exclusively to attack cancers once they occur rather than to 
prevent them from forming 
this is the first study that has scientifically proven in 
humans that skin cancer can be prevented by any means said dr 
howard koh of the boston university school of medicine we use 
sun screens because they should work but we still have not 
rigorously proven in a scientific way that skin cancer can be 
prevented with that method 
however he cautioned that the study conducted on just five 
people is very small and it is unclear whether the findings will 
apply to those at lower risk of skin cancer 
the study was directed by dr kenneth h kraemer at the national 
cancer institute and published in the new england journal of 
medicine 
about 500000 americans are treated each year for basal cell and 
squamous cell skin cancer the most common forms of cancer these 
tumors which are usually curable occur most frequently in 
lightskinned people exposed to too much sun 
you are better off preventing it by avoiding the sun at the 
beginning said kraemer but if that isnt the case this is an 
indication that drugs may be developed to prevent the progression 
of the damage to cancer 
accutane known generically as isotretinoin is widely used to 
clear up severe acne because of its possible danger for pregnant 
women the us food and drug administration last month ordered its 
maker hoffmanla roche to warn customers by printing a picture of 
a deformed baby on the drugs packaging 
in the cancer study high doses were taken by five people with 
xeroderma pigmentosum a rare disorder in which the body is unable 
to repair genetic damage caused by sunlight 
in the two years before taking accutane the patients studied 
had a total of 121 cancerous tumors while on the drug they had 
25 when the drug was stopped they had nearly a ninefold increase 
in the frequency of tumors 
however two people had to drop out of the study because of side 
effects one had high levels of blood fats while the other showed 
signs of liver abnormalities 
kraemer said that high doses of accutane may be warranted for 
some people who have frequent skin cancers because of their 
lifelong exposure to the sun but for the general population 
its much too toxic 
more than 2000 similar vitamin a compounds already exist and 
some of them may be safe and effective enough to protect ordinary 
people from skin cancers scientists say

if there are fewer cherries to bake into pies 
this fall part of the blame can be put on the drought 
the agriculture department said wednesday that production of 
tart cherries is expected to drop 41 percent from last year 
harvest of 3585 million pounds to 211 million pounds in michigan 
the largest producer the crop was estimated at 150 million pounds 
down 43 percent from 1987 
severe spring freezes drought and a high fruit dropoff in june 
were blamed for the decline in michigan production and rain is 
needed within the next few weeks for the remaining cherries to 
grow properly the report said 
production in the four leading states accounts for about 94 
percent of this years expected tart cherry production others 
include new york 23 million pounds down from 35 million in 1987 
utah 15 million down from 29 million and wisconsin 9 million 
down from 14 million 
the crop of sweet cherries was forecast at 175400 tons down 17 
percent from last years harvest of 210800 tons 
department officials say sweet cherry output in the western 
states is mostly quoted by the ton while eastern practice favors 
pounds since most production is in the west the agency reports 
sweet cherries in tons 
the top four producers of sweet cherries in this years forecast 
are california 32000 tons down from 45000 last year michigan 
22000 down from 32000 oregon 45000 down from 50000 and 
washington 67000 down from 74000

onetime democratic presidential contender 
joseph biden has endorsed likely democratic nominee michael 
dukakis nine months after a dukakis aide circulated an attack 
video that helped push biden out of the race 
biden a us senator from delaware telephoned dukakis from his 
home bidens office said wednesday dukakis has a mathematical 
lock on the nomination 
the dukakis campaign reacted to the call with satisfaction 
obviously we are delighted said campaign spokesman mark 
gearan who praised the delaware senator as someone who has 
national stature and has gained a reputation in the senate as a 
leader and a fighter 
his reputation as an effective and forceful leader on foreign 
policy on education and other domestic issues is something that we 
feel can be a tremendous help to our campaign gearan said 
biden who is recovering from brain surgery assured the 
massachusetts governor that he would work on his behalf when he 
returns to the senate later this year his office said 
bidens office said the senator told dukakis he was very 
confident the democrats will win back the white house and retain 
control of the senate in november 
biden ended his quest for the presidency on sept 23 1987 
after a week in which his campaign was rocked by admissions of 
plagiarism and of false claims about his academic record 
he was also criticized for lifting sections of other 
politicians speeches without attribution a videotape juxtaposing 
a biden campaign speech with a speech by british politician neil 
kinnock and showing striking similarities between the two was sent 
to various news organizations 
biden said he had credited kinnock on other occasions but had 
neglected to do so that time 
it was later revealed that john sasso dukakis campaign 
manager distributed the video one day after news reports linked 
the dukakis campaign to the video the massachusetts governor 
admitted that sasso was the source of the video sasso resigned 
from the campaign as did paul tully dukakis campaign issues 
director 
biden 45 is chairman of the senate judiciary committee he was 
released from the hospital last month after successful surgery to 
correct an aneurysm near his brain it was the second aneurysm he 
had suffered since february 
an aneurysm is a ballooning of the weakened wall of an artery 
and is caused by disease or injury

consultants hired by the state department have 
concluded that to tear down a portion of the new us embassy 
chancery in moscow would be an engineering nightmare according 
to a report published today 
members of congress and intelligence officers disclosed last 
year that the unfinished building was riddled with soviet listening 
devices 
the state department asked a team of engineers architects and 
security experts to study the structure and analyze solutions for 
making it secure 
the consultants in their initial finding have concluded that 
partial deconstruction of the eightstory building isnt 
feasible and would be more dangerous and difficult than 
demolishing the entire the structure and rebuilding the new york 
times reported today 
one of the consultants referred to an engineering nightmare 
the times said 
the new chancery was to have been the main embassy building for 
diplomatic and classified activities but after 22 million was 
spent on it construction was stopped in 1985 
a state department source told the associated press the 
department has received a portion of the consultants report but 
the complete report is not due until august the source said no 
decision on what to do about the building has been made 
robert e lamb assistant secretary of state for diplomatic 
security told the times the building experts are saying that a 
partial deconstruction isnt feasible because it is very difficult 
to take a portion of the building and build on the existing 
structure 
just from the efficiency of the construction youre better 
off taking the whole thing down lamb added 
the current embassy which the united states occupied in the 
early 1950s consists of one building its undergoing a 325 
million renovation

the telephone company is instituting a new 
exchange for dialaporn and partyline services that will be 
available to customers only upon request in a twist on efforts to 
keep youngsters from having access to the services 
industry spokesmen say the new exchange could drive the services 
out of business in maryland 
it will infringe on the rights of people who like this 
entertainment said jonathon golan who provides two programs of 
adult entertainment on 976 lines in baltimore their rights will 
be violated because the new service requires identification 
the maryland public service commission has approved chesapeake 
and potomacs request to institute the new exchange for all adult 
and conversationline services which have been available on 976 
numbers 
the new 915 exchange expected to be implemented by the end of 
the summer will be accessible only by customers who have notified 
the company they want to have access to it said al burman a 
spokesman for chesapeake and potomac telephone co 
maryland is the first state to approve the subscription exchange 
for dialaporn lines burman said sports lines financial 
services and other information lines will remain on 976 exhanges 
he said 
it would essentially wipe out the vast majority of the 976 
industry charged brad woodward treasurer of the midatlantic 
audiotex association woodward describes the group as a looseknit 
organization of about 175 services in the 
baltimorewashingtonphiladelphia area 
callers to many 976 programs such as teen party lines 
dialadate lines or other conversation lines make the call on 
impulse woodward said the change to a subscriptiontype service 
would eliminate those spontaneousresponse callers he said 
under the telephone companys plan a customer wishing to obtain 
access to the 915 lines would have to sign a consent form names of 
those signing the forms would be kept confidential 
customers now can request that access from their phone be 
blocked to certain 976 numbers the new system will work in 
reverse providing the 915 service only to those people who 
specifically request it by signing the form burman said 
across the country dialaporn and party line services have 
drawn criticisms from some who complain that they are too easily 
accessible by children who have in some cases run up huge bills 
without their parents knowledge 
the purpose is to provide customers increased control over 
which services would be accessed from their telephone service and 
to minimize billing disputes with customers burman said 
one provider of 976 service in the baltimore area thinks the 
change will have a positive effect on telephone information 
services 
i think its the best thing for it said joseph katz who 
operates the international 976 group in baltimore which operates 
information services but no dialaporn lines youre going to 
have more people who are going to come into the 
informationproviding area theyre not thinking 976 service is 
going out of business i think theyve done away with the 
objectionable part of it 
katz agreed that the subscription service could eliminate 
billing disputes theres no excuse for somebody to say they 
didnt know what they were getting he said they signed up 
but golan contended that the adultoriented business will suffer 
because people wont want to be identified as a subscriber to 915 
its a very touchy issue and its being approached in a very 
negative way he said 
tony parker an attorney for the midatlantic audiotex 
association said the group is considering legal action to block 
the public service commissions decision 
the commission is using the 915 service to drive dialaporn 
lines from the marketplace parker said adding what theyre 
doing is doing indirectly what they cant do directly 
annual revenue from 976type services is about 330 million 
nationwide according to the information industry bulletin an 
industry newsletter of that about 54 million is from 
dialaporn lines 90 million from conference conversation 
lines and 186 million from generalinterest lines such as 
recorded sports results

vice president george bush says the us 
judicial system is being held hostage by politicians and judges 
who get their legal views from the american civil liberties union 
that line won a round of applause from the audience of sheriffs 
but at least one member of the audience a supporter of democrat 
michael dukakis called bushs positions simplistic 
sheriff robert c rufo of suffolk county mass claimed bushs 
tough talk on fighting crime is no more than a republican 
smokescreen to divert attention from where they are weak 
rufo was in the audience on wednesday as bush delivered a 
strongly worded lawandorder speech to the national sheriffs 
association he dismissed some of the vice presidents views on 
crime as complete idiocy 
bush was spending today in washington with no public appearances 
scheduled however aides said he planned to meet at breakfast with 
former united nations ambassador jeane kirkpatrick 
kirkpatrick is frequently mentioned as a possible running mate 
for bush if he decides to name a woman to his ticket 
however bush spokeswoman shelia tate said there was no 
indication of what bush and kirkpatrick would discuss and the vice 
president on wednesday reiterated that he had not yet begun to 
consider any specific individuals for the no 2 spot on the 
republican ticket 
at the same time bush made light of recent polls showing far 
more support for him among men than among women voters 
you hear a lot about the gender gap bush told local 
interviewers what you do is spell out your positions on the 
issues and the gender gap goes away and you win the election 
thats what happened in 1984 and thats exactly what i want to have 
happen in 1988 
in his speech to the sheriffs bush attacked dukakis without 
naming him in what the vice president billed as a nonpartisan 
address 
for too many years weve been held hostage by wellmeaning 
but misguided politicians and judges who get their legal views from 
the aclu bush said a reference to the american civil liberties 
union 
the aclu often takes unpopular positions in representing 
individuals or organizations it contends have been deprived of 
their constitutional rights 
later bush told reporters that dukakis had called himself a 
cardcarrying member of the aclu 
that was a quote of his that is not exactly the mainstream of 
kentucky politics the vice president said 
bush reiterated his support for the death penalty for major drug 
dealers and for drugrelated deaths but said he would not advocate 
such a penalty for those convicted of drunken driving in a fatal 
accident 
i draw the line there he told reporters 
bush also took another swipe at what is becoming a favorite 
target the sinceabandoned massachusetts program for prison 
furloughs under which some convicted firstdegree murderers were 
let out of prison on weekend passes 
the view that all convicts can be rehabilitated is not just 
naive its dead wrong bush told the sheriffs organization 
when firstdegree murderers sentenced to life without parole 
get unsupervised weekend furloughs and commuted sentences that 
view goes from naive to dangerous from wellmeaning to 
irresponsible bush said 
bush recounted details of the case of willy horton a convicted 
massachusetts murderer who was released on a weekend furlough and 
accused of raping a woman while he was free 
sheriff rufo who is the president of the massachusetts 
sheriffs association told reporters that there were 121000 
successful furloughs before that incident 
rufo said that dukakis inherited but did not initiate the prison 
furlough program and now opposes allowing firstdegree murderers 
out of prison on weekend leave just as bush does 
he shares the vice presidents views on furloughs said 
rufo who wore a dukakis campaign button to the event

michael dukakis ducked questions about whether 
jesse jackson would be a liability on the democratic ticket while 
the search for a running mate picked up steam 
campaign sources said jackson along with florida sen bob 
graham ohio sen john glenn and georgia sen sam nunn had been 
asked to submit background and financial information and house 
majority leader tom foley of washington was being asked as well 
the soliciting of such information from potential running mates 
indicates interest on the part of the dukakis campaign 
but at least one potential running mate moved to take himself 
out of the running 
nick donatiello a spokesman for new jersey sen bill bradley 
said wednesday the senator had made it absolutely clear both 
publicly and privately to dukakis campaign chairman paul brountas 
that he was not interested brountas is heading the runningmate 
search 
bradleys office has said it had not been asked to supply the 
dukakis campaign with background information but dukakis asked if 
that meant bradley was not being considered answered with a quick 
no 
the massachusetts governor told reporters wednesday that jackson 
would receive very serious consideration as his running mate 
despite lacking government experience asked about surveys 
suggesting jackson could hurt the democratic ticket dukakis 
sidestepped 
im not going to be checking a lot of polls believe me 
we all have our strengths and our weaknesses 
on the matter of jacksons qualifications dukakis said i 
dont know that you have to have held public office to in fact be 
qualified 
but he added it helps 
in general dukakis was unwilling to say much about the search 
for his running mate 
i dont think its helpful to do it with press conferences 
at the end of the driveway every time you talk to somebody he 
said weve just begun the process 
the probable democratic nominee today was visiting a daycare 
center in southeastern massachusetts continuing his attempt to 
focus on issues he trumpets on the campaign trial 
dukakis picked up the endorsement wednesday of sen joseph biden 
of delaware who exited the presidential race shortly after 
dukakis top aide john sasso distributed a videotape showing 
biden had lifted rhetoric from a british politician without 
attributing the remarks 
on another front dukakis continued to defend himself against 
republican george bushs attacks on a massachusetts furlough 
program that allowed for the release of a murderer who then escaped 
while on furlough and raped a maryland woman 
dukakis said he had since tightened eligibility requirements for 
furloughs to exclude firstdegree murderers and said 45 states and 
the federal government have some form of furlough system 
he said bush was focusing on the furloughescape case because he 
had no record of his own to promote on crime issues

a congressional committee is due in 
west virginia this week to investigate hunger in appalachia but a 
debate already has begun over whether theres an underground 
army of starving people in the state 
we are looking for declining food security in appalachia 
where studies show the poor are getting poorer said timmie 
jensen a staff worker for the us house select committee on 
hunger 
west virginia was selected because all 55 counties of the 
coalmining state qualify as part of appalachia a committee 
spokesman said no other state bears that distinction 
the committee plans hearings in montgomery on friday to listen 
to food bank workers community advocates and state welfare 
officials talk about whether west virginias poor are being fed a 
few congressmen led by rep harley staggers dwva also will 
visit the homes of three needy residents to hear their problems 
there are 100000 people in poverty in west virginia who are 
getting no aid jensen said wednesday its ironic considering 
the federal food stamp program started in west virginia and were 
still not reaching all west virginians 
food stamps were introduced in west virginia in 1961 under an 
executive order by president john f kennedy the state third in 
the nation in unemployment really illustrates the problems of 
the poor jensen said 
west virginias poverty rate is 223 percent versus the 
national average of 181 percent for rural areas staggers said 
joblessness has run as high as 44 percent in some southern 
coalfield counties during the past five years and the state has 
led the nation in unemployment for much of the decade unemployment 
now is at 74 percent by state calculations and 97 percent by 
federal figures 
the committee wants to find out whether the rural poor can feed 
themselves using food stamps or must rely on other sources for 
food jensen said 
if they have to go to food pantries and kitchens that is 
extraordinary means she said 
last month the center on budget and policy priorities a 
washingtonbased liberal watchdog group reported that nearly a 
fourth of west virginians live in poverty and that fewer than a 
third of the states jobless receive unemployment benefits 
i have a hard time sustaining that gov arch moore retorted 
shortly after the study was released he said his department of 
human services reports a reduction in the number of people 
receiving welfare benefits 
how do these people live moore asked theres some that 
talk about there being an underground around here some place im 
hardpressed to figure out where that data base is coming from 
moores press aide john price said the governor obviously is 
concerned about poverty in west virginia but said many of the 
studies on the state exaggerate the problem 
if thats true id like to know why were increasing our food 
distribution by about 400000 pounds a year said carla knicely 
director of the mountaineer food bank which distributes donated 
groceries to 225 food pantries and kitchens throughout west 
virginia 
the operation and two affiliates in huntington and coal mountain 
distributed 32 million pounds of food in 1987 knicely said 
if they arent hungry its because the food pantries are 
feeding them knicely said i would say the problem goes into 
malnutrition here not starvation but there are hungry children 
appalachian research and defense fund director milton ogle said 
federal hunger programs have come close to eliminating severe 
malnutrition he saw in rural states in the 1960s but theres 
still a lot of hunger around 
ogle said he is concerned that monthly food stamp allotments are 
not enough to feed participants and they have to do what they 
call beaning it eat nothing but beans the last week or so

two critically ill soviet refuseniks have been 
told by the soviet government they may soon be allowed to emigrate 
after years of denials relatives said wednesday 
the families of benjamin charny 50 and yuri zieman 49 have 
been notified by the us state department that soviet authorities 
have withdrawn objections on national security grounds to allowing 
the two men to leave 
leon charny said assistant secretary of state for human rights 
richard schifter telephoned him tuesday to say his brothers 
eightyear battle for permission to emigrate may soon be over 
im grateful im happy and i want him out as soon as 
possible charny said in a telephone interview from his needham 
home my wish is that no family will have to go through what this 
family has gone through 
i also got a call from the state department said ziemans 
daughter galina khatusky who emigrated to the united states in 
june 1987 they told me the soviets have no objection to my 
fathers leaving 
ziemans daughter vera had written president reagan appealing 
for help in the couples 11year wait for exit visas and the 
reagans considered visiting her home during the recent ussoviet 
summit in moscow 
the visit reportedly was canceled after us officials were 
warned that a presidential stop would doom the familys chances to 
emigrate 
charny and and khatusky said neither of their relatives had been 
officially granted permission to leave but both said they believe 
their release is just a matter of time 
i trust the state department said khatusky who lives in 
brighton 
the first indications the matter was about to be resolved came 
tuesday when soviet officials informally notified us and other 
western diplomats that the ziemans would soon be granted exit visas 
the word reportedly was conveyed to secretary of state george p 
shultz by soviet ambassador yuri dubynin 
khatusky said she was told it would take about two weeks for the 
soviet union to formally notify her parents and 12yearold sister 
vera that they may leave the soviet union 
zieman a computer specialist who lost his job when he applied 
to emigrate in 1977 worked as a plumber until stricken several 
months ago by a mysterious ailment that left him with double vision 
and a loss of balance 
the condition diagnosed by some soviet physicians as a 
potentially deadly aneurysm or bulge in a cerebral artery made 
the familys quest more urgent because zieman was warned by his 
doctors not to undergo the delicate corrective surgery in the 
soviet union 
zieman had been told he is not permitted to leave the country 
for security reasons though he contends he never had access to 
state secrets and has no information that could threaten soviet 
security 
he has severe brain disorders we hope he can come here and be 
examined properly said khatusky 
leon charny a doctoral student at the massachusetts institute 
of technology said his brother has undergone surgery for a 
cancerous growth on his back and recently suffered a heart attack 
he also has what is believed to be benign tumor growing on the 
back of his neck 
in 1986 the new england medical center offerred benjamin charny 
free medical care leon charny said adding that its doubtless 
he can receive better medical help here than in the soviet union 
charny a mathematician who worked for the institute of 
automation and instrument making 17 years ago had repeatedly been 
denied exit visas on the grounds that he was privy to state secrets 
his brother said a deputy director at the institute had 
contacted his brother tuesday to inform him he was no longer 
considered a person who knows vital secrets and that was the only 
major obstacle to his way out

a civic group has taken a novel approach 
to supporting its local police by taking out a 1 million insurance 
policy to cover the townships eight officers if they are killed in 
the line of duty 
the insurance idea came up after the deaths of two will county 
auxiliary deputies during a 1983 crime spree in homer township 
said james clarage president of the homer men for responsible 
government 
we really felt bad about what happened with that incident 
clarage said theres nothing you can really do to offset 
something like that this was just something we felt obligated to 
do to show that we were concerned 
in any future tragedy he said we wanted to make sure that it 
wouldnt cause hardship to the families of officers 
the coverage presented wednesday to will county sheriff john 
johnsen would provide up to 200000 for families of each officer 
killed and up to 1 million total the policy took effect march 1 
dues from the 100member social and civic organization are 
paying the 3000 annual premiums the insurance applies to the 
sheriff and the seven fulltime deputies who patrol homer township 
a small unincorporated community of 20000 residents located 30 
miles southwest of chicago 
after a twoyear search the club got lloyds of london to 
provide the policy states attorney ed masters said 
clarage said he contacted about a dozen insurance agents while 
local agent samuel maranto talked to more than 20 companies 
everybody said oh no problem clarage said but later 
the companies found they had no experience with civic groups buying 
insurance for local police and no policies were offered 
this is a rather unique situation in their making this very 
gracious and very heartwarming donation masters said i think 
that theres a need to protect police officers they put their life 
on the line 
clarage said many families of slain officers get only 25000 in 
death benefits from government agencies 
in july 1983 two people fatally shot a man and a woman who were 
parked in a secluded area in the township two auxiliary deputies 
steven mayer 22 and dennis foley 50 responded to the shots and 
were gunned down 
the bloody rampage ended only after a fifth person was shot and 
killed 
clarage said hes unsure how much money was given to the 
deputies families but he believes the amounts were minimal 
he suggested that many officers have a hard time getting life 
insurance policies because of the nature of their work bob 
schultz a spokesman for the illinois insurance information 
service said he was unaware of any problems 
when a police officer is killed people often take up private 
collections but there are limits to what can be raised clarage 
said 
my idea was why not have them contribute but do it ahead of 
time and do it in the form of purchasing some really meaningful 
coverage he said

congressional negotiators working on a 
pentagon budget bill have scaled back plans for a major military 
role in the antidrug effort and have cut president reagans 
request for star wars spending sources said 
the housesenate conference committee has approved all but a few 
details of a pentagon budget for the fiscal year starting oct 1 
and expect to complete their work later this week the sources who 
spoke on condition of anonymity told the associated press 
an agreement will send the huge bill back to the senate and 
house floors for approval and it will then go to reagan for his 
signature 
the bill authorizes 2995 billion in defense spending for the 
upcoming fiscal year down slightly from the 300 billion the 
pentagon is allowed to spend in the current year 
the sources said wednesday that the conference committee agreed 
to increase spending for an antidrug program in which coast guard 
officers ride aboard navy warships patrolling in offshore waters 
the coast guard officers have civilian arrest powers that they 
can use if the navy vessels encounter suspected drugtrafficking 
boats 
the coast guard has about 300 people assigned to the program 
riding aboard navy ships in teams of five to seven people per 
vessel another 100 coast guard personnel will be added to the 
program in the next three months the sources said 
the house had voted overwhelmingly to order reagan to have the 
pentagon essentially seal us borders against illegal drug 
shipments 
later the senate easily voted to give navy officers civilian 
arrest powers if warships stopped suspected drug trafficking 
vessels in international waters 
but the pentagon strongly opposed both those provisions defense 
secretary frank c carlucci said the military shouldnt get 
involved in civilian law enforcement and warned that even if it 
did illegal drugs still would flow into the united states 
the final compromise while dropping the more farreaching 
antidrug provisions passed by each chamber requires the pentagon 
to increase the help it provides to civilian antidrug agencies in 
spotting and tracking planes and ships that might be carrying 
contraband 
the air force and navy already provide intelligence help from 
radar planes and ships and carlucci said he has no opposition to 
increasing that aid 
the conference committee meanwhile agreed to authorize 41 
billion for star wars formally known as the strategic defense 
initiative the sources said that is up from the current 39 
billion budget but far below the 48 billion reagan had sought 
in addition the conferees dropped an amendment approved by the 
house that would have required a halt in all but the smallest us 
nuclear weapons tests the senate had rejected the proposed ban 
the legislators also agreed to authorize 250 million each for 
the midgetman and mx programs a pair of controversial efforts to 
develop new landbased atomictipped weapons another 250 million 
was approved for spending after a new president is elected nov 8

for nearly threequarters of a century 
lahontan reservoir has made an agricultural oasis of this desert 
region weathering good years and bad to irrigate 65000 acres of 
alfalfa and other crops 
but after two consecutive winters that produced half the normal 
precipitation in western nevada lahontan is drying up for the 
first time since its completion in 1915 
like many areas in the midwest and plains straining under one of 
the worst droughts in 50 years this fertile area will soon be out 
of water some fields will lack irrigation in a few weeks and by 
midseptember the 600mile network of canals will be dry 
officials said wednesday 
weve got everybody on a 70 percent allocation but its going 
to be pretty tough to meet that lyman mcconnell project manager 
of the truckeecarson irrigation district said 
ted debraga a fallon farmer and president of the irrigation 
district said even the 30 percent cutback equates to dollars 
when you start losing tonnage on the alfalfa 
when the flow to the alfalfa taps out well just try to keep 
it alive in hopes next year will be a better year he said it 
isnt a rosy picture 
the university of nevadareno has estimated the drought could 
put a 14 million dent in the states agriculture industry the no 
3 business behind gaming and mining 
alfalfa a legume with small purplish flowers that is the 
regions principal cash crop is mainly a pasture plant used for 
hay which has fallen into short supply throughout the farm belt 
because of the drought 
mcconnell said lahontan currently holds 121550 acrefeet of 
water barely onethird its capacity of 314000 acrefeet when it 
reaches 10000 acrefeet or 326 million gallons of water the 
gates will be closed to maintain a small reserve for next year 
an acrefoot is the amount of water that covers one acre to a 
depth of one foot 
the reservoir which meanders for 20 miles along the former 
carson river bed 35 miles east of reno is also a popular 
destination for fishing swimming and boating 
the project was begun shortly after the turn of the century and 
within a decade had transformed the desert area into an 
agricultural oasis despite close calls in 1924 1929 and 1931 the 
reservoir never has failed the farmers and ranchers it serves 
lahontan is fed by the carson river which is nearly exhausted 
and by water diverted from the truckee river flowing from lake 
tahoe and other smaller upstream reserves 
while farmers have made their first cutting of alfalfa most 
will at best get only one more cutting rather than the typical 
three said jeanni conlan of the us agricultural stabilization 
and conservation service in fallon 
those who have made four cuttings in the past arent likely to 
be that lucky this summer she added 
id guess there will be little water left to raise a fourth 
crop of hay she said most farmers make their third harvest 
between midseptember and midoctober about the time the water is 
expected to run out ms conlan said 
debraga said he had not heard of any farmers or ranchers being 
in danger of foreclosure but thats always a possibility even 
in a 100 percent irrigation year 
in years like this its that much closer he said next 
years the tough one with all the reservoirs being empty like 
theyre going to be this fall it would take an excellent year to 
get back even close to normal

iowa democratic leaders said its not 
a big surprise that jesse jackson will move to reduce the states 
role in the presidential selection process but they are gearing up 
to thwart the effort 
the iowans are banking on a good relationship with likely 
nominee michael dukakis and national party leaders to carry iowas 
early party caucuses at next months democratic national convention 
it shouldnt come as a big surprise said democratic 
spokesman phil roeder it seems the losing candidates in races 
have a pretty good track record of challenging iowas place its 
not a big surprise that one of the losers in the race is going to 
bring this up 
jackson started the exchange in an interview published in 
wednesdays editions of the new york times in which he said his 
forces would move at the convention to put heavilypopulated states 
such as california and new jersey toward the front of the string of 
primaries rather than at the end 
he complained that something is skewed about a process that 
gives so much importance to small states such as iowa and new 
hampshire while bigger states play little or no role in picking 
the partys nominee 
i will stand for a review of the process jackson told the 
newspaper were going to submit a plan dealing with ways to give 
small states and big states a chance right now for example you 
campaign almost a year in iowa and 10 days in california you do 
almost no campaigning in the northwest as a result of that 
arrangement

dissident republicans are formally 
challenging the credentials of michigans 77 delegates to the gop 
national convention 
the dissidents who held their own alternative state 
delegateselection convention after a dispute over party rules 
sent the national party their competing list of new orleans 
conventioneers on wednesday 
the list is comprised mainly of the more conservative party 
activists who supported the unsuccessful presidential candidacies 
of pat robertson and new york rep jack kemp 
they contend the convention they held was proper and followed 
party rules to the letter while the one led by supporters of vice 
president george bush violated party rules 
the competing delegate lists now must be reviewed by the partys 
contest committee which reports to the national conventions 
credentials committee 
from there the party has a mechanism for choosing between 
competing delegate slates and hearing appeals of those decisions

democrat michael dukakis holds a 
15percentage point margin over republican george bush among 
maryland voters in a new poll conducted by the university of 
maryland 
about 49 percent of the registered voters who responded favored 
dukakis 34 percent favored bush 11 percent were not sure 3 
percent said they would vote for someone else and 3 percent said 
they would not vote at all 
the poll was conducted by the universitys public polling 
project may 4 and june 7 and contacted 1005 residents by telephone 
of course its a long way to november but the traditional 
majority registration for the democratic party in this state may 
give the democratic candidate the edge said sue dowden director 
of the polling project 
president reagan carried maryland in his 1984 reelection 
landslide but the state went for president carter in 1980

last week the san francisco board of supervisors approved a 
penalty system that will sharply increase rates for households that 
use more water than alloted

water the first such enforcement action since a 1977 drought 
georgia natural resources commissioner leonard ledbetter last 
week placed water use restrictions on all surface water systems and 
some ground water systems north of a line extending from columbus 
to augusta several communities already have restricted water use

the house foreign affairs committee voted 
along party lines in approving a bill that arose from last years 
irancontra hearings to tighten congressional control over foreign 
covert intelligence action 
the full house is expected to pass the measure with a vote 
expected sometime later this summer but its unclear whether it can 
attract enough support to override an almost certain presidential 
veto 
the 2217 committee vote on wednesday came after democrats 
defeated a republican attempt to ease the proposed restrictions 
the bill would spell out more specifically how a president must 
notify the house and senate intelligence oversight committees when 
he authorizes a covert action 
under the proposal a version of which already has been passed 
by the senate the president would be required to report any covert 
action to the intelligence committees within 48 hours of its 
authorization

senate supporters of a bill imposing harsh new 
sanctions against whitedominated south africa concede they do not 
have the votes to override a threatened veto by president reagan 
but they said they would battle for senate passage of the bill 
to highlight congressional opposition to south africas racial 
policies 
the bill would end most trade with south africa and call for 
withdrawal of us corporate investment 
testifying before the senate foreign relations committee on 
wednesday deputy secretary of state john c whitehead strongly 
opposed the harsh sanctions measure as counterproductive 
and sen jesse helms rnc the leading opponent of using 
sanctions to increase pressures on south africa to adopt majority 
rule reforms said he will introduce legislation repealing the less 
severe sanctions bill passed over president reagans veto two years 
ago 
whitehead said that while the reagan administration believes 
apartheid is repugnant resorting to drastic remedies such as 
the misuse of american power to destabilize the south african 
economy only increases the chances of a catastrophic outcome for 
all south africans

defense consultant melvyn r paisley 
allegedly arranged for highlevel defense department officials to 
smuggle classified documents out of the pentagon and allow him to 
copy the papers with the help of his wife according to a published 
report today 
citing unnamed government sources the los angeles times 
reported today that paisley allegedly passed sensitive information 
to his major client mcdonnell douglas corp which paid him what 
one source described as staggering fees as a consultant 
paisley was retained by the defense contracting firm the day he 
left his post as assistant secretary of the navy on march 31 1987 
according to the times 
james e gaines paisleys close deputy in the navy department 
and one of six pentagon officials stripped of access to secret 
documents tuesday is suspected of being a major supplier of the 
classified materials according to a document in the investigation 
the times reported 
sources familiar with the investigation told the associated 
press wednesday that gaines is cooperating with government 
investigators 
the investigation that surfaced last week involves allegations 
that defense contractors and consultants many of them former 
military men bribed pentagon officials for contracting details 
that could be vital in winning contracts worth billions of dollars 
the details on paisley and gaines cited by the times are the 
most detailed yet on how investigators believe the alleged scheme 
worked 
the times quoted sources who said paisley recommended mcdonnell 
douglas hire adm james a lyons retired commander of the us 
pacific command whose offices were the target of a search warrant 
last week to assist in the effort to sell the companys f18 
fighterbomber to south korea 
lyons went to work last december to with paisley on the effort 
the warrant served in st louis seeks a wide range of documents 
relating to the work of ace lyons for mcdonnell douglas from 
december 1987 through 1988 
e lawrence barcella attorney for paisley and his wife vicki 
said wednesday it would be premature to make any comment there 
is nothing specific from the prosecutors to comment on 
this case is still in the evidencegathering stage barcella 
said 
paisley and lyons could not be reached for comment 
paisleys involvement in the sale of f18s to us allies 
including south korea was a major focus of a warrant the fbi 
obtained last week to search the office of thomas gunn the firms 
marketing vice president at the companys st louis headquarters 
the search warrant said paisley has provided mcdonnell douglas 
and thomas gunn substantial information obtained from government 
officials which has been classified andor confidential or not 
available to the contracting public 
bob obrien a spokesman in mcdonnell douglas washington 
office repeated a statement the company issued last week when 
gunns office was searched 
we are not aware of any improper requests by the company to 
mr paisley or any improper activities by mr paisley on behalf of 
the company the statement said 
gaines who was deputy assistant secretary for acquisition until 
he was reassigned tuesday by defense secretary frank c carlucci 
was regarded as a key aide to paisley when both were at the 
pentagon 
both men worked for the boeing cos aerospace unit in seattle 
in the 1970s 
the koreans who have indicated they were interested in buying 
as many as 120 new warplanes have not yet chosen between the 
general dynamics f16 and the f18

by the du pont campaign to gather the 5000 signatures needed to 
get on the ballot 
in convicting mountain jurors rejected the defense argument 
that he ordered temporary workers to sign phony signatures only 
because he had been goaded by a du pont official for being unable 
to collect legitimate ones

submit the phony petitions

working as a du pont volunteer not a company employee when he

denied knowledge of the forgeries no one from the du pont campaign 
testified here 
was there an intent to defraud or harm i dont think so

high school cheerleaders hanged black banners 
in the town square in memory of two sisters and five of their 
children killed when a train struck their car at a rural crossing 
that lacked warning signals 
its a major catastrophe for iola said bob johnson city 
editor of the iola register the newspaper in the town of 7000 
people theres shock a lot of people were calling me at home 
last night in disbelief and shock 
kathleen hastings 31 was a basketball star and cheerleader 
when she graduated from iola high school in 1975 her sister lisa 
maxwell 26 was a homecoming queen and graduated in 1980 both 
were honor students 
the collision occurred tuesday near cherokee about 100 miles 
southeast of iola a paramedic collapsed and died trying to save 
one of the children 
it just stunned us pat friskel the mother and grandmother 
of the victims said wednesday you just cant expect it to have 
it happen to so many of our children and their children and all at 
once you never think its going to happen 
mrs friskel and her husband paul are coowners of iolas 
funeral home and will handle the services 
all seven people in the station wagon were killed including 
mrs hastings children cara 8 eric 5 and reuben 3 and mrs 
maxwells children joel 5 and avery 2 
in addition joseph r cobb 48 director of the crawford county 
ambulance service died of a heart attack while trying to 
resuscitate one of the victims at a pittsburg hospital 
im sure there have been a lot of tears shed in this 
community even by people who may not have known them all that 
well because this strikes real close to home said iola mayor 
john carder 
officials investigating the accident said mrs hastings who was 
driving either did not see the burlington northern freight train 
or tried to race it to the crossing 
as far as we can determine there was no attempt by the 
driver to avoid the accident said trooper dan smith of the 
kansas highway patrol who spent wednesday reconstructing the 
accident 
the car left no skid marks and did not veer as it approached the 
crossing which had no signals lights or arms but was in a clear 
intersection two doublefatality accidents have occurred there 
since 1978 
the engineer was cleared of any responsibility in the accident 
smith said he was driving the southbound train 10 miles below the 
55 mph speed limit 
the engineer sounded his whistle before reaching the crossing 
smith said he put on the emergency brakes when he saw the station 
wagon but the switching engine and seven freight cars required at 
least a quartermile to stop 
theres probably nothing more of a nightmare than an 
engineer seeing a loaded car on a railroad crossing said robin 
hughes a burlington northern spokeswoman its always 
emotionally difficult this one was catastrophic

an ailing jewish mathematician who has tried in 
vain to leave the soviet union for more than nine years said today 
that officials had told him they no longer object to his emigration 
but refusenik benjamin charny 50 said he still had not 
received official permission to join relatives in the united states 
charny said he received a telephone call wednesday from his 
former workplace telling him that the ministry of general machine 
building that oversees it no longer objects to his emigrating 
charnys younger brother leon told the associated press in an 
interview from his needham mass home wednesday that us 
officials called to say they had been informed charny would be 
allowed to leave 
asked about the reports in the united states charny said that 
because of the high official sources i think it is so 
however he said in a telephone interview that he had no 
official confirmation from the soviet visa office 
if they are given permission to leave charny said he and his 
wife yadviga would join relatives near boston 
in another longtime refusenik case us officials also said 
that yuri and tanya zieman and their 11yearold daughter vera 
would be allowed to emigrate president reagan considered visiting 
the zieman family during his trip to moscow but us officials have 
said he did not because highranking soviet officials told them the 
zieman family never would be allowed to emigrate if reagan visited 
them 
if the charny and zieman families are allowed to leave it would 
resolve two of bestknown refusenik cases beginning last year 
soviet officials increased jewish emigration and have allowed most 
of the bestknown refuseniks to leave 
but jewish activists claim thousands of those who have not 
attracted media attention remain behind and the soviet system still 
violates their rights to emigration by applying unreasonable state 
secrecy criteria and demanding waivers of financial responsibilty 
from relatives who stay behind 
charny was refused permission to leave because of calculations 
on trajectories of space flight he did between 1966 and 1971 
he had surgery eight years ago to remove a cancerous tumor and 
said he needs surgery for another tumor on his neck he also 
suffered a heart attack recently and said he needs medical 
treatment in the united states

three arms dealers were convicted of plotting to 
illegally ship military equipment to argentina iraq poland and 
the soviet union in what authorities said was the first 
racketeering prosecution of an arms export case 
the us district court jury returned the verdict wednesday and 
was to meet today to decide on forfeiture of the 1 million in 
illegal profits from the deals which included the shipment of 
1300 nightvision goggles to argentina during the falkland islands 
war with great britain 
the three main defendants solomon schwartz 54 of monsey 
owner of texas armament advisors inc leonard berg 52 of new 
york owner of hlb security electronics ltd and leon lisbona 63 
of new york an hlb employee were found guilty of all charges 
they were convicted of 13 counts including racketeering wire 
fraud violations of federal export law conspiracy and making 
false statements to a governmental agency schwartz and berg also 
were convicted of obstruction of justice 
the most serious charge racketeering carries a maximum 
sentence of 20 years in prison 
a fourth defendant grim depancicis 44 of mount dora fla an 
associate of hlb was convicted of aiding an illegal export and 
conspiracy in connection with the soviet deal but was acquitted of 
a charge alleging his involvement in the argentine shipment 
in that deal the military equipment was smuggled out of the 
country without a required export license by couriers who hid the 
goggles in luggage prosecutors said 
another deal involved a shipment of 110 boxes of handguns 
shotguns and ammunition that the government contends was destined 
for iraq but was seized by authorities in belgium 
a third illegal export was a sting by the us customs 
service to ship 400 nightvision devices to the soviet union one 
sample was smuggled out of the united states without an export 
license to a post office box in west germany 
the last deal involved a shipment of 500 automatic rifles 
ammunition and other weapons that had an export license for mexico 
but was to go to poland the indictment said the arms were seized 
at kennedy international airport in february 1984 and the 
defendants were charged soon after 
the defendants used two means to arrange the deals which took 
place between 1982 and 1984 prosecutors said during the 
threemonth trial they either did not obtain export licenses as 
required for arms shipments or used licenses for a shipment to a 
legal destination but had the arms sent elsewhere 
defense attorneys denied their clients had committed any illegal 
actions and said that all the transactions were carried out openly 
because the defendants had nothing to hide 
schwartz testified that the polish shipment was arranged to 
establish routine business dealings in poland to facilitate the 
possible purchase of two soviet tanks wanted by us intelligence 
officials 
he said he was sought out by the cia in 1982 and later had 
contact with the defense intelligence agency concerning the 
purchase of two soviet t72 tanks 
assistant us attorney larry krantz said the prosecution was 
the first time the federal racketeering statute was used in an 
illegal arms export case 
he said it was alleged the defendants made about 1 million from 
the four deals

city officials have approved plans to open 133 new 
bars automatic dispensers and restaurants to sell beer as part of 
a more balanced approach to mikhail s gorbachevs antialcohol 
campaign a newspaper reported 
but moscow news said in an article in its wednesday editions 
that muscovites still have to be lucky to find a bottle of beer 
anywhere 
the newspaper said the city governments decision to allow beer 
sales in more places is a step toward a more considered approach 
to the struggle with drunkenness and alcoholism 
life showed that this problem cannot be solved only with 
prohibitive measures it said 
moscow city officials also ordered a 19 percent increase in beer 
production this year but moscow news said breweries cannot meet 
their deliveries because of a shortage of bottles 
and more than a month after city officials ordered the 
establishment of bars restaurants and dispensers to sell beer 
there is no sign of them moscow news said officials set no time 
limit to fulfill the order 
in one of his first major acts after becoming communist party 
general secretary in 1985 gorbachev cracked down on drinking the 
drinking age was raised prices of alcoholic beverages went up and 
the hours of liquor stores were restricted 
soviet officials credit the campaign with improving worker 
discipline and improving public health but there also has been 
increasing criticism 
consumers often have to stand in long lines to buy a bottle of 
vodka or wine and moonshining has contributed to a sugar shortage

striking scriptwriters packed meeting halls 
on both coasts to vote on the latest contract offer in heated 
meetings that could decide the outcome to the 16weekold walkout 
tonight 
writers guild of america leaders in los angeles urged their 
membership wednesday night to reject the 71 million contract 
offered last week by producers dissident writers eager for a 
settlement called for its approval 
a similar meeting took place in new york results of the vote 
were to be announced late today 
union president george kirgo called the balloting critical 
saying it would determine how were going to deal with the whole 
industry in the future 
the guild struck march 7 over the issue of payments for reruns 
of onehour domestic television shows and a bigger share in the 
increased foreign market the union also sought better guidelines 
to protect a writers work and allow writers to reacquire 
unproduced scripts 
agreement was reached on matters of creative control but both 
sides remain divided on the rerun economic package 
originally officials had hoped to announce results after the 
vote wednesday night but the overwhelming response slowed the 
tabulation an official said 
guild executive director brian walton refused to speculate on 
how the vote would go 
i dont know how big the vote will be to accept or reject 
i dont know how big the divisions really are said walton who 
received a standing ovation during a nearly hourlong presentation 
advocating rejection of the contract 
bill blinn a member of the prosettlement writers coalition 
told the audience this industry feeds on us and we feed on it 
he challenged the strategy suppositions made by walton and the 
union leadership telling union members there is one thing that 
is absolutely definite there is a contract here that can get us 
back to work in two days that is a fact thats not anyones 
supposition 
the union has about 9500 members nationwide about 6000 on the 
west coast 
members of the dissident writers coalition suggested that if 
they could get 30 percent of the vote they would have shown enough 
strength to change conditions and force a quick settlement 
but kirgo disputed that claim saying a 70 percent showing for 
support after four months of striking would be a strong statement 
for the union stance

a faction of the governing 
christian democratic party has nominated a second presidential 
candidate for next years elections further widening the split in 
el salvadors top political party 
fidel chavez mena was chosen unanimously wednesday by 180 
national delegates who gathered at christian democratic 
headquarters in san salvador 
chavez mena 48 is the former minister of the presidency and 
communications under president jose napoleon duartes usbacked 
government 
julio adolfo rey prendes a businessman and former foreign 
minister under duarte was nominated by the partys other faction 
on april 29 
rey prendes 55 has said he will take the matter to the supreme 
court in comments to journalists tuesday he called chavez mena 
a thief 
each faction considers the others convention illegal 
duarte honorary party president called last month for both 
hopefuls to step aside to make way for a unity candidate in the 
march 1989 election 
by law duarte cannot run for reelection the president is being 
treated in washington for terminal cancer though his son has said 
duarte will resume his duties in july 
the bitter infighting has further hurt the christian democrats 
soundly defeated as they were by the rightist republican 
nationalist alliance known by its spanish acronym as arena in 
municipal and legislative elections in march 
el salvador has had an elected civilian government since 1982 
but leftist rebels contend it is only a facade for dictatorial 
military rule they accuse rightist death squads and paramilitary 
forces of killing civilians 
the civil war that has claimed 65000 lives since october 1979 
is generally considered to be stalemated but guerrilla leaders 
recently pledged to step up their military campaign

a federal appeals court has reinstated a 
lawsuit filed by entertainer bette midler after an advertising 
agency allegedly tried to duplicate her voice and singing style in 
one of its ad campaigns 
the 9th us circuit court of appeals unanimously ruled 
wednesday that midler could pursue her suit against the ford motor 
co and the young amp rubicam advertising agency the court said 
certain personal attributes such as a voice can be considered 
property rights protected by state law 
the television ad campaign featured one of midlers former 
backup signers performing do you want to dance in an ad for the 
mercury sable car 
the agencys ads included nine original singers and 10 
soundalikes for its series the court said 
after being turned down by midlers manager the agency 
contacted uta hedwig who once sang backup for midler and asked 
her to imitate midlers voice the court said

iraqi warplanes today bombed 10 oil 
production installations and pumping stations in iran in the 
heaviest air raids on iranian economic targets in weeks the 
official iraqi news agency reported 
the agency monitored in nicosia said six targets in the ahwaz 
oilfields in southwestern khuzestan province were hit and caught 
fire 
soon after two installations at the bibi hakimah oilfield 120 
miles to the southeast were bombed and set ablaze ina reported 
another formation of jets hit the kagsaran terminal on the 
northern coast of the persian gulf at about the same time leaving 
the targets shrouded in flames and smoke the agency said 
all the planes returned safely to their bases ina added 
there was no immediate comment from tehran and the iraqi claims 
could not be independently confirmed 
ina quoted a military communique as saying the raids were a 
message to tehran that it has lost the war in all fields and that 
there is no alternative to save iran from total deterioration but 
to accept peace 
todays air raids were the first significant strikes against 
iranian oil installations on land since early may when 
fighterbombers attacked several oil refineries and petrochemical 
plants 
the air force has also attacked several iranian oil tankers in 
the gulf a bit to choke off the vital oil exports tehran needs to 
finance its war effort 
frenchbuilt iraqi mirage f1s carried out a longrange 
1500mile raid on irans larak island oil terminal in the southern 
gulf on may 14 setting five tankers on fire 
the targets included the worlds largest vessel the 564739ton 
seawise giant 
iraqi air strikes inflicted considerable damage on irans oil 
infrastructure in march and april oil industry and diplomatic 
sources reported refineries were repeatedly hit 
oil industry sources say iran has been forced to import 
unprecedented amounts of refined products such as aviation fuel 
and kerosene because refinery production has been badly reduced 
iraqs air force has been concentrating on attacking iranian 
troop concentrations in the last few weeks as the land war heated 
up 
both sides have claimed to have killed or wounded thousands of 
each others troops in various sectors of the 730mile front 
iran and iraq have been at war since september 1980

a study of ancient teeth suggests ancestors of 
humans ate soft fruits and leaves but their evolutionary cousins 
ate nuts and bark scientists reported today 
the study compared microscopic wear patterns of teeth from human 
ancestors called australopithecus and their cousins called 
paranthropus with those of modern animals with known diets 
the work is reported in todays issue of the british journal 
nature by frederick grine associate professor of anthropology at 
the state university of new york at stony brook and richard kay 
professor of anatomy at duke university in durham nc 
they studied detailed replicas of molars that australopithecus 
left some 25 million to 28 million years ago in south africa and 
that paranthropus left there some 15 million to 18 million years 
ago 
the two kinds of animals are also known as gracile and robust 
australopithecines respectively 
both walked upright but after their lineages split some 25 
million years ago the australopithecus group evolved toward modern 
humans while the paranthropus branch eventually died out 
in the study paranthropus teeth showed more pits and wider 
pits and scratches suggesting a diet of tougher foods than 
australopithecus ate researchers said the difference probably led 
to the bigger teeth and larger jaws of paranthropus they said

scientists today reported finding north 
americas oldest wellpreserved fossils of landdwelling 
vertebrates and said the find should yield important information 
about early species of such animals 
several hundred fossils have been collected in southeast iowa 
from what was apparently a pond when the animals lived 335 million 
years ago scientists said in todays issue of the british journal 
nature 
news of the fossils had been publicized in 1986 
the nature report was written by john bolt of the field museum 
of natural history in chicago robert mckay and brian witzke of the 
iowa department of natural resouces and mp mcadams of william 
penn college in oskaloosa iowa 
the ancient animals lived 15 million years after amphibians 
appeared on the scene the fossils include nearly complete 
skeletons of at least two apparently new species of amphibians 
including one related to ancient animals called anthracosaurs 
researchers said 
at least eight fish species are also represented they said 
the find is important partly because it is the first such site 
of the mississippian age reported from the middle of the continent 
alec panchen of the university of newcastle in england wrote in an 
editorial accompanying the report 
earlier similar animals of the mississippian age had been known 
mainly from scotland nova scotia and an area including northwern 
west virginia he said

emergency room workers should handle all blood as 
though its tainted with the aids virus because of the risk of 
patients having unrecognized aids infections a report today 
concludes 
the researchers found that at one inner city emergency room 4 
percent of the patients were infected with hiv the aids virus but 
did not know it 
their report concludes that infectioncontrol precautions 
should be consistently applied particularly in emergency settings 
by all health care workers coming in contact with blood or other 
body fluids whether hiv infection is known or suspected and 
regardless of patients condition at presentation or knowledge of 
their riskfactor status 
the report published in the new england journal of medicine is 
based on a survey of 2302 emergency room patients who were treated 
over a sixweek period last year at johns hopkins hospital in 
baltimore 
hiv infection was most common among black men between ages 30 
and 34 the survey found that 11 percent of them carried the virus 
threequarters of the emergency room patients were black the 
doctors wrote that the high infection rate may reflect the rapid 
spread of hiv into the local inner city predominantly black 
population 
the risk of hospital workers catching aids from the patients is 
considered to be very low nevertheless experts recommend that 
doctors nurses and technicians take special precautions when 
handling the blood of aidsinfected patients to eliminate even this 
low risk 
the researchers said that during the period studied only 27 
patients who were already known to be infected were treated with 
special precautions their blood was labeled infectious and health 
care workers wore gloves when performing procedures or handling 
blood after medical evaluations the examining rooms were cleaned 
with disinfectant

leader lee yungbok 
company president lee yangsup welcomed the settlement and said 
all hyundai officials and workers would do our best to make up 
for lost production 
hyundai said the strike cost 490 million in lost sales 
the settlement will give workers an immediate pay increase of 
106 a month hyundai workers earn an average of 800 a month after 
five years including allowances 
union leaders called off the strike monday indicating the 
company had assured them considerable pay hikes if their boycott 
ended voluntarily 
the unions decision prompted hyundai to announce the reopening 
of its plant on tuesday but the plant failed to reopen tuesday as 
union leaders changed their mind and made a new demand for payment 
of lost wages during the strike 
the company rejected the union demand but offered a oneshot 
payment of 206 to encourage workers to work harder to increase 
production the union accepted the offer 
hyundai planned to produce 720000 vehicles this year and export 
twothirds of them to the united states and other countries

habit of stopping young female drivers for lingering talks in the 
dark 
craig peyer 38 of poway a california highway patrol officer 
for 13 years was convicted wednesday in his second trial for the 
onduty murder of cara knott 20 of el cajon 
a prosecution case strengthened through hindsight and the 
inability of the defense to establish an alibi were the chief 
reasons cited by lawyers for the jurys firstdegree murder finding 
after five days of deliberations peyers first trial ended with a 
hung jury feb 25 
holes closed in the second trial district attorney ed 
miller said 
the jury came to the conclusion that there was an overwhelming 
abundance of evidence i think what weve demonstrated is the 
system works justice has been served and no one is above the 
law he said 
regarded as an exemplary officer before his jan 15 1987 
arrest peyer was fired after an internal investigation he is 
appealing the firing 
peyer was the second officer in the 58year history of the 
agency to be charged with killing a motorist while on duty 
he is crushed he wants to appeal said peyers attorney 
robert grimes 
peyer was convicted of strangling knott a san diego state 
university student after pulling her car over on dec 27 1986 as 
she drove home along interstate 15 
knotts abandoned car was found in a culdesac near an offramp 
of i15 and her body was found in a creek bed beneath an old 
highway bridge nearby she had been strangled before being thrown 
off the 65foot bridge 
knott was described by the prosecutor as a careful young woman 
who was trained in selfdefense and who may have grown suspicious 
of peyers actions and prompted him to kill her 
during retrial jurors heard testimony from 121 prosecution 
witnesses including two dozen women motorists who recalled their 
encounters with peyer the former officer never made any sexual 
advances and was described by some as helpful and polite while 
others said they were scared and uncomfortable 
superior court judge richard huffman scheduled sentencing for 
july 20 and peyer faces a prison term of 25 years to life grimes 
said he would appeal the verdict at the sentencing 
peyer who was free on 250000 bail was taken into custody 
immediately after the verdict 
we recognize the extraordinary courage of the witnesses who 
came forward and through their soulsearching revealed the truth 
said knotts father samuel we put our trust in the criminal 
justice system and feel justice has finally been served 
peyers wife karen vowed to stand by her husband 
as a family were sticking together side by side mrs 
peyer said outside the couples house its a really tough time 
for us but we always remain a family and i trust totally in the 
lord jesus christ

china today rejected a proposal made by tibets 
exiled leader the dalai lama that would have recognized its 
control of tibets foreign affairs in exchange for limited 
independence for the remote region 
foreign ministry spokesman li zhaoxing at a weekly briefing 
said it was irrefutable that tibet is an inseparable part of 
chinese territory 
therefore to have independence or semiindependence will go 
nowhere in tibet it is not tolerable or acceptable and even a sort 
of independence in a disguised form is not acceptable he said 
the dalai lama who fled to exile in india after a failed 1959 
uprising against china made the proposal last week in strasbourg 
france 
it was significant in that it acknowledged chinese interests in 
tibet and granted china the right to keep troops in tibet and run 
the regions foreign affairs 
the dalai lama said he proposed a middle way in which tibet 
would be a selfgoverning entity in association with china 
the proposal was seen as a major concession by the dalai lama 
who in the past has called for the total independence of tibet 
last fall and again in march monks loyal to the dalai lama led 
bloody antichinese riots in the tibetan capital of lhasa 
sources in the office of tibet in new york said many tibetans 
were unhappy with the dalai lamas new proposal and had hoped he 
would not give in to the chinese in his strasbourg speech the 
exiled tibetan leader acknowledged his proposal might be 
controversial within the tibetan community 
li today accused the dalai lama of attempting to 
internationalize the tibet question 
we oppose any action or activities to be taken by dalai lama 
in foreign countries which are detrimental to the unification of 
the motherland and the national unity he said 
the buddhist spiritual leader made his proposal during a private 
visit to the european parliament in strasbourg he was not invited 
to address the body because of the parliaments concern for 
maintaining good relations with china 
after the speech china canceled several visits to china planned 
by parliament members 
beijing strongly criticized the us congress for inviting the 
dalai lama to testify on conditions in tibet last fall shortly 
before the outbreak of rioting in lhasa 
we are also opposed to any foreign organizations or personage 
who provides a forum for dalai lama to make statements which are 
detrimental to national unity li said 
asked if there were any good points in the dalai lamas 
proposal li would only say that tibet is entirely a matter of 
the chinese internal affairs

scientists medicine men and farmers have long 
sought ways to make it rain on command while that day may be 
nearer rainmaking cannot yet offer hope for breaking the drought 
gripping america 
experiments have shown that cloud seeding can offer a modest 
increase in what precipitation does fall but it would not break a 
drought or anything like that said meteorologist michael r 
poellot of the university of north dakota 
studies suggest mans ability to modify precipitation is 
really quite minor added roscoe r braham who teaches 
meteorology at the university of chicago 
were not dealing with a minor problem in the drought were 
dealing with a major catastrophe braham said theres no 
reason to think cloud seeding could do anything to ameliorate the 
dry conditions that we have 
even tom henderson president of atmospherics inc in fresno 
calif the nations largest cloudseeding company conceded that 
weather modification as a cureall for drought situations is 
probably not a very viable technology 
bruce boe director of the north dakota atmospheric resource 
board which operates a weather modification program in that state 
held out hope that something can be done but he noted in a 
drought the opportunities are less 
seeding might shorten the length of a drought a bit but you 
will not see a dramatic result from it in most cases he said 
poellot reported that cloudseeding experiments have increased 
rainfall by as much as 10 percent but he noted for cloud 
seeding to work it needs some clouds so if there are no clouds 
youre out of luck that same thought was echoed by the other 
meteorologists 
the atmosphere just does not have any clouds in it weve been 
totally cloud free braham said 
weve been in the field since june 1 but weve flown very 
litte added boe whose agency operates an airborne cloudseeding 
program covering 66 million acres of western north dakota 
north dakota spends about 15 million per twoyear budget cycle 
on weather modification half from the state and half from a tax 
voted by residents of the counties affected 
henderson said that the cost of running a commercial fourmonth 
summertime cloudseeding program covering 3000 to 5000 acres in 
the midwest would typically run from 100000 to 125000 
making it rain has obsessed mankind for thousands of years and 
many hoped for a breakthrough a few decades ago when the first 
successes were achieved 
in 1946 vincent j schaefer accomplished the goal although he 
actually made it snow rather than rain 
through the centuries all sorts of less scientific methods had 
been attempted including animal sacrifice setting out pots of 
water calling on various gods clashing armor ringing church 
bells and even firing artillery into the sky 
schaefer in a famous nov 13 1946 experiment near 
schenectady ny sprinkled three pounds of ground dry ice into a 
cloud and within minutes snowflakes formed and a hole appeared in 
the cloud 
a lot of experimentation was done in the 1970s sponsored by 
state and federal governments but there has been relatively little 
scientific work on changing the weather in the 1980s 
that is partly because of reductions in money available for the 
work and partly because the scientists succeeded in defining the 
situations where rainfall increases looked feasible and those where 
it didnt look so feasible and the window of opportunity kept 
getting smaller and smaller braham said 
boe stressed that any cloudseeding program has to be a 
continuing one 
if youre going to start a weather modification program to 
deal with drought and when its over you bag the program youre 
taking the wrong tack he said longterm cloud seeding adds to 
the deep ground moisture and can help resist the damage of 
droughts

newly elected prime minsiter do muoi 
said today that hanoi is trying to end its international isolation 
by seeking to end its 9yearold military occupation of cambodia 
the official voice of vietnam radio quoted do muoi as saying 
vietnam may withdraw all of its troops from cambodia before 1990 
according to the broadcast do muoi said that to widen 
cooperation first of all it is necessary to maintain peace and 
security vietnam is striving to solve the cambodian issue 
do muoi 71 was elected on wednesday 
many noncommunist western and asian countries have denied 
economic aid to vietnam and otherwise isolated the communist nation 
to protest its late 1978 invasion and continuing occupation of 
cambodia 
vietnam has said it will remove all its estimated 120000 troops 
by 1990 and plans a pullout of about 50000 troops this year 
todays announcement was the first time a vietnamese leader said 
the withdrawal could be completed before that date 
hanoibased diplomats say that under a new pragmatic leadership 
that has given top priority to economic development vietnam has 
made a series of diplomatic initiatives on cambodia which not long 
ago was a nonnegotiable issue 
vietnam recently decided to send foreign minister nguyen co 
thach to attend unprecedented peace talks involving cambodian 
guerrilla factions next month in indonesia 
in a speech wednesday do muoi pledged to continue vietnams 
westernstyle economic reforms to revive an economy communist 
authorities said they weakened through indecisiveness and poor 
planning 
an official radio hanoi report seen in bangkok today quoted do 
muoi as telling the national assembly he will thoroughly grasp 
the renovative spirit of resolutions adopted at a december 1986 
party congress 
the resolutions liberalized vietnams economy by allowing a 
measure of free enterprise and opening up the country to foreign 
investment 
in a report to the assembly wednesday vo van kiet the acting 
premier said people were deeply worried about rampant 
inflation chaos in the distribution of goods and acute food 
shortages in the northern provinces 
vietnamese sources had said do muoi was the most likely choice 
as premier because he is a disciplinarian who can crack down on the 
corruption and inefficiency among cadres involved in implementing 
economic reforms 
some diplomats say the choice of do muoi could slow down the 
reform momentum sending a wrong signal to the average vietnamese 
who preferred kiet 66 a pioneer of economic reform 
kiet was first vice premier before becoming acting premier after 
pham hungs death the radio report did not say whether he would 
return to the old post 
do muoi is the thirdranking member of the politburo the top 
policymaking body he gave up the vice premiership last year after 
becoming the no 2 man in the party secretariat where he is said 
to have directed a purge of inept and corrupt elements in the 
18millionmember party 
he joined the communist party in 1939 and held key party and 
government posts during the struggle against the french 
colonialists the americans and south vietnam

new members of the policymaking central committee 
may be chosen at a national party conference next week but most of 
the sessions will be closed to the public a soviet official 
indicated today 
yuri a sklyarov of the communist party central committees 
propaganda department told a news conference that the 5000 
delegates to next weeks conference could have the right to elect 
new members to the 300plus central committee 
the new members could replace the 60 to 70 members who have died 
or have become socalled dead souls by losing the positions 
that gave them the right to spots on the committee 
sklyarov refused to say definitely however whether new people 
would make it onto the central committee or other leading party 
organs 
he was similarly vague about many details of procedure and 
agenda for the conference scheduled to open tuesday it will be the 
first since 1941 
sklyarov confirmed a report in the government daily izvestia 
that only the opening and closing sessions of the conference would 
be broadcast live on national television with other coverage 
limited to summaries of conference speeches 
that is likely to disappoint the many reformers who have 
published demands in the staterun media for full television 
coverage 
yegor yakovlev editor of the reformist weekly moscow news said 
wednesday about 70 delegates were likely to take the floor during 
the conference which government spokesman gennady gerasimov has 
said will run from june 28 to july 1 
sklyarov refused to confirm that timetable saying only the 
conference could decide how long it would sit he also tried to 
suggest there was no fixed number of speakers saying the presidium 
would give the floor to speakers in the order they ask for it 
sklyarov said speakers would have the right to amend their 
remarks for the written record 
it is up to the delegate himself to decide what his remarks 
will look like sklyarov said thats his right 
sklyarov said the most prestigious workers of the various 
party organs will get together before the conference opens to 
decide who should sit on the agendasetting presidium 
the restricted coverage of the party conference is similar to 
the access at the previous party congress in 1986 as at that 
forum party leader mikhail s gorbachev will give an opening 
report followed by selected speakers 
gorbachevs speech is supposed to outline his further plans to 
reform the economy and open up the party and society 
there has been a growing feeling among moscow intellectuals in 
recent days that the party conference will not be a reformsetting 
gathering as was predicted several months ago but rather a dress 
rehearsal for the next regular party congress in 1991 
gorbachev had said in may he wanted conference delegates to be 
strong partisans of perestroika his term for the restructing of 
soviet society but public protests in various soviet cities over 
undemocratic delegate selection and the failure of some prominent 
reformers to be elected delegates indicate conservative party 
forces have put a brake on the conference as originally envisaged

school systems comprised of innercity 
neighborhoods and suburbs that bus students for racial balance are 
the most successful at maintaining integrated schools a study 
concludes 
the finding is one of several contained in a report released 
wednesday at the annual meeting of the national school boards 
association 
that was one of the more interesting findings given the 
fierce battling that goes on over desegregation said political 
scientist gary orfield of the university of chicago the 
perception is often that reassigning students to other 
neighborhoods encourages white flight 
but the places that have been most successful nashville las 
vegas nev most every big city in florida except miami have 
been those where the city and suburbs are in the same district and 
you can implement a districtwide desegregation plan orfield said 
researchers led by orfield and political scientist franklin 
monfort of the university of wisconsin analyzed data from the 60 
largest public school systems between 1967 and 1986 
they concluded the schools have become increasingly segregated 
over that period because of a dramatic rise in hispanic students 
and a steady erosion in white enrollment 
predictions about central city districts losing the majority 
of their white students came true orfield said wednesday but 
now not only are blacks still being segregated hispanics are 
being more segregated at an evenfaster rate 
however the segregation is not the result of whites leaving 
public schools so much as migration patterns and changes in the 
birth rates he added 
among the reports most significant findings 
total enrollment declined by 15 percent in the 60 districts to 
67 million over the 19year period white enrollment declined by 
16 percent while the number of black students increased by 5 
percent and hispanic students by 103 percent 
the 25 largest central city school districts now serve 28 
percent of all black students 30 percent of all hispanics but 
only 3 percent of white students 
what that means he said is that the school systems that 
are decisive to the future of large parts of our minority groups 
are almost irrelevant to the white population 
almost half of the largest public school districts are now in 
the suburbs and metropolitan counties alongside urban centers 
the researchers did not attempt to assess the consequences of 
segregation or to propose solutions 
but orfield said schools that serve black and hispanic 
populations exclusively serve a disproportionate number of poor 
kids they continue to do much worse than white schools in academic 
achievement graduation rates and almost any other measure of 
providing a successful education 
and the worst part he added is that almost nothing 
substantial is being done to change it

japanese prime minister noboru takeshita says his 
country is determined to play a more active global leadership role 
equal with its economic superpower status 
in his first visit to americas industrial heartland wednesday 
takeshita also defended his countrys burgeoning investments in the 
united states saying they have created jobs 
acknowledging that some americans view japans investments in 
the united states as a threat takeshita said they have created 
more than 200000 jobs and would help improve the us trade 
balance 
takeshita visited chicago one day after the close of the 
economic summit of the leaders of seven major industrialized 
countries in toronto canada 
the prime minister said he hoped his visit to the hub of 
americas heartland would contribute to broader and deeper 
japanus relations 
speaking at a dinner hosted by the japanamerica society of 
chicago takeshita quipped that he hoped a fireworks display 
scheduled afterward over lake michigan would shake the sky above 
and help bring some rain to the droughtstricken region 
takeshita echoed the same themes he sounded at the summit at 
which japan offered a plan for third world debt relief and signaled 
its willingness to accept the international leadership role that 
goes with its economic power 
takeshita who became prime minister in november said 
playing an active role commensurate with our national strength 
responds both to japans interests and to the expectations of the 
peoples of the world 
i have therefore set as the highest goal of my 
administration the building of a japan contributing more to the 
world he told about 1000 dinner guests at the fairmont hotel 
including gov james r thompson chicago mayor eugene sawyer and 
cardinal joseph bernardin 
takeshita outlined what he called japans international 
cooperation initiative under which japan would increase cultural 
exchanges take part in peacekeeping actions and offer debtrelief 
to developing countries 
takeshita said japans official development assistance 
announced at the toronto summit would total 50 billion for fiscal 
years 198892 more than double the sum for the previous five years 
by next year he predicted that japan would surpass the united 
states as the worlds largest development assistance donor 
the japanese government has recently drawn up a new fiveyear 
economic plan that is in harmony with the world economy by 
boosting domestic demand and opening up the japanese market to 
imports takeshita said 
he said the agreement announced this week to liberalize japanese 
imports of beef and citrus fruit should lead to a further expansion 
of agricultural trade between the united states and japan the 
worlds biggest purchaser of us farm products 
takeshita also said americans had no reason to be pessimistic 
about their countrys future 
no country can replace the united states in its central role 
as the leader of the west said takeshita whose speech in 
japanese was simultaneously translated into english through 
headphones 
a strong america is essential for japans future

fires that appeared set by arab arsonists lit 
up the night in rural areas and a widespread power outage darkened 
israeli cities and the occupied territories this morning officials 
said 
the blackout left major israeli cities and the occupied gaza 
strip and west bank without power for three hours authorities were 
investigating the outage but had ruled out sabotage 
in mostly arab east jerusalem palestinian high school students 
today stoned two israeli buses slightly injuring several 
passengers and smashing one front windshield israel radio 
reported the radio said arab schoolgirls also stoned israel 
vehicles on the areas main shopping thoroughfare 
the radio did not specify how many bus passengers were hurt and 
the police spokesman was not in his office 
also today the army said israeli troops arrested a 
knifewielding palestinian shepherd who allegedly tried to stab an 
israeli in the same west bank area where an israeli was bludgeoned 
to death monday 
an army helicopter chased the shepherd wednesday after he tried 
to stab an israeli official who told him to leave a restricted 
military zone near the communal farming settlement of shekef the 
army said 
on wednesday a palestinian was killed and two wounded in 
violence bringing to 211 the number of arab fatalities in the 
6month uprising against israels occupation of the west bank and 
gaza strip four israelis also have died 
leaders of the uprising issued one of their most militant 
directives wednesday urging arabs to form paramilitary strike 
forces to destroy israeli property and attack palestinians who 
collaborate with the israelis 
the authors of leaflet no 20 called for two general strikes 
including one on tuesday the 21st anniversary of the annexation of 
arab east jerusalem after its capture by israel in the 1967 middle 
east war 
at about 1115 am 415 am edt power suddenly went out in 
jerusalem tel aviv the west bank cities of nablus and bethlehem 
and the gaza strip 
we dont know what happened but were checking it police 
spokesman rafi levi told the associated press on an emergency 
telephone line during the outage 
a spokesman for the israel electrical corp avri ravid told 
israel radio that sabotage was ruled out ravid said officials were 
still investigating the cause 
 
palestinian leaders had designated wednesday arson day 
directing arabs to set fire to israeli farmland forests and 
factories to protest the 21yearold israeli occupation 
israeli officials who mobilized thousands of firefighters and 
volunteers to meet the threat said about 15 blazes were reported 
wednesday but the figures were still being compiled at least 10 
were blamed on arson 
overnight fires broke out in tel aviv and nearby petah tikva 
in tel aviv a blaze gutted a knitwear factory on the top floor 
of a threestory building said fire department spokesman eitan 
cohen 
he said the blaze was under investigation but the daily haaretz 
quoted police as saying it was arson 
israel army radio said another fire broke out at a factory that 
produces cooking oil in petah tikva it said police were 
investigating the cause 
police minister chaim barlev blamed some blazes on israeli 
children he said three 9yearold israelis were caught setting 
fires just for the fun of it now the arab children who do it 
some of their motives are the same and some are being sent 
sometimes for money 
so far this year about 35000 acres of forests and fields have 
been wiped out by fire about 10 times last years total 
police spokesman yehoshua goldapfel reported more than 330 cases 
of arson from january to june including about 130 fires linked to 
the arab uprising 
the number of fires set by palestinians has risen steadily from 
about 40 percent of the blazes in january to 80 percent in june he 
said 
destruction of trees is especially painful in israel where much 
effort has been put into turning arid lands into woods and farms 
many of israels trees have been donated by american jews

burning phosphorus from a derailed tanker 
spread a toxic cloud across five kentucky counties driving 
thousands of residents from their homes before it began dissipating

and the chemical leaked from one car the fire burned itself out 
shortly after dawn today 
its very very much dissipating state police trooper bryan 
pitney said today its not as dense as it was its not as 
irritable 
the federal aviation administration this morning lifted a 
restriction imposed overnight on all air travel at or below 2000 
feet in the area state officials temporarily closed some roads 
the only remaining fire this morning was a minor brush fire 
nearby officials said 
phosphorus fires cannot be extinguished with water and must burn 
themselves out said don armstrong spokesman for the state 
disaster and emergency services in frankfort 
bob l cart csx superintendent of operations for the chicago 
division said the railroad had been given permission to begin

on wednesday a palestinian was killed and two wounded in 
violence bringing to 211 the number of arab fatalities in the 
6month uprising against israels occupation of the west bank and 
gaza strip four israelis also have died 
leaders of the uprising issued one of their most militant 
directives wednesday urging arabs to form paramilitary strike 
forces to destroy israeli property and attack palestinians who 
collaborate with the israelis 
the authors of leaflet no 20 called for two general strikes 
including one on tuesday the 21st anniversary of the annexation of 
arab east jerusalem after its capture by israel in the 1967 middle 
east war

directing arabs to set fire to israeli farmland forests and 
factories to protest the 21yearold israeli occupation 
israeli officials who mobilized thousands of firefighters and 
volunteers to meet the threat said about 15 blazes were reported 
wednesday but the figures were still being compiled at least 10 
were blamed on arson 
overnight fires broke out in tel aviv and nearby petah tikva 
in tel aviv a blaze gutted a knitwear factory on the top floor 
of a threestory building said fire department spokesman eitan 
cohen 
he said the blaze was under investigation but the daily haaretz 
quoted police as saying it was arson 
israel army radio said another fire broke out at a factory that 
produces cooking oil in petah tikva it said police were 
investigating the cause 
police minister chaim barlev blamed some blazes on israeli 
children he said three 9yearold israelis were caught setting 
fires just for the fun of it now the arab children who do it 
some of their motives are the same and some are being sent 
sometimes for money 
so far this year about 35000 acres of forests and fields have 
been wiped out by fire about 10 times last years total 
police spokesman yehoshua goldapfel reported more than 330 cases 
of arson from january to june including about 130 fires linked to 
the arab uprising 
the number of fires set by palestinians has risen steadily from 
about 40 percent of the blazes in january to 80 percent in june he 
said 
destruction of trees is especially painful in israel where much 
effort has been put into turning arid lands into woods and farms 
many of israels trees have been donated by american jews

a third us company says it will 
begin human testing of a prototype aids vaccine designed to protect 
people not infected with the deadly virus 
chiron corp said wednesday that tests on humans will start in 
switzerland in the initial step in clinical studies that could last 
10 years 
the tests are being conducted by biocine co a joint venture of 
chiron and cibageigy corp a new york subsidiary of a swiss 
pharmaceuticals giant 
the first clinical trial will involve 20 to 25 healthy swiss men 
who do not carry the virus that causes acquired immune deficiency 
syndrome and aidsrelated complex biocine said it is now selecting 
the participants 
it is the first human testing of a prospective aids vaccine in 
europe and may expand to the united states within a year said 
ginger rosenberg a chiron spokeswoman 
two other companies in the united states oncogen in seattle 
and microgenesys of connecticut already have begun human trials 
on aids vaccines in the united states 
chiron said it has already conducted tests on chimps goats 
rabbits and guinea pigs 
but since animals do not get aids animal studies provide 
limited information about the ability of a vaccine to generate a 
protective immunity against the aids virus said dr dino dina 
director of chirons virology program much of what we nee to 
know about the vaccines effectiveness must await the results of 
our initial human studies 
typically it takes five to 10 years to test a prospective 
vaccine he said

israels major cities the occupied west bank 
and the gaza strip lost electrical power today for up to three 
hours but a utility spokesman ruled out sabotage 
at about 1115 am 415 am edt power went out in jerusalem 
tel aviv and as far south as the seaside resort of eilat on the 
egyptian border 
also affected were the occupied west bank cities of nablus 
ramallah and bethlehem and the occupied gaza strip 
the israel electrical corp was investigating the causes but 
company spokesman avri ravid told israel radio about four hours 
after the outage that officials had ruled out sabotage 
power was restored to most locations after an hour although tel 
aviv and some parts of the gaza strip remained without electricity 
for another two hours 
southern district police spokesman rafi levi initially told the 
associated press that police were investigating whether the outage 
was a case of sabotage 
but ravid later said officials had determined the outage was not 
caused deliberately although they were still were unsure about 
what caused the electrical failure 
underground leaders of the 6monthold palestinian uprising in 
a leaflet distributed wednesday called on palestinians to 
continue destroying the property of our fascist enemy 
the leaflet was one of the most militant directives issued 
urging arabs to form paramilitary strike forces to destroy 
israeli property and attack palestinians who collaborate with the 
israelis 
israeli army officials said they were affected by the power 
outage but that the electrical cut did not hamper security 
operations in the occupied territories 
radio broadcasts appeared unaffected by the outage as stations 
apparently switched to emergency power generators 
in tel aviv long lines formed at banks after computers went 
down and tellers had to conduct transactions manually outdoor 
cafes were packed as shoppers and store owners fled from hot 
shopping malls when air conditioning went out 
massive traffic jams were reported in jerusalem and tel aviv 
where police directed drivers by hand at major intersections

two years ago high water levels sent waves 
crashing over miles of great lakes shoreline chewing up beaches 
submerging marinas and causing millions of dollars in destruction 
today drought has helped lake water levels drop up to 3 feet 
since then good news for the suffering recreation industry and 
for home owners who feared their property was doomed 
the drought is having a major effect on lake levels said 
frank quinn head of lake hydrology at the great lakes 
environmental research laboratory in ann arbor mich 
if the trend continues the lakes will drop below their monthly 
average levels for the first time in 10 to 15 years 
declining water levels have decreased the threat of erosion and 
landslides and improved conditions for sunbathers and recreational 
boaters said quinn whose lab is operated by the national oceanic 
and atmospheric administration 
our docks are 4 or 5 feet above water level said patty 
demink who works at south haven municipal marina when i first 
started coming here two years ago if it rained the water would 
go over the docks 
fred harrington 71 said that in 1986 he and his wife feared 
their dream house which sits 280 feet above lake michigan in 
south haven might slip into the lake 
about 50 feet of our frontage was destroyed in two 
landslides harrington said now we feel more confident that 
well be able to stay here longer 
the great lakes have dropped 2 feet to 3 feet since their 
recordhighs in 1986 when waves left lakefront homes teetering on 
scoopedout bluffs on june 17 lake michigan was 31 inches lower 
than it was in october 1986 quinn said 
in the last month lakes michigan and huron dropped 2 inches 
erie dropped 3 inches superior stayed the same and ontario went up 
an inch he said 
lakes michigan and erie peaked in the first half of april and 
have been steady or falling since quinn said 
in an average year the lakes do not peak until july or august 
but hot dry weather has caused much water to evaporate quinn said 
even if the drought ends most of the moisture from muchneeded 
rain would be absorbed by the parched soil and little would run 
into the great lakes 
the army corps of engineers has considered diverting some water 
from lake michigan to the illinois and mississippi rivers which 
have been drying up in the drought 
changing the diversions would only change the lake levels by a 
matter of a couple of inches quinn said 
a 1929 us supreme court ruling in a lawsuit however set 
limits on how much water could be diverted from the lake into the 
river system the lawsuit was brought against illinois by other 
great lakes states and canada said ross fredenburg a spokesman 
for the north central division of the corps of engineers 
since then the supreme court must be petitioned to change the 
limit the latest came in 1980 when the court said 3200 cubic feet 
per second could be diverted 
william wente executive director of wilmette harbor north of 
chicago said although he is glad the water has dropped from levels 
that swamped his marina two years ago the shrinking trend has 
drawbacks 
were a good 3 or 4 inches from where we were a month ago 
he said weve had to do a lot more dredging here in the harbor 
entrance and its costing us more 
if it continues at this rate its going to be trouble in a 
couple of years he said

pravda said today that soldiers have been deployed 
in several cities of the disputed region of nagornokarabakh the 
site of massive ethnic protests 
the communist party newspaper warned that those responsible for 
the ethnic unrest in the southern republics of armenia and 
azerbaijan eventually would be held responsible for their actions 
in the past days the situation in nagornokarabakh has become 
even more tense pravda said in a report from stepanakert the 
main city of the disputed region 
nagornokarabakh has belonged to azerbaijan since 1923 but 
armenians consider it part of their ancestral homeland and are 
demanding that it be incorporated into armenia the majority of its 
160000 residents are armenian 
the migration of armenian families to armenia and azerbaijanis 
from armenia to azerbaijan is continuing in a number of cities 
including those of nagornokarabakh soldiers have been brought 
in pravda said 
a general strike and daily meetings and demonstrations are 
continuing in nagornokarabakh pravda said 
it did not say where the soldiers have been deployed but moscow 
dissidents showed film monday of soldiers protecting the armenian 
section of baku the capital of azerbaijan 
reports said eight armenians and eight azerbaijanis were injured 
last week in fights in two armenian villages masis and sayat nova 
those who put the long friendship of the two nations in 
danger sooner or later must be held accountable pravda said 
only quiet restraint a clear understanding of the current 
situation can prevent extremely undesirable consequences it said 
residents of nagornokarabakh have been agitating since february 
to have their territory annexed to armenia 
the governments of nagornokarabakh and armenia have backed the 
demand but azerbaijan has refused to go along national officials 
have offered an economic and social development plan 
officials say 32 people six azerbaijanis and 26 armenians were 
killed in rioting in the azerbaijani city of sumgait at the end of 
february and beginning of march 
pravda said a general strike that began may 23 in stepanakert 
has led to despair among some residents but they cannot back down 
many understand the senselessness and absurdity of their 
method of selfexhaustion but there is nothing they can do the 
affair has gone too far 
on wednesday a resident of stepanakert said some residents had 
been persuaded to return to work by their legislatures request to 
central authorities to approve the annexation request 
the resident said about half of the estimated 30000 strikers 
remained off their jobs 
soviet foreign ministry spokesman gennady i gerasimov said 
wednesday that the annexation request would be taken up by the 
presidium of the national supreme soviet the soviet unions 
highest legislative body but that it probably would not be 
discussed in the near future

attorneys for three men convicted of 
smuggling a bomb into the united states say they wont appeal the 
prison terms of up to 16 years given to their clients 
the government alleged the three men who are natives of lebanon 
and hold canadian citizenship are members of a syrian political 
group responsible for several acts of terrorism 
but us district judge albert coffrin told the men wednesday it 
didnt matter to him whether they belonged to an extremist 
political party his concern was that the explosive device they had 
been carrying could have caused serious damage 
the lethal potential however is clear coffrin said any 
victim of a bombing is an innocent victim 
defendant georges younan and codefendant walid kabbani each 
received a 16year sentence in federal prison walid mourad who 
pleaded guilty one day before the others went to trial was 
sentenced to eight years in prison 
younan had faced the stiffest penalty up to 35 years in prison 
mourad had faced 10 years in prison and kabbani 30 years and six 
months 
younan and kabbani pleaded innocent but never testified at their 
trial none of the three addressed coffrin during the sentencing 
hearing instead they chose to have their attorneys speak for them 
he says im not a terrorist kabbanis attorney mark 
keller said he simply says i know what i am he asked me 
not to beg on his behalf not to grovel on his behalf 
the defense attorneys claimed victory with the sentences saying 
the government had proposed a plea bargain in which 20year prison 
terms were offered in exchange for a guilty plea and cooperation 
with the government 
the three were arrested last october and charged with smuggling 
a homemade bomb into the united states through richford a small 
town on the vermontcanadian border the us government claimed 
the three were members of a terrorist group responsible for the 
1982 assassination of a lebanese presidentelect bashir gemayel 
their attorneys described them as mere bunglers as opposed to 
professional terrorists 
us attorney george terwilliger iii and the fbi however said 
the three men are members of the syrian social nationalist party 
the group was founded in the fascist era of the 1930s and was 
devoted to the formation of greater syria that encompassed 
several middle east nations 
younans cousin says younan is a member of the party but denied 
that it was a terrorist group attorneys for kabbani and mourad 
denied their clients were members at all 
terwilliger said he felt the sentence was appropriate its 
one of a very few incidents involving a person associated with 
middle eastern terrorist organization actually being in possession 
of explosives on us soil he said

a justice department spokesman says a bicycle 
messenger wearing a tshirt that proclaimed meese is a pig was 
not admitted to its headquarters because he was inappropriately 
attired 
just as we would not permit somebody to come strolling in here 
with a bathing suit for example i think its reasonable to have 
some kind of standard spokesman patrick s korten said wednesday 
he said the messenger christopher stalvey was 
inappropriately attired 
stalvey who said the incident occurred june 10 visited the 
american civil liberties union this week to tell legal director 
arthur b spitzer about the encounter 
we are prepared to bring suit if they say this is their 
policy spitzer said it seems like a perfectly clear case of 
discrimination based on the content of the tshirt 
korten spokesman for attorney general edwin meese iii said 
this is an interim policy until a firm determination can be made 
on how such matters ought to be handled 
korten obviously doesnt understand what the first amendment 
is all about said spitzer if they had a rule that said no 
tshirts that might be an acceptable rule but apparently they 
have a rule that says no tshirts that insult ed meese presumably 
this guy would have been allowed in if he was wearing a tshirt 
that said reaganbush 84

a vintage us transport plane left frankfurt for 
west berlin today to mark the 40th anniversary of the berlin 
airlift a massive mission to feed and clothe millions of berliners 
sealed off from the rest of the world by russian troops 
the c47 aircraft took off from frankfurt and landed at 
templehof airport in west berlin at 414 pm at 1014 am edt 
its a short flight between the two cities but for the 2 
million berliners blockaded by the soviets at the end of world war 
ii the 250mile jaunt meant the difference between life and death 
during the airlifts 15 months us and british cargo planes 
ferried more than 18 million tons of food coal and other vital 
supplies to the alliedcontrolled sectors of berlin an enclave 
deep inside what was then sovietheld territory and is now 
communist east germany 
among the passengers aboard the c47 flying to west berlin today 
were the us british and french ambassadors to west germany 
earlier the ambassadors attended the opening of an airlift 
exhibit in bonn and ceremonies at the us rhine main air base near 
frankfurt 
most of the airlift flights originated at rhine main 
taking part were us ambassador richard r burt british 
ambassador sir christopher mallaby french ambassador serge 
boidevaix west german defense minister rupert scholz and west 
berlin mayor eberhard diepgen 
the berlin airlift began june 26 1948 and ended sept 30 1949 
it was masterminded by us army gen lucius d clay the military 
governor of the american zone of conquered germany following world 
war ii 
bitter disputes between the kremlin and the three other 
victorious world war ii allies led to the soviets move to cut 
berlin off from the west 
soviet dictator joseph stalin was staunchly against creation of 
a unified german state in the three western occupation zones and 
when the western allies backed a currency reform to speed up 
economic recovery of wartorn germany moscow imposed the blockade 
just four days after the money reform on june 20 the soviets 
blocked all roads waterways and railway lines leading to west 
berlin 110 miles deep in sovietoccupied territory 
in response clay ordered all cargo planes available to deliver 
provisions to keep the hope for democracy in west berlin alive 
the continuous string of small c47 c54 and other cargo planes 
ferried about 120 tons of supplies to west berlin daily at the 
start 
by april 1949 the raisin bombers socalled because the 
crews often brought along candy and raisins for berlins hungry 
children were bringing in about 13000 tons of supplies a day 
after the soviets called off the blockade on may 12 1949 the 
western allies continued the flights to the end of september until 
normal land waterway and rail traffic had resumed 
more than 277000 flights were conducted during the airlift 
costing 200 million

a soviet spy ring exposed by canadian authorities 
tried to infiltrate a usowned military contractor that has 
access to highly classified american naval technology news reports 
said 
the canadian broadcasting corp reported late wednesday that the 
ring was after sophisticated warship electronics slated for a new 
generation of canadian naval frigates it said the sonar radar and 
communications equipment is made by paramax electronics of 
montreal a subsidiary of unisys corp of detroit 
the new york times today quoted unidentified canadian officials 
as saying paramax had access to classified technology including 
equipment that controls weapons systems aboard us navy ships 
 
the canadian security intelligence service which monitored the 
activities of the eight soviet diplomats and officials expelled 
last week and nine others barred from reentering canada would not 
confirm the link with paramax 
but spokesman jerry cummings told the associated press today 
it wasnt one single operation some of these operations have 
been over four or five years 
at paramax offices in montreal the company said no one was 
available to comment on the incident 
foreign minister joe clark told parliament wednesday that 
canadian authorities had prevented any severe security breach 
the soviet government expelled two canadian diplomats in 
retaliation wednesday and said three others currently out of the 
country would not be allowed back 
 
spokesman viatcheslav bogdanov of the soviet embassy in ottawa 
termed the expulsions from canada a provocation 
these people were not doing anything wrong he said 
clark and other government officials declined to provide details 
of the soviets activities though clark said they included 
attempts to infiltrate national security intelligence agencies 
the cbc said one of the soviets expelled was a naval attache at 
the soviet embassy in ottawa and was caught redhanded in a 
sting operation 
it connected his expulsion to the arrest earlier this month of a 
canadian of hungarian descent stephen ratkai who was charged with 
attempting to obtain classified us military documents from the 
argentia us naval base in newfoundland the base monitors soviet 
submarine movements in the atlantic 
the cbc also said parts for the new canadian frigates were once 
shipped on a soviet freighter and soviet agents took the 
opportunity to examine them 
clark announced that a soviet defector yuri smurov had 
provided useful information in connection with the expulsions 
and has asked to stay in canada with his family 
the cbc said smurov a translator at the international civil 
aviation organization in montreal was a canadian double agent who 
identified most of the soviet intelligence agents 
in december 1987 paramax was awarded the first part of a 950 
million contract to build the combat systems for six new canadian 
frigates the company which was established in 1983 had already 
been working on the weapons systems and electronics for six other 
canadian frigates 
at the time minister of national defense perrin beatty termed 
the order the first concrete example of the implementation of 
canadas ambitious plans to improve its military 
the report that the soviets were seeking information on the 
canadian frigates appears significant because nato allies have 
recently moved to standardize much of their frigatebuilding 
technology 
paramax is a subsidiary of unisys which was formed in 1986 when 
burroughs copr took over sperry corp in a 48 billion deal 
unisys is a leading defense contractor in the united states in 
june datamation magazine ranked it the third biggest computer 
company nationwide with revenues in that area of more than 85 
billion

jesse jackson said today he has privately 
decided whether he would accept the vice presidential nomination 
but has not shared that decision with likely democratic nominee 
michael dukakis 
privately yes jackson said when asked the question by a 
reporter after a meeting with his state campaign chairmen from 
around the country however he reiterated the campaigns public 
position that he has earned serious consideration to be 
dukakis running mate 
before departing on a trip to thank his supporters in puerto 
rico jackson said hes certain that dukakis at some point will 
announce the criteria he is using to pick a running mate 
asked to assess whether hes been given fair treatment by the 
democrats in convention preparations he said i feel positive 
about it i feel hopeful about it 
he said the process is ongoing adding the process is one 
thing the conclusionis another 
the director of jacksons convention operation ron brown said 
wednesday the jackson forces want to see some changes in party 
rules but do not anticipate trying to challenge any rules in 
atlanta next month because their concerns are being met through 
accommodations 
acknowledging some sticking points remain on foreign policy 
platform issues brown nonetheless expressed optimism a consensus 
could be reached with apparent presidential nominee michael dukakis 
brown steered away from any hint of convention turmoil saying 
negotiations with dukakis representatives have shown a real 
willingness and desire to iron out differences in the two camps 
he said the campaign wanted to make it known that we are going 
with a positive constructive unifying attitude to make it known 
that we want the party and the ticket to be stronger when it leaves 
atlanta than when it goes in 
speculation about how much of a fuss jackson would make at the 
convention over rules and platform issues has followed the 
committee process leading to this weekends drafting of the 
platform in denver and the rules committee meeting in washington 
jackson has several suggestions for rules changes he wants the 
convention itself to address 
asked if he would try to change any rules for purposes of this 
summers convention brown indicated that probably would not be the 
case as long as dukakis keeps working on shifting delegates to 
jackson in the states where jackson considers the process unfair 
the proposals he said are prospective in nature adding 
as far as 1988 we are seeking accommodations and we feel 
positive about the way those discussions are going 
jackson wants to see rules changes that would tie the popular 
vote more closely to the candidates delegate counts in states 
where it is not directly proportionate he also wants to make the 
socalled super delegates who are free to vote as they like 
more representative of the popular vote in their states 
later today jackson was leaving for a threeday trip to puerto 
rico where he won a nonbinding beauty contest primary but 
voting for delegate slates there awarded all 57 to dukakis 
while jackson may be hoping to persuade some of the delegates to 
support him at the national convention his local backers say he is 
mainly interested in underlining the role of puerto ricans in his 
rainbow coalition 
puerto rico gov rafael hernandez colon endorsed dukakis and 
went to new york to campaign for him angering some puerto rican 
politicians on the mainland as well as at home 
hernandez colon who recently met with puerto rican political 
leaders in new york to patch up any differences planned to meet 
with jackson 
the islands 32 million people are us citizens but do not 
vote in general elections

scientists campaigning against nuclear weapons say 
new calculations confirm that about 23 tons of plutonium produced 
in british civil nuclear reactors is missing 
but authorities say the scientists have misunderstood the 
problem and gotten their figures wrong 
in a letter published today in nature a science weekly an 
american and three british scientists say their 1985 claim of a 
shortfall is borne out by more detailed figures which the 
government began publishing last year 
they say they dont know where the missing plutonium has gone 
but speculate that it went to nuclear weapons programs in britain 
or the united states or both 
the letter to nature is signed by physicists keith barnham of 
the imperial college london david hart of the pressure group 
scientists against nuclear arms jenny nelson of bristol 
university and rob stevens of unicam corp aptox calif 
the problem centers on a 68ton gap between government civil 
stockpiles and the amount the scientists calculate actually were 
produced 
the scientists said they have calculated that four tons went to 
the united states in exchange for enriched uranium under an 
agreement that lasted until 1971 
about half a ton was lost in reprocessing leaving 23 tons 
unaccounted for they wrote 
they said their 1985 calculations could not be confirmed because 
the government then was not disclosing figures 
but when the government began publishing figures for each of its 
nine reactors these coincided with the physicists earlier 
calculations proving their original model was correct they wrote 
even so the government figures are rounded out to the nearest 
110 pounds of plutonium per reactor which taken together would be 
enough to arm 100 warheads a year barnham said in an interview 
diane monk a spokeswoman for the governments central 
electricity generating board said the scientists figures are 
inaccurate because large numbers are involved and because they 
would appear to lack basic understanding of the processes 
involved

a nationwide survey of 1400 hospital executives 
shows that 48 percent of them think reduced medicare reimbursements 
may force their hospitals to close in the next five years 
small rural and governmentowned hospitals in arkansas 
louisiana oklahoma and texas are most vulnerable according to the 
survey conducted and paid for by the bostonbased touche ross 
accounting and management consulting firm 
suburban hospitals and hospitals owned by religious 
organizations also may be much more likely to close than in 
previous years the survey showed 
hospitals in new england showed the greatest increase in the 
likelihood of closure according to the study titled us 
hospitals the future of health care 
in 1986 hospital executives estimated that 21 percent of their 
facilities might close in the recent survey the chance for 
closure jumped to 46 percent of local hospitals 
the fact that so many hospitals anticipated failure is even 
more dramatic when one realizes that 150 hospitals have already 
closed in the last two years said raymond cisneros national 
director of health services for touche ross 
if the survey predictions are accurate 680 hospitals will close 
in the next five years he said 
cisneros said the main reason for what the survey called 
american hospitals increased vulnerability to failure is the 
decrease in revenues under the medicare prospective payment system 
a program created in 1983 to standardize the amounts medicare 
reimburses hospitals for inpatient care 
almost 70 percent of the hospital executives surveyed said 
hospital incomes have dropped since the programs inception 
in contrast to small rural and suburban hospitals innercity 
hospitals and other urban hospitals show no indication of a greater 
potential for closure since a 1986 survey cisneros said hospitals 
with the least chance of closure are located in the midatlantic 
states and on the west coast 
other findings of the survey 
occupancy rates are at an alltime low fortysix percent of 
the hospitals surveyed reported average occupancy of less than 50 
percent 
the quality of care was perceived as declining in 1986 55 
percent of hospitals ranked the health care available in their 
regions as excellent but in 1988 that number dropped to 44 percent 
there are signs of increasing limitations on healthcare 
delivery threefourths of the hospital officials questioned 
believe health care given patients should be curtailed when the 
cost of providing that care becomes excessive 
questionnaires were sent to hospital executives at all 5678 
acutecare hospitals in the country

a judge today granted a mistrial in a 
lawsuit pitting actor paul newman against a delicatessen owner 
after jurors said they could not deliberate impartially after 
getting a look at unauthorized evidence 
superior court judge howard zoarski declared the mistrial after 
jurors sent a note out of the jury room that they couldnt ignore 
depositions that were never entered into evidence but were 
inadvertently turned over to them before deliberations began two 
days ago 
the judges ruling reversed one he made earlier in the day when 
he instructed jurors to disregard copies of depositions from 
westport deli owner julius gold and others involved in the case 
gold had alleged during the threeweek breachofcontract trial 
that an attorney for newman promised him 8 percent of the stock 
from newmans food company in return for helping newmans own inc 
the jury which had deliberated for eight hours over two days 
was sent home wednesday after its foreman told the court that it 
had received depositions from gold and some defendants and wanted 
to see newmans 
w patrick ryan newmans attorney said wednesday it appeared 
the clerk who took the exhibits into the jury room inadvertently 
also took the depositions 
author ae hotchner newmans longtime friend who is also being 
sued said alice in wonderland falling down the rabbit hole had 
a more sane time of it than i did falling in this judicial hole 
gold filed suit against newman another westport resident his 
two food companies newmans own inc and salad king inc 
hotchner and kalman 
gold claimed that he helped develop and market newmans own 
salad dressing and was promised the stock gold said he contributed 
30 months effort to newmans company and believed that his work led 
to its success 
the defendants have denied all of the allegations 
newmans own whose products include spaghetti sauce lemonade 
and popcorn has donated 15 million to charity since 1982 
newman said he once considered giving a gift of stock to four 
people who contributed to the food venture but gold was not among 
them he also said he decided not to give away any stock after his 
lawyer advised him against it

a death row inmate who faced execution 
saturday won a 30day stay on the same day that the supreme court 
upheld the states death penalty law 
convicted killer fletcher mann got the stay wednesday from a 
federal judge in dallas because new attorneys in his case asked for 
more time 
also wednesday the high court announced its longanticipated 
decision that it had voted 63 to uphold the conviction and death 
sentence of donald gene franklin of san antonio 
attorneys for franklin had contended jurors were not allowed to 
consider any mitigating circumstances in sentencing franklin for 
the 1975 abductionslaying of nurse peggy moran 
since the high court agreed to hear the case late last year 
only one inmate robert streetman was put to death dozens of 
prisoners used the pending case to obtain stays of execution 
after hearing of the high court decision wednesday death row 
inmates were predictably glum 
mann 27 who had not yet heard of his stay was philosophical 
if its going to happen its going to happen he said of the 
possibility of his death 
many inmates believed the franklin case the most serious 
challenge to the texas death penalty law in several years would 
result in a ruling favorable to them and commutations of their 
sentences to life 
i feel like an idiot having put my hopes in the court 
inmate jim vanderbilt said this is a bitter disappointment its 
not easy seeing your friends hauled off to be killed 
im afraid theyll try to get as many as they can before the 
next issue comes up said james beathard another death row 
resident 
franklin has turned down interviews since the ruling 
his attorney mark stevens said he likely would seek a 
rehearing for franklin but that the high court rarely granted such 
motions 
stevens said he doubted the pace of executions would quicken and 
speculated the court would analyze capital cases on a casebycase 
basis 
its pretty nice when the supreme court of the united states 
says youre right said bob walt an assistant attorney general 
who handles death row cases the plurality opinion is very close 
to what we said in our brief 
walt said it is likely franklin would be rescheduled for 
execution and the supreme court would vacate stays issued to other 
texas inmates who cited the franklin case 
texas which uses lethal injections has executed 27 convicted 
killers more than any other state since the supreme court allowed 
the death penalty to resume in 1976

anatoly n rybakov author of children of the 
arbat is in the front rank of those struggling to reform the 
soviet system a system which sent him to siberia in the 1930s and 
blocked publication of his novel for 21 years his book finally 
published in russian last year has recently appeared in english 
and his been critically acclaimed 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
anatoly naumovich rybakov still 
energetic at 77 jumped up and pulled a bundle of papers from one 
of the shelves that line the study of his cottage in the forested 
writers colony outside moscow 
carefully lovingly the novelist laid the bundle on the desk 
next to the window untied the string and pulled out two covers of 
the largest soviet literary magazine novy mir one from 1966 and 
the other from 1978 
in the soft light filtered through the trees rybakov held up 
first one and then the other of the blue sheets of stiff paper 
tracing with his gnarled finger the underlined announcement that 
the journal would soon publish children of the arbat his novel 
of the great terror waged by dictator josef v stalin in the 1930s 
both times in 1966 and 1978 publication was blocked by the men 
in the kremlin men who rose to power under stalin 
rybakovs patience paid off 
more than 21 years after it was written children of the 
arbat was published last year in the literary journal druzhba 
narodov friendship of peoples as part of mikhail s gorbachevs 
campaign to reform the tyrannical system created by stalin 
the novel has since appeared in hardback editions and was 
published in english in the united states last month by little 
brown amp co 
the book probes more deeply than any other yet published in the 
soviet union into stalins mind and methods the pettiness and 
arbitrariness that guided his followers the innocence of his 
victims and the terror he created 
it tells the story of sasha pankratov a young man of 23 who 
like rybakov was sentenced without trial for a crime he never 
committed and sent to siberia for three years of cold and lonely 
exile 
rybakov grew up in the apartment building inhabited by most of 
the books characters no 51 arbat street an old shopping street 
in downtown moscow that was at once popular among the communist 
party elite and among fashionable young people 
rybakov is working on the sequel 1935 and other years 
which will continue the story and like children of the arbat 
will give intimate portraits of stalin and his lieutenants and 
describe how he terrorized his deputies and the country 
the entire nation lived in fear said rybakov his craggy 
features grim beneath a balding pate and gray hair only one 
person thought for himself everyone else abandoned free thought 
gorbachev and his supporters have concluded that a nation based 
on such a system cannot survive in the technological age 
during the years rybakov waited for his blockbuster to appear in 
print he lived and worked at his peaceful dacha or cottage at 
peredelkino the wooded village where the nobel prizewinning poet 
and novelist boris pasternak wrote and is buried rybakov earned a 
comfortable living by writing 11 other novels as well as 
screenplays for television and movies 
he resisted the temptation to publish his works abroad as 
pasternak aleksandr solzhenitsyn and others had done pasternak 
was ostracized his works banned until recently and solzhenitsyn 
was exiled to the west 
i wanted to publish it in this country said rybakov i 
wanted to change my country that is why i have been so patient 
hardback and paperbound editions of the book are expected to 
reach 35 million copies he said a phenomenal circulation in the 
soviet union where a run of 100000 is considered generous for 
works of fiction 
the book disappears from stores before it reaches the shelves 
the only places it can be found in moscow are in hotel shops open 
only to foreigners and at a special store on kropotkin street that 
accepts no rubles only western currency on the black market it 
sells for 30 rubles 5140 more than 10 times its retail price 
inside the kropotkin store a saleswoman told an american 
visitor im sorry we dont have children of the arbat it 
hasnt come in yet 
then she lowered her voice ill get you a copy but just 
one she disappeared returning a few minutes later with the 
volume 
the written word has played a huge role in russia since the 19th 
century when works by writers such as pushkin and tolstoy were a 
moral and spiritual counterbalance to the authoritarian rule of the 
czars the influence of writers in the soviet union is immensely 
greater than that of any american author in the united states 
i dont think that fiction is as important in the united 
states in shaping the image of a country in the minds of the 
people said rybakov just back from a monthlong trip to 
america his third visit in as many years 
in reforming the soviet system said rybakov the first step 
is to change the psychology of the people perestroika 
restructuring started in literature films the mass media the 
fields that shape peoples spiritual lives and thinking 
we need to reshape peoples minds and that will inevitably 
lead us to economic freedom said rybakov 
children of the arbat deals largely with the purges within 
the communist party and only mentions in passing a far bloodier 
episode the 192932 collectivization of agriculture which 
caused a famine and according to estimates by western scholars 
claimed 8 million lives 
rybakov said he will explore this in greater depth in his next 
novel 
my figures are even higher he said 
although food shortages persist six decades later soviet 
authors have only tentatively touched on the collectivization 
issue any detailed discussion might lead to calls to return the 
land to private farmers a step reformers in china have taken 
rybakov lets a grin crease his leathery face i am no expert 
on decollectivization but we need greater freedom in the village 
the smile gives way again to a look of grim determination who 
will take land and cultivate it if he fears that someone will take 
it away from him

democrat michael dukakis said today his administration had been 
entirely open about a prison controversy under investigation by the 
fbi jesse jackson said he has decided whether he wants to be 
dukakis running mate but would not divulge his decision unless 
offered the job 
dukakis toured a day care facility at a private business as the 
prison probe erupted the fbi noting dukakis status as the 
certain democratic presidential nominee took the unusual step of 
saying the governor himself was not the subject of an 
investigation 
the fbi said it is looking into a dukakis administration 
multimillion dollar proposal to purchase land for a prison in new 
braintree in central massachusetts a plan vigorously opposed by 
the community 
the process was as open as it could possibly be we have 
very tough procedures for the acquisition of property dukakis 
told reporters today 
jackson meanwhile was besieged with questions about the vice 
presidential nomination had he decided in his own mind whether he 
would accept if offered privately yes jackson said but then 
he cut off reporters 
republican george bush had a series of private meetings 
scheduled today breakfast with former un ambassador jeane 
kirkpatrick an afternoon session with president reagan and 
agriculture secretary richard lyng and evening meetings with 
australian prime minister bob hawke 
kirkpatrick has been mentioned as a longshot vice presidential 
prospect on a bush ticket some observers believe a woman on the 
ticket might boost bushs support among female voters a number of 
polls have suggested that women are far more likely to back 
dukakis the allbutcertain democratic nominee than bush his 
likely opponent but the vice president dismissed such surveys 
what you do is spell out your positions on the issues and the 
gender gap goes away and you win the election bush told local 
reporters wednesday on a trip to louisville ky 
on wednesday dukakis told reporters in boston that the process 
of picking a running mate had just begun 
however campaign sources indicated the pace was picking up as 
several vice presidential prospects including florida sen bob 
graham ohio sen john glenn and georgia sen sam nunn were 
invited to submit background and financial information to the 
dukakis campaign for scrutiny 
one lawmaker however said he wants to be crossed off the list 
of contenders new jersey sen bill bradley said through a 
spokesman that he had told the dukakis campaign he wasnt 
interested 
hes absolutely unambiguous about this said bradley 
spokesman nick donatiello 
pressed about jackson dukakis replied that the secondplace 
finisher in the primary races was under very serious 
consideration 
however dukakis said it helps for a vice presidential 
contender to have held public office jackson never has 
the two met tuesday in california after weeks of signals from 
jackson that he should be offered a spot on the ticket jackson 
said the two talked about the selection of a running mate but 
refused to elaborate 
ron brown the head of jacksons convention team said jackson 
did not directly ask for a place on the ticket 
dukakis who has enough delegates for a firstballot victory at 
next months democratic national convention in atlanta betrayed a 
flash of impatience when asked about jacksons refusal to concede 
the nomination 
its over the nomineetobe said shortly 
dukakis on wednesday won the backing of biden who dropped out 
of the race last september amid allegations of plagiarism and 
exaggerating his academic record 
one of the most damaging stories to surface at that time was 
bidens liberal borrowing without credit from a speech by british 
politician neil kinnock 
after biden bowed out dukakis top aide john sasso admitted 
that he distributed the attack video featuring the biden and 
kinnock speeches that triggered the stories 
the dukakis campaign had initially denied any role in the 
incident and when sasso told dukakis what he had done the 
candidate wavered before finally accepting his aides resignation 
however biden said later he blamed only himself 
the delaware senators expression of support for dukakis nine 
months after the collapse of his candidacy came in a telephone 
call from bidens home his office in washington said biden is 
recuperating from surgery last month to repair an aneurysm near his 
brain 
dukakis spokesman mark gearan welcomed the endorsement praising 
biden as a leader and a fighter who can be a tremendous 
help to the campaign 
two of the massachusetts governors other former rivals for the 
democratic nomination sen albert gore of tennessee and rep 
richard gephardt of missouri were to be on hand for a pricey 
democratic fundraiser in washington tonight 
in other developments 
atlanta mayor andrew young said reports that his city will not 
be ready in time for the democratic national convention are 
exaggerated anybody who doesnt like atlanta can go somewhere 
else said the mayor 
dissident republicans in michigan have taken the first step 
toward challenging the credentials of michigans 77 delegates to 
the gop national convention after a dispute over party rules the 
dissidents had walked out of the state gop convention and held 
their own gathering now they have sent the national party their 
competing list of delegates to the convention

three unmanned locomotives today sped 
through three towns at speeds up to 40 mph before stopping on their 
own officials said 
the runaway engines traveled about 10 miles between the towns of 
orange and gardner in north central massachusetts 
there were no injuries reported as a result of the runaway 
engines said colin pease spokesman for guilford transportation 
industries which operates the trains 
pease said a crew working on engines near the gardner rail yard 
discovered the string of locomotives was gone at about 5 am and 
they notified a dispatcher who alerted local authorities 
he said he believes the trains were released by vandals and he 
said it was at least the second runaway since another string of 
locomotives sped out of control through nine towns last november 
until they were deliberately slammed into empty freight cars in 
deerfield 
there were no injuries in that incident and the fbi said it has 
found no evidence of sabotage 
pease however said the two runaways and a third last january 
form a pattern that cannot be coincidental 
the circumstances are just too close pease said 
hopefully somebody will begin realizing this is a serious problem 
and that we need help 
the latest incident came four days after striking rail workers 
began returning to work ending a sixmonth walkout over safety 
issues 
union leader mike maloof said today that the workers could not 
have been involved in the alleged vandalism because they were busy 
taking physical exams

rearseat lap belts expose victims of car 
crashes to greater risk of paralysis or death than lapandshoulder 
restraints according to a study released thursday by 
productliability lawyers 
the institute for injury reduction a dunkirk md organization 
founded this year by attorneys involved in productinjury 
litigation presented the study at a hearing of the house 
government activities and transportation subcommittee 
in crash after crash children and adults are dying being 
rendered paraplegic or quadriplegic or suffering disabling injuries 
to their abdominal organs while wearing only rearseat lap belts 
a benjamin kelley president of the institute testified 
the tests commissioned by the institute were conducted by 
automotive safety testing inc of east liberty ohio 
the tests used instrumented dummies belted into the rearseat 
assembly of a 1987 honda accord lx and subjected to simulated 
crashes 
a 33 mph simulated crash using dummies the size of 6yearold 
children showed pressure against the outer part of the lap belt 
when used alone was 61 percent greater than with a lapshoulder 
combination 
in a simulated crash at 27 mph using adultsize dummies 
pressure on the outside part of the lap belt when used alone was 
338 percent higher than with a lapshoulder combination a similar 
test at 32 mph showed a 145 percent difference 
the results indicate a greater likelihood for lapbelt only 
occupants to sustain severe or fatal injuries in such 
crashes the study said 
peter sursi program manager at automotive safety testing said 
in an interview the study did not address the question of the 
position of the lap belt on the passenger 
auto manufacturers and the national highway traffic safety 
administration have said a properly adjusted lap belt will provide 
protection because the force of the crash will be absorbed by the 
large pelvic bones 
a misadjusted belt will result in the belts cutting through the 
soft abdomen to the spinal column studies have shown 
nhtsas policy is to encourage manufacturers voluntarily to 
install lapandshoulder belt combinations in the rear seat while 
asserting that a lap belt alone provides better crash protection 
than no belt 
a 1986 study by the national transportation safety board 
however concluded that lap belts used alone may cause serious 
injury rather than providing protection 
thomas hanna president of the motor vehicle manufacturers 
association which represents the nations automakers told the 
committee by 1990 virtually every car produced in the us will 
be equipped with lapshoulder belts in outboard rear seating 
positions 
automakers offer kits for nearly all models made in the last 10 
years that allow owners to install lapshould belt combinations in 
the back seat of vehicles hanna said 
the institute for injury reduction however said knowledge and 
availability of such kits is limited 
the institute on may 2526 conducted a random telephone poll 
of 30 dealers for five automakers in six cities and found none had 
lapshould belt kits in stock 21 said no kits were available and 
only eight said kits could be ordered

pope john paul ii today urged austrians 
to remember its world war ii past as he began a controversial trip 
that includes meetings with president kurt waldheim and a visit to 
a former nazi death camp 
waldheim under bitter attack from jews and shunned by most 
western leaders for his alleged complicity in nazi war crimes led 
the official government welcoming delegation for the roman catholic 
leader 
waldheim in his own greetings denounced intolerance 
intransigence and hate among nations religions and classes but 
made no direct comments about the dispute over his past as a german 
army officer 
the whiterobed pontiffs special alitalia dc9 aircraft touched 
down at vienna schwechat airport during a light shower 
in comments delievered in german john paul mentioned his second 
trip as pope to austria will include the site of the former 
mauthausen death camp 
he said such places recall times of hardship which have left 
their indelible mark 
let us when we meet bring before god not only the great and 
burdensome legacy of the past but also the joys and sorrows of the 
present the pontiff said 
many austrians claim they were victims of adolf hitlers nazi 
rule and the nations events marking the 50th anniversary of the 
1938 annexation with the third reich have sparked a renewed round 
of soulsearching 
the polishborn pontiff drew the ire of jews when he received 
waldheim a year ago at the vatican an audience the pope later 
defended as necessary because waldheim came as a democratically 
elected president the vatican says the popes meetings with world 
leaders do not imply his support for an individual or political 
system 
this is not a political visit it is a pastoral visit he the 
pope was invited by the bishops said vatican spokesman joaquin 
navarro 
today six american jews demonstrated outside waldheims office 
to show their displeasure with the popes decision to meet with him 
do not embrace waldheim no said rabbi avi weiss of the 
hebrew institute of riverdale ny standing with him were five 
jewish students dressed in blackandwhite striped uniforms 
reminiscent of those worn by concentration camp inmates during the 
nazi era 
earlier this week two representatives of major jewish 
organizations met with a vatican envoy in jerusalem to register 
their protests over the meetings 
dr avi beker of the world jewish congress said the pope was 
going out of his way to legitimize waldheim 
but rabbi marc h tanenbaum director of international relations 
of the american jewish committee warned against extremist 
hysteria and stridency over the meetings 
in a statement from new york on wednesday he pointed out that 
the pope was visiting a predominantly catholic country and that it 
was vatican policy for popes to meet with heads of states of 
countries with which the holy see has diplomatic relations 
tanenbaum also said his group had been informed by vatican 
officials that the popes contacts with waldheim will be kept to 
an absolute minimum 
waldheim has denied that he committed war crimes but the united 
states has barred him saying it found evidence he was involved in 
deportations of balkan civilians in world war ii 
an international commission of historians appointed by the 
austrian government to investigate the allegations concluded in 
february that waldheim was aware of nazi atrocities in the balkans 
and did nothing to prevent them it left open the question of 
whether he was guilty of wartime atrocities 
john paul is to deliver about 20 speeches during the trip his 
second to a country where the vatican counts 64 million roman 
catholics or 85 percent of the 75 million population he paid a 
threeday visit in 1983 
on friday the 68yearold pontiff is scheduled to meet with 
representatives of austrias 12000 jews then visit the site of 
the mauthausen concentration camp where 110000 prisoners died 
during world war ii on pilgrimages to his homeland the pope 
visited the auschwitz and majdanek death camps

the famed leaning tower tilted another 
fraction of an inch in the past year a rate that might cause the 
landmark to topple in about 100 years an expert said thursday 
gero geri of the university of pisa said that since june 1987 
the tower has leaned 005 inches according to measurments taken 
wednesday 
geri is a member of the team which makes semiannual checks of 
the displacement of several of pisas architectural treasures 
settling into the citys soft clay foundation 
although decembers checkup showed encouraging signs that the 
towers tilt may be slowing geri said wednesdays readings 
indicated the monument had resumed its average tilting pace of 
about 004 inches per year 
the 180foot tower completed between 1360 and 1370 is now 
leaning 146 feet off the vertical 
we really do not know why its still standing geri said 
but judging from its current rate of shift and from the centuries 
the process has taken we estimate that the structure will fall in 
a century if nothing is done to stop it 
he added no one is really sure when it will go down 
the ministry of public works has been trying for years to come 
up with a plan to save the tower but any project is far from 
implementation

the burgeoning pentagon bribery investigation 
may be developing into the kind of scandal both democrats and 
republicans can love 
little more than a week after it emerged into public view the 
contractfraud affair shows potential to become the most 
politically popular scandal in years says one defense lawyer for a 
man targeted by the investigators 
this is the best thing thats happened to both the republicans 
and democrats in six months because for the republicans it gets 
everybodys mind off attorney general ed meese and for the 
democrats it gets everybodys mind off house speaker jim 
wright said this lawyer who has no desire for any more 
publicity for his or his clients name 
so what you have is a natural tendency on the part of both 
parties to try to pump it up youve got a republican iowa sen 
charles grassley whos pumping it up and youve got the 
democrats too including sens david pryor of arkansas and sam 
nunn of georgia and rep les aspin of wisconsin the lawyer added 
all four have joined the public outcry over the affair 
its the one thing everybody can join in on because it gets 
reporters off their leadership the lawyer said its terrific 
a perfect opportunity 
this experienced attorney is one of a dozen washington lawyers 
already hired by the contractors consultants and pentagon 
officials named in government search warrants or grand jury 
subpoenas 
he was giving his admittedly selfinterested view of how 
government investigators had received such voluminous and favorable 
publicity for their side of the case through leaks speeches and 
news conferences even before the investigators have brought any 
charges or made any arrests 
meese who 365 days out of most years solemnly refuses to 
discuss ongoing investigations in public even held a news 
conference to outline the scope of the investigation and rebut 
grassleys complaints that the justice department had moved too 
slowly 
since the governments coordinated searches on june 14 the 
pentagon story has muscled two highprofile investigations off the 
nations front pages the special prosecutors imminent report on 
whether meese used his office to benefit himself and friends and a 
house ethics investigation of democratic speaker jim wrights 
finances and official actions 
the wellknown names meese and wright have been replaced by 
those of pentagon bureaucrats private consultants and contractors 
who are hardly household words berlin galvin gunn lackner 
paisley parkin and others 
even the congressmen whose names have been pulled in by justice 
department or investigative leakers as potentially of interest to 
investigators are not the best known on capitol hill democrats 
william chappell jr of florida roy dyson of maryland thomas j 
downey and samuel s stratton both of new york and republican 
andy ireland of florida 
aides to those five point out that even the leakers dont say 
theyre under investigation at this time federal prosecutor henry 
hudson publicly says no one on the hill is now a target 
this is as close as a washington scandal comes to catnip for 
politicians as texas gop chairman george strake told the dallas 
times herald every morning when i wake up i run out to get the 
paper and see what the scandal of the day is whether its on them 
or us 
the defense lawyer also offered some cautionary words for those 
tempted to translate leaks and fbi search warrant affidavits into 
automatic convictions 
its a specific federal crime if you trade inside information 
on wall street but there is a sensitive information flow between 
the pentagon and its contractors that is not only legal but even 
encouraged only in certain circumstances is that illegal he 
said 
the leakers have crowed over how unguarded their targets were as 
government agents secretly monitored their telephone calls and 
office conversations but this lawyer who has heard similar 
government tapes before said they may not have tapes that are 
that clear and what they are hearing may be legal or illegal 
depending on the intent involved 
the tapes may have showed a need to check further the 
lawyer said but he emphasized that further investigation is just 
beginning with last weeks massive seizure of records and the 
efforts to persuade targets to confess and cooperate 
even if the leakers are correct he said this would be dozens 
of separate small conspiracies that take time to investigate not 
one big conspiracy all the search warrants were done together 
so that one search did not alert other people who might be involved 
in separate similar schemes to begin shredding their documents 
based on his experience this lawyer said the people 
hemorrhaging information now are the ones who know the least the 
ones who know the most dont talk at this stage

recent criticism of the crimes of josef v stalin 
have prompted unspecified changes at the museum honoring him in his 
georgian birthplace the communist party leader of the southern 
republic said thursday 
the stalin museum in his native town of gori which also has 
the last town square statue of the dictator left standing in the 
soviet union contained a large and uncritical display of 
artifacts tracing stalins life and political career 
georgian party head dzhumber patiashvili was asked at a news 
conference thursday whether the museum showed the georgian party 
had a different attitude to stalin than mikhail s gorbachev who 
in november condemned the dictators enormous and unforgiveable 
crimes 
there can be no other interpretations said patiashvili 
he added that although stalin is not a georgian problem at 
all but a soviet one the museum at gori had been reviewed since 
november and the exhibits there have been changed in the spirit 
of gorbachevs report he did not detail the changes 
there have been unconfirmed reports the museum would close prior 
to being turned into a museum of stalins cult of personality 
which is fiercely criticized in soviet media 
almost all monuments extolling stalin were dismantled after 
nikita s khrushchev condemned the former leader in 1956 
in georgia however some residents still proudly display 
pictures of stalin at home or in car windows in the capital of 
tbilisi a river embankment park and mountain railway are named 
for stalin 
even after khrushchevs condemnation stalin continued to be 
extolled as a hero of the soviet unions world war ii victory over 
germany 
in volgograd formerly stalingrad quotes from stalin are 
engraved on world war ii memorials 
this week however articles coinciding with the anniversary of 
the june 22 1941 invasion by the nazis have openly criticized 
stalin for failing to heed red army warnings of a coming german 
invasion suggesting he left the nation unprepared for attack

expanding federal crop insurance and diverting 
lake michigan to allow resumption of mississippi river barge 
traffic are among the steps needed to deal with the drought 
speakers today told midwestern governors 
well need a little bit of time to determine what the losses 
are said us agriculture secretary richard lyng but we will 
do what is needed to minimize the severity of the damage 
the 10 governors at the meeting told lyng about a number of 
problems 
illinois gov james thompson said his states soybean and corn 
crops would be lost without substantial rain in the next 30 days 
while gov george sinner of north dakota said 70 percent of his 
states grain crop already is lost 
welcome to the heart of the drought land thompson said in 
opening the conference we used to be known as the heart of the 
heartland now we are both 
thompson said barge traffic much of it bringing crops to 
market is virtually closed on the vital commercial waterway of 
the mississippi and he called for the us army corps of engineers 
to petition the supreme court and allow diversion of lake michigan 
water in order to get the traffic flowing again 
sinner said the oneday conference would address how to prevent 
farmers struggling because of the drought from going broke and 
leaving the land and devising a longterm solution to dropping 
water tables throughout the northern tier and western united states 
lyng said the federal governments response would include 
expansion of existing crop insurance and disaster loan programs he 
also cited the creation of task forces in the congress and within 
president reagans administration preparing to respond to problems 
of the drought 
lyng left the conference after his speech but said he would 
meet with reagan on friday morning to update him on the drought 
situation 
attending the daylong meeting besides sinner and thompson

despite scandals in the pulpits and problems on 
wall street americans reached deeper than ever into their pockets 
last year to give more than 93 billion to philanthropic 
organizations according to a study 
the 9368 billion tallied in the annual report giving usa 
was almost 65 percent more than the 88 billion given in 1986 the 
increase was nearly twice the rate of inflation which rose by 37 
percent and topped the growth of personal income which was just 
under 6 percent in 1987 
eightytwo percent of all charitable donations came from 
individual americans they contributed 7682 billion 665 percent 
more than they gave in 1986 
only one major category of donor us corporations failed to 
give more than in 1986 they gave 45 billion in 1987 the same as 
in 1986 
contributions by foundations rose by 814 percent to 638 
billion and bequests from estates went up 7 percent to 598 
billion 
the figures were issued wednesday by nathan weber editor of the 
annual report of the american association of fundraising counsel 
trust for philanthropy 
the october stock market crash loss of deduction for 
nonitemizing incometax payers and the scandals of fundraising tv 
evangelists all presaged a decline in giving but in the face of 
this it increased significantly said weber 
the biggest gift of the year was norton simons donation of art 
worth 750 million to the university of california 
among the list of milliondollarormore donors were paul 
newman who gave 5 million to his childrens camp in connecticut 
t boone pickens who gave west texas state university 15 
million and bill cosby who gave 13 million to fisk university 
among the reasons corporate donations flattened out was what the 
report called the inevitable running out of steam after nearly 
a decade of enormous increases 
the report also said serious economic difficulties befell key 
corporations notably oil companies and the rust belt 
manufacturers of the midwest and northeast 
the woes of tv evangelists notwithstanding religion came in for 
its usual 40 percent to 50 percent share of donations the estimate 
for 1987 was 436 billion almost 47 percent of all charity 
contributions 
the rest broke down as 1365 billion to health groups and 
hospitals 1084 billion to education 984 billion to human 
services 641 billion to the arts and humanities 244 billion 
to social activist causes and 689 billion to others

city officials agreed thursday to return a 
building now used as a medical institute to the synagogue that 
owned it before world war ii two american and soviet rabbis 
announced 
we asked for this five years ago 15 and 20 years ago but no 
one would listen the soviet unions chief rabbi adolf 
shayevich said in an interview 
the return of the twostory building to the choral synagogue on 
arkhipova street in central moscow fits a pattern of liberalization 
that began during preparations for the celebration of the 1000th 
anniversary of christianity in russia 
during the celebration earlier this month the government 
returned a monastery it had controlled in kiev and several churches 
throughout the country to the russian orthodox church the soviet 
government has taken over church property since the 1920s 
after the structure was built more than 100 years ago the 
synagogue used it for jewish community activities but the 
government took it away in 1941 and made it into a hospital for 
world war ii casualties shayevich said it now houses a training 
center for doctors it is adjacent to the beige synagogue and the 
two doors connecting it to the synagogue are sealed 
arthur schneier a new york rabbi said he began campaigning 1 
years ago for the return of the building but made progress with 
soviet officials just in the past two weeks during the millennium 
of christianity 
its part of a process that seeks to align religious believers 
with restructuring and rebuilding of society schneier said in an 
interview in a synagogue office they are trying to reach out to 
the masses 
he said the return of the building would have been 
unthinkable during his first visit in 1966 and improbable five 
years ago 
schneier said moscows deputy mayor gennady d arzhanov agreed 
on behalf of the moscow city council thursday to turn over the 
building to the synagogue the oral agreement is to be followed up 
with a formal contract later 
schneier said the jewish congregation he represents at new 
yorks park east synagogue will help pay for restoration of the 
building and will send architects and construction specialists to 
offer advice he predicted the building could be used within two 
years for adult jewish education classes and a museum 
the new york synagogue also has agreed to help the medical 
institute find other quarters schneier said

the house of representatives telephone system 
went dead thursday for the fourth time in two weeks silencing half 
of congress and leading one lawmaker to complain that alexander 
graham bell would be depressed and despondent 
the widespread outage brought howls from congressmen cut off 
from their constituents and district offices and prompted a 
scramble by top officials of american telephone amp telegraph co 
which installed the 16 million system to find out what went wrong 
i dont know what motivated this installation of the new 
system but its certainly proven to be a failure rep walter 
jones dnc complained 
had bell the inventor of the telephone been around during the 
last two weeks he would have been most depressed and despondent 
to say nothing of being embarrassed jones said 
rep jim kolbe rariz said the communications glitch reminded 
him of the atampt television commercials showing distraught employees 
bemoaning their choice of a phone system and discussing how their 
businesses had been ruined the commercials end by proclaiming atampt 
the right choice 
well in the interest of truth in advertising i think we 
ought to admit that the same source of that advertising is the one 
that has the telephone system here in the house kolbe said in a 
floor speech 
when the system went down for the first time last week he said 
it was kind of nice to have the break no calls coming in quiet 
in the offices everybody went off and got a coke or did 
something 
but as the outages kept recurring he said tempers 
increased 
members and staff described variously everything from totally 
dead telephones to intermittent operation of some lines calls 
could not be transferred at times all the lights on a telephone 
would go on at once and all the phones in an office would ring 
simultaneously 
officials in the house clerks office which administers the 
phone system said they were working feverishly to find out what 
had gone wrong and that atampt had sent its top technical experts 
from all over the country to help diagnose the problem 
its a flukey sort of thing said deputy house clerk ray 
colley the switching system which is the heart of the telephone 
network is a computerized atampt system 85 which is in wide use and 
has not been a problem elsewhere he said 
colley said he believed the house system which has some 17000 
telephones is one of the largest in the country 
were losing a lot of calls obviously he said believe 
me we have total attention from atampt technicians suspected a 
software problem but were examining everything including the 
possibility of computer hackers tampering with the system from 
outside he said 
an atampt spokesman herb linnen said the company had pulled 
together its best technical minds and was working around the 
clock to resolve the problem 
we do not know the cause we have tried to replicate the 
calling situation of the house in our bell lab facilities in denver 
to see if we can spot a software or hardware problem but we have 
not been able to replicate it he said 
linnen said the company was totally empathetic with 
lawmakers frustration we are frustrated we have a commitment 
to get the problem fixed as quickly as possible he said 
the system was installed last august and after some initial 
startup problems worked fine until it went dead for the first time 
last week colley said since then outages of an hour or more 
occurred on tuesday wednesday and thursday 
house clerk donnald k anderson defended the system weve got 
the best system on the market he said i still have confidence 
in system 85 
meantime kolbe had a suggestion for members frustrated by being 
unable to communicate with constituents use the house floor and 
its television system as an electronic billboard to send open 
messages back home 
and if nothing else works my staff has come up with a 
prototype system he said holding up a pair of styrofoam coffee 
cups linked by a piece of wire 
if i get the contract for 10 million or so to install this in 
the house of representatives i promise that it will work just as 
well as the phone system we have here now

the united states welcomed on thursday what it 
hoped was a flexible approach by angola toward negotiations to 
end a 13yearold war between cubanbacked government forces and 
ussupported guerrillas 
state department spokesman charles e redman noting reports 
that the angolan government is willing to enter peace discussions 
without demanding cessation of us support for the rebels said 
we welcome a flexible approach to these very complex problems 
were addressing 
his comments were made on the eve of us cuban south african 
and angolan talks in cairo on a possible settlement of the conflict 
that has enflamed southern africa for more than a decade 
one of the stumbling blocks in recent years has been angolas 
unwillingness to negotiate a withdrawal of cuban forces in the 
country as long as the united states backed the guerrilla forces of 
the national union for the total independence of angola or unita 
unita receives more than 15 million a year in us assistance 
in thursday editions the new york times quoted angolan justice 
minister fernando franca van dunem as saying us support for unita 
would not be an issue in the talks about to begin 
it is not appropriate for us to raise the issue now the 
minister said we will raise it with the united states 
separately at another juncture the issue is not on the table for 
the current negotiations we should not mix these subjects 
redman said that the us position has always been that that 
is not a subject for discussion and it has never been on the table 
in these negotiations 
the american spokesman also said secretary of state george p 
shultz would meet next week with unita leader jonas savimbi 
after shultz met with the angolan government delegation on 
wednesday the department issued a statement declaring the united 
states believes that the quickest way to end the conflict that has 
already consumed the lives of thousands of angolans is for 
angolans themselves to meet and resolve their differences 
peacefully and without the pressures and interference of outside 
forces

a nationwide journalists strike in its second day 
on thursday kept nearly all of italys national newspapers off the 
newstands and reduced staterun broadcasts to barebone accounts 
the contract dispute also stilled news agencies including the 
two major national ones ansa and agi 
among the missing papers were the leading sports dailies but 
for soccer fans it was probably just as well the strike meant no 
postmortems of wednesdays night match between italy and the 
soviet union which saw the soviets kill the italians title hopes 
for the european championship 
the state broadcasting network rai had carried the match live to 
show the journalists sensibility to the nations soccer fever 
the broadcast which involves the services of journalists was the 
only exception on wednesday to the nowork day 
on thursday however rai radio and television carried reduced 
newscsts without video or audio services instead an announcer 
designated by the journalists union read the news in reduced form 
including a declaration of why the strike was called 
the strike was scheduled to end friday allowing the publication 
of saturdays newspapers 
local papers and some that are outside the union such as the 
leftist manifesto did publish 
officials of the national press federation called the strike 
which began wednesday morning over a breakdown in negotiations 
publishers and union officials have agreed on a 381 monthly pay 
increase in the new contract 
but the unions are want a clause preventing newspaper chains 
from using a central newsroom to provide national and international 
news for the group and publishers say that would be too costly

rival palestinian guerrilla factions 
battled with mortars and machine guns thursday for control of two 
refugee camps in beirut police said two people were killed and 
nine wounded 
in a related development the abu nidal group issued a threat to 
assassinate yasser arafats chief spokesman for issuing a statement 
saying the palestine liberation organization was ready to recognize 
israel 
the camp fighting raised the overall toll to 53 people killed 
and 215 wounded since the latest round of the war between arafats 
mainline fatah guerrillas and col saeed mousas fatahuprising 
broke out 14 days ago 
by police count 102 people have been killed and 468 wounded in 
the camps of chatilla and bourj elbarajneh since the two factions 
began their bloody feud may 1 
a police spokesman said mousas guerrillas dislodged from the 
two shantytowns in previous rounds of fighting shelled the camps 
from syriancontrolled territory in west beirut early in the day 
he said shells slammed into the two camps at the rate of one 
every 10 minutes at certain times the shantytowns have suffered 
from repeated attacks from israel and syrianbacked shiite moslem 
militias since 1982 
the spokesman said sniper fire kept most roads in the two 
camps closed throughout the day he could not be dentified in 
line with standing regulations 
the fighting continued despite repeated efforts by neutral 
guerrilla groups and libyan mediators to arrange a ceasefire 
between fatah and mousas group 
the ceasefire broke down in part because of a statement issued 
by arafat chief spokesman bassam abu sharif saying the plo was 
willing to recognize israels existence 
on thursday the abu nidal faction issued a veiled threat to 
kill him 
abu sharif is acting like the interred traitor issam 
sartawi said a statement from abu nidals fatahrevolutionary 
council published by beiruts leftist assafir daily 
sartawi a roving ambassador for arafat was assassinated in 
madrid in 1983 the plo blamed abu nidals group which opposes any 
negotiations with israel 
sartawi was among the most moderate plo leaders he had met with 
israeli moderates before he was killed 
abu sharif expresses the willingness of the group represented 
by arafat to negotiate with the zionist entity the statement 
said 
abu sharif said in a statement released in tunis tunisia 
earlier this month that the plo was willing to recognize israel and 
accept a palestinian homeland in the occupied west bank and gaza 
strip as a solution to the 40yearold arabisraeli conflict 
abu sharifs unusually conciliatory proposals drew strong 
condemnation from five syrianbacked guerrilla groups 
abu nidal whose real name is sabri albanna broke with arafat 
in 1974 he is wanted in the united states and western europe for a 
chain of terrorist attacks including the december 1985 vienna and 
rome airport attacks in which 16 people were killed 
in kuwait the alqabas daily reported thursday that the us 
administration will deal with the plo if it publicly endorses abu 
sharifs statement 
the newspaper quoted reliably informed western diplomatic 
sources as saying in a report from paris that this had been 
conveyed to arafat through an unidentified third party 
state department spokeswoman phyllis oakley said this week that 
the statement by abu sharif was a positive step but stressed it 
lacked the authoritative support of the plo leadership 
alqabas quoted diplomatic sources as saying the americans 
considered abu sharifs statement as the first plo statement 
which talks in detail about the palestinians desire to live in 
peace with the israelis and the existence of an agreement between 
the palestinians and the israelis to live in peace and security

democrats for the first time are headed to 
their national convention with no fights pending over delegates 
after the credentials committee on thursday ratified the names on 
the roll to be called in atlanta 
harmony and winning in november were the sounds from the 
campaigns of nomineetobe michael dukakis and remaining rival 
jesse jackson 
reverend jackson wishes to insure by starting in unity with 
this committee today that the tone will be set for a united 
convention leading to a united democratic victory in november 
said toney anaya the former new mexico governor speaking for 
jackson 
jesse jackson has made us all proud michael dukakis is 
looking forward to a very unified and winning convention in 
atlanta replied joe warren of massachusetts speaking for his 
governor he is especially thankful to the jackson campaign for 
the determination to make 1988 the year of the democrats 
the campaigns had cut deals in recent days to resolve each of 
the remaining battles about delegates who will meet in atlanta july 
1821 jackson complaints about delegates in pennsylvania and 
puerto rico which were not filed as challenges are being worked 
out privately 
but anaya warned that fights were to come this weekend when the 
convention rules committee meets to talk about 1992 and beyond 
there is still some disagreement with party rules state and 
national he said reverend jackson has determined the proper 
place to take those disagreements is the rules committee and seek 
changes prospectively 
ann lewis a top jackson adviser said the candidate wants 
changes that will bring the delegate totals in 1992 closer to the 
primary vote he wants those changes written into the rules by the 
1988 convention 
the credentials meeting in washington the only one scheduled 
was a quiet affair as the group slowly ratified every deal that was 
cut to settle the total of 21 delegate challenges the group also 
put its stamp of approval on the delegates from all the states 
which had not been questioned 
and a lack of credentials fights in atlanta suits democratic 
national committee chairman paul kirk just fine 
we never get a second chance in life to make a first 
impression kirk said when we think about what we are doing 
today i think it is the first time in recent political history 
as far back as the secretarys office can advise us weve never 
started out the general election process at the democratic 
convention free of credentials challenges 
i think its a credit to the presidential campaigns to 
settle these differences without rancor in a sense of unity so we 
can begin this process with an eye on november 
the chair will be absolutely delighted if on the evening news 
nothing appears on television about us added committee chairman 
k leroy irvis of pennsylvania 
irvis gaveled the resolutions through methodically joking at 
one point as he called for a vote those who approve say aye 
those who disapprove nay we wont hear them anyway 
the last four battles to be resolved were jackson delegate 
squabble in indiana kansas and virginia and a spat between the 
national party and maine 
in the first two states a few extra delegates were added 
without increasing the number of votes to settle fights 
in indiana two delegates were added with full votes to enable 
both current gary mayor thomas barnes and former gary mayor richard 
g hatcher and one supporter each to go to atlanta barnes 
defeated hatcher in the democratic mayoral primary last year 
originally barnes and his supporter rudy clay were elected 
delegates but hatcher challenged that in court arguing that he 
and his supporter carlos tolliver should be seated now all four 
will go and the votes of four other indiana delegates backing 
jackson will be cut in half to make room 
this settlement worked out thursday morning was slightly 
different from what officials said the deal was on wednesday 
in kansas jackson picks up six more delegates with a half vote 
each five delegates for sen albert gore jr and one for dukakis 
challenged by jackson will go to the convention but with half 
votes 
thus jackson will gain three votes in kansas while gore will 
lose 25 votes and dukakis half a vote 
in virginia four jackson supporters who were tossed off the 
delegate list by other jackson backers dropped their challenge 
credentials officials said 
in maine the state party ignored a national rule setting a 
threshold of 15 percent support before a candidate or group could 
win delegates to the national convention the state convention last 
month gave three delegates to an uncommitted slate even though it 
had only 13 percent support at the meeting 
to settle the argument the three uncommitted delegates have 
been accepted as dukakis delegates by the campaign even if they 
dont vote for the massachusetts governor

issue

pullout other vietnamese officials previously have said an early 
withdrawal is possible if a political settlement is reached

construction of part of a shopping center 
adjacent to manassas national battlefield park will be halted 
indefinitely to prevent damage to federally protected wetlands 
us army corps of engineers officials said today 
its a dream come true said betty rankin president of the 
save the battlefield coalition which has been fighting the 
proposed william center complex 
the army corps of engineers has accomplished at least 
temporarily what developers and the county refused to do we all 
feel relieved she said 
the ceaseanddesist order issued wednesday applies to work 
being done at youngs branch a creek running through the civil war 
battlefield site and on adjacent wetlands developers 
hazelpeterson cos have started construction of one of two roads 
that would cross the creek 
the stopwork order which extends indefinitely was issued 
because the developers violated a corps provision requiring that 
the army be notified when a project could affect a historic 
property said corps spokesman bill brown 
our concern is with the two roads crossing the creek brown 
said that work could have an impact on the park 
john t til hazel president of the development group has 10 
days from receipt of the letter to explain why the army wasnt 
notified about the road brown said 
the stopwork order could entirely block construction of the 
project or force the developer to alter its design if an 
investigation determines that the park would be adversely affected 
brown added 
preservationists claim construction of the massive project 
which includes a 12millionsquarefoot shopping mall 17 million 
square feet of office space and 560 homes would destroy 50 acres 
of wetlands and ruin beaver dams and rare plants spread throughout 
the 542acre tract 
historians feel the project will destroy forever the sanctity of 
the stillrustic setting of two crucial civil war battles 
robert kelly a spokesman for hazelpeterson told the 
washington post that his firm would do everything in its power to 
comply with the armys requests 
the workstoppage order came as proposals to block the project 
were gaining momentum in congress 
on tuesday a house interior and insular affairs panel held a 
hearing on several congressional proposals to take control of the 
development tract and add it to the 4600acre park 
sen john warner rva on wednesday offered legislation that 
would deprive hazelpeterson of direct access to the site from 
interstate 66 the measure failed in the appropriations 
subcommittee but warner said he would introduce it before the full 
appropriations committee

an overwhelming majority of people entering 
the work force over the next decade will be women minorities and 
immigrants and they are likely to be stuck in lowlevel 
lowpaying jobs a private study said thursday 
the study by the institute for educational leadership a 
washingtonbased think tank said steps must be taken now to assure 
these new workers have adequate education and job choices 
the study drew its data from demographic analyses of several 
indicator states considered representative of the nations 
population new york florida connecticut michigan texas 
california indiana arizona delaware kentucky and ohio 
it concluded that 20 million people will start work between now 
and the year 2000 and that 83 percent of them will be women 
minorities and immigrants 
unless better education opportunities are provided the jobs 
available to these new workers will continue to be lowlevel 
lowpaying service positions the study said 
for example for every computer programmer hired in the united 
states there will be 13 new jobs for cashiers the study said 
states in the southwest will feel a decided impact on their 
student populations and work force from the increasing numbers of 
hispanics while the southeastern states will face pressures from 
the growing number of blacks the study said states like new york 
florida and california will have to make sure they have resources 
to provide for a fastgrowing elderly population 
there are significant challenges ahead which will require all 
sectors of society to join together if our states are to provide 
quality education and meaningful employment said harold 
hodgkinson a senior fellow at the institute 
the institute includes representatives from education business 
and the media it is supported by various private foundations and 
also receives some federal money

following the letter of the constitution results in a system that 
is unfair to citizens 
the forum was a census subcommittee hearing on bills which would 
require the census bureau to figure out whether people are in the 
country legally and if not to delete them from the counts used in 
reapportioning seats in the house of representatives 
this is a fairness issue said rep thomas j ridge rpa 
who contended that states with large numbers of illegal aliens 
benefit unfairly when their large population totals give then extra 
seats in the house 
because there is a 435seat limit when one state gains a house 
member another must lose one 
ridge cited the 1980 census which estimated the number of 
illegal aliens at 2 million the result he said was that georgia 
and indiana lost house seats to new york and california 
subcommittee chairman mervyn m dymally dcalif however said 
he is unsure whether the bills backed by ridge and others are 
constitutional 
the us constitution requires the census bureau to cound all 
the persons in the country every 10 years for purposes of 
reapportionment it doesnt specify citizens 
i am disturbed by the implication that undocumented residents 
of the united states are not persons dymally said 
noting that at times in the past blacks and indians have been 
excluded from participation in government he commented i do not 
want to return to a time when some human beings are considered less 
than equal in the eyes of the law 
every census since the constitution was adopted has counted 
all residents of the states including both legal and illegal 
aliens added rep don edwards dcalif it was never the 
intent of the framers to include only citizens for apportionment 
purposes 
and rep albert g bustamente dtexas termed the worry over 
counting aliens hysterical pointing out that the movement of 
americans into western and southern states has had a much larger 
effect on representation than the presence of aliens 
the census bureau also opposes the bills contending that the 
effort to determine who is an illegal alien could delay and 
complicate the count and that people would be unlikely to tell the 
truth anyway 
but reps tom petri rwis and william f goodling rpa 
asserted that counting illegal aliens violates citizens basic 
right to equal representation by giving greater voice in congress 
to states where the aliens live 
and rep tim valentine dnc contended that counting aliens 
in effect is granting representation in congress to individuals 
who have entered this country by breaking the laws of the united 
states

an investigative officer has made 
confidential recommendations on whether an officer and five 
instructors should be courtmartialed for the death of a recruit at 
the navy rescue swimmer school a spokesman confirmed thursday 
cmdr daniel j dalesio a navy legal services officer 
stationed in philadelphia made the recommendations based on 
hearings earlier this month to rear adm david r morris chief of 
naval air training said morris spokesman lt lee saunders 
morris is expected to make a decision before he leaves his 
present job july 1 to take command of an aircraft carrier battle 
group in the atlantic ocean but depending on what he decides the 
disclosure of his action may be delayed until after that date 
saunders said 
morris may decide to call for a courtmartial nonjudicial 
punishment or dismissal of the charges 
the five instructors were charged with involuntary manslughter 
and conspiracy to commit battery by forcing airman recruit lee 
mirecki 19 of appleton wis into a swimming pool at the 
pensacola naval air station and holding his head under water until 
he collapsed the alleged actions occurred when the sailor panicked 
on march 2 and said he was quitting the rescue course

charged with the lesser offense of dereliction of duty he has been 
relieved of his command

triggered heart failure that was followed by drowning the 
pathologist said 
mirecki panicked during an exercise known as sharks and 
daisies in which instructors grabbed students in headholds to 
simulate a panicking air crash survivor the exercise now has 
students practice rescue exercises on each other rather than 
instructors

three israeli children on their way back from a 
school hike were hurt by flying glass when their bus was stoned in 
an arab neighborhood of east jerusalem a police spokesman said 
thursday 
in a further sign of resurgent unrest that has struck jerusalem 
recently outlawed palestine liberation organization flags were 
flown from utility poles in several parts of the city 
west bank commander maj gen amram mitzna decided to free 89 
palestinian detainees and prisoners an army official said the 
decision followed appeals from arab notables and was made to 
contribute to the restoration of normal life 
the army said it would pardon 17 prisoners stop proceedings 
against 27 detainees and cut short sixmonth prison terms of 45 
administrative detainees the palestinians would be released 
friday it said 
prime minister yitzhak shamir speaking at a ceremony at the 
national police headquarters urged the police to suppress all 
manifestations of unrest in jerusalem 
these threats must become a challenge to the israeli police 
who should make a special effort to repel every attack and cut off 
every hand that would be raised against the unity of jerusalem our 
eternal capital he said 
police spokesman rafi levy said the incidents appeared linked to 
orders issued by underground palestinian leaders in a leaflet 
distributed wednesday 
the leaflet calls on arabs to focus their disturbances on 
jerusalem to protest israeli control of the disputed city israel 
annexed the arab sector of the city after driving out jordanian 
troops in 1967 but most countries have refused to recognize 
jerusalem as israels capital 
palestinian girls from a high school in the shuafat quarter of 
jerusalem stoned two israeli buses heading toward neve yaacov an 
isolated jewish neighborhood surrounded by palestinian communities 
levy told the associated press 
the 11yearold israeli children were returning from a visit to 
ammunition hill the site of a key battle in the 1967 middle east 
war 
three students were hurt and treated at jerusalems hadassah 
hospital levy said adding that the injuries were believed to be 
minor 
police detained several palestinians including arab students 
he said 
in a separate incident a palestinian stoned an israeli bus on 
saleh eldin street the main shopping thoroughfare in the arab 
part of the city levy said the stone smashed a window but caused 
no injuries he said 
the latest unrest following a fourmonth lull in violence in 
jerusalem began saturday when palestinian protesters blocked city 
streets with stones and attacked a police van and a lookout post 
atop the old citys damascus gate 
also thursday the israeli army accused the londonbased human 
rights group amnesty international of using biased sources of 
information and denied an amnesty report that soldiers had killed 
arabs by using tear gas improperly in its fight against the arab 
uprising 
the report accused israeli soldiers of firing tear gas into 
confined areas in violation of manufacturers order thus killing 
at least seven palestinians 
but a military communique said soldiers had instructions not to 
fire into rooms and said the tear gas used by israel is not 
dangerous to human life 
an electric power failure paralyzed most of the country and the 
occupied territories stopping factory production causing traffic 
snarls and disrupting telephone and other communications the 
electric corporation spokesman ruled out sabotage as a cause of the 
outage 
the power failure caused blackouts of up to three hours in most 
parts of israel including jerusalem and tel aviv it reached as 
far south as the resort town of eilat on the egyptian border 
police spokesman levy initially said police were investigating 
whether the outage was the work of palestinian saboteurs however 
avri ravid spokesman for the israel electric corp later told the 
ap the failure was caused by a torn high tension wire 
no person could have cut it ravid said if anyone tried 
there would be nothing left of him 
israeli officials and palestinian landowners said mischievous 
israeli children and jewish settlers seeking retaliation set some 
of the blazes that have scorched thousands of acres of land since 
may 
most of the 35000 acres of greenery torched since this spring 
were destroyed by arab arsonists underground arab leaders called 
an arson day on wednesday and nine of the 14 fires which broke 
out apparently were set by palestinians police said

caspar weinbergers former colleague in 
private life brought in to the pentagon to get control of 
procurement says he quit in frustration last fall because 
weinberger and president reagan failed to support his management 
reforms 
i differ 100 percent with the former secretary of defense 
who said the system is fine but we have a few bad apples said 
richard p godwin the former undersecretary of defense for 
acquisition who was brought into the pentagon to carry out reforms 
recommended by another californian industrialist david packard 
godwin the former president of bechtel civil and minerals inc 
also said weinberger the former defense secretary was 100 
percent wrong in defending the way the pentagon buys weapons 
in a telephone interview wednesday godwin called the pentagon 
procurement process a national crisis as serious for the 
united states as drug trafficking and the aids epidemic 
we have institutionalized a bad system said the 66yearold 
godwin who worked with weinberger at bechtel before president 
reagans election in 1980 
bechtel civil and minerals was a division of bechtel group inc 
the huge construction company based in san francisco between 
assignments in republican administrations weinberger served as 
vice president and general counsel of the bechtel group secretary 
of state george p shultz was president of bechtel group from 
19751982 
weinberger has said he thinks the pentagons weaponsbuying 
procedures are generally adequate but it is impossible to 
eliminate dishonesty on the part of some people 
reagan said on tuesday that although he does not condone 
misconduct some corruption is understandable in an enterprise 
as big as the defense department which spends 160 billion a year 
on acquisitions and which weinberger noted wednesday lets more 
than 50000 contracts a day 
godwin said he accepted the job as the first undersecretary of 
defense for acquisition in 1986 with the understanding that he 
would stay only as long as he felt he was effective 
the post was created by congress in the wake of a report by 
packards presidential commission recommending changes in 
procurement practices packard served as deputy secretary of 
defense in the nixon administration 
i determined the job was not doable in large part because of 
the unwillingness to make some hard decisions godwin said 
specificially godwin said weinberger and reagan refused to give 
him the support he needed to create a central management system for 
acquisitions giving one person control over pentagon buying and 
stripping service chiefs of some of their authority to decide which 
weapons system should be bought 
the service chiefs would no longer control the acquisitions 
system though they would carry out instructions he said 
his goal godwin said was to run the pentagon purchasing system 
like a corporation since the defense department is the biggest 
business in the world involving in some way over 100 million 
people and spending more money than the gross national product of 
some countries 
asked why reagan and weinberger did not back him in the way he 
felt he needed to create a central management system godwin said 
i dont know they just didnt support it 
the showdown godwin said came when air force secretary edward 
c aldridge jr complained godwin was getting into 
micromanaging the air force aldridge simply ignored the central 
management plan and was not brought to heel by his superiors 
godwin said 
if you are ignored i consider that as tantamount to 
nonsupport he said 
aldridge was not immediately available for comment his 
spokesman said 
without a central acquisitions system no one person knows what 
the defense department is spending on weapons and how costs are 
being controlled godwin said moreover no one is accountable he 
said 
instead the service chiefs or warlords as godwin called 
them go their own way establish fiefdoms lobby congress for 
money and let contracts for weapons 
godwin who serves on several boards of directors and operates 
vineyards in sonoma county calif said he was unaware of the 
federal investigation into allegations that bribes and gratuities 
were paid for crucial information about pentagon contracts and 
secret information was passed from the pentagon to defense 
contractors 
authorities are looking into allegations that defense 
contractors obtained classified information through their 
consultants in order to get billions of dollars of defense 
contracts 
while godwin said he did not come in contact with specific 
incidents of wrongdoing he said the entire system needs to be 
overhauled 
we have to make major changes in functions authorities and 
accountability he said one idea godwin said is to have three 
people running the pentagon one to oversee the militarys 
combatreadiness one to deal with policy matters and a third to 
operate the pentagon business 
asked if his policy disputes with weinberger have soured their 
relationship godwin replied we are not as we were

the us economy grew at a strong 36 percent 
rate in the first three months of 1988 prompting the reagan 
administration on thursday to make what was once considered a 
toorosy forecast even rosier 
after the october stock market collapse many private economists 
expected a slowdown or even a recession this year they criticized 
as unrealistic white house projections saying the economy as 
measured by the gross national product would grow at a steady 29 
percent pace the same as in 1986 and 1987 
but booming growth in the last three months of 1987 and 
continued strength this year sent analysts scrambling to revise 
their forecasts upward until the administration estimate began 
looking pessimistic 
on thursday beryl sprinkel chairman of the presidents council 
of economic advisers boosted the administrations gnp forecast for 
all of 1988 to 35 percent at the same time he predicted that 
consumer price inflation would hold steady at 43 percent 
the administration is looking for a sixth straight year of 
economic expansion the longest in peacetime since the civil war 
to bolster the chances for a republican presidential victory in 
november 
sprinkel said the expansion gives every indication of 
continuing on into next year 
our rosy forecast wasnt rosy enough he told reporters 
the economy is doing better than even we expected 
private analysts said sprinkels growth projections now are on 
target but that his inflation forecast should be higher because of 
the expected effect of the widespread drought on food prices 
hes certainly right about better growth but the rest is 
just pie in the sky stuff said michael k evans head of a 
private economic consulting firm in washington 
were not going to have doubledigit inflation but a 
reasonable private sector forecast of consumer inflation would be 5 
to 55 percent he said 
meanwhile the commerce department reported that an exportled 
manufacturing boom and a surge of investment spending by businesses 
kept the economy growing at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 
36 percent in the januarymarch period 
the gnp the broadest measure of economic health grew to a 
seasonal and inflationadjusted annual level of 3915 trillion a 
346 billion increase from the fourth quarter of 1987 
the latest figures represent a modest downward revision of a 
previous estimate of gnp growth in the first quarter a month ago 
the government put gnp growth at 39 percent however in april 
the initial estimate was a much lower 23 percent 
the revision showed a bigger dip in federal spending mostly 
because of a decline in purchases of surplus farm commodities the 
growth in consumer spending also was estimated as somewhat slower 
38 percent instead of 43 percent 
earlier in the economic expansion consumer spending fueled 
economic growth now manufacture of exports spurred by the 
cheaper dollar and of equipment to help businesses to produce more 
exports is leading growth 
really youre substituting trade and capital spending as the 
engines of the economy for consumption and thats going to be the 
structural change for the next several years said james annable 
chief economist at first national bank of chicago 
exports of goods and services were up a strong 228 percent in 
the first quarter business investment in capital equipment shot up 
331 percent the fastest rise since the fourth quarter of 1983 
when the nation was beginning its recovery from the 198182 
recession 
the chief drags on growth in the quarter were federal spending 
down 257 percent and residential construction spending down 88 
percent 
the gnp in the fourth quarter of 1987 grew at an even stronger a 
48 percent annual rate however much of that production went into 
a rapid buildup in inventories of goods held on shelves and back 
lots 
the mix of growth in the januarymarch period is considered 
better and it occurred with little pickup in inflation 
a price index tied to the gnp rose at an annual rate of 14 
percent slightly lower than the previously estimated 17 percent 
and well below the 27 percent pace of the fourth quarter 
the concern now is that too much demand from american 
consumers as well as from overseas buyers will strain factory 
capacity causing shortages and driving up prices later this year 
with the second quarter of 1988 drawing to a close the signals 
are mixed most economists are projecting slightly weaker economic 
growth with estimates ranging from 2 percent to 35 percent 
in a second report thursday the commerce department said the 
aftertax profits of us corporations fell 10 percent in the 
first quarter the poorest showing since profits dipped 37 percent 
in the first quarter of 1987 profits were up a moderate 26 
percent in the fourth quarter 
economists say lagging earnings could put pressure on businesses 
to raise prices

the nations businesses reported a 10 percent 
decline in profits after taxes in the first three months of this 
year the poorest performance in a year the government said 
thursday 
the commerce department said profits dipped to a seasonally 
adjusted annual rate of 1442 billion down 14 billion from the 
last three months of 1987 
it was sharpest drop since the first quarter of 1987 when 
profits fell 37 percent in the second and third quarters of last 
year aftertax earnings rose 43 percent and 55 percent 
respectively 
thursdays report on the januarymarch period represents a 
downward revision from an estimate last month when the department 
said profits after taxes rose 05 percent 
many analysts believe lagging profits are a sign of inflation 
because they expect companies to raise prices to make up for lost 
ground 
however donald h straszheim chief economist of merrill lynch 
said he believed most companies remembering the painful cutbacks 
they had to make when imports flooded the country in the early 
1980s will be very cautious about boosting prices 
i think companies are going to take a bit of a longerterm 
view and say wait a minute if we raise prices too quickly we 
may give some of that market share back to our foreign 
competitors he said 
in other details of the report the government said 
corporate cash flows a measurement intended to show the funds 
corporations have for investment rose 06 percent to an annual 
rate of 3788 billion after a 05 percent increase in the fourth 
quarter 
dividend payments to stockholders rose 21 percent to an annual 
rate of 993 billion in the first quarter following a 22 percent 
increase in the fourth quarter 
corporate profits before taxes were down 14 percent to 2815 
billion annual level in the first quarter following a 02 percent 
increase in the fourth quarter

a court thursday ruled against legendary 
bullfighter manuel benitez agreeing with an american woman who 
alleged he fathered her 19yearold son the matadors lawyer said 
attorney antonio de la riva said three members of the fivejudge 
supreme court voted to overturn two lower court decisions against 
elizabeth velasco 
she said her son also named manuel benitez was conceived while 
she lived with the millionaire bullfighter known as el 
cordobes from 1968 to 1972 
two judges voted against ms velasco a 38yearold santa 
monica calif resident who first brought suit in 1982 against 
benitez spains most popular matador during the 1960s and early 
1970s 
in the decision the majority said the 52yearold matadors 
refusal to take a blood test was obstructionist behavior and a 
clear sign of his fear the test would prove ms velascos claim 
el cordobes had argued the test represented an affront to his 
honor 
the supreme court ordered el cordobes to pay the costs of ms 
velascos original 1982 suit it also ordered both of them to share 
the costs of the latest appeal 
ms velascos lawyer carlos vinader said he was greatly 
satisfied by the ruling he said the court had not officially 
informed him of its decision 
its a good thing she has a strong heart he said of 
velasco she has suffered many injustices 
de la riva said el cordobes planned to appeal the decision to 
the constitutional tribunal spains highest court 
in 1982 represented by attorney marvin mitchelson ms velasco 
sought an award of 2 million and an obligation for child support 
from a cordoba court 
she lost that suit and an appeal to a court in seville capital 
of the andalusian autonomous region 
ms velasco later dropped her demand for a cash settlement 
el cordobes and his wife of 13 years marina freysee have five 
children 
the flamboyant bullfighter who retired in 1981 but gave benefit 
performances in 1982 and 1986 emerged from humble origins to 
become immensely popular and wealthy during his career which lasted 
from 1958 to 1981 
he is a businessman with a personal fortune estimated at 20 
million

two paddlewheelers take off friday for the 
annual recreation of a historic steamboat race but the drought 
thats drying up the mississippi river could prompt officials to 
eliminate some ports of call 
the 10day trip still will begin on schedule said capt 
lawrence keeton of the mississippi queen 
keeton said thursday that river traffic was being shut down at 
memphis tenn to allow for dredging of the shallow river channel 
but by the time the mississippi queen and its rival delta queen 
reach that point the river may be open he said 
hopefully well be thre just at the right place at the right 
time keeton said 
the company that operates both steamships said planned stops at 
greenville miss memphis carthersville mo and cairo ill 
may have to be changed 
both ships are scheduled to steam into the port at st louis 
under the gateway arch at 9 am on the fourth of july among 
precautions being taken by the steamship company to assure safe 
navigation of the shallower river will be the use of a towboat 
pushing a barge with a 9foot draft the tow and barge will travel 
ahead of the steamships acting as a pathfinder 
the race pits the mississippi queen against the delta queen 
in what is billed as a reenactment of the june 24 1870 race 
between the natchez and the robert e lee however instead of 
trying to match the speed of that race which was won by the lee 
in three days 18 hours and 14 minutes the two modernday 
steamboats will set a leisurely 10day pace 
the boats traditionally stop at natchez vicksburg memphis and 
other ports where passengers and crew from each vessel take part in 
contests such as dueling calliopes the floozie parade 
competition and a kite flying contest points gained during all 
the events determine the winner of the race

senators dumped an overhauled version of their 
vetoed 1000page bill in the hopper thursday and expressed 
optimism that the measure will reach president reagans desk this 
year 
this represents a consensus on trade policy its a consensus 
that has been a long time in coming sen john c danforth 
rmo told reporters 
finance committee chairman lloyd bentsen dtexas said he saw 
an excellent chance of getting trade legislation and im 
optimistic 
senate majority leader robert c byrd dwva said however 
that there would not be time to take up the legislation at least 
until late july he said he wants to get all of the fiscal 1989 
money bills through the senate first 
that timetable threatened to put the slimmeddown trade bill in 
a time squeeze with some lawmakers opposed to any such legislation 
while others may be eager to wrap up congressional business and hit 
the campaign trail 
a similar bill quietly went into the house hopper last week and 
there were signs that it might see faster action 
the measure is shorn of a provision that would require companies 
to provide 60day notice of plant closings and major layoffs 
as the lawmakers fielded questions at a news conference the 
senate debated a separate plantclosings bill with provisions 
identical to those removed from the trade bill 
a similar plantclosings measure was pending in the house and 
lawmakers in both houses planned to vote on the measure before the 
july fourth break democratic leaders have been saying for three 
weeks that prospects appear good for passage of separate 
plantclosings legislation 
labor unions had lobbied against detaching the plantclosings 
provision from the trade bill in april and refused to give in when 
democratic leaders asked them to go along with dropping it the 
leaders then pushed the bill with the provision intact despite 
predictions that it meant a sure veto 
this time union leaders again lobbied against detaching the 
plantclosings provision but democratic leaders insisted on doing 
so a move that insulates them from electionyear charges of 
refusing to compromise on trade 
also dropped from the modified version of the trade bill were 
provisions to restrict alaska petroleum exports 
they would limit exports from new oil refineries in alaska to 
70000 barrels a day and 50 percent of output up to 50000 barrels 
a day could be exported to canada but only after making a detour in 
an americanflagged vessel to a port in the lower 48 states 
president reagan objected to both the plantclosings and alaska 
oil provisions in his veto of the earlier version of the 
legislation 
central features of the measure would overhaul the system under 
which the united states imposes import curbs to aid threatened us 
industries and retaliate against international trade violations 
other features range from repeal of the 1980 windfall profits 
tax on oil industry earnings to substantial agricultural subsidy 
programs 
one feature targeted in reagans veto message but left intact 
when seantors overhauled their measure would allow dutyfree 
imports of caribbean ethanol used for making gasohol corn 
producers have been fighting to get it erased 
all you have to do is look at the drought bentsen said 
theyre not going to have the corn for ethanol 
danforth appealed for support from farm groups 
this bill is very good farm legislation he said as a 
matter of fact i think it is the most significant agricultural 
legislation that ive ever seen in the senate

spur exports as well as millions of dollars to agribusinesses to 
advertise their wares in global markets 
under the measure wheat feed grains and oilseed crop producers

the government has approved in principle 
the registration of an association for homosexuals a member of 
parliament said thursday 
mikolaj kozakiewicz a prominent sexologist and member of 
parliament from the united peasant party said in an interview that 
he was told by the ministry of health that homosexual associations 
may be formed for different cities in poland 
it would be the second association for homosexuals in the east 
bloc hungary approved a similar association several months ago 
after much public debate 
the polish associations will have the right to their own 
publications and will be linked in some way to the public health 
service he said 
according to kozakiewicz there are about 30 male homosexuals in 
warsaw who are willing to join the association and a much larger 
group which would support it 
kozakiewicz said he was approached last year by a small group of 
homosexuals and was asked for help in winning permission for an 
association he said he met personally with gen czeslaw kiszczak 
minister of the interior to discuss the matter 
he received word that it was approved wednesday from deputy 
health minister jerzy bonczak he said 
homosexuality is legal in poland and persecution of homosexuals 
is unheard of but it is much less open than in western countries 
and homosexuals have complained of intolerance and bigotry 
for the first time in poland last year four representatives of 
the nascent gay movement appeared on television on a latenight 
talk show intimate talks they spoke frankly about their 
problems but appeared only with their backs to the camera 
the unwillingness of homosexuals to identify themselves has been 
considered one obstacle to the governments efforts to combat the 
aids virus in poland homosexuals have been asked to volunteer for 
blood tests under an ambitious government program to counter the 
disease which has claimed at least three lives in poland

the federal communications commission voted 
thursday to impose the first fine under its decency standards on a 
missouri television station for broadcasting a pandering and 
titillating sex comedy during prime time 
the fcc voted 21 to levy the maximum 2000 fine on kzkctv a 
uhf station in kansas city for showing the movie private 
lessons at 8 pm a time at which the agency said children were 
likely to be watching 
the movie broadcast may 26 1987 is about a 15yearold boy 
who is seduced by his housekeeper and included scenes in which the 
woman appeared barebreasted the fcc said the scenes were 
neither isolated nor fleeting 
the commission said that while nudity and sexual themes are not 
necessarily indecent their context and treatment in private 
lessons were 
the movie included nudity and scenes depicting sexual matters 
which were dealt with in a pandering and titillating manner the 
commission said 
the story line of the seduction of a 15yearold boy by an 
older woman together with the inclusion of explicit nudity would 
have commanded the attention of children and the sexual references 
would have been readily understood by children who tuned into the 
program the fcc said 
attorney tom davidson representing media central inc of 
chattanooga tenn owner of kzkctv said he was shocked and 
surprised and outraged by the imposition of the maximum fine in 
light of the circumstances 
davidson said the punishment was unfair because the standards 
are vague and this is the first time they have been applied to 
television 
we dont know what is indecent because the standard doesnt 
provide any guidance he said 
the guidelines are being challenged in court by broadcasting 
groups news organizations and public interest advocates as being 
unconstitutionally vague and overbroad 
media central has not decided what action to take davidson 
said station officials have said the movie was edited for 
television by an inexperienced editor and violated its own 
standards for good taste but that they took immediate corrective 
action including clarification of the stations policy on nudity 
all three commissioners agreed that the movie was indecent and 
that children are likely to be in the audience before midnight but 
commissioner patricia diaz dennis said the commission has no 
evidence there is a substantial number of unsupervised children in 
the audience at that time 
parents not the commission should bear the primary 
responsibility of deciding what their children should watch at 
night she said 
fcc chairman dennis r patrick said surveys have shown that 42 
percent of all children are watching tv at 8 pm and that it is 
reasonable to assume that there are unsupervised children in the 
audience 
commissioner james h quello said the fccs action was 
significant because this serves notice that we are going to 
enforce indecency standards in regard to television as well as 
radio stations it marked the first indecency finding against a tv 
station and was the first time the agency imposed a fine under its 
tough new standards 
the fcc decided in april 1987 to toughen its existing decency 
standards by applying the wording of a 1978 supreme court decision 
that said indecent material is language or material that depicts 
or describes in terms patently offensive as measured by 
contemporary community standards for the broadcast medium sexual 
or excretory activities or organs 
the commission said indecent material may be aired only when 
there is a reasonable risk that children are not in the audience 
in a subsequent ruling in november 1987 the fcc said it would 
consider that children were not likely to be in the audience after 
midnight previously the fcc had considered 10 pm the cutoff time

presidential nominee 
after reiterating his stance that he has earned serious 
consideration for the post jackson was asked if he has privately 
decided whether he wants the job 
privately yes he replied but as to informing dukakis on 
his point of view he said teasingly no that would be public 
he made the comments to reporters after a preconvention meeting 
with his state campaign chairmen from around the country who are in 
washington for briefings on convention strategy and planning 
jackson then departed for puerto rico where he plans a series 
of appearances over the next three days 
puerto rico has been an object of jackson complaints about 
unfair distribution of delegates during the primary season jackson 
won puerto ricos nonbinding beauty contest primary but all 
57 delegates were awarded to dukakis 
jackson said thursday that no doubt there will be some 
adjustments made in puerto rico in delegate distribution as there 
has been in new jersey illinois and pennsylvania other states 
where he objected to the way delegates were allocated 
the islands governor rafael hernandez colon said thursday he 
was considering jacksons request for some of the delegates 
hernandez colon said we are willing to examine a petition of 
that nature within the context of the need for unity in the 
democratic party and always in coordination with dukakis 
campaign

considered for the position of vice president since he won second 
place in the primaries all over the united states

vote in general elections 
jackson was asked here whether he thinks dukakis is giving him 
fair and serious consideration for the vice presidential spot he

he said however that so far i feel positive about it i 
feel hopeful about it 
regarding the nonpublicized criteria that dukakis is using to 
pick a running mate he said some judgment must be made on some 
criteria which has not yet been established 
jackson listed his own baseline criteria for a running mate 
ability to inspire youth experience in the third world and ability 
to erase traditional discrimination based on race or sex 
although the focus for weeks has been on jacksons vice 
presidential aspirations he is refusing to follow the other 
runnerup candidates in endorsing dukakis before the convention 
thats somebody trying to get me to play some rules that are 
not in the interest of my constituency he said my 
constituency has a reason to continue our campaign to atlanta and 
take an active role in the platform rules and credentials 
committees 
he said he would endorse the ticket at the appropriate time 
if he loses the nomination and said that those who have thrown 
in the towel early they are people who have fainted in the face of 
adversity

linda and tom wolfe discovered 
marylands motto when their son wrote a history report and began 
another campaign to persuade the general assembly to change a motto 
they consider sexist 
the motto in italian fatti maschii parole femine means 
manly deeds and womanly words according to the states 
accepted translation 
there it was right on the seal it is pretty disgusting 
mrs wolfe said recently she and her husband have formed momma or 
modernization of marylands motto association 
since midmay about 400 people have signed the wolfes petition 
which hangs on the cash register at their college park store the 
smile herb shop they hope to have 3000 signatures on the petition 
when they submit it to state officials 
the wolfes are not the first to try to change the motto in 
1978 a joint resolution requested a legislative committee to 
devise a more appropriate state motto 
the motto is incompatible with the equal rights and privileges 
accorded to women by the constitution of the united states read 
the bill which died in the senate 
during the past three centuries scholars have debated the 
mottos proper translation deeds are of more avail than words 
and act boldly but speak softly are among the less offensive 
translations said gregory stiverson former editor of maryland 
manual a handbook of state government 
stiverson believes a corrupt translation has created the mottos 
sexist slant while he favors a change in the traditional 
translation he said state legislative action may prove difficult 
legislators argued at length a few years ago about whether 
maschii should be spelled with a single i a double i 
or end in the letters ij 
in their campaign the wolfes contacted their legislator 
delegate timothy maloney 
frankly im not convinced the motto itself is sexist 
maloney said but if it is we ought to change it he said a 
bill would most likely change the translation not the motto 
my concern is to just change it so that deeds and words are 
not related to genderand so the motto says something 
positive linda wolfe said

syndicated columnist carl t rowan will not be 
charged with assault against a man whom he shot after calling 
police to report a predawn prowler the us attorneys office said 
today 
the young man benjamin n smith 18 of chevy chase md and 
his companion laura bachman 19 of bethesda md pleaded 
innocent to charges of unlawful entry onto rowans property in 
northwest washington 
the us attorneys office said it was referring to district of 
columbia authorities the decision whether to bring weapons charges 
against the columnist 
rowan asked to comment on the days developments told a 
reporter 
i am not saying one word about that decision i think ive 
been very generous in talking to the media and ive said all im 
going to say 
a city police investigation of the june 14 incident revealed 
that 22caliber handgun rowan used was not registered with the 
district of columbia 
us attorney jay b stephens said in a statement that while his 
office believes rowan should be charged with possession of an 
unregistered firearm the city traditionally prosecutes such 
charges 
rowan told authorities that the gun had belonged to his son 
carl t rowan jr a former fbi agent rowan maintained that his 
son had been told by city officials he did not need to register the 
weapon when he left the fbi the districts farreaching 1976 
handgun ordinance says that all weapons must be registered 
if rowan is charged with possession of an unregistered handgun 
and ammunition he could face penalties on each charge of up to a 
year in prison and a fine of up to 1000 
smith and bachman face a maximum penalty of six months in prison 
and a 400 fine on the misdemeanor charges district of columbia 
hearing commissioner j dennis doyle set a trial date of aug 18 
the two had been charged with illegal entry shortly after the 
incident but those charges were withdrawn within hours 
the statement from the us attorneys office said investigators 
had found insufficient evidence to file an assault charge 
against rowan 
rowan has said he called police after hearing noises in his 
backyard investigating and finding four people in his pool 
the columnist said he fired at smith after the young man lunged 
at him smith disputes that saying he was trying to flee when he 
was shot 
wounded in the hand smith was treated and released from a local 
hospital

next weeks communist party conference may name 
new members to the policysetting central committee but it will 
stick to the old practice of closing the door on most of its 
debates an official said thursday 
yuri a sklyarov of the central committees propaganda 
department said the conference opening tuesday could name new 
members to the 300plus member party body that formulates policy 
and signs off on key personnel changes between the party 
congresses which normally are held every five years 
but he did not say definitely that there would be new members to 
replace socalled dead souls 60 to 70 members who have died 
or lost the jobs that entitled them to central committee seats 
since the last party congress in 1986 
for many months after gorbachev announced in january 1987 that 
he would hold the first party conference since 1941 soviet 
officials and journalists predicted it would make sweeping changes 
in the central committee to give the kremlin leader a body strongly 
backing his reforms 
the strength of conservatives who are braking change appears to 
have scaled down the expectations of a sweeping personnel shakeup 
and radical reforms 
many moscow intellectuals now say they expect the conference to 
be more of a dress rehearsal for a proreform congress in 1991 
saying gorbachev may have learned from this experience how to do to 
avoid conservative maneuvering to dominate delegate slates 
sklyarov said thursday that live television coverage of the 
conference will be limited to a broadcast of the opening session 
where gorbachev will set the tone with a report on the present and 
future pace of reform and a report on the closing session 
delegate speeches will be summarized on tv and printed in full 
in newspapers once the speakers themselves have had a chance to 
approve the text sklyarov said 
the arrangements are almost identical to those for the february 
1986 congress and seem certain to disappoint the most outspoken 
reformers who had demanded live tv coverage of the entire meeting 
as a way of making the communist party more accountable to the 
people it rules 
strengthening political accountability and the legal system are 
two declared goals of the 30page conference proposals known as 
theses which have been fiercely debated in the media and at party 
meetings since being approved by the central committee may 23 
the theses contain proposals that could dismantle the vestiges 
of stalinism but are vaguely worded in a possible attempt to fend 
off conservatives 
sklyarov said hundreds of thousands of suggestions based on the 
theses have poured into the central committee which is collating 
them for presentation to the agendasetting presidium of the 
conference 
he declined to specify however who is collating the proposals 
and exactly how the presidium will be selected 
georgian communist party head dzhumber patiashvili said 
important representatives of each conference delegation will huddle 
after all 5000 arrive in moscow on sunday 
those discussions are likely to remain secret ivan d laptev 
chief editor of the government newspaper izvestia said his daily 
would publish details only if they were interesting 
yegor yakovlev a delegate and editor of the proreform weekly 
moscow news said wednesday about 70 delegates will take the floor 
during the conference which soviet spokesman gennady gerasimov has 
said will last through july 1 
but sklyarov and other officials refused to confirm that 
timetable suggesting the duration and agenda of the conference are 
still open 
patiashvili said the 106member georgian delegation is still 
meeting in his republic to decide its platform at the conference 
he said he had not read the radical platforms published by the 
baltic republics of estonia and latvia which demanded a form of 
home rule georgias demands will not be published as a program he 
said but may contain a few similar proposals for more autonomy 
from moscow 
party congresses theoretically are the supreme organ of the 
party usually meeting every five years to name members of the 
central committee and formulate policy party conferences which 
were held infrequently before 1941 but have not been convened since 
then are convened to take up special proposals

a 1944 cargo plane hauled ambassadors instead of 
food supplies thursday to mark the 40th anniversary of the berlin 
airlift the massive allied effort that broke a soviet blockade of 
west berlin 
the berlin airlift changed this city and it changed the 
world said us ambassador richard burt who spoke at west 
berlins templehof airport after arriving from frankfurt thursday 
afternoon on the dc3 plane a civilian version of the military 
c47 transports used during the airlift 
in june 1948 the soviet union sealed off allied road rail and 
canal access to western sectors of berlin an enclave 110 miles 
inside what was then sovietheld territory and is now communist 
east germany 
during the airlifts 15 months us and british cargo planes 
ferried more than 18 million tons of food coal and other vital 
supplies to 2 million hungry people in the alliedcontrolled 
sectors of berlin 
the planes that delivered the supplies came to be known as 
raisin bombers because they frequently dropped raisins and 
candy to the children of berlin 
everything was in short supply food clothing everything 
there was nothing left over from day to day recalled helga 
galler 60 of west berlin one of 400 people waiting at templehof 
for the plane to land 
so when we saw these planes coming these raisin bombers 
we knew we didnt have to worry any longer she said 
accompanying burt were british ambassador sir christopher 
mallaby french ambassador serge boidevaix west german defense 
minister rupert scholz and retired air force col gail halvorsen 
an original airlift pilot 
earlier thursday the ambassadors attended the opening of an 
airlift exhibit in bonn and ceremonies at the us rhine main air 
base near frankfurt many of the berlin airlift flights orignated 
at rhine main 
the airlift began on june 26 1948 and by the time it ended on 
sept 30 1949 more than 277000 planeloads of food and supplies 
were brought into the former german capital 
bitter disputes between the kremlin and the three other 
victorious world war ii allies led to the soviets move to cut 
berlin off from the west 
soviet leader josef stalin staunchly opposed creation of a 
unified german state in the three western occupation zones when 
the allies backed a currecy reform to speed up economic recovery of 
wartorn germany moscow imposed the blockade 
four days after the money reform on june 20 the soviets blocked 
all roads waterways and railway lines 
in response us army gen lucius d clay the military 
governor of the american zone of conquered germany ordered all 
cargo planes available to deliver provisions 
the soviets ended the blockade may 12 1949 but the western 
allies continued the flights until land waterway and rail traffic 
had resumed the airlift cost 200 million

australian prime minister bob hawke charged 
thursday that his countrys farmers are falling victim to a 
transatlantic trade war but president reagan pledged to watch out 
for australias interests while combating european agricultural 
subsidies 
hawke addressing a joint meeting of congress said australias 
producers are finding themselves squeezed out of markets by 
practices which distort prices and levels of production 
as a result he said the us share of the world wheat market 
has climbed from 29 percent to 43 percent while australias slumped 
from 20 percent to 12 percent 
australia must not be given to believe that while we are 
firstclass allies we are in trade secondclass friends hawke 
said 
we believe our relationship entitles us to a fair go in our 
trade with the united states and in competition with the united 
states in third markets he added not i emphasize special 
favors but a fair go 
in agriculture we find ourselves caught in the crossfire of a 
destructive and counterproductive transatlantic subsidies war 
hawke said 
reagan after meeting with hawke at the white house said 
were in full agreement on the need to open up international 
trade in agricultural products a keystone of both our economies 
we also agree on the need to redouble our efforts toward the 
elimination of trade distorting government subsidies of 
agricultural products 
until we achieve that goal he added we will assure that 
any measures the united states may take to counter unfair 
subsidization of agriculture will take fully into account the 
interests of countries like australia 
gaston j sigur assistant secretary of state for east asian and 
pacific affairs said reagan and hawke discussed australian 
concerns about us agricultural trade policies and the 
president reassured the prime minister that it is not our purpose 
to damage the interests of nonsubsidized agricultural producers 
such as australia 
in answer to a question sigur said reagan didnt make any 
very specific commitments as such but merely reiterated the 
commitment that he made to hawke on the issue during their last 
meeting in 1986 
they are still concerned but we feel that we have handled 
their concerns very well he said the president assured the 
prime minister that we were going to continue to watch very 
carefully the australian export situation and that we would not do 
anything as we believe we have not done anything in the past to 
harm australian markets 
the state department official said hawke appreciated the 
presidents remarks on this but said he wanted to be sure that 
we were always watching the prime minister did not allude to 
reagans pledge in his remarks at a departure ceremony 
sigur said the president reported to hawke on the sevennation 
economic summit in toronto from which he returned on tuesday 
reagan sought with little success at the summit to secure european 
support for his campaign to end agricultural subsidies by the year 
2000 
reagan also told hawke that australia is an important ally in 
armsreduction negotiations hawke said his talk with the president 
confirmed the strength and enduring nature of the relationship 
between the united states and australia 
the president called attention to the facilities the two 
countries share in australia and said they are essential to 
deterrence and to the wests ability to monitor soviet compliance 
with arms accords 
in his address to congress hawke made clear that australia has 
no intention of following the lead of its neighbor new zealand in 
barring us warships carrying nuclear weapons from its waters 
the united states has every right to see alliances as a 
twoway street to expect that allies will carry their weight he 
said i assure you that australia is and will remain such an 
ally 
we welcome your ships and aircraft to our ports and 
airfields

out apparently were set by palestinians police said 
but a rarely mentioned fact is that israelis are responsible for 
some of the blazes despite the importance the jewish state places 
on cultivating the land 
settlers living in the occupied west bank burned more than 400 
acres of wheat crops and olive trees in the past month on 
arabowned land near the city of nablus according to palestinian 
farmers 
they said the settlers appeared to be acting in retaliation for 
attacks by arabs during the 6month uprising against israeli 
occupation of the west bank and gaza strip 
the arab farmers complaints were backed by the daily haaretz 
which reported settlers were suspected of setting at least eight 
recent fires in the west bank israeli police officials in the west 
bank said they could not confirm the reports 
in addition some recent fires in israel were set by jewish 
children who acted just for the fun of it police minister 
chaim barlev said on israel radio 
three 9yearold jewish boys were caught this week starting a 
fire in a field near the mediterranean coastal city of tel aviv 
said barlevs spokesman nahum mendel barlev said the three were 
simply mischievous but mendel declined to elaborate 
israeli soldiers are a third group which causes some fires 
troops sometimes unwittingly ignite fields and trees by gunfire or 
flares during target practice or border combat galilee fire chief 
danny hanania told the associated press 
in fact one of the worst blazes wednesday was caused by 
soldiers who shot flares in a grove of avocado trees as they chased 
a squad of palestinian guerrillas near the lebanese border hanania 
said 
he said training accidents were the cause of dozens of fires in 
northern israel in recent months but he declined to be more 
specific the army routinely refuses to comment on damage or 
casualties caused during military training 
most of the fires set since may were inside pre1967 israel but 
palestinians in the west bank also have been victims 
farmer mohammed amran of burein village near nablus said he saw 
2 acres of his wheat crop go up in flames on june 6 after men 
wearing jewish skullcaps parked a van by his field 
i saw three settlers park near my land shortly afterward i 
saw the field engulfed in smoke amran said 
in another case two shepherds employed by abdel moati silwada 
of rash rash village near nablus said they saw two guntoting 
jewish settlers set a fire that razed 2 acres of fig and olive 
groves on june 13 
attorney muna rishmawi of law in the service of man an arab 
affiliate of the genevabased international commission of jurists 
said details of such cases were being gathered for publication

a senateordered investigation may delay 
completion of a study by billionaire businessman h ross perot to 
find ways of saving money at the postal service 
the senate has requested the general accounting office to 
investigate terms of the deal and directed the postal service to 
delay phase two of the contract 
postal officials meanwhile defended the deal thursday and said 
they welcomed the investigation 
although we are aware that adverse statements about the 
contacrt are emanating from wouldbe competitors of mr perot and 
are presenting a distorted view of this opportunity to bring his 
vast business experience to bear on resolving some of our problems 
we believe this contract is an appropriate step that is 
consistent with our ongoing efforts to prepare the postal service 
for the future the agency said in a statement 
the 500000 deal calling for computer specialist perot to 
analyze postal operations and recommend costsaving changes was 
announced june 2 it was to last for 90 days and be followed by a 
second phase in which perot would be paid a percentage of any 
savings the service realized from implementing his recommendations 
its a beautiful arrangement for perot but not so pretty for 
the postal customers said sen carl levin dmich the postal 
service will pay the costs for the first phase then the perot 
company gets a cut of the savings if phase two is successful 
also critical of the the deal which was not opened to 
competitive bids were sens paul simon dill and charles e 
grassley riowa 
the senate resolution called on the gao to look into the 
contract and report back within 45 days it also called on the 
postal service to delay implementation of any second phase of the 
contract for a further 45 days to give the senate time to study the 
gao report 
thus if the study suggests changes in postal operations 
implementation could be delayed by a month or so

a greenhouse that provided herbs from the urban 
jungle for plates in posh restaurants has gone bankrupt after seven 
years 
the demise of glie farms known officially as south bronx 
greenhouse put more than 80 residents of the blighted south bronx 
neighborhood out of work 
theyre no longer there their jobs have disappeared said 
allen morrison spokesman for the port authority of new york and 
new jersey which runs the bathgate industrial park where the herb 
farm once thrived 
this week the sanitation department removed rows of unkempt 
herbs after neighbors complained of the rotting smell but the 
empty greenhouses still may see future harvests 
something will be grown at bathgate in their wake were 
optimistic morrison said thursday 
glie farms was founded in 1981 with the help of a federal 
grant as a nonprofit venture to provide jobs for runaway youths 
after several years it became a forprofit venture building up a 
clientele of 800 restaurants and 15 supermarket chains and grossing 
as much as 250000 a month 
glie farms was a real cinderella story said bob menge the 
purchasing director for the four seasons restaurant in manhattan 
but thats the food business you see so many companies come and 
go 
glie founder gary waldron said his principal problem had been 
difficulty in securing a 15 million loan that he negotiated last 
year to start a farm in puerto rico the company filed for 
bankruptcy a few weeks ago

earlier landslide officials said 
state television said villagers reported hearing people cry out 
for help from beneath the ooze and rubble

thunder the rocks swept away everything in a second said turan 
alemdar a trucker who saw the disaster as quoted by the hurriyet 
news agency 
another witness zeki ilha was quoted as saying i saw the 
mountain coming at me and started running away 
rescuers were hampered by rain another landslide at 8 pm 
forced a suspension of the rescue work but caused no casualties 
the television reported from catak village 500 miles northeast of 
ankara near the black sea

which are blamed on extensive cutting of forests 
enver hizlan the provincial governor said only one body had 
been recovered earlier reports said three were found 
deputy gov haydar ozgun told the associated press by telephone 
the rescue work would resume when landslide experts declared it 
safe the anatolia news agency said huge searchlights were set up

the house on thursday refused to kill a 
proposal barring discrimination in housing for families with 
children 
the house rejected on a vote of 289116 an amendment proposed by 
rep clay shaw rfla that would have stripped the protection for 
families with children from legislation designed to strengthen the 
enforcement of the nations fair housing law 
under the bill families with children under 18 could not be 
refused housing except in retirement communities where at least 90 
percent of the tenants are 55 or older and the facilities are 
specifically designed for the physical or social needs of retirees 
any community renting to those 62 or older would be exempt even if 
it did not provide special facilities 
final action on the bill was delayed as the house recessed for 
the day to attend the funeral services of rep john j duncan 
rtenn in knoxville the bill is expected to be taken up again 
late next week 
senate leaders have said they would take up the bill after the 
house approves it indicating that the legislation may go to the 
white house before the end of summer 
civil rights groups and realtors earlier this week ended a 
20year battle by reaching a compromise to put teeth in the basic 
fairhousing law while still satisfying president reagans concerns 
about constitutional guarantees 
the bill would give the department of housing and urban 
development the power to bring actions on behalf of individual 
victims of discrimination would ban discrimination against the 
disabled and would forbid limitations on renting to families with 
children except in the clearly defined retirement communities 
under the compromise hud would be required to investigate 
complaints of discrimination in the sale or rental of housing and 
it would be authorized to lodge charges if it finds reasonable 
cause to believe that discrimination may have occurred 
at that point there would be an administrative proceeding 
unless either the plaintiff or the defendant requests a jury trial 
either proceeding could lead to imposition of fines or injunctions 
and could be appealed to a higher court 
the compromise language which gives the accused the right to a 
civil trial by jury was introduced by rep hamilton fish jr 
rny and was passed by the house 4010 
the house also passed by voice vote an amendment by rep barney 
frank dmass which would permit the exclusion of an individual 
who threatens the safety of others and one by rep robert s 
walker rpa to take away protection of the law from anyone 
convicted of drug manufacturing 
the shaw amendment would have eliminated the provisions of the 
bill extending protection from housing discrimination to families 
with children under the age of 18 it would have required the civil 
rights commission to conduct a study on the nature and extent of 
housing discrimination against familes with children and report to 
congress within three years

the government has sharply raised the bonuses it 
pays to farms for grain in a major new effort to stimulate 
production and cut imports tass reported thursday 
the decision by the communist partys policymaking central 
committee and the governments council of ministers the cabinet 
reflects the hard push soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev is making 
to invigorate the sluggish soviet economy 
the new drive to breathe life into soviet agriculture comes at 
an important time politically for gorbachev just days before the 
communist party holds a conference to review progress in the three 
years of his program of perestroika or restructuring about 5000 
delegates from around the country are to convene the meeting in 
moscow on tuesday 
bonuses for grain production were introduced last year 
gorbachev a former central committee agriculture secretary 
apparently believed the time was ripe to increase the incentives 
tass the official news agency said the sharp increases in 
bonuses were aimed primarily at stimulating production of 
highquality grains 
the noted bonuses are paid out when the quality of production 
meets the demands of state standards the report said 
the bonus for durum wheat was raised to 150 percent tass did 
not say what the earlier level was this means that if any farm 
produces more durum wheat than the state orders any surplus is 
bought for the regular price plus 150 percent of that price 
bonuses were also raised for increased production of other grain 
products 
the new bonuses are to take effect july 1 but one western 
diplomat familiar with soviet agriculture said he doubts there will 
be any quick results 
its like telling a football team at the end of the third 
quarter that if you win the game youll get a 5000 bonus instead 
of a 2000 bonus it just comes too late said the diplomat 
speaking on condition of anonymity 
soviet grain production has consistently fallen below targeted 
levels and this has forced the country to make large imports last 
years harvest was 2114 million tons this was an improvement 
since larger shortfalls in previous years the united states 
agriculture department estimates soviet grain production this year 
will amount to 215 million tons the targeted level is 235 million 
tons 
under an agreement with the united states the soviet union must 
buy at least 9 million tons of grain annually

striking autoworkers demanding a 50 
percent pay increase assaulted the mayor of the slovenian city of 
maribor on thursday as he tried to calm them down the official 
tanjug news agency said 
tanjug said the workers were angred by a report that most of the 
strikers from the tam truck and military vehicle factory had 
returned to work and mayor ivan cuk tried to soothe them 
instead he hardly managed to escape an assault of several 
angry persons tanjug said without elaborating 
the incident took place in the northern yugoslav city when 
strikers reportedly refused to accept a proposed 75 percent pay 
increase a company spokesman said thursday that about 4000 of the 
employees had returned to work 
tanjug said that 1500 tam workers were joined by 3000 workers 
from three other plants and marched to the center of the city 
it added that the workers began dispersing around noon sources 
said police blocked off one downtown street but no arrests were 
made 
the 5000 employees of tam went on strike tuesday seeking higher 
wages several hundred workers from four other plants in the 
slovenian city joined the walkout in the first such show of 
solidarity reported in yugoslavia 
the belgrade daily politika said as many as 7500 workers were 
involved 
the strikers claim their wages threaten minimum standards of 
living 
yugoslavia is planning to reduce inflation to 90 percent this 
year compared with an average 170 percent last year 
yugoslavias economy a mixture of freemarket elements and 
sovietstyle central planning has been growing at a sluggish rate 
averaging less than 1 percent annually over the past six years 
the government on saturday launched an austerity program that 
included substantial price increases wage cuts of up to 30 
percent and a 239 percent devaluation of the dinar the national 
currency

the house ethics committee announced thursday 
it is launching a formal preliminary investigation into whether 
rep patrick l swindall rga violated the law or house rules in 
seeking a loan that he knew was being financed by drug proceeds 
the panel formally known as the committee on standards of 
official conduct said it had recieved evidence reasonably 
indicating that swindall may have departed from acceptable 
standards in seeking to negotiate the 850000 loan 
secretly taped conversations reported last week by the atlanta 
constitution showed that swindall was advised by an undercover 
agent that the money almost certainly came from drug trafficking 
but he continued to pursue the transaction for a month 
the twoterm congressman was seeking to refinance a construction 
loan on his 12 million home in stone mountain ga near atlanta 
and convert it to a longterm mortgage 
an aide to swindall bill thorne said the ethics committee had 
done what we asked them to do he said swindall had sought the 
investigation and was confident he would be cleared of wrongdoing 
swindall was on his way back to georgia for the weekend and 
unavailable for comment thorne said 
a preliminary inquiry is the first step in an ethics committee 
investigation if the panel finds reason to believe that the 
alleged violation in fact occurred it makes a formal statement of 
the violation and can ultimately recommend disciplinary action 
swindall ultimately backed out of the deal after being told he 
would have to accept the cash loan in person and sign a receipt for 
it 
the only reason i cant do that is i would then be essentially 
laundering yalls money swindall told an internal revenue 
service undercover agent according to the constitution 
in other words if charles lechasney who has subsequently 
been indicted on moneylaundering charges wants to launder yalls 
money fine but i cant do that and to sign a receipt of cash 
would be to do that 
swindall at a town meeting in his congressional district last 
week apologized for his behavior and asked voters to forgive him 
i did entertain the idea and it was wrong swindall said 
but he said he had no intention of resigning and i hope voters 
will find it in their hearts to forgive what i have done 
swindall who faces a tough reelection battle this fall said 
he was tempted to accept the loan because of financial pressures 
stemming from cost overruns on the large new house he was building 
but he said he backed away when he became convinced the 
transaction was illicit 
when it was between myself and my maker i made the right 
decision he said

beryl sprinkel chairman of president reagans 
council of economic advisers took a lot of heat in the months 
after the stock market crash for seeing the world through 
rosecolored glasses and predicting strong steady economic growth 
this year 
many private economists had issued deeply pessimistic 
projections fearing that the oct 19 market collapse when 
investors lost 500 billion in a single day would shock consumers 
into cutting back and topple the country into a recession 
but the actual performance of the economy as measured by the 
gross national product 48 percent annual growth in the fourth 
quarter of 1987 and 36 percent growth in the first three months of 
this year made even the white house estimates look too gloomy 
our rosy forecast wasnt rosy enough the economy is doing 
better than even we expected a smiling confident sprinkel told 
reporters at a white house briefing thursday 
he said the administration now expects the economy to grow 35 
percent yearoveryear in 1988 compared with an earlier 
projection of 29 percent the forecast of average unemployment is 
moving from 58 percent to 55 percent 
and despite fears of inflation by stock and bond traders he 
said hes holding steady on his prediction for consumer price 
inflation of 43 percent and expects only an average increase in 
interest rates of half a percentage point 
president reagan responding to a reporters question at a 
picturetaking session said hes not worried about inflation 
either 
all the evidence shows us that our recovery is going on and 
no there is no great threat of inflation the president said 
private analysts found little fault with the administrations 
new growth estimate but they said its optimistic view of inflation 
fails to take into account the potentially devastating effect on 
food prices of the drought scorching crops in the nations 
midsection 
hes certainly right about better growth but the rest is 
just pie in the sky stuff said michael k evans an economic 
consultant in washington 
sprinkel conceded the drought could have a significant effect 
on food prices but said it is too soon to say how significant 
we cannot guess because i dont know whether its going to 
rain i hope soon sprinkel said 
but the national weather service said thursday that the 
sixto10day outlook for the midwest and great plains calls for 
more hot dry weather 
sprinkel noted however that the farm community generates only 
about 2 percent of the gross national product 
david jones chief economist of aubrey g lanston amp co a 
government securities dealer said i think almost everyone is 
underestimating how devastating the drought can be to food 
prices he noted that food makes up about onefifth the consumer 
price index 
i think the shading of the administrations estimates on 
inflation may involve at least some election year politics in 
addition to economic analysis he said i think what the 
administration is trying to do is present a picture of strong 
economic growth and low inflation as we come into an election 
but sprinkel said our economy is not overheating as 
sometimes feared he said the administration bases its inflation 
predictions on the expectation that economic growth will slow 
somewhat in the remaining nine months of they year from the 
firstquarter pace 
he said growth projections for 1989 and beyond were being 
revised downward slightly to offset the upward revision for 1988 
and the strongerthanexpected growth experienced during 1987 for 
1989 the administration expects the economy to grow 31 percent 
for those of you who are always trying to figure out what we 
are thinking it means we envision some decline in interest rates 
later this year he said

iraq said its warplanes bombed 10 iranian 
oil installations thursday in the heaviest air raids on tehrans 
economic backbone in weeks 
the official iraqi news agency said six production installations 
in the ahwaz oilfields in southwestern khuzestan province were set 
on fire 
later two installations at the bibi hakimah oilfield 120 miles 
to the southeast were bombed and set ablaze ina said the report 
was monitored in nicosia 
another formation of jets hit two pumping stations at the gash 
saran field north of bibi hakimah at about the same time leaving 
them shrouded in flames and smoke the agency said 
ina said its jet fighters flew 113 missions and its helicopter 
gunships 30 missions and all returned safely to their bases 
there was no independent confirmation of the iraqi claims but 
irans official islamic republic news agency also monitored in 
cyprus reported that iraqi jets bombed a residential area and 
labor quarters in the ahvaz area killing one civilian 
the agency said other unspecified areas also were bombed but it 
made no mention of oil installations being hit 
ina denied residential areas were hit saying the bombing was 
confined to striking installations at oilfields and iranian 
military positions 
ina quoted a military communique as saying the raids were a 
message to tehran that it has lost the war in all fields and that 
there is no alternative to save iran from total deterioration but 
to accept peace 
thursdays raids were the first significant attacks on irans 
vital oil installations on land since early may when 
fighterbombers attacked several oil refineries and petrochemical 
plants 
the air force also has attacked several iranian oil tankers in 
the persian gulf in its campaign to choke off irans oil exports 
which tehran needs to pay for its war effort 
iran and iraq have been at war since september 1980 
frenchbuilt iraqi mirage f1s carried out a longrange 
1500mile raid on irans larak island oil terminal in the strait 
of hormuz may 14 
five tankers were set on fire they included the worlds largest 
vessel the 564739ton seawise giant which was badly damaged 
the iraqi air offensive inflicted considerable damage on irans 
oil infrastructure in march and april oil industry and diplomatic 
sources reported refineries were repeatedly hit 
oil industry sources have reported that iran has been forced to 
import unprecedented amounts of refined products such as aviation 
fuel and kerosene because its refinery production has been badly 
reduced 
despite the iraqi raids iran has maintained its oil production 
at around an average of 23 million barrels a day with exports of 
around 14 million barrels a day the respected middle east 
economic survey reported 
thats about the mimimum level iran needs to maintain to earn 
sufficient revenue to keep its war effort going oil revenue 
accounts for some 95 percent of irans foreign exchange earnings 
oil sales earned 20 billion a year in 1983 but plummeted to 
only around 6 billion in 1986 when oil prices collapsed 
the iranians have suffered two major battlefield defeats in 
recent weeks which along with political infighting in tehran and 
economic woes have pushed them on the defensive for the first time 
in several years 
iraqs air force has been concentrating on attacking iranian 
troop buildups in the past few weeks as the land war heated up 
with the iraqi army abandoning its longheld strategy of static 
defense to go on the offensive for the first time in six years

a company said thursday it 
plans to build the first highrise apartment complex in soweto the 
vast black township where tens of thousands of people live in 
shacks because of a housing shortage 
the project envisions 40000 people would be able to live in 
7000 to 8000 apartments in buildings up to 25 stories two dozen 
schools will be built in six threestory buildings nearby 
according to the 230 million plan by the nonprofit foundation for 
community development 
the highest building in soweto where an estimated 25 million 
people live on 40 square miles of low hills is now a 10story 
nurses dormitory 
aside from a few twostory houses in higherincome 
neighborhoods sowetans live on small lots in onestory houses 
many have outside toilets and no bathrooms 
most homes now have running water and electricity but 
squatters relatives and friends of householders live by the 
thousands in shacks sheds and garages 
there are relatively few apartment buildings for blacks anywhere 
in south africa 
the proposed soweto complex would house 40000 people where two 
hostels previously accommodated 4000 
the nonprofit foundation said a studio apartment in the new 
complex would be sold rather than rented and would cost about 
6000 it said that compared to an average 6500 for a serviced 
plot of land without a house in a township 
south africas apartheid laws require blacks to live in 
segregated townships most of them relatively far from urban 
centers where they work under apartheid south africas 26 million 
blacks have no vote in national affairs and have separate schools 
and health services 
antiapartheid activists accuse of the government of restricting 
the available land for black housing to control the numbers of 
blacks in urban areas one result has been massive squatter camps 
the government recently announced a plan to add vacant land to 
the black townships around johannesburg for more black housing one 
proposed community north of johannesburg may be designated as an 
area where people of any race could live

rep roy dyson dmd on thursday labeled as 
absolutely untrue and politically motivated a newspaper 
report that the fbi had dysons aide under surveillance last month 
when the aide committed suicide by jumping from a new york hotel 
there is absolutely no basis in fact to these reports ive 
never been contacted by any investigators no one in my office has 
been contacted none of my friends has been contacted dyson said 
in an interview 
the new york post quoting unnamed law enforcement officials 
said fbi agents were watching the hotel as part of an investigation 
of alleged pentagon fraud and bribery 
the newspaper quoted the sources as saying the fbi was 
monitoring the trip because the event was financed by unisys a 
defense contractor the aide tom pappas committed suicide by

widespread investigation house speaker jim wright dtexas said 
he had been assured that no congressmen are among the targets 
the speaker said yesterday and the us attorney said 
yesterday that no member of congress is a target dyson noted 
i just have to assume that if somebodys leaking this stuff its 
politically motivated and theyre just trying to focus attention 
away from the pentagon and onto capitol hill 
i cant tell exactly whos behind it but if these kind of 
leaks come about and theres no foundation for it i would have to 
assume its partisan it would have be republicans he said 
this is absolutely untrue unfounded and i dont think its 
honorable of people in the executive branch to leak this kind of 
stuff dyson said

newmans own remains paul newmans own 
for now as the lawsuit against the blueeyed star who also operates 
salad king got temporarily tossed thursday 
bridgeport superior court judge howard zoarski declared a 
mistrial in the case of a delicatessen owner seeking some profits 
from the actors food enterprises but the plaintiff said he will 
sue again 
the judge decided on the mistrial after jurors said they were 
unable to ignore depositions that were inadvertently turned over to 
them wednesday the papers had not been admitted as evidence 
he reversed a ruling he made a few minutes earlier when he 
instructed jurors to disregard copies of depositions from westport 
deli owner julius gold and others involved in the case 
a note delivered to the judge just before noon said some 
members do not feel an unbiased opinion can be rendered in light of 
their reading of an amount of the depositions 
after reading the note zoarski said he had no choice but to 
order a mistrial 
gold said a mistrial is one of those things that happens 
and he vowed to pursue the lawsuit he filed five years ago 
attorneys for newman indicated they would file a motion within 
five days asking the judge to decide the case in their favor 
both sides ruled out a settlement 
jurors were ordered not to talk about the case after the 
mistrial but some indicated to reporters that the panel wasnt 
close to reaching a verdict 
joseph grassi jury foreman and a philosophy professor at 
fairfield university said a number of jurors were extremely 
disappointed 
as of tomorrow it the trial would have lasted exactly one 
month and this month has been wasted now grassi said 
the jury which had deliberated eight hours over two days was 
sent home wednesday after its foreman told the court that it had 
received depositions from gold and some defendants and wanted to 
see newmans 
w patrick ryan newmans attorney said wednesday it appeared 
the clerk who took exhibits into the jury room inadvertently also 
took the depositions 
gold alleged that an attorney for newman promised him 8 percent 
of the stock from newmans own inc gold said he contributed 30 
months effort to newmans company and believed his work led to the 
corporations success 
gold sued newman his two food companies newmans own inc and 
salad king inc author ae hotchner and food distributor david 
kalman and kalmans company 
the defendants denied all of the allegations 
newmans own whose products include spaghetti sauce lemonade 
and popcorn has donated 15 million to charity since 1982 
newman said he once considered giving a gift of stock to four 
people who contributed to the food venture but gold was not among 
them he also said he decided not to give away any stock after his 
lawyer advised him against it

trade representative clayton yeutter on 
thursday raised the prospect of us escalation of the 
alreadycostly farm subsidy battle unless progress is made on 
eliminating all subsidies by the year 2000 
yeutter said congress could very likely increase export 
subsidies just as it did in 1985 if it appears that current 
global trade negotiations on the matter are at a stalemate 
sometimes one must have a higher level of confrontation in 
order to achieve progress yeutter said at a news conference held 
during trade talks with americas largest trading partners 
the two days of discussions with trade ministers from japan 
canada and the 12member european community come on the heels of 
the sevennation economic summit in toronto where farm subsidies 
were a major item of dispute 
the allies rebuffed president reagans call for totally 
scrapping subsidies the final economic communique simply repeated 
language calling for further negotiations aimed at reducing 
subsidies rather than eliminating them 
the world leaders directed their trade ministers to keep 
negotiating but officials said they did not expect any 
breakthrough in this round of talks being held at a resort in the 
lake country of minnesota 
the trade ministers reported after the first session thursday 
morning that significant progress was being made in other areas 
particularly a us effort to speed up the process for settling 
trade disputes before the 96member general agreement on tariffs 
and trade or gatt the genevabased organization which governs 
world trade 
the gatt is conducting the current round of trade liberalization 
talks known as the uruguay round because they were launched at a 
conference in that country in 1986 
yeutter and his counterparts were hoping to narrow their 
differences on a variety of issues from trade in services to 
foreign investment so that progress can be made at a key montreal 
meeting in december the halfway point for the current trade round 
however there are fears that the dispute over agriculture has 
become so contentious that it could jeopardize progress in other 
areas 
yeutter said that unless progress is made at the montreal 
meeting pressure will build in congress to further subsidize 
american farmers so they can cmpete on world markets 
he said congressional frustration would probably result in a new 
farm bill being taken up next year rather than in 1990 when the 
current subsidy program is due to expire 
i am not making legislative threats i am just giving you an 
assessment of what could happen yeutter said 
the 1985 farm bill significantly boosted us subsidy payments 
to help american farmers stay competitive on world markets last 
year the us government spent 26 billion on farm support 
programs 
japanese trade minister hajime tamura said his country was 
already upset over the congressional insistence on passing an 
omnibus trade bill this year a version minus the plantclosing 
provision that prompted a reagan veto has begun working its way 
through congress 
tamura said the new bill still contained many protectionist 
provisions to which japan objects 
we have a strong belief that good sense will prevail and the 
president will not sign the bill he said 
reagan has not said what he would do if a second bill reaches 
his desk although congressional sponsors are predicting he will 
sign it 
all nations agree in principle that farm subsidies are a major 
drain on their treasuries but europeans claim that political 
pressures make it impossible to totally eliminate farm support 
programs 
instead they are arguing for an effort to reduce the subsidies 
to a less costly level perhaps onehalf of where supports are 
currently 
western europe the worlds largest food importer in 1970 is 
now second to the united states in the amount of food it exports 
the united states is still the worlds largest exporter of farm 
commodities accounting for roughly 40 percent of the volume of 
wheat and feed grains sold on world markets but since reaching a 
record of 417 billion in 1981 us farm exports steadily 
declined for five years falling to a low of 266 billion in 1986 
they posted a slight increase to 29 billion in 1987 
the reagan administrations push to reduce farm subsidies 
through trade negotiations has generated very little reaction among 
us farm lobbying groups because they believe in part that the 
american stand is just a bargaining position and will not actually 
result in scrapping all subsidies

syndicated columnist carl t rowan will not be 
charged with assault after shooting a youth who had taken a 
predawn dip in his backyard swimming pool the us attorneys 
office said thursday 
instead prosecutors reinstated charges of unlawful entry were 
reinstated against benjamin n smith 18 of suburban chevy chase 
md and a companion 19yearold laura bachman of bethesda md 
smith who suffered a wrist wound in the june 14 incident and 
ms bachman pleaded innocent to the misdemeanor charge before a 
district of columbia superior court hearing commissioner trial was 
scheduled for aug 18 
us attorney jay b stephens said his office found insufficient 
evidence to warrant an assault charge against the 62yearold rowan 
but believed he should be charged with possession of an 
unregistered firearm 
the city government traditionally handles weapons charges and 
claude bailey a spokesman for the district of columbia corporation 
counsel said officials would and decide within a few days whether 
to prosecute rowan 
rowan who has written frequently of the need for stringent 
handgun control refused to discuss the court developments with a 
reporter 
i am not saying one word about that decision he said when 
reached by telephone at his home by the associated press i think 
ive been very generous in talking to the media and ive said all 
im going to say 
rowan told authorities the 22caliber handgun used in the 
shooting had belonged to his son carl jr a former fbi agent 
rowan maintained that his son had been told by city officials he 
did not need to register the weapon when he left the fbi 
the districts farreaching 1976 handgun ordinance says that all 
weapons must be registered possession of an unregistered handgun 
or ammunition carries a maximum penalty of a year in jail and a 
1000 fine 
neither smith nor ms bachman would comment after their court 
appearance but smiths parents criticized rowans handling of the 
incident 
neil smith acknowledged that his son had committed an unlawful 
act by entering rowans yard but he added was that act cause 
for mr rowan to shoot ben and possibly kill him 
dinah smith said her sons judgment certainly showed 
immaturity but mr rowans judgment is appalling 
rowan has said he called police after hearing noises in his 
backyard investigating and finding four people in his pool 
the columnist said he fired at smith after the young man lunged 
at him smith disputes that saying he was trying to flee when he 
was shot 
smith and ms bachman face a maximum penalty of six months in 
jail and a 400 fine if convicted the two had been charged with 
illegal entry shortly after the incident but those charges were 
withdrawn within hours pending an investigation of the case

a family is feeding worms to a nestful of 
baby sparrow hawks after the birds parents apparently abandoned 
them to search for water and food amid the lingering drought 
five baby american kestrels a type of small falcon commonly 
known as a sparrow hawk plopped down at the picnic table of june 
shawvers home in this community monday 
family members have been giving worms to the brownspeckled 
birds which are members of a federally protected species 
sunday i saw a bird out my window that i thought was an 
owl said ms shawver she now believes the bird was probably the 
adult bird just as it was abandoning the nest 
the next day she found the babies who are about 6 inches long 
and will grow to up to 12 inches the birds happily dined on worms 
that the family had gathered to feed a pet turtle she said 
they were gobbling them up like crazy ms shawver said 
because the kestrels like all birds of prey are protected by 
federal law ms shawver notified state game protector jerry 
duckworth duckworth said it was not normal for parent birds to 
leave a nest like that 
more than likely it was the lack of water and insects that 
prompted the birds to abandon the nest duckworth said there 
was not enough food for the parents to survive so they left 
while it is illegal to possess the kestrels dead or alive the 
shawvers will be allowed to feed the baby birds so long as they are 
not confined in any way duckworth said 
the birds are gradually getting adult feathers ms shawver said 
you can see them changing every day she said the female 
is the most aggressive she is bigger than the rest she seems to 
stand up by herself a lot

members of congress and spokesmen for postal 
workers expressed alarm thursday over the shipment of biological 
toxins and other deadly agents through the us mail system saying 
the items are not properly packaged at times 
but officials from the defense department and the centers for 
disease control both shippers of such items defended their 
procedures and said elaborate packaging precautions are taken 
the postal service said it is considering tighter regulations 
that would ban the shipment of some diseasecausing agents and 
microorganisms from its mail service 
the action is being considered because an expected increase in 
such shipments through the postal service could cause a possible 
hazard to postal workers frank henselton assistant postmaster 
general said at a congressional hearing 
the proposed regulation was to be issued thursday followed by a 
45day comment period before a final rule is taken under 
consideration he said many of the shipments of diseaserelated 
agents already are shipped by private overnight carriers 
the postal services assurances did not ease some of the concern 
expressed by members of a subcommittee of the post office and civil 
service committee 
these viruses are intended for warfare theyre intended to 
kill people declared rep barbara boxer dcalif adding that 
they should not go through the regular mail system 
moe biller president of the american postal workers union 
called plans by the us army to expand its shipment of toxic 
materials through the postal system bizarre and a devious 
scheme that should be rejected 
he said that at the very least the postal service should require 
a permit to ship toxic specimens and should require advance 
notice before it is presented for acceptance into the mailstream 
eighteen members of congress sent a letter to defense secretary 
frank carlucci earlier this month expressing their concerns about 
the armys plan to expand the shipment of toxins by registered mail 
from research centers around the country to a proposed testing 
center at the dugway proving grounds in utah 
such shipments said rep nancy pelosi dcalif will expose 
postal workers and the general public to an unacceptable health 
risk she said the army has gone to great lengths to describe 
the safety precautions being taken at the proposed laboratory but 
shows a lack of concern with shipping safeguards 
thousands of toxins and disease agents are shipped through the 
postal service by private laboratories as well as the defense 
department and the cdc witnesses said while the shipments require 
strict packaging in some cases up to five layers of packing there 
still are spills witnesses said 
gerald miss a postal service mail handler from frederick md 
said he and his colleagues frequently have observed shipments that 
are not properly packaged 
miss said that last november he came across a dripping styrofoam 
parcel containing flu vaccine which dripped over his hands and 
onto his apron 
though the spill did not result in an illness it points to a 
potential threat he told the subcommittee

garrison keillor and national public radio 
said thursday they had settled a lawsuit that the star of a 
prairie home companion brought alleging copyright infringement 
the terms of the settlement call for npr through keillor to 
make available free to people who request them 400 cassettes of a 
disputed speech keillor made in october 1987 at the national press 
club in washington 
the speech covered various topics and promoted his book 
leaving home npr which long has transmitted national press 
club luncheon appearances to member stations included the speech 
in its catalog of cassettes for sale 
in his lawsuit filed in minneapolis minn keillor said he 
never gave the radio network permission to use the speech 
it was an expensive suit and they tried to punish me as much 
as possible and make it cost as much as possible by going through 
days of tortuous depositions and after they put us all through the 
grinder as far as they could they agreed to stop doing what i was 
suing them to stop doing he said in an interview thursday 
i never wanted any money from them and there was never any 
money asked for he said i just wanted them to leave my work 
alone 
keillor had sought in the suit to have all unsold tapes 
destroyed and a list of people who had bought the tapes he also 
had asked for unspecified damages and attorneys fees 
npr defended its sale of the cassette saying it handled 
keillors appearance before the press club no differently than it 
handled talks by others 
the nonprofit radio network said it has distributed tapes of 
those events to the public through its cassette catalog since 1979 
and has more than 130 titles 
spoken arts inc of new york which produces and distributes 
some cassettes for npr was included in the settlement officials 
at spoken arts were out of the office and not available for comment 
npr said it believes keillors book publicist was aware when he 
arranged the appearance that cassettes would be distributed and 
that keillor also was aware of the arrangements 
npr thinks it is important to preserve its right to distribute 
programs and cassettes of press club appearances as part of its 
service to the listening public the radio network said 
keillers nationally broadcast variety show a prairie home 
companion which was produced by minnesota public radio and 
distributed by american public radio was discontinued a year ago

new york gov mario cuomo said thursday 
that after a long discussion with a top aide to michael dukakis 
he thinks therell be no quick decision on a democratic vice 
presidential candidate 
meanwhile a political adviser to both cuomo and dukakis said 
the new york governor had agreed to stump the nation in support of 
dukakis presidential campaign 
cuomo said he had talked wednesday with paul brountas who is 
leading the effort to find a running mate for dukakis about the 
vice presidential selection process and came away with the 
impression that it would take awhile 
they do not seem to me the kind of people who would make 
precipitous judgments or very early judgments said cuomo i 
dont expect a quick decision 
cuomo said he and brountas talked about jesse jackson and the 
new york governors role but he did not provide details he noted 
that a dukakiscuomo ticket was not discussed 
thats not even a question said cuomo 
brountas didnt return telephone messages left at his office 
meanwhile former cuomo aide michael del giudice said the 
governor would soon be helping the dukakis campaign in other ways 
the dukakis people want him to talk in other parts of the 
country getting out the democratic agenda and talking about 
dukakis said del giudice a wall street investment banker who 
served as chief of staff to cuomo during the governors first term 
del giudice helped put together dukakis successful new york 
primary campaign 
the former cuomo aide said the new york governor would take a 
very active role in the dukakis campaign and had already 
scheduled speaking engagements in california and florida 
cuomo once considered a possible 1988 democratic presidential 
candidate himself remained neutral through the new york primary 
and didnt endorse dukakis until the primary season ended june 7 
by then dukakis already had the nomination sewed up

the withdrawal of soviet forces from 
afghanistan is well under way with the russians pulling out 
their troops on schedule a senior state department official 
testified thursday 
so far we see no evidence that the soviets do not intend to 
meet their troop withdrawal deadlines on aug 15 and feb 15 
1989 undersecretary of state michael h armacost told the senate 
foreign relations committee 
but armacost resisted demands by sen gordon humphrey rnh 
that the united states immediately appoint an ambassador at large 
to deal with the afghan resistance movement 
he indicated that the reagan administration prefers to wait 
until a fullfledged government emerges that has widespread support 
of the afghan people before extending any sort of official or 
informal recognition 
humphrey who testified before the committee also asked that 
us aid to afghan refugees be doubled 
richard s williamson assistant secretary of state for 
international organizations said emphasis is being put on 
organizing a united nations relief and resettlement program for the 
afghan people some 55 million of whom are refugees in either 
pakistan or iran 
williamson said that in the fiscal year ending sept 30 the 
united states will have made about 142 million in relief funds 
available for afghan refugees 
the state department does not intend to seek a supplemental 
appropriation to provide additional funds for the period because of 
budget constraints he said adding our continuing programs are 
consistent with supportive of and will be closely coordinated with 
the un effort 
he said the united states is encouraging other nations to make 
substantial contributions to the afghan relief effort administered 
by the un 
in our appeals we point out that we are by far the largest 
donor of humanitarian assistance to afghans and that others should 
now assume a major share of the new burden as the refugees begin 
their return home he said 
williamson also made clear that the soviet union is being asked 
to bear a large share of the costs 
it destroyed the country of afghanistan it is obligated to 
pay a major part of the bill to rebuild it he said but its 
contribution to the un must come without strings or any 
requirements that the funds be used to bolster the illegitimate 
kabul regime 
he said the soviets also should help in eliminating the danger 
posed by the thousands of landmines thay have planted on afghan 
territory

massachusetts gov michael dukakis announced his backing 
thursday for 115 million in new taxes to make sure the states 
fiscal base is solid and strong and also faced questions about 
his administrations acquisition of land for a new prison a deal 
now under scrutiny by the fbi 
on the republican side george bush had breakfast with former 
un ambassador jeane kirkpatrick while an independent group called 
americans for bush announced plans to spend 10 million 
supporting him in the presidential campaign 
jesse jackson said hes made up his mind about the democratic 
vice presidential nomination but wont reveal his decision unless 
asked by dukakis 
making two longawaited fiscal decisions certain to provide 
campaign ammunition to the republicans the democratic governor 
announced he had signed a 40 million cigarette tax and favored 
raising another 75 million by bringing the massachusetts tax code 
in line with federal tax law changes 
dukakis said he had balanced nine state budgets a record he 
characterized as in sharp contrast to that of the reagan 
administration 
i think the people of this state and the people of this 
country can recognize when someone is talking about fiscal 
responsibility and someone who is doing it dukakis told a 
statehouse news conference the massachusetts constitution requires 
the governor to balance the budget although dukakis has twice 
inherited deficits 
in statements issued in washington and boston the fbi 
acknowledged it has opened a preliminary inquiry to determine if 
federal laws were violated in connection with a proposal to place a 
new state prison in new braintree mass 
gov michael dukakis is not the subject of an investigation 
fbi spokeswoman kathy bradford said in washington 
residents of the rural community of 800 people waged a bitter 
fight against placement of the mediumsecurity prison in their area 
and some opponents have contended that the current owners of the 
700acre parcel had inside information that the property would be 
chosen as the site of the new prison 
a development firm owned by gary striar and gary jacobson bought 
the land from the seventh day adventist church in 1985 for 3 
million they have offered to sell it to the state for 95 million 
jacobson and his wife contributed 1000 each to dukakis 
presidential campaign the maximum allowed by law 
asked about the deal dukakis told reporters in fall river 
mass the process was as open as it could possibly be we 
have very tough procedures for the acquisition of property 
jacobson and dukakis grew up near each other in the boston 
suburb of brookline 
the governor told a statehouse news conference upon his return 
from fall river that he was unaware who owned the land when he 
chose it as a prison site 
one of them grew up around the corner from me and i remember 
shoverling his parents driveway he said any suggestions that 
the secretary of human services and his staff proceeded other than 
in accordance with the law and strict standards of integrity are 
unfortunate and regrettable 
jackson added a new element to speculation over whether he is 
interested in the vice presidential nomination when he was asked in 
washington whether he had privately made an decision on whether 
hed accept second place on the ticket if it were offered by 
dukakis 
privately yes he replied 
had he informed dukakis 
no he said that would be public 
jackson met with his state campaign chairmen for preconvention 
planning and then flew to puerto rico although jackson won puerto 
ricos beauty contest primary dukakis ended up with all of the 
territorys 57 delegates 
no doubt there will be some adjustments made in puerto rico 
he said 
meanwhile the democratic party made what chairman paul g kirk 
jr claimed was history by settling all delegate challenges before 
the july convention in atlanta 
after the last four disputes involving delegates in indiana 
kansas maine and virginia were settled kirk said it was the 
first time the democrats would open their convention without a 
single delegate challenge 
but disputes over platform issues were far from over 
one of those was highlighted thursday when dukakis was asked if 
he could support jacksons call for an independent palestinian 
state 
no of course not he said 
i support direct negotiations between israel and its neighbors 
and responsible palestinians who recognize israels right to 
exist within its borders dukakis said im going to do 
everything i can as president to create an environment in which 
these discussions can take place 
republican party chairmen from 13 southern states met in 
charleston sc and were told by bush campaign manager lee 
atwater that the vice president would be emphasizing the 
differences between himself and dukakis in the fall campaign 
its obvious to me the democratic party and the dukakis 
campaign has made a very conscious decision to try to make the case 
theres not a lot of difference between the candidates said 
atwater a native south carolinian 
americans for bush unveiled the first of what it said would 
be a series of television commercials supporting bush 
the commercial describes bushs career as a navy pilot 
businessman member of congress un ambassador us 
representative in china and as vice president floyd brown a 
spokesman for the group said 330000 was being spent to air the 
commercial on several cable networks 
bush had no public appearances but he began the day with a 
breakfast with mrs kirkpatrick who is often mentioned as a 
possible vice presidential candidate the former united nations 
ambassador is a favorite of gop conservatives who like her tough 
anticommunist positions on foreign policy

the education department is letting highlevel 
officials get away with abuses for which lowlevel employees and 
program beneficiaries are punished harshly a house subcommittee 
chairman said thursday 
highranking officials have gotten off with slaps on the 
wrist while lowlevel employees and program participants have been 
disciplined or prosecuted to the full extent of the law rep ted 
weiss dny said in opening a hearing on criminal cases 
investigated by the departments inspector general 
our preliminary review of these cases indicates that justice 
is not blind when it comes to corruption at the department of 
education said weiss who chairs the government operations 
subcommittee on human resources 
much of the discussion centered on twoyearold charges against 
madeleine will assistant secretary for special education and the 
estranged wife of conservative columnist george will 
the inspector general james b thomas jr said his office 
recommended that mrs will be criminally charged based on findings 
that she had used a department car and driver for personal 
business had claimed travel expenses that were never incurred and 
had authorized payments to a special assistant in her office for 
four months after terminating the womans employment 
thomas said the assistant us attorney indicated the case would 
be prosecuted but joseph digenova the us attorney at the time 
decided it should be treated as a civil matter mrs will and two 
others involved paid restitution totaling 15000 to the department 
thomas said he wrote two letters asking why the us attorneys 
office had decided not to prosecute some weeks later he received a 
reply citing insufficient evidence of criminal intent and an 
overall lack of merit 
i was uncomfortable with it thomas said of digenovas 
decision when we have sufficient evidence then i feel there 
should be a prosecution 
asked if the treatment of mrs will was comparable to the 
treatment of others charged with similar offenses thomas replied 
the record on that is very mixed 
mary rose deputy undersecretary for management denied that 
there was a double standard of justice at her department each 
case is taken individually she said a number of factors have 
to be considered including whether a person is a career civil 
servant or a political appointee 
guidelines attached to roses testimony said that by law 
willful use or authorization of a government vehicle for other than 
official purposes must be punished by suspension of at least 30 
days or removal rose said willful intent was never proved in the 
will case 
the guidelines say penalties for falsifying an attendance record 
for oneself or another employee should range from a fiveday 
suspension to removal for a first offense the same range was 
recommended for falsifying documents and actual or attempted theft 
of government property 
weiss contrasted wills case with several others all recorded 
in biannual reports to congress by the departments inspector 
general among them 
a department employee pleaded guilty to filing false time 
records involving 2000 she was required to make restitution 
received an 18month suspended jail sentence and was placed on 
three years probation 
a utah man received a suspended jail sentence and paid a 2500 
fine for understating his income so his wife could get a 5000 
student loan 
an employee was fired and another suspended without pay for 13 
days for backdating civil rights reports when they couldnt meet 
timetables set by the department 
a department pool driver was suspended for 60 days without pay 
for using his official vehicle on personal business 
mrs will in a june 22 letter to the washington post said she 
did not know that her former aide was not at her work station while 
her salary was continuing she said she had acknowledged 
responsibility by making full restitution but never did i 
knowingly violate any government regulation 
the letter made available by the education department did not 
address the other allegations

pope john paul ii recalled the evils of 
nazism during a meeting thursday with president kurt waldheim who 
has been accused of being involved in war crimes while serving in 
adolf hitlers army 
foreign diplomats did not attend a speech by the pope to church 
and government officials including waldheim who has been virtually 
ostracized internationally because of his wartime past but 
diplomats warmly greeted the pope at a reception afterwards 
in this year of 1988 i should like to particularly recall the 
great trials and cruel tyranny which austria along with other 
nations had to suffer in the not too distant past john paul 
said in his speech at the beginning of a fiveday visit to 
austria his second since becoming pope in 1978 
amongst the many who were persecuted for religious racial and 
political reasons were large numbers of catholics priests 
members of religious orders and lay people the pope said in an 
ornate ceremonial hall of the hofburg palace 
about 80 people including government officials and church 
leaders attended the gathering the pope delivered his address in 
german 
this year is the 50th anniversary of the anschluss when 
hitler annexed his native country in 1938 the event coupled with 
a war record that continues to dog waldheim has inspired 
controversy and soulsearching waldheim has repeatedly denied 
involvement in war crimes 
in his own greeting waldheim thanked the pontiff for receiving 
him at the vatican in june 1987 a meeting that drew a bitter 
response from jewish leaders because of questions about the 
presidents war service 
the vatican said at the time that john paul was receiving the 
office not the man vatican spokesman joaquin navarro has said of 
the popes trip to austria this is not a political visit it is 
a pastoral visit he was invited by the bishops 
waldheim and his family later posed for pictures with the 
pontiff at the hofburg palace then the pope met privately with 
waldheim for about five minutes but navarro declined to say what 
the two men talked about 
waldheim did not attend a reception afterwards where the envoys 
greeted the pope according to a pool report distributed to 
journalists the pope then retired for the night at the vienna 
archbishops residence 
protests coincided with the popes arrival 
earlier thursday john paul said an evening mass at st 
stephens cathedral as he was about to start american jews 
displayed banners at the windows of a hotel across the square from 
the cathedral the banners said nazi waldheim and dont meet 
waldheim 
police ordered the banners removed 
several hours before john paul arrived rabbi avi weiss of 
riverdale ny and five other american jews demonstrated outside 
waldheims office 
do not embrace waldheim no weiss told a small crowd 
attracted to the demonstration the other five members of the group 
were dressed in blackandwhite striped uniforms similar to those 
of concentration camp inmates 
in new york elan steinberg executive director of the world 
jewish congress issued a statement saying the popes meeting 
with his flock in austria is not what troubles the jewish 
community it is the deliberate inclusion of meetings with kurt 
waldheim on his itinerary 
john paul will make about 20 appearances in austria 85 percent 
of whose 75 million people are roman catholic he visited the 
country for three days in 1983 
waldheim smiling and wearing a blue suit was the first person 
to greet the whiterobed pontiff as he stepped off the special 
alitalia jetliner at schwechat airport 
the pope mentioned several places he will visit including 
mauthausen the nazi concentration camp where 110000 prisoners 
died 
let us when we meet bring before god not only the great and 
burdensome legacy of the past but also the joys and sorrows of the 
present the pope said speaking in german 
waldheim also denounced intolerance intransigence and hate 
among nations religions and classes but made no direct 
reference to the dispute over his past 
most western leaders shun waldheim who was un 
secretarygeneral for 10 years because of allegations of 
complicity in nazi atrocities the charges arose during the 
election campaign two years ago 
waldheim denies wrongdoing but the united states has barred him 
from the country saying it has evidence he was involved in 
deporting civilians while serving as a german army officer in the 
balkans during world war ii 
john paul on the 38th foreign pilgrimage of his papacy also 
will meet with representatives of austrias small jewish community 
and address roman catholics from neighboring communist countries

thirty rickety trucks and buses comprising the 
veterans peace convoy circled the white house on thursday to 
protest administration opposition to their mission of delivering 
the vehicles and tons of food medicine and clothing to nicaragua 
the convoy arrived in washington from laredo texas where 
customs officials seized four vehicles and barred the group from 
crossing into mexico without posting bond and signing an agreement 
that the aging school buses and pickup trucks would be returned to 
the united states 
we have come to take care of the children of nicaragua said 
convoy organizer gerry condon of san francisco we intend to 
lobby and gain support for this convoy to pass we want to feed the 
children not the war 
rep mickey leland dtexas expressed support for the group 
with a resolution introduced in congress on wednesday that the 
treasury secretary should not regulate the donation of articles to 
relieve human suffering in nicaragua 
its wrong to thwart the humanitarian impulses of the american 
people this tradition has sustained us and made us leaders 
throughout the world leland said in a statement thursday how 
ironic it would be to deny assistance to our own neighbors in the 
western hemisphere there are hungry and wounded children awaiting 
this aid people of good will wish to help them we must and we 
will find a resolution 
the treasury department contends that to let the vehicles remain 
in nicaragua would violate a trade embargo 
but condon said reagan administration fears the vehicles would 
land in the militarys hands are unfounded four of the convoys 
original 38 vehicless did not survive the long trip from laredo to 
washington because of mechicanical problems the rest condon said 
are unworthy of military service because of the many miles they 
have on them or would have on them by the time they reached 
nicaragua 
the buses adorned with slogans in english and spanish such as 
help the children on to managua nicaragua or bust and 
bikes not bombs circled the white house to the cheers and 
whistles of about 100 protesters 
convoy spokesman craig merrilees said the group which is made 
up mostly of vietnam veterans would continue its protest across 
the street from the white house as long as it takes but the 
contingent may take the convoy to the state department if elliot 
abrams assistant secretary for interamerican affairs refuses 
their demand that he meet with them by friday afternoon 
ellen bork a state department spokeswoman said the convoys 
request for a meeting was being considered late thursday she 
initially said the convoy should instead contact the treasury 
department which is responsible for enforcing the trade embargo 
the convoy formed after groups from seattle missoula mont 
minneapolis and caribou maine joined in austin arriving in 
laredo on june 7 
the 30 tons of aid carried by the group includes oats and dry 
milk and medical supplies such as crutches and wheelchairs 
another 140 tons of humanitarian aid collected by the group was 
shipped to nicaragua members of the convoy said 
the reagan administration is trying to stop a massive 
peopletopeople humanitarian aid campaign condon said as an 
antinuclear group chanted and beat on drums nearby 
convoy leaders have filed a lawsuit in laredo against the 
customs order

the fund that insures deposits in commercial 
banks could decline by as much as 10 percent the first drop in 
its 54year history after the completion of three large bank 
bailouts in texas this year the chairman of the federal deposit 
insurance corp says 
l william seidman in the text of a speech to be delivered 
friday to the oregon bankers association on friday said the fund 
should start growing again in 1989 after first republicbank corp 
of dallas texas american bancshares and national bancshares corp 
are rescued 
when seidman announced a 1 billion infusion into first 
republicbank in march he noted the fund which had 183 billion 
at the end of 1987 could decline this year for the first time 
since it was established in 1934 
but the oregon speech was the first time he said the loss to the 
fund which expects revenue of more than 3 billion this year 
would likely be limited to 10 percent 
in 1987 the fund posted a small 50 million gain last year 
despite a postdepression record of 184 bank failures failures are 
continuing at about the same pace this year and the fdic is dealing 
with larger institutions 
the agency hopes by midseptember to find a private investor to 
help in its rescue of first republicbank 
the congressional general accounting office says preliminary 
estimates of the ultimate cost of the bailout range up to 2 
billion which would make it the fdics largest ever but it said 
the funds initial outlay could be even greater 
seidman said widespread weaknesses in the oildrilling states of 
texas oklahoma and alaska will continue to be a significant 
burden for the fdic at least for the short run but the fdic fund 
is sufficient to deal with the problems we can foresee at this 
time

the judge in the irancontra case complained 
thursday about more delays in bringing oliver l north to trial and 
called on the reagan administration to speed up the 
declassification of necessary documents if it wants the case to go 
forward 
the highest levels of the government have to make a decision 
as to whether this case is going to go or if its not going to 
go gesell said during a hearing on the problems posed by reams 
of secret government documents collected by independent counsel 
lawrence e walsh 
the judge expressed frustration over walshs request for a 
onemonth delay in getting 150000 pages of secret documents 
cleared by an interagency task force 
if you cant get a trial going soon there isnt going to be a 
trial gesell warned both sides during the hearing in us 
district court 
gesell said he was not ready to schedule a trial of the former 
white house aide even though he had been preparing to set a date 
i anticipated when i came on the bench of issuing a trial date 
notice tomorrow im not going to do that the case isnt ready 
the judge said 
gesell suggested that attorney general edwin meese iii designate 
a justice department official to review the situation to help the 
administration decide whether it is ready to release secret 
documents or whether the case has to be dismissed 
the judge questioned whether we wont need to have a clear 
decision from the administration itself that they want to try this 
case or they dont want to 
walsh said he already has consulted with deputy assistant 
attorney general john martin about the secrecy problems and would 
meet with other senior justice department officials 
some 82000 pages of classified documents many from the 
national security council where north worked until he was fired in 
november 1986 already have been turned over to the defense for 
pretrial review 
of that group walsh said a much smaller number but still a 
large number of documents will be relevant to the case 
the prosecutor repeated previous assertions that the batch of 
unprocessed 150000 pages from the cia or the justice department 
contained little that would be relevant to the defense case 
walsh said the task force composed of representatives of 
agencies that originate the documents needs more time to mark the 
portions of the documents that must be redacted before they can be 
introduced at trial 
gesell said he had deferred to the interagency task force out of 
concern for national security concerns about disclosing the 
documents in open court 
but the obstacles keep arising the judge said 
although he expressed confidence they are not trying to 
torpedo the case or help the case the task force members are 
not in the position to judge the larger implications of the case 
gesell said 
the judge said a highlevel political decision is needed on what 
material the administration will allow to be disclosed in court 
on wednesday gesell had ordered north to specify by july 11 
what secret government documents he intended to disclose in court 
to defend the charges against him 
north along with former national security adviser john m 
poindexter and arms dealers albert hakim and richard v secord are 
accused of conspiring to illegally divert usiran armssale 
profits to the nicaraguan rebels during a ban on such aid 
the judge has ordered four separate trials north was designated 
as the leadoff defendant by walsh 
the issue involves classified documents that north and 
ultimately his three codefendants would be allowed to introduce 
into evidence to rebut the charges 
under the classified information procedures act a defendant 
must notify the government of secret documents he wants to disclose 
in court 
the judge then decides whether the documents are indeed relevant 
to the case under the law gesell can order the substitution of 
secret documents that government doesnt want released with 
statements of facts the material would prove if presented to the 
jury 
he can also dismiss the charges if there are too many secret 
documents that the government wants withheld from the case 
an alternative to dismissing all the charges would be to force 
north to stand trial on some of the counts contained in the 
indictment that wouldnt require extensive use of classified 
documents 
these might include charges that north lied to congress about 
his role in the covert effort to help the nicaraguan rebels and 
allegations he obstructed a presidential inquiry into the 
irancontra affair by destroying documents 
walshs request to delay production of the remaining documents 
and a defense complaint about the slow pace of pretrial discovery 
prompted gesell to convene the hearing 
among other things the defense complained that it has yet to 
receive any of the government documents that walshs investigators 
were allowed to look at but could not copy these include relevant 
pages of president reagans diary and schedule

the senate appropriations committee voted 
thursday to give victims of rape or incest the right to federally 
funded abortions 
the panel voted 1514 to defeat a motion to delete the 
provision which had been added earlier this week by a subcommittee 
to the fiscal 1989 spending bill for the departments of health and 
human services labor and education 
the office of management and budget in a letter to committee 
members said presidential advisers would recommend a veto of the 
139 billion bill if it includes the abortion provision 
the sponsor of the motion sen lowell weicker rconn argued 
before the committee that denying medicaid funds to poor women 
for what is legal in this country makes no sense 
the annual spending bill usually contains a provision saying 
abortions can only be paid for under the federalstate medicaid 
program when the womans life would be endangered by carrying the 
fetus to term 
the version approved by the committee would return the law to 
its status before 1980 the same provision was added in 1986 in 
committee but removed on the senate floor 
the 1989 spending bill is expected to reach the senate floor 
next month 
omb called the new abortion provision a medicaid expansion that 
diverges from longstanding policy on this issue 
weicker called the omb letter a waste of power that diverts

two more soviet envoys were expelled or barred 
from canada on thursday in a spy squabble and a soviet embassy 
spokesman said his side would take further retaliation 
the latest action by canada brings to 19 the number of soviets 
expelled or barred from returning to the country since tuesday the 
soviets have expelled or barred five canadians 
the soviets were accused of seeking military and industrial 
secrets and trying to infiltrate canadas intelligence agencies 
canadas external affairs department said col grigori 
stepanovich roublev a topranking military attache at the soviet 
embassy in ottawa was expelled thursday and given until monday to 
leave 
a former second secretary at the embassy sergei mikhailovich 
kashtanov was told he can never return to canada 
the government also announced it will cut by three the total 
number of soviet diplomats assigned to canada 
the reduction in accredited soviet diplomats brings to 60 the 
official soviet diplomatic complement in canada 
within minutes of the orders issued thursday spokesman 
vyacheslav bogdanov at the soviet embassy said there is no doubt 
whatsoever that there will be retaliation by moscow 
the most serious rift in canadiansoviet relations in a decade 
began tuesday when prime minister brian mulroneys government said 
eight soviet diplomats and officials had been expelled and nine 
others formerly posted in canada would not be allowed to return 
moscow retaliated wednesday by expelling two canadian diplomats 
and barring reentry for three others alleging espionage 
a statement thursday from canadian foreign minister joe clark 
said the espionage allegations against the canadian diplomats in 
moscow are totally without justification it said the latest 
expulsions follow soviet espionage activities in canada which 
have obliged the canadian government to expel the soviet 
officials 
the statement gave no details of the alleged spying by roublev 
and kashtanov but clarks press secretary paul frazer told the 
associated press they were involved in unacceptable activities 
the usual euphemism for spying 
frazer said roublev has been in canada since may 1985 while 
kashtanov served in canada from february 1981 to august 1985 
asked why they had not been expelled earlier frazer said we 
think our response is appropriate in the circumstances 
he said the soviet ambassador was called in thursday and 
informed of the latest action he was also told that canada was 
willing to put the matter behind us if moscow did likewise 
frazer said 
the last wave of mass expulsions was in 1978 when 13 soviet 
diplomats were expelled for trying to recruit a royal canadian 
mounted police intelligence officer as a double agent 
the canadian broadcasting corp said the latest soviet spy ring 
tried to infiltrate a usowned military contractor in montreal 
paramax electronics which has access to highly classified american 
naval technology 
paramax a subsidiary of detroitbased unisys corp is building 
the combat systems for six new canadian frigates and the radar 
sonar and communications systems for six other frigates 
a soviet translator at the international civil aviation 
organization in montreal yuri smurov provided useful 
information leading to the breakup of the spy ring clark said 
wednesday 
smurov has now defected and asked for asylum for himself his 
wife and daughter christina a fifth grade pupil

the greenhouse effect global warming of 
the earth is here but the current drought and heat wave over much 
of the united states cant be blamed on it a scientist told a 
senate panel thursday 
however similar heat waves and droughts can be expected much 
more often as a result of future warming said james e hansen a 
climatologist at the national aeronautics and space 
administrations goddard institute for space studies in new york 
city 
hansen told the senate energy and natural resources committee 
there is only a 1 percent chance that he is wrong in blaming rising 
temperatures around the world on the buildup of manmade gases in 
the atmosphere 
for unknown reasons the earth has been getting warmer for more 
than a century though with cooler intervals the four warmest 
years on record have been recorded in the 1980s and without what 
hansen called an improbable cooling for the rest of the year 1988 
will break all records 
though there has been much speculation by scientists around the 
world that the warming resulted from the greenhouse effect 
hansens statement is the most definite yet 
syukuro manabe soil specialist at the geophysical fluid 
dynamics laboratory of the national oceanic and atmospheric 
administration said it was more likely that the current drought 
was the result of natural fluctuations than the greenhouse warming 
it is an example of the kind of drought that will occur more 
frequently as the global warming become larger he said 
many studies have said global warming could bring drastic 
changes in weather including more rainfall at low and high 
latitudes and more drought in between with drastic shifts in 
possible crop patterns 
a major report from the world meteorological oganization and the 
united nations environment program earlier this month concluded 
that without a major effort to fight warming global temperatures 
could increase by 054 degrees fahrenheit per decade until the 
middle of the next century and sea levels could rise by a foot 
tropical temperatures wouldnt change much at all but in canada 
the change could be two or three times as large as the average 
extreme temperatures would occur more often hansen earlier 
calculated that instead of the typical one day a year with 
temperatures above 100 degrees fahrenheit in washington it 
reached 101 on wednesday the year 2030 could see 12 days dallas 
would see 78 such days instead of 19 
gases emitted by modern civilization notably carbon dioxide 
from the burning of fossil fuels but also methane nitrous oxide 
and the chlorofluorcarbon gases that major nations agreed last year 
to reduce trap heat from the earths surface that normally would 
be radiated out to space just as the glass over a greenhouse traps 
the suns heat inside 
carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere are 10 percent 
above 1958 levels and 25 percent above concentrations believed to 
prevail in 1790 when the industrial revolution brought the first 
widespread burning of coal in industry to fire the new steam 
engines 
if we could magically reduce annual emissions of carbon by 
about 3 billion tons we could stabilize the content of the 
atmosphere said george m woodwell director of the woods hole 
research center in massachusetts it is well within reach no 
question about that 
the problem has the potential for turning the world into a 
form of chaos not greatly different from that produced by global 
war he said 
sen wendell ford dky concerned about his states coal 
industry asked physical chemist william r moomaw of the world 
resources institute a washingtonbased policy research 
organization if technology could not reduce the harmful emissions 
im trying to find a way to use a resource we have ford 
said 
moomaw replied i would argue the resource we have in most 
abundance is the potential for using fossil fuels more efficiently 
at much lower cost than building any form of power generation

the late leonid i brezhnevs oncemight image 
fell a little farther thursday a white marble mansion built for 
brief visit he paid to baku will be turned into a wedding palace 
azerbaijans communist party built the mansion which overlooks 
the caspian sea for the soviet leader so he would have an 
appropriate place to stay during a visit to the southern republics 
capital in 1982 
he stayed only two days and the building has been unoccupied 
since according to reports by state television and the official 
news agency tass 
this beautiful white marble building is well known to all baku 
residents but hardly any one of them can boast of being in it even 
once a television correspondent said on vremya the evening news 
program 
he said the azerbaijan party central committee acted under the 
principle of social fairness in deciding to convert the mansion 
soon mendelssohns march will ring out here for thousands of 
newlyweds the correspondent said as images of crystal 
chandeliers flashed across the screen in shots of the mansions 
interior 
in january soviet authorities stripped a city town squares and 
a moscow neighborhood of brezhnevs name 
the twostory mansion surrounded by a high concrete wall was 
built in the days when geidar a aliev a close brezhnev associate 
was party chief in azerbaijan aliev was retired from the ruling 
politburo at the age of 64 on oct 21 1987 ostensibly for health 
reasons but under a cloud of poor performances of industries he was 
responsible for 
the man who replaced aliev as azerbaijani party chief kyamran 
bagirov was fired may 21 apparently for mishandling a territorial 
and ethnic dispute with the neighboring republic of armenia 
bagirovs leadership also received an implied blow on thursday 
the television report said a complex of buildings where azerbaijani 
leaders had lived will be turned into a childrens health center 
the report did not specifically mention bagirov 
the appropriation of lavish private mansions has a long 
tradition here when the bolsheviks seized power in 1917 they 
converted many mansions of russias aristocrats and palaces of the 
czars for public use 
under soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev brezhnevs name has 
become synonymous with what soviet officials call the period of 
stagnation a time when the economy fell into a slump brezhnev 
who ruled from 1964 until his death in 1982 has been blamed for 
fostering complacency and cronyism

at an arraignment thursday before bristol county superior court 
judge george n hurd peabody waived extradition and was turned

massachusetts charge of being a fugitive from justice was dismissed

applicants for civil service jobs no longer 
will have to take written examinations under a new reagan 
administration policy that will rely solely on college grades or 
jobrelated skills tests when hiring new workers 
constance horner director of the office of personnel 
management said in a speech thursday to a group of recruiters that 
the shift will allow the government to pursue highquality 
candidates aggressively because they will be able to offer jobs 
on the spot 
the new policy will allow recruiters to hire any college 
graduate with a minumum grade point average of somewhere between 
30 and 325 on a 40 scale others could be hired after passing an 
individual achievement record skills test related to whatever job 
is being sought 
these tests said the government agency will measure the full 
range of relevant personal qualities required for successful job 
performance 
we want the strongest possible civil service and were going 
to get it under this plan ms horner said 
she said the government needs to change its criteria for hiring 
to compete with private industry in attracting job applicants 
the pool of young workers entering the job market will shrink 
to the lowest since the 1930s during the next decade for 
the federal government this means that competition to hire and 
retain qualified candidates will be fiercer than ever she told a 
recruiting conference 
she said current testing procedures are so slow and 
cumbersome that many of the best candidates for jobs go elsewhere 
horner said she hoped the details of the plan could be worked 
out so the government could begin using the new hiring system by 
next april 
horner said in a speech to a conference attended by government 
recruiters that the new approach to selecting entrylevel workers 
will allow the government access to the most intellectually 
strong academically accomplished candidates and still ensure a 
workplace reflective of american racial and ethnic diversity 
but robert m tobias president of the national treasury 
employees union expressed concern about the change 
hiring on the basis of gpas grade point average is contrary 
to congressional intent that hiring be done through a competitive 
exam that is nationwide in scope he said 
horners proposal also was criticized by her opm predecessor 
donald devine as a sad day for the civil service when it cant 
have an objective civil service exam 
the government has had no entrance test for more than 100 jobs 
since 1982 when the professional and administrative career 
examination was discarded after it was deemed to be racially 
discriminatory 
since then hiring has been done using a temporary special 
process of interviews recommendations and college grades that us 
district judge joyce hens green ruled last year was arbitrary and 
capricious

the veterans administration announced thursday 
the discovery of 10 million military medical records that duplicate 
some lost in a devastating 1973 fire and said it will review 
disability claims that were rejected because of the lost files 
thomas k turnage the va administrator said the agency just 
became aware of the records last week and it was too early to tell 
how many people would be affected but he called the development 
very important 
it opens up new vistas for us it means that these people who 
before had difficulty establishing a basis for their disability 
compensation or the degree of it it means we can have another 
chance to look at it and in effect may come up with a different 
result turnage said 
john sommer the director of the american legion veterans 
affairs and rehabilitation commission whose office helps veterans 
with their disability claims said the development potentially 
could affect thousands of former military personnel 
weve handled many cases where there were no records because 
of the fire and its very difficult to develop additional evidence 
on which to try to get these claims allowed he said in an 
interview 
youd be amazed at the number of people world war ii veterans 
in particular who waited until they retired to file a claim with 
the va and then found the records had been destroyed sommer 
said many of them felt they just didnt want to take anything 
from the government then as they aged they decided to file a 
claim and discovered their records had been burned 
eighteen million military personnel records were destroyed or 
seriously damaged in the july 12 1973 fire at the national 
personnel record center in st louis mo the lost records were 
from the years 1912 through 1959 for army personnel and 1947 
through 1963 for air force personnel with the surnames of hubbard 
and through the letter z 
the duplicate records cover the years 1942 to 1945 and 1950 to 
1954 so will primarily affect veterans of world war ii and the 
korean war 
the records were collected by the national research council a 
private research organization during the 1950s as part of its 
analysis of army hospital records a researcher at the council came 
across the records and notified the national archives said jill 
brett an archives spokeswoman 
ms brett said the records are on computer magnetic tapes 
created by the council from admissions punch cards prepared by the 
office of the surgeon general she said the archives paid the 
council 8662 for the tapes and will reformat them for 
crossreferencing against other files 
the records were not listed by the military officers name but 
included the officers serial number grade and rank age date and 
place of admission as well as disease and diagnosis ms brett said 
veterans applying for monthly disability benefits as a result of 
injury or illness suffered while on active duty must have some 
verification of their claim turnage said he did not have figures 
on how many disability claims had been denied as a result of the 
lost records 
there were 35 million files that turned up for the year 1944 
alone turnage said covering about 24 million people for 1945 2 
million files were discovered covering about 14 million people 
but officials cautioned against the notion that millions of 
veterans would be affected by the discovery rj vogel the vas 
chief benefits director said that most of the veterans who made 
disability claims did so during their initial years after service 
and likely would have filed claims before 1973 
those most likely to be affected by the discovery of the records 
include people with an injury suffered during active duty which was 
aggravated over the years such as a back or heart ailment vogel 
said 
the va said it would immediately begin reviewing disability 
claims rejected because of the lost records the agency said it 
also expected many veterans would come forward seeking information 
about their claims it said those people should contact their va 
regional offices

residents of this small mining 
town dread the end of a truce that gave them nearly three months of 
relative peace from fighting between usbacked rebels and leftist 
sandinista government troops 
both sides have sympathizers here but everyone fears the 
return of the fighters said maria toledo owner of a small food 
shop 
santo domingo nestles between two hills in the central chontales 
province a region which has seen intense fighting during the 
6yearold war between the rebels known as contras and the 
sandinistas 
military sources say the violence has steadily diminished since 
a ceasefire began march 23 
the towns only ambulance once busy transporting war wounded 
now ferries sick children to the local health center residents 
like eudoro castro 43 are now left more or less in peace 
castro explained how hes gotten by in a war that has killed 
26500 people wounded another 25000 and nearly destroyed the 
nicaraguan economy 
the contras come along and demand a cow i give it to them 
castro said the sandinistas come by i give them one too im 
happy they are leaving me in peace now to work 
military sources admit there have been some abuses by sandinista 
soldiers abuses that have helped the contras build a strong base 
of popular support in the region 
the fatigueclad soldiers are still here but now they doze on 
the shaded sidewalks instead of preparing for another round of 
combat 
this region is also headquarters for a contra force of about 
2000 rebels 
military sources who asked not to be identified said the army 
has been in contact with various rebel factions during the 
ceasefire attempting to persuade them to lay down their arms the 
army has had little success the sources said 
the truce is due to expire at the end of june 
the last round of talks between the contras and sandinistas fell 
apart in managua on june 9 and no new talks have been scheduled 
the government has proposed another round in the capital starting 
june 26 but the rebels have not responded to the offer 
meanwhile the people of santo domingo wait dreading renewed 
hostilities

the navy has set up a schedule for retiring 16 
aging frigates in a budgetcutting move that prompted the last 
secretary of the service to resign 
the pentagon said thursday the navy had decided to remove from 
active service 10 of the frigates by the end of this calendar year 
and the remaining six in 1989 
the first eight of the 16 ships being retired prematurely will 
be decommissioned during the month of september the pentagon said 
the last of the 16 will be retired in september 1989 
the final disposition of each ship has not been determined 
the statement added 
crewmembers will be reassigned to other navy commands based on 
manning priorities every consideration will be given to satisfy 
individual duty preferences and minimize family and command 
difficulties 
the 16 ships are operated by more than 5100 sailors 
defense secretary frank c carlucci announced early this year in 
unveiling the pentagons fiscal 1989 budget proposal the navy would 
retire 16 older frigates and postpone indefinitely its goal of 
building a 600ship fleet 
the defense chief said the move was just one of several designed 
to shrink us military forces rather than maintain a hollow 
force that wasnt ready to fight 
that decision was roundly and publicly criticized by navy 
secretary james h webb who asserted carlucci and his aides had 
ignored realistic budget alternatives he advanced saying he could 
not work for carlucci under the circumstances webb abruptly 
resigned in february 
thursday the pentagon said the navy was preparing to begin the 
decommissioning of the brookeclass and garciaclass frigates in 
september due to fiscal restraints 
the pentagon also acknowledged however that four of the 16 
ships slated for retirement were now in the midst of overhauls in 
each case the overhauls will be completed before the ship is 
retired 
the navy said the four overhauls were costing a total of 785 
million and were under way before the decision was made to retire 
the ships the service also estimated it would cost 112 million 
to mothball the vessels or 700000 per ship the navy declined 
to estimate how much money it would save in operating costs 
it released the following schedule for decommissioning

the federal communications commission agreed 
thursday to consider measures designed to curb abuses in a 
broadcast license renewal process that allows extortion and sham 
applications by license challengers seeking profitable 
settlements 
the fcc commissioners voted 30 to consider changes in the 
system by which radio and television station owners renew their 
licenses and defend themselves against charges by competing 
companies that apply for the license to run the station 
the licensechallenge process is aimed at bringing to the 
commission legitimate issues related to a station owners 
qualifications 
but commissioners said they were concerned that some license 
challengers may have no interest in running a broadcast station and 
may file competing applications or petition the agency to deny an 
incumbents license only so they can profit from a financial 
settlement 
fcc chairman dennis r patrick said the commission will not 
tolerate extortion or sham applications 
the fcc said it would consider whether to limit the amount of 
money an incumbent licensee could pay a challenger to withdraw a 
competing application or to prohibit such payments altogether 
the agency also will consider requiring competing applicants to 
identify financial contributions from those backing the application 
the fcc also will consider changes in its policy of granting 
stations renewal expectancy to give the industry more 
stability such status is currently awarded based on a stations 
past service to its community 
patrick said he wanted to develop a policy with the least amount 
of secondguessing of a stations programming decisions

a twinengine plane that skidded to 
a stop on its nose in an abandoned airfield thursday was carrying 
half a ton of cocaine the largest shipment ever seized on the 
island police said 
six people were in custody for questioning and helicopters were 
still combing the area late thursday for another who escaped 
police spokesman tony santiago said no charges have been filed 
police said the cocaine shipment was the largest ever 
intercepted on its way to puerto rico they estimated its street 
value at 720 million 
direct to puerto rico this is the largest to date santiago 
said last august more than 2000 pounds of cocaine were found in 
the steel beams of more than 20 shipping containers bound for 
florida

weve been having meetings all week and weve decided the best 
thing is to get the show on the air 
as of thursday night nbc would not confirm that letterman was 
going back on the air 
johnny carson went back on the air last month without his 
writers he is writing his own monologues 
the tonight show starring johnny carson and late night 
went into reruns when the writers went on strike four months ago 
letterman a member of the guild would not be violating the 
strike by going on the air in his capacity as a performer 
odonnell said if the writers do not get a waiver and letterman is 
on his own he will make casual remarks at the beginning of the 
show then interview guests 
odonnell said letterman attended wednesday nights meeting of 
the writers guild of america east where a vote was taken on the 
latest contract offer by the producers 
the vote was not yet final thursday night but supporters of the 
contract conceded they did not have enough votes to end the strike 
lettermans show had previously sought an independent contract 
with the guild but that plan was scrapped because the show is a 
production of nbc

police formed a tight ring thursday around 
the goldencrusted shwedagon pagoda this buddhist nations holiest 
shrine where student protesters set up a strike center 
students in green sarongs the uniform of high school students 
tried unsuccessfully to enlist residents of rangoon in a march to 
the hilltop pagoda the march did not take place 
demostrations also were reported in pegu about 50 miles north 
on the rangoonmandalay railroad classes were suspended at the 
main schools in mandalay the nations secondlargest city but no 
disturbances were reported 
rangoon spent its third night under a 6 pm6 am curfew and a 
ban on public meetings which were imposed after street violence in 
which nine people were killed by official count 
university students have led three major rounds of protest since 
october the first since 1974 against the 26yearold regime of 
gen ne win whose economic policies and wars on ethnic minorities 
have impoverished this southeast asian country 
hundreds of people have been arrested and western diplomats say 
100 may have died in street violence most in rioting march 18 and 
since 
witnesses said police closed the pagoda to the public at 5 am 
and surrounded the grounds on which protesters established their 
strike center wednesday 
students began arriving at the shrine wednesday morning after 
authorities shut down the rangoon institute of technology some of 
the last worshipers to leave said about 500 students were there 
but the figure could not be confirmed 
no information was available on the student demands or what was 
happening inside 
shwedagon pagoda sits on a hill in rangoons northern suburbs 
its gilded central stupa or tower soars 325 feet above a temple 
base adorned with more than five tons of gold 
burmese are almost fanatically devoted to the shrine which 
legend says was founded 2500 years ago it has survived wars 
earthquakes and the british occupation during which it was a 
center for anticolonial nationalists 
residents reached by telephone in mandalay about 380 miles 
north of rangoon said classes were suspended at mandalay 
university the medical college and the government technical 
institute the action appeared to be precautionary since no 
trouble was reported 
similar reports from pegu said an overnight curfew was imposed 
wednesday after students and other rioters destroyed or heavily 
damaged government buildings vehicles and cooperative stores pegu 
was the seat of several ancient kingdoms 
western analysts say restrictions on individual freedoms and 
poor economic conditions are spurring the protest 
although burma is rich in resources and has an educated 
populace its per capita annual income of less than 200 puts it 
among the poorest nations ne wins burmese way to socialism 
mixes military control socialism and few dealings with the outside 
world 
most merchants in rangoons sprawling market districts closed 
their shops at noon thursday for fear of looting if violence 
resumed some government employees went home before normal closing 
hours 
attendance was minimal at high schools and the education 
institute the only center of higher learning still open in 
rangoon teachers were told to continue classes regardless of the 
attendance level 
no major incidents have been reported since the curfew took 
effect tuesday a few street vendors and drivers of taxis and 
rickshaws have been arrested for going out before 6 am but were 
reported freed after warnings 
the latest trouble began tuesday when 5000 students and other 
protesters in rangoon fought police with stones 
students at several institutions demonstrated peacefully last 
week for legalization of student unions and release of detained 
comradesd the government closed the school and the government 
responded with violence 
trouble began last october when the government declared much of 
the currency in circulation to be invalid and did not offer 
compensation on march 18 after several days of unrest police and 
soldiers quickly crushed a rampage in downtown rangoon by students 
and other protesters 
a government panel announced only two deaths and said 625 people 
were arrested but diplomatic sources told reporters in bangkok 
thailand as many as 100 people have been killed since october 
many of those arrested have been released

a federal agency is investigating an 
arson fire at a georgia warehouse owned by the same company whose 
massachusetts plant was ravaged by fire over the weekend routing 
25000 people from their homes 
while the federal bureau of alcohol tobacco and firearms was 
looking into the georgia warehouse fire thursday georgia 
investigators were on their way to springfield to take a look at 
the burnedout plant springfield fire department spokesman giorgio 
placanico said 
well probably go down there too placanico said 
firefighters in protective suits continued carting barrels of 
chloride out of the remains of the 18thcentury mill thursday as 
ambulances stood by in case pockets of fumes overwhelmed the 
workers 
the springfield plant burned for four days spewing a 
threemilelong gas cloud across the city of 170000 and forced 
thousands out of the neighborhood before firefighters controlled 
the last of several fires monday 
the first fire apparently was sparked by rainwater that fell 
through a window of the advanced laboratories inc plant and mixed 
with chloride tablets that the plant makes for swimming pools 
causing a violent reaction the later fires are under investigation 
a june 10 fire at a weatherking south inc warehouse in 
doraville ga owned by the same company also appears to be 
accidental said chuck johnson a spokesman for the dekalb county 
public safety department 
but the second fire tuesday in georgia was clearly the work of 
an arsonist he said there was no other way that fire could have 
started he said in a telephone interview 
the arson fire destroyed the 30000foot swimming pool supply 
warehouse which also housed offices johnson said 
the unusual number of fires here and up there have forced us 
to make the connection johnson told the unionnews of 
springfield we think they are associated and so weve called in 
the bureau of alcohol tobacco and firearms to help us 
an agent with the bureau said investigators are working only on 
the georgia fires and have not been called in to help with the 
springfield investigation which is being handled by the city arson 
squad 
but he added that the federal investigators are keeping watch on 
what the springfield fire officials turn up 
nobody can say yet whether these fires were arson or 
accidental said agent terence mcardle but we are keeping an 
eye on it when two company plants have chemical fires we are 
interested 
no one was hurt in the georgia fires which released a small 
amount of chlorine gas but forced no evacuations 
an estimated 275 people have gone to springfieldarea hospitals 
for treatment since the first fire ignited friday but none of the 
injuries has been reported to be serious 
advanced laboratories and weatherking south are both wholly 
owned subsidiaries of aquafab industries inc of new york a pool 
supply firm owned by john p perreira of east greenwich ri and 
boca raton fla and robert m petrin of coventry ri according 
to records filed with secretaries of state in massachusetts and 
georgia 
the massachusetts department of environmental quality 
engineering has released records showing that since april 1986 
state officials have investigated a series of incidents at the 
plant including charges that the firm was illegally dumping 
chlorine chemicals in a nearby pond 
an attorney for the company has said the owners will have no 
comment until the damage from the fire has been assessed

us agriculture secretary richard lyng said 
thursday federal programs will provide relief for droughtstricken 
farmers but governors meeting in emergency session questioned 
whether those methods were adequate 
during a brief appearance before the 10 governors who gathered 
for the daylong conference lyng promised the federal government 
will do what is needed to minimize the severity of the damage 
but the agriculture secretary also reminded the gathering that 
there were several existing aid programs already in place and he 
stressed repeatedly that the extent of the damage from the drought 
was yet to be determined 
but gov george sinner of north dakota speaking at a closing 
news conference said farmers in several states already had lost 
much of their cash crops and others have sold off entire livestock 
herds for lack of feed grain 
where i think he lyng is wrong is in the wheat area said 
sinner that damage is done and it is very very severe in the 
livestock feed area that damage is done and its going to grow 
sinner also said government programs must be made flexible 
enough to ensure that farmers hurt by the current drought arent 
disqualified from participating in cropinsurance and disasterloan 
program because of technicalities 
im afraid were going to lose some farmers he said and 
weve lost enough already in my state 
that message echoed throughout the day 
welcome to the heart of the droughtland illinois gov james 
thompson said in opening the conference we used to be known as 
the heart of the heartland now we are both 
in his speech lyng noted that 1200 counties in 30 states 
already have been granted permission for grazing livestock or 
making hay on governmentrented land normally set aside for 
conservation or cropreduction plans 
he also pointed out that task forces already have been set up 
within the administration and congress to study the consequences of 
the drought the federal governments cropinsurance and 
disasterloan programs could serve large number of farmers once the 
extent of the damage from the drought becomes clear he said 
the situation is still fluid well need a little bit of 
time to learn what the losses are he said 
before he left the conference lyng said he would meet with 
reagan on friday morning to update him on the drought situation 
but several governors suggested the situation in their states 
already demands a morespecific response from the federal goverment 
even if they had different ideas on what the response should be 
illinois thompson said the barge traffic along the mississippi 
river so crucial to agricultural states like illinois was paralyzed 
because of low water levels and proposed he us army corps of 
engineers seek permission to divert water from lake michigan to 
solve the problem 
that proposal however was disputed by wisconsin gov tommy 
thompson 
it might turn out to be more disastrous over the long term 
than the immediate salvation it provides said the wisconsin 
governor 
its an idea we should explore im just saying we should not 
go quickly though 
tommy thompson said restoring last years 50cent price cut on 
federal dairy support programs and blocking a second cut next 
january would do more for wisconsin farmers than anything but 
rain 
given the differing needs of the states represented thompson 
was asked how they would reach agreement on priorities 
thats difficult he said any time you deal with 
agricultural issues everybody has a different agenda but this 
issue is crucial enough for us to find a common ground 
attending the daylong meeting besides sinner and both 
thompsons were the governors of minnesota montana south dakota 
mississippi ohio kansas and nebaska

some watermelons no longer rate as seedy 
characters 
two california companies sun world and petoseed co are 
marketing seedless watermelons which are showing up in 
supermarkets across the nation for the first time 
sun world has launched a national marketing effort for its 
seedless watermelons while petoseed has provided several growers 
with seeds and is promoting hybrid seedless varieties the company 
developed 
the need to spit out the seeds to the juicy fruit has long been 
the pits but the idea of ending such expectorating has been around 
a while too 
the process by which it is produced was developed in the late 
1930s said david marguleas sun worlds merchandising manager 
seedless watermelons didnt catch on then because they were 
very difficult to grow very expensive to farm and production of 
seed for seedless watermelons was produced on a very limited 
basis he added 
dr oj eigsti continued work on developing seedless 
watermelons in oklahoma he had no commercial success until recent 
years when his american seedless corp formed a joint venture to 
have sun world promote and distribute them 
petoseed began a breeding program in 1976 to develop seedless 
watermelons for sale in japan said jim mcconnell the companys 
product marketing coordinator the japanese have eaten seedless 
watermelons produced by their own farmers for more than two 
decades he noted 
petoseed has developed three seedless varieties which have been 
planted on about 600 acres this year 
sun world which markets about 75 californiagrown fruits and 
vegetables testmarketed seedless watermelons grown on 180 acres 
last year then expanded production to 2000 acres this season 
marguleas said 
regular watermelons with seeds were grown on more than 15000 
acres of california farm land in 1986 the last year for which 
state statistics have been compiled the crop that year totaled 
186000 tons valued at 277 million 
sun world seedless watermelons will be available in most major 
markets during the summer said marguleas who was in new york city 
last week promoting the product to food editors 
not only gone are those annoying black seeds consumers also 
found the flavor sweeter and crunchier than the average 
watermelon marguleas said 
barbara buck of the western growers association said sun world 
seedless watermelons will carry a sticker on the side that says 
they are seedless with a disclaimer that says they may contain an 
occasional seed 
consumers will find a couple of other things different in 
comparing seedless varieties with regular watermelons 
both marguleas and mcconnell said seedless watermelons could 
cost two or three times as much as seeded watermelons which now 
range from 9 to 19 cents a pound 
mcconnell said the difficulty in growing seedless watermelons 
and the extra cost will limit their popularity to about 15 percent 
of the market 
i dont see it as taking over the watermelon market he 
said i see it as a specialty item

defense minister yitzhak rabin left 
thursday for a weeklong visit to the united states during which he 
said he would present american officials with plans for the future 
of the israelioccupied lands 
rabin said he would meet with president reagan and other top 
us officials but described his trip as a regular visit 
israeli officials did not disclose rabins itinerary for security 
reasons 
i will take an opportunity before the us elections to thank 
a sympathetic supportive administration and particularly 
president reagan who has done so much for israels security 
rabin said before departing from tel avivs ben gurion airport 
the defense minister said he planned to discuss with us 
officials the middle east situation and the arab uprising in the 
occupied west bank and gaza strip which has claimed the lives of 
211 palestinians and four israelis since it began last dec 8 
im bringing them some plans for the future rabin said 
without elaborating 
rabins visit comes amidst us criticism of israeli policies in 
the occupied territories the latest criticism came thursday when 
us ambassador thomas pickering accused israel of violating 
palestinian human rights 
speaking at bar ilan university near tel aviv pickering called 
on israel to stop deportations administrative detentions house 
demolitions and other measures of what he termed collective 
punishment 
israel has deported 21 palestinians since the uprising began as 
of june 9 at least 2500 palestinians have been served with 
administrative detention orders a measure allowing the army to 
hold a suspect in jail for a period of up to six months without 
trial 
in apparent response to pickerings criticism rabin revealed 
plans to release some palestinian detainees he said between 50 and 
80 prisoners are beingh released every day 
if a village or a family have shown good behavior we are 
going to release some detainees from the area rabin said we 
want to use the carrot as well not only the stick

a federal judge threw out a 24 million damage suit 
thursday against former cia officials contra leaders and cocaine 
traffickers accused of running an armsfordrugs smuggling scheme 
chief us district judge james lawrence king dismissed the case 
against irancontra figures richard secord and albert hakim former 
cia deputy director of operations theodore shackley former maj 
gen john k singlaub and 25 other defendants including leaders of 
colombias violent medellin cartel 
the suit was filed two years ago by the liberal 
washingtonbased christic institute on behalf of journalist tony 
avirgan injured in the 1984 nicaragua bombing aimed at maverick 
contra leader eden pastora 
king said the plaintiffs failed to prove their basic contention 
that a wideranging conspiracy was responsible for the la penca 
bombing that injured avirgan and later threats aimed at covering up 
their involvement 
the trial had been scheduled to start monday 
thats fantastic said shackley in washington when told of 
the dismissal its what i have been saying all along there is 
no basis to the damn thing 
shackleys sentiments were echoed by thomas spencer attorney 
for singlaub and one of the most active defense lawyers in the case 
were elated said spencer now its payback time were 
going to file some actions for malicous prosecution and 
defamation against the christic institute and their attorney 
daniel sheehan 
the christic institute in washington issued a terse response to 
the judges decision 
were going to appeal immediately said director sara 
nelson their spokesman peter dykstra said he felt the decision 
was an effort to delay the case until after the november elections 
although only 13 of the defendants had filed motions for summary 
judgment king said the case was not strong enough for trial 
against the remainder 
the plaintiffs have made no showing of existence of genuine 
issues of material fact with respect to either the bombing at la 
penca the threats made to their news sources or threats made to 
themselves wrote king 
the damage and racketeering suit charged that the defendants 
were members of a rightwing terror network dating to 1959 and 
illegally participated in assassination plots gun running and drug 
trafficking 
other wellknown defendants included contra director adolfo 
calero reputed medellin cartel leaders pablo escobar gaviria and 
jorge ochoa vasquez irancontra figure robert owen costa rican 
rancher john hull and former mercenary sam hall 
the suit was filed in may 1986 six months before the 
irancontra affair became public and many of the names it brought 
to light have been indicted or appeared before congressional 
committees investigating that case 
the suit accused the defendants of funding illegal contra 
activities with drug runs in cooperation with the medellin cartel 
and threatening imprisoning and even killing anyone who threatened 
to uncover the ring 
affidavits filed with the suit say the contra involvement was 
simply the latest venture of what sheehan called an 
offtheshelf standalone selffinancing operation dating to 
the botched bay of pigs invasion and the vietnam war 
according to the suit shackley and others using drug profits 
assassinated officials in vietnam iran nicaragua and other 
nations by keeping the operation off the books they could violate 
federal laws and avoid congressional oversight 
when the reform administration of jimmy carter was elected in 
1976 shackley took the operation completely private to avoid 
scrutiny sheehan says 
the key event in the suit was the may 1984 bombing of a news 
conference held by pastora 
three journalists and five pastora supporters died in the 
explosion although pastora was only slightly injured avirgan was 
seriously hurt and his camera damaged in the explosion allowing 
him and his wife martha honey to file a civil damage suit under 
federal law 
according to the suit that bombing was arranged by shackley 
contra leaders and others angered that pastora refused to join 
antisandinista groups he considered too close to deposed 
nicaraguan dictator anastasio somoza debayle 
all the major figures in the suit have strenuously denied the 
charges 
in a may 6 hearing sheehan accused members of the reagan 
administration of trying to block the suit because of potential 
damage to vice president george bush bush led the cia in 1976 
when sheehan said shackley and others in the agency went private 
with the secret team 
andy messing head of the washingtonbased conservative 
foundation national defense council was initially named in the 
suit but was dropped after a few months 
he denied involvement in any weapons or drug allegations saying 
his foundation emphasizes only humanitarian aid for central america 
acts of legal terorism like this against the us justice 
system should not be tolerated he said they obviously 
couldnt even get close to making their case because it was dropped 
with prejudice 
he said the suit was a polticially motivated suit and named 
innocent people with nefarious people to besmirch the names of 
the innocent people they threw in a lot of nefarious 
characters to give it credence

tall pine trees will shield many sensitive 
operations of an east texas army installation from soviet observers 
arriving in midaugust to watch the burning of mediumrange nuclear 
missiles officials said thursday 
morton thiokol inc the contractor operating the longhorn army 
ammunition plant won a 11 million contract that will allow it to 
burn 74 of about 800 rocket motors being eliminated under a joint 
ussoviet treaty 
the plant about 170 miles east of dallas is one of two sites 
the army selected to burn the pershing missiles banned under the 
intermediaterange nuclear forces treaty 
under the pact a team of up to 20 soviet observers will watch 
the burning and little else 
onsite inspection does not mean that the soviets will get a 
free look at our secrets said lt col allen l germain plant 
commander 
morton thiokol inc officials said they have received the 
blessing of state and environmental officials to burn the missile 
motors through static firings and by openair ignition 
soviet observers mandated by the treaty to watch the burnings 
will arrive at the gregg county airport stay at area motels and 
dine in local restaurants but will have little to do with 
residents company officials said 
we plan no special events or contacts with the community for 
the soviets germain said our contacts will be professional 
a charge we take seriously we have a detailed security plan 
the two superpowers must under the terms of the treaty signed 
by president reagan and soviet leader mikhail gorbachev reduce 
their mediumrange nuclear missiles within three years 
the other armyauthorized burning site in colorado has raised 
the ire of some environmentalists 
dave harris spokesman for the army missile command in 
huntsville ala said colorado officials have no previous 
experience with rocket motor testing and want the military to 
answer questions about the project 
the army conducted a static missile firing in late may for 
colorado officials to establish whether we can meet their 
requirements he said 
data from that firing will be analyzed and released next month 
said harris adding he was confident the armys application for 
missile burning at the pueblo army depot would be approved 
missiles to be burned in texas would be hauled by rail or truck 
from several locations primarily pueblo said george l huffman 
morton thiokol plant engineering manager for the longhorn divison 
at the longhorn plant reporters were taken by bus down 
treelined roads to a signal testing area where missile motors 
will be fired then to a circular field where solid rocket 
propellant will be burned in openair cages 
this is the exact route the soviet vistors will be taking when 
they come for onsite inspection huffman said all they can 
see with any significance is we have a lot of trees said 
huffman 
at the static test site the two pershing stages each about 
nine feet long and 40 inches in diameter will be locked in turn 
horizontally on a metalandconcrete stand and ignited 
each stage contains thousands of pounds of granular propellant 
static firing takes about 45 seconds while openair burning of the 
fuel requires 1015 minutes huffman said but he added static 
firing is environmentally perferred because the combustion is more 
complete 
the plants pine forests will help to muffle noise from the 
rocket motors cornish said

a 49yearold convict who claims he died two 
years ago and should be freed from his life sentence lost his case 
thursday when a judge ruled he never legally died 
jerry rosenberg hoped to convince cayuga county judge peter 
corning that he died during open heart surgery was brought bac 
to life by doctors and therefore had fulfilled his sentence of life 
in prison 
corning ruled instead that rosenberg failed to meet the 
definition of death set forth in 1984 by the court of appeals the 
states highest court it said death occurs when there is no brain 
activity or the heart and lungs irreversibly stop functioning 
as his presence in this courtroom indicates he did not 
die corning said 
rosenberg who was returned to the auburn correctional facility 
after the ruling said he planned to appeal 
during the hourlong hearing rosenberg maintained that the 
definition of death was ambiguous and that two kinds of death 
existed irreversible and reversible 
he argued that he died a natural death when his heart stopped 
during surgery and was revived by artificial means 
the higher courts the supreme court has never defined death 
theyve defined life rosenberg said in a crowded courtroom 
reversible death which is a medical term means they bring you 
back from death to life not life to life 
ken goldman an assistant attorney general presented affidavits 
from doctors that countered rosenbergs claim 
thousands of people undergo bypass surgery recover and are 
therefore not pronounced dead wrote dr erik mitchell onondaga 
county medical examiner 
and the cardiac surgeon who performed the operation on 
rosenberg dr leslie kohman wrote that having a patients heart 
stop during heart bypass does not represent any untoward 
occurrence 
corning asked rosenberg who was convicted for the 1963 murder 
of two policemen if he believed that everyone whose heart stopped 
during heart surgery should be considered legally dead rosenberg

everyone who has heart surgery could collect on life insurance

portauprince haiti ap plainclothesmen briefly arrested 
the nephew of former prime minister martial celestin thursday in a 
crackdown on supporters of deposed president leslie manigat by the 
new military government 
he seems to have been arrested this morning celestin said 
of his nephew alix celestin i have no idea why 
family friends told the associated press that armed men in 
civilian clothes took alix celestin away in handcuffs and stole 
what jewelry they could find in his house 
a few hours later he was released thanks to the intervention 
of a very highly placed person a friend of the family said 
without elaborating 
more than a dozen manigat supporters and their relatives 
including american citizens have been arrested after lt gen 
henri namphy overthrew manigat and proclaimed himself president 
early monday others say they plan to go into hiding 
the coup ended four months of civilian government and manigat 
went into exile 
the military government confirmed several people were detained 
but gave no explanation for the roundup 
the united states has protested the arrests and says at least 
two detainees are us citizens roger savain jr son of former 
information minister roger savain sr and robert benodin a top 
manigat adviser the elder savain also is detained 
radio haitiinter said thursday that benodins wife mireille 
and manigat party officials sandy william and frantz jeanlouis 
also hold us citizenship and are under detention 
on thursday armed soldiers stood guard outside the sacked 
headquarters of manigats progressive national democratic rally 
party the sidewalk was littered with desks campaign posters and 
broken glass 
we saw him namphy on television shaking his uzi 
machinegun said a 21yearold maid speaking on condition her 
name not be used people who dont understand arent afraid 
people who do understand are 
namphy headed a junta that governed haiti for two years after 
dictator jeanclaude duvalier fled to france on feb 7 1986 
namphy turned over power last feb 7 to manigat who won 
presidential elections in january with the armys help 
manigat dismissed namphy as military commander june 17 in a 
dispute over transfers of army officers and put him under house 
arrest 
soldiers freed namphy sunday night captured the national palace 
and sent manigat into exile in the dominican republic which shares 
the caribbean island of hispaniola with haiti manigat said he 
would travel to miami friday and leave for europe over the weekend 
journalists at haitian radio stations say they fear a media 
crackdown and will think twice before reporting controversial news 
haitians still remember the bloody reprisals of last summer 
when soldiers opened fire on unarmed antigovernment demonstrators 
and bystanders killing more than 100 people thugs killed at least 
34 people during presidential elections last nov 29 which were 
aborted to stop the violence 
namphy has shown us what he can do so what will happen is no 
mystery said lucille a hairdresser who spoke on condition she 
not be fully identified 
businessmen fear the armys latest takeover will provoke more 
capital flight and disinvestment by foreign assembly plants which 
employ more than 40000 haitians 
i think things can only get worse now said a wholesale 
businessman who imports canned goods dried fish and other 
foodstuffs for two years he namphy didnt do any good for the 
country i think people have lost all hope of betterment there is 
no more democracy no more progress no more constitution

a bank robber turned jailhouse journalist 
was released thursday from solitary confinement where he was put 
after reporting the federal prison where he is an inmate had become 
a caldron of fear hatred and violence 
dannie m martin 48 was released from the isolation unit at 
lompoc federal penitentiary in southern california where he was 
placed wednesday for his own protection said warden r h 
rison 
rison said the article in sundays edition of the san francisco 
chronicleexaminer which accused him of a gulag mentality 
created a degree of tension in the prisons inmate population 
and required segregating the inmatewriter until an investigation 
was completed 
i could care less about criticism of this administration 
said rison but i have had inmates say that martin is not their 
spokesman and im obligated to make sure he doesnt get himself 
hurt he walks around here rather freely 
the article had the potential to set off a riot rison said 
associate warden paul hofer said an investigation found no 
threat to martin there was some grumbling about the article but 
it was not significant enough to keep dannie in confinement said 
hofer 
while he still was held in the 120man isolation ward at the 
maximumsecurity prison martin said in a telephone interview 
arranged by rison that he was confined in retaliation for his 
article 
there is really no threat to my safety said martin who has 
written 20 articles for the san francisco newspapers sunday punch 
section in the last two years 
i havent encouraged any group demonstration i just depict 
things as they are as long as my articles have veracity i 
should be allowed to depict people the public is entitled to a 
viewpoint other than the stereotype put out by the bureau of 
prisons 
rison said that unless the newspaper allows him to tell his side 
in print he will transfer martin to another federal prison rather 
than risk anger among the inmates 
it is obvious from the prison officials comments that they 
are angry about the content of an article in the chronicle said 
peter sussman editor of the sunday punch section if dannie 
martin is being punished for that reason it is a serious violation 
of the first amendment 
the sunday punch section publishes feature stories and opinion 
columns such as martins sussman said 
rison has never called the newspaper asking to comment but the 
newspaper would be willing to grant him space sussman said 
in his articles martin has never attempted to glamorize or 
apologize for the criminal said sussman 
in the 20 or so articles dannie has contributed to this 
section i have found him to be a sensitive observer and a fresh 
powerful writer with a deep commitment to justice he said

members of the 577seat body either were absent or abstained 
rocard 57 said wednesday he would name a new government as

two days after assembly elections june 12 in which neither the 
socialists nor the conservative coalition won a majority 
some centrist politicians have asked mitterrand to form a 
coalition government but political analysts expected the new 
cabinet to resemble the previous one largely made up of wellknown

im sorry about dennis i thought he was one of a kind said 
milton berle who knew day for 40 years through the tutorage of 
my pal jack benny he became a very good foil and straight man

along very well together said irving fein bennys former

he assumed the name dennis day when he joined bennys radio show 
as a singer in 1939

tv variety shows the remark came from day when a skit situation 
seemed to overwhelm him 
besides his success as a foil day gained popularity as an irish 
tenor with his renditions of danny boy mcnamaras band 
clancy lowered the boom and other ballads another day 
favorite peg of my heart was a ballad he sang for his wife

the foreign ministry on thursday denied reports 
out of washington that china agreed to help solve the cambodian 
conflict by offering asylum to khmer rouge leader pol pot 
ministry spokesman li zhaoxing at a weekly briefing said a 
washington post article last week saying china would give refuge to 
pol pot was highly irresponsible such a report is absolutely 
groundless 
li also denied china is ready to accept a cambodian government 
without the khmer rouge the communist faction it backs with arms 
and supplies 
we favor a fourparty coalition of kampuchea cambodia under 
the leadership of prince norodom sihanouk we are not in favor of 
any single party taking power nor are we in favor of exclusion of 
any other party li said 
us state department spokeswoman phyllis oakley said monday 
that china signaled in private its backing for a cambodian 
government without the khmer rouge which launched a reign of 
terror during its 197578 rule during which more than a million 
people died 
china and members of the association of southeast asian nations 
support a threeparty resistance coalition led by sihanouk and 
including the khmer rouge 
the resistance is calling for the withdrawal of vietnamese 
troops that have occupied cambodia since late 1978 and the forming 
of a fourparty government including the vietnambacked faction 
holding the capital of phnom penh 
little is known of the current activities of pol pot the khmer 
rouge leader during the 197578 bloodbath but both asean and 
vietnam have expressed concern that the khmer rouge might regain 
power after vietnam withdraws and pol pot and other fanatic 
leftists might reemerge 
asked if china supports indonesias plans to host informal 
cocktail party talks in jakarta next month that will for the 
first time bring together the rival factions in cambodia li said 
it is worth giving it a try 
he said china supports all efforts by asean countries for a 
fair and reasonable settlement to the cambodian question 
adding that china believes the rapid withdrawal of all vietnamese 
troops is the key to any settlement 
he criticized vietnams statements that it will pull out 50000 
of its 120000 troops this year and leave cambodia by 1990 or 1991 
saying the timetable was too slow 
this only shows that up to now vietnam has no sincerity to 
settle the question of kampuchea he said 
li said that in the past vietnams proclaimed withdrawals 
turned out to be mere troop rotations people are entitled to 
call for strict international supervision and onthespot 
verification of the withdrawal of vietnamese troops from 
kampuchea

a study published today shows that the acne 
medicine accutane is the first treatment known to prevent skin 
cancer in humans but scientists caution the drug is too toxic for 
routine use 
accutane a vitamin a derivative that can cause birth defects in 
pregnant women sharply reduced skin cancer in a small group of 
people who were at extremely high risk because of an inherited 
genetic disorder the study shows 
while accutane cannot be taken for long periods by most people 
other synthetic forms of vitamin a may someday be routinely used to 
prevent skin cancer in people whose skin has been damaged by years 
of exposure to the sun the researchers said 
in addition vitamin a drugs may someday be used to treat other 
tumors of epithelial tissue such as cancers of the lung stomach 
colon bladder cervix and breast said dr harley haynes of 
brigham and womens hospital in boston 
the odds are that within the lifetime of many people we may 
well be able to develop treatments that reduce the risk of cancer 
in highrisk people he said

a familiar ingredient was missing from this 
weeks economic summit in toronto no one did any japanbashing 
unlike past summits when the japanese sat quietly on the 
sidelines and other countries complained of surging trade deficits 
toronto was more like a corporate board meeting with japan an equal 
partner 
statistics talked on our behalf explained michihiko 
kunihiro chief cabinet counselor on foreign affairs 
he was referring to three interrelated developments in japans 
economy 
over the last three years the value of the yen has doubled 
against the dollar making japanese exports more expensive and 
american imports cheaper second japan has agreed it needs to 
develop its domestic market and thus increase its import most 
important the island nation has promised to work for a gradual 
narrowing of its record trade surpluses 
the performance of the japanese economy led several summit 
partners to compliment japanese prime minister noboru takeshita

the us economy grew at a strong 36 percent 
rate in the first three months of 1988 prompting the reagan 
administration on thursday to make what was once considered a 
toorosy forecast even rosier 
after the october stock market collapse many private economists 
expected a slowdown or even a recession this year they criticized 
as unrealistic white house projections saying the economy as 
measured by the gross national product would grow at a steady 29 
percent pace the same as in 1986 and 1987 
but booming growth in the last three months of 1987 and 
continued strength this year sent analysts scrambling to revise 
their forecasts upward until the administration estimate began 
looking pessimistic

trade representative clayton yeutter on 
thursday raised the prospect of us escalation of the 
alreadycostly farm subsidy battle unless progress is made on 
eliminating all subsidies by the year 2000 
yeutter said congress could very likely increase export 
subsidies just as it did in 1985 if it appears that current 
global trade negotiations on the matter are at a stalemate 
sometimes one must have a higher level of confrontation in 
order to achieve progress yeutter said at a news conference held 
during trade talks with americas largest trading partners

to purchase land in the small massachusetts town of new braintree 
for a state prison but said gov michael dukakis is not the 
subject of the probe for now 
dukakis denied any knowledge of the probe and said his 
administration had been as open as it could possibly be about 
the prison controversy 
the case centers on a proposed prison that has met with vigorous 
opposition in new braintree local officials have charged that the 
dukakis administration tailored a deal because the coowners of the 
700acre property are longtime acquaintances of the governor and

two studies of key cells in the inner ear of 
birds suggest a possibility of developing therapy to correct 
deafness in people such as president reagan caused by exposure to 
loud noises 
in companion studies published friday in the journal science 
teams of researchers report that after exposure to traumatic levels 
of noise both adult quails and young chickens are able to regrow 
damaged cells that are essential to hearing the studies suggest 
that there is a hormone or protein secreted by the damaged cells 
that causes a growth of the new replacement cells 
this is a truly new finding said edward w rubel of the 
university of washington coauthor of a study using adult quail 
we have not found a cure for deafness but we have found 
something in the ear of birds that we havent before thought 
possible

viewers who dont want to stay up half the night 
this fall can get a glimpse of nbcs new latenight talk show host 
sports announcer bob costas when he takes a turn as guest cohost 
on today beginning monday 
on aug 22 costas show later with bob costas premieres 
it will follow late night with david letterman monday through 
friday at 130 am edt 
costas hopes a homey set and varied guest list will quickly 
disabuse viewers of the notion that costas is a sports guy and must 
be doing a sports show 
some of the guests already booked include david eisenhower 
activist abbie hoffman comedians steven wright and martin mull 
talkshow host larry king journalists tom shales and linda 
ellerbee film critics gene siskel and roger ebert sex therapist 
dr ruth westheimer actor chuck norris singers meatloaf and 
johnny cash and jerry mathers as the beaver 
sports figures wont be ignored john madden and bob uecker have 
been booked and costas hopes to get sugar ray leonard and bobby 
knight on the show too 
if we do get sports figures it would be because the interest 
in them transcends sports fans costas said 
were going to get a really good crosssection of people that 
i think will appeal to viewers that have watched the letterman 
show we hope we can keep some of the people that are watching 
letterman at 130 and pick up some strays you know milkmen who 
are getting ready to go to work precocious paper boys 
meanwhile costas is one in a series of fillins for today 
cohost bryant gumbel who is off getting ready for his duties as 
anchor of the networks coverage of the summer olympics costas 
will go to the olympics too and appear on a wrapup that will 
preempt the nbc latenight schedule including his own show 
it has been widely speculated that gumbel wont want to return 
to the earlymorning grind after his highprofile stint in prime 
time so costas along with other guest hosts has been presumed 
under consideration to replace him 
costas predecessors in the recent hostoftheweek series have 
included phil donahue tom snyder and jim lehrer all three are 
consummate professionals in their element but only snyder seemed 
comfortable with the today format 
costas dismisses speculation about the today slot but avoids 
issuing an unequivocal rejection of the idea 
i think the thing that no reasonably intelligent person would 
say no ill never do that stupid thing to say but is it 
something im thinking about doing something that concerns me 
something im pointing toward doing absolutely not 
how well he does next week notwithstanding costas is considered 
to have star potential by nbc whose talkshow king johnny carson 
is approaching retirement age 
and the cushy schedule of later would be hard for costas to 
give up the show is taped one day a week then hes free to 
continue his first love covering baseball and if the show is 
successful and is picked up beyond the current 26show commitment 
costas will move it for the summer to st louis his hometown a 
today job would require him to be in new york almost all the 
time 
im well aware that some very substantial people in this 
business have done that today job and even to be mentioned 
in connection with it is flattering and an honor et cetera et 
cetera costas said 
however i think the most important thing that someone should 
do is do what makes them happy not fulfill somebody elses idea of 
what the next highestranking job is and what the next step up the 
ladder is and what your next ambition should be 
my ambition is to do a good job at what i do and to be happy 
and im very very very happy anytime im at a baseball game

harry cook worries that the 
rolling green countryside of spencers wood is endangered that 
throngs from london 35 miles to the east will pour into tracts of 
houses where now there are trees and meadows 
he heads a group of 450 local residents opposing the 
suburbanization of their countryside in spencers wood and all of 
berkshire county where tiny villages are designated by the 
government as the sites for thousands of new homes for people 
overflowing from crowded london 
the battle of berkshire is a test case in a political 
controversy brewing across southern england where the green belt 
a ring of protected land around london has put housingdevelopment 
pressure on more outlying rural areas like spencers wood 
once the atmosphere goes its no longer country living so to 
speak said cook as he surveyed smokestacks and a sea of 
rowhouses on one side of the highway running through the area and 
the green land on the other 
the issue touches sensitive political nerves 
critics even in prime minister margaret thatchers conservative 
party say that by funneling development to the wealthy southern 
england the government is ignoring the economically ailing north 
and widening national divisions 
environment minister nicholas ridley and developers argue that 
houses must be built where they are needed and thats in the 
south they maintain that denying freemarket forces a cornerstone 
of mrs thatchers policies would dampen southern growth 
this issue is potentially as explosive for the tories 
conservatives as any that has caused rumblings of discontent 
within their ranks during the past decade commented the 
financial times 
at the heart of the controversy is the green belt the 12 
million acres set aside 50 years ago around london to keep the city 
from sprawling to the sea give it a green lung and preserve 
the citys character belts around other cities followed and green 
belts now cover 14 percent of england 
as part of her goal of transforming britain into a 
propertyowning democracy mrs thatcher wants everyone to have 
the chance to buy a home but she could not touch the green belts 
without alienating large numbers of voters in the south her 
electoral heartland 
the planned channel tunnel linking southern england to france 
and the growth of london as a financial capital have sent real 
estate prices soaring and added greater burdens on hospitals and 
other services 
opponents like harry cook say its fine to protect the green 
belts but unfair to make the countryside pay the price they say 
inner cities should be revitalized with new housing 
we think its bad management for britains inner cities to be 
depopulating and green fields to be built over said jerry 
wiggin a lawmaker who opposes his conservative partys development 
policy 
richard bate senior planner for the 60yearold council for the 
protection of rural england cpre says if we continue to have 
major housebuilding and investment in the southeast and not in 
other parts of the country the problem of two nations under one 
government is going to become even greater than it already is 
ridley argues that city dwellers need parks and green spaces 
and gardens too and resent the implication that all development 
can just be dumped in their backyard 
the controversy heated up in february after ridley increased 
estimates of southeast housing needs from 460000 homes to a 
possible 610000 by the year 2000 
weve taken berkshire as a test case because it is the 
county under the greatest pressure the cpres bate said in an 
interview its an area which has seen a doubling of its housing 
stock in the last 30 years where villages have already been 
absorbed into main towns 
a rightwing think tank the adam smith institute has suggested 
reviving green belt land that was once used for industry and fell 
derelict after the conservation area was introduced 
it says up to 40 percent of the belt consists of such brown 
patches and proposes letting developers in provided they also make 
other spoiled areas green again 
harry cook and his neighbors in the meantime worry about what 
they will lose 
small developments already peek from behind the trees and old 
homes of their region 
london already has encroached

after 49 million worth of renovations to 
bring the white house of the confederacy to its civil wartime 
stateliness restorers are welcoming visitors again to the 
executive mansion of another nation 
the house built in 1818 was leased to the confederate 
government for use as the residence of president jefferson davis 
and in it he often mapped war strategy with his generals including 
robert e lee and thomas stonewall jackson 
it gives a glimpse into the life of the souths first family 
while reflecting the decline and death of the confederate states of 
america 
as the war went on the quality of what was served went 
down said david s bundy director of development and public 
relations at the house and the museum of the confederacy next door 
by the end of the civil war he said the white house was 
serving what became known as jefferson davis punch water 
richmond the capital of the confederacy had bought the house 
for 42000 in 1861 
three decades after the war in 1896 it opened as the 
confederate museum but closed in 1976 when its confederate 
collections were moved to the new museum its restoration and 
reopening this month were underwritten by 49 million in private 
corporate state and federal donations 
we feel like the white house is one of the most important 
historical houses in america bundy said it was the executive 
mansion of another nation whether youre from the north or the 
south it played a big part in our destiny 
the threestory classical revivalstyle white house actually 
painted a pale gray stands in the heart of the citys historic 
court end district 
visitors can tread on a recreation of the white carpet on which 
lee inadvertently tracked mud restorers learned the carpet was 
white from a reference davis wife varina made to the incident 
general lee came up from camp one day evidently worn out and 
worried to find mr davis lying quite ill on a divan in a little 
morningroom in which we received only our intimate friends mrs 
davis recalled in her memoirs general lee with a bow and excuse 
for coming in on the white carpet with his splashed boots sat down 
and plunged at once into army matters 
visitors also can see the secondfloor office where davis met 
with lee and jackson to discuss strategy and the front parlor where 
davis entertained the public bundy said 
authenticity was important to those restoring the house the 
only nonperiod pieces in sight are smoke alarms 
most of the furniture in the house was used by the davises in 
the four years they lived there and was donated to the restoration 
effort a painted floor cloth in the round entranceway was very 
trendy at the time 
anything thats not a davis piece is of the period bundy 
said 
most of the gaslight chandeliers in the house are original and 
have been restored we could have used substitutes and 99 
percent of the public never would have known he said 
restorers analyzed the paint on the furniture to determine which 
coat was on top when davis lived in the house 
reproducing textiles throughout the house cost quite a bit 
over 100000 bundy said 
a new york textile reproduction company created a green and gold 
silk for the drapes and an ottoman in the dining room that is 
almost identical to the fabric in place 123 years ago 
we have these original fabrics these are pieces of history 
if we can recreate them we make every effort bundy said 
it was painstaking work copying the original design on graph 
paper dying yarn to match the original colors and handtying 
15000 threads individually to a loom said adriana bitter one of 
the owners of scalamandre a restoration consultant in new york 
city 
the silk left the loom at a rate of only 4 yards in an 8hour 
workday she said the pattern still is not an exact copy because 
the patterns in the new fabric do not repeat at the same rate mrs 
bitter said it could have been done for another 30000 
restorers discovered the house had one more room than previously 
thought a secretarys office adjacent to davis they found a 
joint that indicated where a wall had once been 
among furniture and other items that davis and his family used

discarded plastic already blamed for the deaths 
of hundreds of thousands of birds and fish in the oceans and along 
seashores is spreading to the great lakes 
the virtually indestructible material is becoming not just an 
eyesore but a potential threat to wildlife in the worlds largest 
freshwater system according to researchers and lay observers 
jim mattis of benzonia mich has operated fishing charter 
boats for 15 years in lake michigan he said hes found plastic 
debris floating up to 10 miles offshore some of it in scum 
lines of garbage a mile long 
theres more plastic bags and pieces of visquine a trade name 
for plastic sheeting in the lake than ive ever seen mattis 
said its gotten worse in the last three or four years 
ive heard a lot of people say its just a plastic bag 
they dont realize the damage it can do 
most legislation research and enforcement has focused on a 
different kind of great lakes pollution toxic chemicals that 
threaten widespread areas and can be traced to specific sources 
therere about 1000 different types of hazardous substances 
that are known to exist in the great lakes said cameron davis a 
research analyst with the chicagobased lake michigan federation 
right now toxics and contaminated sediments are the no 1 
thing 
plastic pollution is less fully understood although its 
potential for harm is clear a single shard of plastic sheeting 
sixpack beverage carrier or strand of fishing line can float 
undetected until it strangles fish or birds binds a boat propeller 
or jams an engine intake 
we see the pictures every year we know it happens said 
glen dudderar a michigan state university biologist but we 
dont have any research on to what extent 
the michigan department of natural resources estimated that one 
bird in 100 observed by biologists was entangled in plastic fishing 
line according to a 1987 report by the washingtonbased center for 
environmental education entanglement can also mean ingestion of 
the plastic 
little is known too about another synthetic material 
intentionally put into the lakes fishing nets that are loosed 
accidentally but continue trapping their prey 
ghost fishing has been documented mainly along the atlantic 
and pacific coasts but it also occurs in great lakes waters where 
gillnet fishing is done either by stateregulated commercial 
interests or by indians working under terms of federal treaties 
officials said 
from the fisheries standpoint the worst thing weve got is 
gill nets that break away said asa wright manager of the great 
lakes program of the state dnrs fisheries division 
just last month authorities retrieved a gill net containing 
more than 600 pounds of rotting lake trout the 1000footlong 
44inchwide net probably had been adrift several months in 
southern lake superior investigators said 
bill eger a biologist who works with michigans indian 
fishermen said gill nets occasionally are abandoned or torn from 
buoys in storms or by passing freighters 
but the approximately 350 indians who fish in the 
treatyprotected waters of northwestern lake huron northern lake 
michigan and south central lake superior usually set and retrieve 
their gill nets daily eger said 
since gill nets cost about 1 a yard theyre seldom abandoned 
he said those that arent retrieved tend to ball up and sink 
bearing only the fish trapped on the first day or two after being 
set he said 
it does not continue to catch fish at an exponential rate as 
asa wright would like to have you believe eger said 
charter skipper mattis said plastic refuse poses a threat to 
navigation 
my son last year blew out an engine when a plastic bag got 
sucked up in the intake he said i had a piece two years ago 
an 8foot piece of visquine that got around my prop it 
wouldnt come off it knotted up so bad luckily a shaft didnt 
break 
the governor has signed legislation that will make michigan the 
13th state and the second in the great lakes region after 
wisconsin to require that sixpack beverage carriers be made of 
plastic material that degrades within 360 days of exposure to 
sunlight the bill awaits action in the state senate 
enforcement of antidumping laws is isolated conceded capt 
larry murdock chief of the marine safety division of the us 
coast guards district office in cleveland 
disposal of solid waste anywhere in the great lakes has been 
illegal for years murdock said freighters and other large 
commercial vessels are required to store or incinerate their trash 
rather than dump it overboard a practice common among oceangoing 
ships and blamed for at least part of the plastic pollution at sea 
for the pleasure boaters i dont think youre going to find 
any enforcement murdock said we havent apprehended anyone 
youre talking about an individualtype problem 
department of natural resources biologists have estimated that 
michigans recreational boaters produce up to 26000 tons of 
garbage a year an unknown percentage of that total finds its way 
into the lakes 
the plastics industry has joined government and environmental 
groups in conducting public education campaigns about plastic 
pollution in the great lakes and oceans alike 
brochures describing the harm done to marine life by discarded 
plastic have been jointly distributed by the center for 
environmental education the marine entanglement research program 
of the national marine fisheries service and the society of the 
plastics industry inc an industry group 
the fisheries service and defenders of wildlife another 
washingtonbased environmental group have distributed similar 
brochures encouraging boaters and beach visitors to dispose of 
trash properly 
individuals can do the most to turn back the invasion of plastic 
flotsam said tom martin director of michigans office of the 
great lakes the absolute key thing is peoples individual 
responsibility that it has consequences for the environment

as they size up the outlook for the us economy 
at mid1988 many analysts see good prospects for continued growth 
over the next six months or so 
there are several cloudy spots in their crystal balls however 
thanks to some unusual trends and unfolding events that defy 
measurement 
the drought in the farm belt for one looms as a potential wild 
card whose longterm economic implications cannot yet be gauged 
in addition there is the presidential election coming in 
november the outcome of which seems likely to affect in unknown 
ways the continued progress of an economic expansion that will be 
entering its seventh year about the time the voters go to the polls 
four years ago many forecasters felt safe in assuming that 
president reagan would be reelected and would make no dramatic 
changes in economic policy this time there is widespread 
uncertainty about which candidate will prevail and on what sort of 
platform 
by almost all accounts the economy enters the second half of 
the year in sounder shape than anyone dared hope last winter 
donald straszheim chief economist at merrill lynch capital 
markets projects growth of the gross national product after 
adjustment for inflation at a 36 percent rate for all of 1988 up 
from 29 percent last year 
the economy he said is in transition from being led by the 
19831986 consumer spending boom to being led in 19871989 by trade 
and net exports 
the white house on thursday revised its growth estimate for 1988 
upward to 35 percent from an earlier prediction of 29 percent 
in the view of a good many analysts continued improvement is 
likely in the trade deficit led by the export boom 
it is now clear that the us trade deficit is declining 
said robert barbera at the investment firm of shearson lehman 
hutton inc 
material improvement in us trade and a bottom for the us 
dollar are the most fundamental issues confronting us and world 
financial markets 
one big question that remains for the outlook is whether the 
economy will reach the point where expansion turns into an 
inflationary force 
according to straszheim although growth seems secure for 
1988 rising inflation and interest rates suggest the economy is 
vulnerable to a modest recession in 1989 
allen sinai chief economist at the boston co economic advisors 
inc says the economy has entered the full employment zone 
where capacity of operating facilities and the labor force could 
begin to show signs of strain 
the problem for economic policies in the us is to somehow 
traverse the full employment zone without an unacceptable 
acceleration of inflation and the instability that has always 
created a turning point for the expansion and then a subsequent 
recession he asserts 
if the drought in the midwest continues much longer analysts 
say its effects could start to spread beyond the region and the 
farm economy 
rising prices of basic commodities that become scarcer than 
expected because of the drought naturally evoke visions of 
increased inflation however some observers say the effect may 
more complicated than that 
as david resler chief economist at nomura securities 
international suggested over the next several months rising 
food prices are likely to absorb a growing portion of most peoples 
budgets since food demand is generally insensitive to price 
but this may serve to intensify consumer resistance to price 
increases on other goods thus unless income growth suddenly 
accelerates real consumer spending can be expected to remain 
soft

twelve million pages of army documents dealing 
with vietnam were recently unsealed special correspondent george 
esper who covered the war for 10 years and was the last saigon 
bureau chief for the associated press spent a week going through 
some of the papers for this report 
</TEXT>

secret documents recently declassified and 
opened to public view confirm behindthescenes efforts by 
president lyndon b johnson and top military commanders to 
manipulate american public opinion of the vietnam war and reverse 
growing opposition 
in one memo vietnam commanders were told to make it clear to 
all concerned that expressing criticism to news media 
representatives and others will serve only to aggravate the issues 
surrounding our problems in southeast asia it was signed by adm 
us grant sharp commander of american forces in the pacific 
johnson himself was described in some messages as wanting to 
play down military operations in 1968 so as not to upset efforts to 
get the north vietnamese to enter peace talks 
the 12 million pages at the national archives are onesixth of 
the 72 million pages of army documents that will be released in 
installments the next batch will be released in april 1990 
the papers topics range from battlefield reports to a division 
commanders concern that his troops were taking radios and comic 
books to the front lines making them less vigilant against viet 
cong attack 
but the most significant papers are the exchanges between saigon 
and washington while johnsons sensitivity to criticism and his 
administrations efforts to put the most favorable light on an 
unpopular war were widely reported at the time the papers provide 
an inside view of official thinking 
one particular message signed by gen earle g wheeler 
chairman of the joint chiefs of staff illustrates the 
administrations thrust it was sent jan 31 1968 at the start of 
north vietnams tet offensive which began turning americans 
against their involvement in the distant war 
in the memo gen william c westmoreland was told that 
president johnson wanted him to make a brief personal comment to 
the press at least once each day to convey to the american people 
your confidence in our capability to blunt these enemy moves and to 
reassure the public here that you have the situation under 
control 
but even as westmoreland received the memo the situation was 
chaotic with north vietnamese and viet cong troops attacking more 
than 100 cities and towns on the second day of their threeday 
lunar new year called tet 
they suffered heavy casualties but showed the vulnerability of 
south vietnams cities sending a message to americans that no end 
to the war was near in the two weeks of the offensive more than 
1000 americans were killed increasing frustration and dismay back 
home 
the papers also reveal that johnsons decision two months later 
to halt the bombing of north vietnam in hopes of coaxing the enemy 
to the peace table was instead taken by military officers as an 
opportunity to lay low in bad weather and sway public opinion at 
the same time 
the president appeared on national television march 31 1968 to 
announce the cessation of bombing above the 20th parallel he then 
stunned listeners when he added that he would neither seek nor 
accept the democratic nomination for a second term 
in a memo dated the same day and apparently reflecting prior 
knowledge of johnsons announcement sharp the pacific commander 
pointed out to westmoreland that the bombling halt was timed just 
right 
since the tet offensive support in the us for the war in 
southeast asia has decreased at an accelerating rate sharp 
wrote many of the strongest proponents of forceful action in 
vietnam have reversed their positions have moved to neutral ground 
or are wavering if this trend continues unchecked public support 
of our objectives in southeast asia will be too frail to sustain 
the effort 
weather over the northern portion of north vietnam will 
continue unsuitable for air operations during the next 30 days 
therefore if a cessation of air operations is to be undertaken now 
is the best time from the military viewpoint 
it is hoped that this unilateral initiative to seek peace will 
reverse the growing dissent and opposition within our country to 
the war the initiative will aid in countering foreign criticism 
in another march 31 message wheeler advised westmoreland that 
at a white house meeting that night johnson cited the fact that 
we have been accused in the past of always accompanying peace 
initiatives with increased military activity 
wheeler said the president was aware of ongoing operations to 
open route 9 and lift the north vietnamese siege of the american 
base at khe sanh one of the most widely reported campaigns of the 
war 
the purpose of this message is not to have you stand down 
those operations wheeler told westmoreland however it is 
desired that you your subordinate commanders and your pa public 
affairs people play them low key you and your people should 
take care to describe these operations as being merely in the usual 
run of offensive operations 
the battle to free khe sanh however was hardly usual more 
than 200 marines were killed and 1600 wounded in the 77day siege 
which was lifted april 5 
in the meantime air strikes continued in the less populous 
southern panhandle of north vietnam and the administration failed 
to manipulate the press to its liking when it was reported in 
midapril that us bombers had launched the heaviest air strikes 
of the war in the panhandle johnson was furious prompting a cable 
april 16 from wheeler to secretary of defense clark clifford and 
others including sharp and westmoreland 
apparently the president was considerably chafed by tv and 
radio newscasts to effect that johnson unleashed yesterday 
heaviest air attacks of war against panhandle of nvn north 
vietnam wheeler said the president thinks we are handing a 
case to those who profess that our actions are contrary to his 31 
march speech by providing so much detail to the news media 
sharp and westmoreland suggested to wheeler that if bombing were 
to be renewed beyond the panhandle their commands should decline 
comment to the press responding on may 23 wheeler said 
as i advised you previously the highest authority johnson 
desires the noise level to be kept low in such eventuality ie 
no announcements to the press giving details of weight or effort 
targets struck etc 
i must say westy that your proposal and the rationale behind 
it make good sense specifically that you make no announcements 
but be permitted to confirm that a particular target has been 
struck if such question is asked 
the north vietnamese did agree to peace talks which opened in 
paris may 13 1968 but it was almost five more years on jan 27 
1973 until an agreement was reached ending us intervention in 
the war american forces and prisoners of war returned home 
the opposing vietnamese sides ignored the agreements call for a 
ceasefire and continued fighting until saigon fell to the north 
vietnamese on april 30 1975

the nations rival teacher unions are heading 
to their conventions with differing approaches to school reform but 
closer than ever in their criticism of the reagan administration 
american federation of teachers president albert shanker will 
ask his 3000 delegates at their july 26 convention in san 
francisco to endorse his call for a myriad of experimental 
schools within schools 
mary hatwood futrell the president of the giant national 
education association will seek from her 8000 delegates meeting 
in new orleans july 47 an endorsement of her proposal to create 
an experimental lighthouse district in each state where anything 
goes 
like the rest of the labor movement both the nea and the aft 
have refrained from endorsing a candidate for president 
that could change for the nea as early as next saturday when its 
board of directors meets in new orleans the neas political action 
committee will consider an endorsement on friday 
if it decides to make an endorsement the 19 millionmember nea 
would be the first major union to back democrat michael dukakis 
the aft like its parent aflcio is holding its fire but its 
leaders are not both shanker and rachelle horowitz the afts 
political director will be dukakis delegates in atlanta 
futrell a mondale delegate in 1984 and a political activist in 
her home state of virginia will not be a delegate this time 
around but kenneth melley the neas director of government 
relations said the union will have a contingent of about 250 
delegates in atlanta with a large majority for dukakis and several 
dozen for jesse jackson 
the nea fielded nearly 400 delegates in 1984 at the democratic 
convention 
both unions now are unremittingly hostile to the education 
policies of president reagan and his secretary of education 
william j bennett who has accused teacher unions of trying to 
hijack the school reform movement with extortionate demands for 
more money without increased accountability 
the aft which has criticized reagans education cuts invited 
reagan to address its convention five years ago and heard him 
shower the union with praise for being openminded on things such 
as merit pay and for supporting a rigorous curriculum 
whatever openness the aft exhibited then it has since reverted 
to a stance as critical of merit pay as any taken by the nea 
indeed one of the nations largest experiments with merit pay is 
underway in fairfax county va the 10th biggest school district 
where most of the teachers belong to the nea 
a resolution on education reform that will be debated by the aft 
delegates says many of the reforms launched since the 1983 report 
a nation at risk has been bad of merit pay it says 
traditional merit pay schemes now bearing new names continue to 
rear their unsubstantiated heads 
shanker unlike futrell is still on the white house guest list 
for education events or at least he was until this spring when he 
emerged from a ceremony marking the fifth anniversary of a nation 
at risk to write a barbed open letter to bennett accusing him of 
a major failure of leadership 
instead of leading your troops you kept shooting at them 
shanker said 
futrell said in an interview it took him 3 years to realize 
mr bennett was not an advocate for education 
shanker said he does not regret the aft policy of willingness to 
entertain any and all school reform proposals his affiliates in 
rochester ny dade county fla toledo ohio and hammond 
ind have received wide attention for contracts that give teachers 
more say in school management and peer review but also hold them 
accountable for improved performance 
i think we have fairly widespread acceptance now of things 
that were considered pretty radical a few years ago including 
peer review and wider teacher involvement in decision making 
shanker said 
but he remains deeply pessimistic about the current structure of 
most public schools which shanker contends deliver an inadequate 
education to 80 percent of american students that is why he favors 
radical and widespread experimentation with new forms of school 
organization 
the resolution backed by the afts executive council would put 
the union on record as favoring shankers idea of allowing groups 
of six to 12 teachers the wherewithal to set up their own schools 
within school provided they got the approval of their local union 
and school board and could convince enough teachers parents and 
students to voluntarily sign up for the type of instruction they 
were offering 
futrell said she hopes her lighthouse school district proposal 
will lead to establishment of model districts in all 50 states 
we want them to feel free to experiment what we want is to 
fundamentally and systemically restructure school systems were 
willing to look at everything she said 
at the same time the union would insist that such models not be 
created by topdown fiat but through consensus among all affected 
constituencies parents teachers school administrators business 
she wants to include rural urban and suburban districts and at 
least some of those districts should reflect the racial and 
ethnic makeup of our country 
another issue expected to spur debate at both teacher 
conventions is the tracking of students into classes for students 
with high middle and low abilities futrell has been sharply 
critical of tracking which some researchers say does little good 
for kids at the top and harms the kids at the bottom 
a proposed nea resolution says the national education 
association believes that the use of discriminatory academic 
tracking based on socioeconomic status race or sex must be 
eliminated in all public school settings the association urges its 
affiliates to oppose these practices 
futrell indicated she will ask her delegates to authorize a 
major study over the next year of tracking and ways to devise less 
discriminatory alternatives 
it remains a thorny issue 
i think its very political futrell said we have to be 
honest in some school districts in order to hold on to the middle 
class white students you needed to set up the advanced placement 
or high level classes 
the neas membership has grown in the past year to more than 19 
million including about 15 million public school teachers 
while the aft has 665000 members including about 450000 
teachers there are more than 23 million teachers in public 
schools roughly 15 percent belong to neither union 
futrell is entering her sixth and final year as nea president 
shanker is running unopposed for reelection as head of aft a post 
he has held since 1974

the communist party conference opening tuesday 
will be the 19th such gathering in soviet history and the first 
since 1941 
here are highlights from some past party conferences which 
under present rules can be called at any time to consider urgent 
questions of party policy 
first communist party conference held by russian 
revolutionaries at an exile base in tammerfors finland in 1905 
the year of a bloody unsuccessful uprising that set the stage for 
the collapse of the monarchy 12 years later and the bolshevik 
revolution that brought the communists to power 
seven party conferences were held in paris prague and other 
cities outside russia as revolutionaries plotted the overthrow of 
czar nicholas ii 
1912 the prague conference votes to create an allrussian 
workers newspaper which is today the official party organ pravda 
1924 a party conference held days before the death of soviet 
founder vladimir lenin condemned leon trotsky and his followers 
signaling the rise of josef stalin who was to lead the soviet 
state for most of the next three decades 
1929 the 16th party conference approves the first fiveyear 
plan the keystone of what has become a cumbersome centrally 
managed economy 
the 16th conference also ordered a purge of party ranks that 
presaged stalins mass political repression of the late 1930s 
1941 the 18th party conference orders party organizations to 
oversee the management of industry and transport as the nation 
rushes to prepare for war with germany 
the partys entanglement in practically all governmental and 
economic affairs which grew from the resolutions of the 16th and 
18th conferences is a key target of soviet leader mikhail s 
gorbachevs decentralization drive

no specific agenda has been announced for the 19th 
communist party conference but delegates may consider a wide range 
issues put before them by the policymaking central committee or by 
speakers recognized by the conference leadership 
whether specific recommendations emerge from the debate could 
provide an indication of whether soviet party leader mikhail s 
gorbachev or more conservative forces among the delegates control 
the conference 
the conference starts tuesday and is now expected to last at 
least four days among the matters likely to be raised 
the partys role gorbachev has said he wants to get party 
workers out of the hair of state and industry managers the party 
he said should focus on political and ideological work rather 
than try to rule every aspect of soviet life 
stalinism the conference will play a role in the effort to 
come to terms with the legacy of josef stalin who ran the soviet 
union with an iron hand for nearly 30 years part of that legacy 
has been a cult of personality now condemned he also developed 
the command economcy with all decisions made in the kremlin 
and passed down to individual factories and farms 
party control gorbachevs reformminded followers may press 
for new rules to limit party officials to two fiveyear terms and 
could set a mandatory retirement age perhaps 75 the move would 
shake up the entrenched party bureaucracy that is seen as an 
obstacle to reform and enable gorbachev to bring in new blood to 
help press his modernization program known as perestroika or

workers in commercials for ibms new family of personal system2

pepsico inc has agreed to pay 705 million in 
cash for the soft drink bottling operations of grand metropolitan 
inc the nations thirdlargest independent bottler of pepsicola 
products 
the deal disclosed wednesday is expected to be completed by 
late july and involves territories in the carolinas georgia 
kentucky tennessee and calfornia 
grand metropolitan acquired the operations in 1980 they account 
for about 36 percent of pepsicolas domestic soft drink volume 
but the montvale njbased concern said the bottling 
operations did not fit its strategic business plan for developing 
its core businesses which include hotels retailing foods and 
alcoholic beverages 
although pepsi is a leader in the soft drinks industry we do 
not own the brand and therefore cannot direct its position in the 
marketplace as we do our other brands like smirnoff 
intercontinental and alpo said ian a martin chairman of grand 
metropolitan 
the operations being sold are atlantic soft drink co based in 
columbia sc that holds pepsi cola franchises in the carolinas 
georgia kentucky and tennessee and pepsi cola san joaquin which 
has franchises in central california 
grand met said the companies had combined annual sales of 355 
million in the year ended sept 30 1987 
d wayne calloway pepsico chairman and chief executive said 
the grand met franchises will significantly strengthen our soft 
drink volumes and improve operating profits both this year and 
well into the future 
he said the acquisition will dilute pepsicos earnings for 1988 
by about 4 cents a share in 1987 pepsico reported net income of 
595 million or 226 a share on revenue of 115 billion 
the sale would mean pepsico which is based in purchase ny 
will own bottling operations that account for about 36 percent of 
its domestic soft drink volume up from about 324 percent 
james m griffith a spokesman for pepsico said pepsico was not 
looking to acquire independent bottling operations but became 
interested once the bottlers became available because they are 
located in two very important areas where we are determined to 
strengthen pepsis presence and in some cases border territories 
pepsico already owns 
he said such acquisitions offer some economies of scale 
a spokeswoman for grand met mary carroll said her company was 
approached about three months ago by someone who suggested he may 
be prepared to offer a certain price for the bottling operations 
she refused to identify the suitor 
she said the inquiry prompted the company to consider whether it 
wanted to sell the operations and it subsequently notifified a 
limited number of potential bidders that the operations were for 
sale 
martin said pepsico offered a very fair price 
grand metropolitan is the us subsidiary of grand metropolitan 
plc a multinational company based in the united kingdom sales in 
the united states exceed 10 billion the company said 
pepsico has operations in soft drinks snack foods and 
restaurants

the debt restructuring brazil reached 
with its creditor banks after eight months of tense negotiations 
includes 52 billion in new loans lower interest rates and 
payments aimed at bringing the nation current on its obligations 
brazil on wednesday said it had closed a 58 billion accord 
with its creditor banks to refinance some 64 billion of the 
countrys massive foreign debt 
the agreement ends brazils negotiations with the committee of 
14 banks representing the nations 700 creditor banks which now 
must sign the accord 
brazil has concluded one of the best refinancing accords ever 
reached by a debtor nation finance minister mailson da nobrega 
told reporters at a news conference 
the accord is not a solution to the countrys foreign debt 
problems but it will bring brazil closer to the international 
financial community and remove the obstacles to economic and social 
development of the country he said 
the accord came a year and a half after brazil stopped interest 
payments on the 64 billion in bank debt in order to conserve 
shrinking foreign reserves the nations total foreign debt of 121 
billion is the largest in the developing world 
while interest payments were a crippling 1 billion monthly 
inflation soared to 1000 percent annual levels money reserves and 
the trade surplus dropped dramatically and unemployment skyrocketed 
to about 25 percent 
under the agreement brazil will make a 345 million payment to 
creditors for march interest on friday and by the end of next month 
will meet a 1 billion to cover april and may interest bringing it 
current on its obligations 
but da nobrega said the agreement did not formally revoke 
the moratorium da nobrega said that might happen in october when 
all creditors are expected to have signed the accord and brazil 
receives more than 4 billion 
under the agreement which covers interest due in 1987 1988 and 
the first half of 1989 brazil will receive 52 billion in new 
money to meet interest payemtns and debt falling due over the 
period will be spread out over 20 years with an eightyear grace 
period 
brazil also will receive 600 million in shortterm credit lines 
toward financing exports and imports 
in addition the banks agreed to sharply reduce the interest 
rate they had been charging on the 64 billion in loans brazils 
spread or the extra interest charged highrisk clients above the 
london interbank offered rate was to be cut to 08125 percent from 
the 175 percent set under previous agreements among developing 
nations only mexico has obtained such a low spread from creditors 
one of the sticking points between brazil and its creditors was 
linkage between new money and approval of the countrys economic 
policies from the international monetary fund brazil has argued 
the funds policies are recessionary and impinge upon the countrys 
sovereignty 
according to the accord only the 600 million in credit lines 
will be linked to meeting economic goals in an imfapproved plan 
and even that decision could be appealed at a later date 
brazil is the first country to sign a mediumterm accord 
without having to have any rigid links with the fund da nobrega 
said 
according to da nobrega a brazil also is allowed to pull out of 
the agreement if there are any external economic shocks that 
impair brazils ability to meet interest payments this could 
apply to even a drop in brazils trade surplus this year expected 
to reach over 13 billion

officials of arizonas largest thrift say a 
federallyassisted takeover of a pair of texas savings and loans is 
a chance to branch out in new directions 
we had to diversify ourselves said gene rice chairman and 
chief executive officer of merabank any time a bank has all its 
eggs in one basket it can get in trouble our longterm objective 
is to have 20 percent of our bank in arizona 20 percent in texas 
and the balance in other places 
federal home loan bank board officials guaranteed 839 million 
in assistance for merabank federal savings and loan to absorb first 
financial a savings association in el paso and brownfield 
savings and loan association in brownfield 
the transaction announced wednesday was part of the southwest 
plan a federallyfunded plan to recapitalize and consolidate 
ailing thrifts 
merabank officials still do not know how much in outstanding 
loans they will have to write off said arthur gonzalez president 
of merabanks texas division 
he said officials have not yet inventoried the two thrifts loan 
portfolios and are unsure how many employees they have inherited 
from the ailing thrifts 
this acquisitionwas a little unusual in what we agreed to 
do with the federal home loan bank board without lots of 
information gonzalez said 
merabank federal savings and loan of phoenix the largest thrift 
in arizona and 25th largest in the country has 64 billion in 
assets 
merabank which already has seven branches in texas is 
contributing 88 million in new capital to the deal to acquire 
first financial with 330 million in assets and brownfield with 
40 million 
merabank also agreed to acquire a third major insolvent texas 
thrift later this year as part of the transaction it is forming a 
separate subsidiary merabank texas to hold the three texas 
institutions 
bank board officials said they expect merabank texas to 
consolidate all its operations in texas within six to nine months 
the federal savings and loan insurance corp which insures sampl 
deposits up to 100000 will hold warrants for 20 percent of the 
subsidiarys stock officials said 
first financial and brownfield are the ninth and 10th savings 
and loan cases resolved by federal regulators in texas this year 
while 40 nationwide have been resolved 
the states institutions hard hit by slumps in the oil industry 
and real estate valuations accounted for 3 billion of the 
industrys 38 billion loss in the first three months of this year 
regulators say 133 of texas 279 thrifts are insolvent under 
generally accepted accounting rules the bank board hopes to reduce 
the number of savings and loans in texas by about 150 this year 
bank board chairman m danny wall said merabanks expansion in 
texas will benefit texas the thrift industry and fslic 
the third thrift to be acquired by merabank which is based in 
phoenix ariz would create a deal worth about 1 billion rice 
said 
thrift industry officials said a 12 billion loss at sunbelt 
savings association of dallas boosted losses by texas savings and 
loans to 35 billion during the first three months of 1988 
operating losses for the 477 institutions in the five states 
served by the dallas office of the bank board widened during the 
first quarter of 1988 to 11 billion from 623 million in 1987 
nonoperating losses primarily funds set aside to cover 
nonperforming assets increased to 28 billion from 609 million

a new york company is helping 
jacksonville solve its part of the national problem of what to do 
with the millions of discarded tires littering the landscape 
the company plans to shred 3 million of jacksonvilles 4 million 
junked tires and send them to a company in greece for industrial 
fuel 
the tires are stored at the frasier tire co yard which has 
been identified as a breeding ground for the asian tiger mosquito 
a suspected carrier of deadly dengue fever and encephalitis 
jacksonville is paying oxford tire co of buffalo ny 
538000 to shred the tires into the size of charcoal briquets 
oxford said it is selling the shreds to titan cement co of athens 
greece which will use them to fuel a cement plant 
they actually have produced more heat energy than the same 
amount of coal don bayly assistant director of the jacksonville 
bioenvironment services division said of companies using the fuel 
bayly said the tires cant be burned here because local 
incinerators and boilers arent designed to handle them without 
discharging particulates that would add to air pollution 
jim ladue vice president of oxford tire said the company could 
shred about 1000 tires an hour with one machine it hopes to have 
about half the tires in the 17acre dump shredded by the first week 
in september and be finished by midoctober the city contract 
gives the company nine months to do the job 
the city and dump owner murvin l frasier jr have been in court 
since the city sued him in early 1986 over the tire dump earlier 
this month frasier gave oxford the right to shred and remove the 
tires 
some of the tires in jacksonville were imported from asia by 
recapping companies which junked them when they proved unusable 
it was in such tires that the asian mosquito found its way to the 
united states health officials say 
in addition to the mosquito danger the mountains of dumped 
tires are a major fire hazard that virtually are impossible to 
extinguish once ignited bayly said 
other ideas are in the works to handle the estimated 2 billion 
discarded tires littering landscapes throughout the united states 
an amount the us environmental protection agency says is 
increasing by 250 million annually 
bayly said a number of companies are working on incinerators 
that will burn tires without pollution while producing carbon 
black and oil as end products 
according to oxfords ladue denver has the largest single tire 
dump in the united states with an estimated 8 million tires 
oxford also will be bidding to rid denver of its rubber mountain 
he said 
oxford began operations in buffalo last year as a subsidiary of 
integrated waste systems sales manager tom flynn said the company 
has a state permit to shred 10000 tires a day at its buffalo plant 
and is using a shredder at marion ny to reduce a pile of 
200000 to 300000 tires 
he said the chips can be an environmentally sound fuel 
alternative given the proper type of power plant 
were looking to burn it with coal on a basis that would 
eliminate any smoke or fumes from going into the air flynn said 
companies that use it for fuel he said would have the proper 
scrubbing systems and stacks

alaska gov steve cowper the new chairman 
of the interstate oil compact commission says congress should 
substantially increase automotive fuel taxes to curb the flow at 
the nations gas pumps and reduce imports of foreign oil 
this is widely regarded as a politically unpopular proposal 
cowper said in a speech prepared for the 29state commission 
meeting in colorado springs colo nevertheless it is probably 
the most effective way to reduce dependence on oil at the gas 
pumps 
cowper was sworn in wednesday as the 198889 commission 
chairman replacing north dakota gov george sinner the commission 
was established by congress 52 years ago to promote development of 
oil and gas reserves 
in his speech cowper warned that the united states must reduce 
its dependence on foreign oil 
in 1983 the nation imported two million barrels of foreign oil a 
day by may 1987 that figure had doubled to four million barrels 
last month we were averaging 55 million barrels of imports a 
day cowper said 
if that supply is cut off we will be faced with an 
economycrippling price spike in oil he said 
cowper blamed low prices for some of the problem the current 
abundance of relatively cheap oil encourages this trend 
cowper also blamed the lack of energy conservation efforts for 
the increasing demand 
revenue from increased federal taxes on gasoline could be used 
to attack both problems he said 
the proceeds would be used to promote research in alternative 
fuels ranging from natural gas to grain alcohol fuels and to 
promote research into other conservation programs cowper said 
he did not propose a specific tax hike other than to call for a 
substantial increase an increase of 1 cent per gallon would 
yield 1 billion a year for the federal treasury and a 25cent tax 
increase would generate 25 billion he said 
cowper was less enthusiastic about an import tariff on foreign 
oil as a means of boosting the price of domestic supplies and 
reducing imports 
tariffinduced prices would be artificial he said and could 
hurt the economy more than they would help reduce dependence on 
foreign oil

while the federal pension benefit guaranty corp 
is entitled to make employers take back terminated pension plans 
it hasnt proven its case yet against ltv corp a judge has ruled 
the judge on wednesday refused to uphold the pbgcs decision to 
force the financially ailing ltv to reassume 2 billion in pension 
obligations because a new labor contract restored previously cut 
benefits 
us district judge robert sweet of manhattan said the agency 
which insures the pensions of 30 million american workers had not 
explored all the relevant facts before handing three 
underfunded pension plans back to ltvs clevelandbased steel unit 
ltv steel co 
since the agencys decision is not sustainable on the 
administrative record the appropriate remedy is to vacate the 
restoration decision that gave back responsibility for the 
pensions to ltv said sweet 
were very pleased said lewis b kaden an attorney for ltv 
corp who called the ruling a complete victory 
but sweet concluded in his 126page opinion that the pbgc might 
be able to make its case with additional data the judge sent the 
issue back to the pbgc for further consideration and told both 
sides to arrange a conference with him on further proceedings 
while the court recognized pbgcs authority to restore 
terminated plans it did not immediately enforce restoration of the 
ltv plans said pbgc spokeswoman jane hoden instead the court 
required additional fact finding by the pbgc on ltvs ability to 
fund the plans the pbgc is pleased that the court recognized our 
authority to restore plans but we are disappointed that the court 
required additional proceedings 
reading from a statement she said the pbgc is now considering 
other legal steps to resolve the issues of this case and relieve 
the uncertainty faced by retirees 
the dallasbased ltv a giant steel aerospace and energy 
concern filed for protection from its creditors under chapter 11 
of the us bankruptcy code in july 1986 
the pbgc which insures pension benefits much like the federal 
deposit insurance corp insures bank deposits took over ltvs 
steel industry pension plans last january after the company 
terminated them the plans were 2 billion in debt making the pbgc 
ltvs largest creditor 
but when a new ltv labor contract with the united steelworkers 
of america restored some benefits previously cut the agency 
claimed that the company was taking unfair advantage of federal 
funds to cut costs and gain labor peace 
ltv the nations no 2 steelmaker claims that restoring the 
plans and their deficit will seriously hamper its ability to 
reorganize and emerge from bankruptcy proceedings 
ltv corps first quarter net income rose 26 percent according 
to the company because of higher steel prices and the continuing 
benefits of federal bankruptcy law protection 
last september the pbgc shifted responsibility for the 
underfunded pension plans back to ltv claiming the corporation was 
abusing the pension insurance program and its actions could 
jeopardize the agencys already strapped nationwide pension 
insurance fund 
but ltv claimed the move violated the automatic stay provision 
of the bankruptcy code which bars legal action against companies 
in reorganization 
sweet ruled however that the restoration of pension plans was 
allowed under the law that created the pbgc and the action was not 
subject to the automatic stay provision

norway will restrain by 75 percent its 
north sea oil production during the second half of 1988 the oil 
and energy ministry announced thursday 
ministry spokesman egil helle said the restrained level will 
mean a daily production of 90000 barrels below full capacity but 
new wells and fields will be opened during the next six months 
raising norways overall production helle said 
the cut will apply to all offshore fields 
the energy ministry said that norways average daily production 
during the first half of 1988 was about 1035 billion barrels 
during the second half it is projected to reach 1125 billion 
barrels 
norway is not a member of the organization of petroleum 
exporting countries but it has held back on production since 
february 1986 in line with opecs efforts to stabilize prices 
the governments decision to reduce the production growth is a 
contribution to stabilization of oil prices the ministry said

the nations economy fueled by an exportdriven manufacturing 
boom expanded at a robust 36 percent in the first quarter 
slightly less than previously thought the government said today 
meanwhile the government revised upwards its estimate of 
economic growth in 1988 predicting an expansion of 35 percent 
the original predictions was that the economy would grow by 29 
percent this year 
beryl sprinkel chairman of the presidential council of economic 
advisers said the economy is doing better than even we 
expected our rosy forecast wasnt rosy enough 
he said that contrary to some fears the economy is not 
overheating with inflation holding at 43 percent 
the commerce department said the gross national product the 
broadest measure of economic health grew to a seasonally adjusted 
annual level of 3915 trillion in the januarymarch period a 
346 billion increase from three months earlier 
it was a modest downward revision of a previous estimate of gnp 
growth in the first quarter last month the government put gnp 
growth at 39 percent up from an initial estimate of 23 percent 
in april 
analysts were expecting the slight retreat 
government economists said the first quarter growth occurred 
with little pickup in inflation a price index tied to the gnp rose 
at an annual rate of 14 percent slightly lower than the 
previously estimated 17 percent and well below the 27 percent 
pace of the fourth quarter 
in a separate report today the commerce department said 
aftertax corporate profits fell 10 percent in the first quarter 
to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1442 billion 
that was down 14 billion from the last three months of 1987 
and the worst performance since the first quarter of 1987 when 
profits fell 37 percent 
todays report represents a downward revision from an estimate 
last month when the department said profits after taxes eased up 
05 percent 
on wednesday a strong rally by the dollar and indications that 
inflation may not be heating up as badly as earlier feared helped 
spark a stock market rally that pushed wall street to its highest 
levels since the october crash 
the dow jones average of 30 industrial stocks rose 4303 points 
to 215220 eclipsing the previous postcrash high of 213140 set 
a week earlier 
aiding the market was the commerce departments report of a 22 
percent decline in may of orders to us factories for big 
ticket durable goods the biggest drop in nine months 
economists said the decline in orders was healthy because it 
indicated the economy was not being overheated by too much pressure 
on production capacity 
stocks also were helped by a big rise by the dollar in foreign 
exchange a rally that caught many traders by surprise 
the dollar reached almost 129 japanese yen in new york up more 
than 2 yen from tuesdays close 
analysts said the dollars jump may have stemmed partly from the 
outcome of the economic summit meeting of the seven major 
industrialized countries in toronto and a summit communique 
hinting there was room for the dollar to strengthen further 
that statement gave the market a signal to buy dollars said 
earl johnson a vice president at harris trust and savings bank in 
chicago 
the decline in durable goods orders surprised economists who 
had expected more than a 2 percent rise in orders but they noted 
the governments survey apparently did not include several 
multibilliondollar orders placed to seattlebased boeing co 
even though the overall may decline was the largest since 
augusts 23 percent fall analysts saw little cause to worry that 
the report was forecasting a significant decline in manufacturing 
which has been booming as the cheaper dollar bolsters export sales 
of us goods 
excluding defense goods orders fell only 09 percent excluding 
airplanes they rose 06 percent 
the financial markets read the report as good news for 
inflation many traders and some analysts have been concerned that 
the export boom coupled with steady consumer demand in the united 
states would strain manufacturers capacity and cause shortages 
and price increases

the us economy fueled by an exportdriven 
manufacturing boom expanded at a robust 36 percent pace in the 
first three months of this year slightly less than previously 
thought the government said today 
the commerce department said the gross national product the 
broadest measure of economic health grew to a seasonally adjusted 
annual level of 3915 trillion in the januarymarch period a 
346 billion increase from three months earlier 
strong first quarter growth has prompted the reagan 
administration to boost its 1988 projection for gnp growth to 35 
percent at the start of the year the administration had predicted 
the economy would grow 29 percent in 1988 the same rate of growth 
as in 1986 and 1987 
at the time many private economists were more pessimistic but 
they have since scrambled to increase their predictions 
our rosy forecast wasnt rosy enough said beryl sprinkel 
chairman of the presidential council of economic advisers the 
economy is doing better than even we expected 
the latest first quarter numbers were a modest downward revision 
of a previous estimate of gnp growth in the first quarter a month 
ago the government put gnp growth at 39 percent however in 
april the initial estimate was a much lower 23 percent 
many analysts were expecting the slight retreat 
todays revisions show that nonmilitary spending by the federal 
government was 38 billion less than previously thought most of 
that was accounted for by a dip in purchases of surplus farm 
commodities 
consumer spending although up a moderately strong 38 percent 
was weaker than the previously estimated 43 percent growth much 
of that was due to somewhat less automobile buying than first 
thought 
immediately after the october stock market crash many 
economists feared the shock to consumer confidence would topple the 
country into a recession 
consumer spending did post a rare 25 percent decline in the 
fourth quarter but it has come back in the first three months of 
this year 
the engines driving the sixyearold economic expansion now 
even more than consumer spending are rising export sales spurred 
by the cheaper dollar and the consequent surge in modernization and 
expansion spending by businesses 
exports of goods and services were up a strong 228 percent in 
the first quarter business investment in capital equipment shot up 
331 percent the fastest rise since the first year of the recovery 
from the 198182 recession 
the growth has buried fears of another recession but now 
financial markets have become concerned that the economy is 
expanding so rapidly that it will rekindle inflation 
first quarter growth was occurring with little pickup in 
inflation however a price index tied to the gnp rose at an annual 
rate of 14 percent slightly lower than the previously estimated 
17 percent and well below the 27 percent pace of the fourth 
quarter 
but some analysts say inflationary pressures have begun to 
surface in the quarter ending this month 
in a second report the commerce department said us 
corporations aftertax profits fell 10 percent in the first 
quarter the poorest showing since profits dipped 37 percent in 
the first quarter of 1987 
last month the government in a preliminary estimate said 
profits eased up a slight 05 percent in the januarymarch period 
profits were up a moderate 26 percent in the fourth quarter 
economists say lagging profits could put pressure on businesses 
to raise prices 
the gnp in the fourth quarter of 1987 was even stronger growing 
at a 48 percent annual rate however much of that production went 
into a rapid buildup in inventories of goods held on shelves and 
back lots 
the mix of growth in the januarymarch period is considered 
better but the worry now is that too much demand from american 
consumers as well as from overseas buyers will strain factory 
capacity causing shortages and driving up prices 
with the second quarter of 1988 drawing to a close the signals 
are mixed 
inflation as measured by the consumer price index is running 
at a 44 percent annual rate through may the same as last year 
but droughtspared food price increases have yet to show up at the 
retail level 
and factory operating rates have risen from 824 percent of 
capacity in march to 829 percent in may creeping closer to the 85 
percent level that economists consider clearly inflationary 
on the plus side consumer demand seems to be cooling enough to 
allow more room for production of exports and business equipment 
retail sales grew only a lackluster 01 percent in may after a 04 
percent decline in april 
most economists are projecting slightly weaker but not weak 
economic growth in the second quarter 
i would see some modest slowing in the second quarter as 
businesses trim down their inventories but theres too much pep in 
the economy for there to be a major slowdown until later in the 
year said jerry jasinowski chief economist of the national 
association of manufacturers

gaf corp confirmed thursday that it is under 
investigation for possible securities law violations but a 
spokesman for the company denied any wrongdoing 
according to the spokesman the focus of the investigation 
appears to relate to the disposition of a portion of gafs stock 
position in union carbide corp during late 1986 
gaf made a hostile bid for carbide in 1985 but reached a 
standstill agreement with the company the following year 
according to unidentified sources quoted in thursdays editions 
of the wall street journal the federal government is looking into 
gafs accumulation of carbide stock through jefferies amp co a los 
angeles securities firm once headed by boyd l jefferies 
jefferies pleaded guilty to two felonies after being implicated 
in a stock parking scheme by convicted arbitrager ivan f boesky 
who is now serving time in prison 
james sherwin gafs vice chairman and chief administrative 
officer has been named as having had an agreement with boyd 
jefferies regarding alleged stock parking and manipulation the 
newspaper said 
under their alleged agreement gaf agreed to reimburse the 
jefferies firm for losses incurred in trading in carbide stock 
the journals sources noted that sherwin did not make any money 
from the scheme the us attorneys office in new york appears 
undecided as to whether it will seek criminal charges in the case 
the paper said 
both the company and its officials are innocent of any 
wrongdoing a spokesman for gaf said 
in early trading on the new york stock exchange gaf had fallen 
162 a share to 46 
according to the journal gaf is the first industrial company to 
be targeted for investigation in the governments widespread probe 
of abuses within the securities industry 
the paper noted that the investigation could hamper gaf chairman 
samuel heymans planned 127 billion leveraged buyout of the 
wayne njbased chemicals and building materials company 
but the gaf spokesman said the outcome of this matter will 
not have any material financial consequences to the company and 
plans for managements proposed leveraged buyout of gaf remain 
unaffected

italian financier carlo de benedetti 
has agreed to sharply reduce his stake in societe generale de 
belgique ending a lengthy takeover battle for belgiums largest 
holding company sources said thursday 
under terms of a settlement de benedetti will sell part of his 
45 percent stake in societe generale to cie financiere de suez a 
french banking company that along with its allies holds a slim 
majority 
the sale will reduce de benedettis holdings to about 15 
percent thereby blocking his ability to manipulate decisions that 
require a 75 percent vote of shareholders 
in return however de benedetti would get a cash payment at 
least three seats on societe generales board and would increase 
his stake in suez according to sources who spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
the agreement is expected to be formally announced friday at a 
news conference called by societe generale whose holdings in 
industries including energy finance chemicals mining and 
transport control about a third of belgiums economy 
de benedetti announced in january he sought to control societe 
generale the belgian company resisted his overtures but had to 
look for foreign support in suez which along with the belgian 
insurer groupe ag came to control slightly more than 50 percent of 
the holdign companys shares 
at a special meeting two months ago shareholders spurned de 
benedettis bid to win board seats for himself and two allies 
suezs strengthened stake under the settlement should allow the 
french group to run societe generale with its own new chief 
executive reorganizing the companys often criticized strategy as 
well as its management structure 
a statement issued earlier this week confirming negotiations 
were underway said suez and its allies will back the nomination of 
herve de carmoy a french banker to societe generales board 
while de benedetti and his allies will abstain 
it is expected that de carmoy will be asked to take over a large 
part of societe generales management 
the frenchbelgian group was also reported to be interested in 
looking for more foreign partners including the british media 
magnate robert maxwell 
under the agreement between de benedetti and suez belgians 
stake in societe generale will decline substantially according to 
belgian press reports 
the conservative daily la libre belgique wrote the decision 
center has moved to paris belgians will have to fight hard to 
defend the national character of the company

the federal communications commission today 
voted to levy the first fine for violation of its new decency 
standards on a missouri television station that aired a sexy movie 
during prime time 
commissioners voted 21 to impose the maximum 2000 fine 
against kzkctv for its may 1987 broadcast of private lessons 
which included scenes of a barebreasted woman seducing a teenager 
the kansas city station aired the movie at 8 pm a time the 
fcc has determined children are likely to be in the audience the 
fccs guidelines allow indecent material to be aired after 
midnight to lessen the risk that such programs could be viewed by 
children 
attorney thomas davidson who represents the station said he 
was shocked and surprised and outraged by the imposition of the 
maximum fine in light of the circumstances he said the sanction 
is unfair because we dont know what is indecent because the 
statute doesnt provide any guidance 
all three commissioners said that the movie fit the fccs 
definition of indecency but commissioner patricia dennis disagreed 
with the fine she said parents not the commission should bear 
the primary responsibility of deciding what their children should 
watch at night 
fcc chairman dennis r patrick disagreed saying the government 
must help parents in deciding what their children watch on 
television he said it is reasonable to assume that there are 
unsupervised children in the audience during primetime hours 
patrick said wednesday that the fccs record on indecency has 
been clear 
while respecting the first amendment rights of all citizens 
we have taken clear and decisive action to enforce the statutory 
ban on broadcast obscenity and to further restrict the broadcast of 
indecent material so as to put parents in a better position to 
control their childrens access to this type of material he said 
media central inc which owns kzkc has said the film had been 
cut by an inexperienced editor and violated company standards but 
a fine would be inappropriate because the fccs indecency 
guidelines are ambiguous and are being applied to tv for the first 
time 
the movie the owners said was aired little more than a month 
after the new standards were adopted the fcc guidelines are being 
challenged in court by broadcasting groups news organizations and 
public interest advocates as being unconstitutionally vague and 
overbroad 
media central acknowledged that the airing of the 1980 sex 
comedy violated kzkcs broadcast standards and sense of good 
taste but the company said station officials took immediate 
corrective action after the broadcast including a clarification of 
the stations policy on frontal nudity 
attorney thomas davidson representing media central said it 
would be premature to comment before the commission acted 
media central based in chattanooga tenn is awaiting court 
action on a reorganization plan it filed under chapter 11 of the 
federal bankruptcy act 
private lessons is about a wealthy 15yearold boy who is 
seduced by his housekeeper the film includes several scenes in 
which the housekeeper is shown barebreasted 
the fcc decided in april 1987 to apply the wording of a 1978 
supreme court decision that said indecent material is language or 
material that depicts or describes in terms patently offensive as 
measured by contemporary community standards for the broadcast 
medium sexual or excretory activities or organs 
the commission said indecent material may be aired only when 
there is a reasonable risk that children are not in the audience 
in a subsequent ruling in november 1987 the fcc said it would 
consider that children were not likely to be in the audience after 
midnight previously the fcc had considered 10 pm the cutoff time

the government today predicted that the 
economy will grow at a largerthanexpected 35 percent rate in 
1988 and that inflation will hold steady at 43 percent with the 
odds overwhelming against a recession 
a slight increase in interest rates about a half percent was 
forecast for the year 
in revising earlier estimates beryl sprinkel chairman of the 
council of economic advisers said our rosy forecast wasnt rosy 
enough 
the economy is doing better than even we expected 
the administration originally had predicted the economy would 
grow by 29 percent this year 
president reagan responding to a reporters question at a 
picturetaking session with visiting australian prime minister 
robert hawke said he was not worried about a new round of 
inflation and i dont think we should 
all the evidence shows us that our recovery is going on and 
no there is no great threat of inflation the president said 
sprinkel said the drought could have a significant effect on 
food prices unless there is rain soon however he said the farm 
community generates only about two percent of the gross national 
product the broadest gauge of economic health 
asked about the administrations new projections private 
economist michael k evans agreed with the upward revision in the 
economic growth prediction but disagreed with the inflation 
estimate 
hes certainly right about better growth but the rest is 
just pie in the sky stuff said evans a private economic 
consultant in washington 
were not going to have doubledigit inflation but a 
reasonable private sector forecast of consumer inflation would be 5 
to 55 percent he said nobody can be faulted for not 
forecasting the drought ahead of time but now that it has occurred 
you have to make some upward revisions because of it 
sprinkel released his new estimates at a white house briefing 
asked if the figures mean there is no chance of a recession 
sprinkel said i wouldnt say its zero danger anything can 
happen 
but its our view the overwhelming odds suggest that the 
economy will continue to expand on average this year even though at 
a more moderate pace than was evident in the first quarter 
sprinkel said 
he said that contrary to some fears the economy is not 
overheating moreover he said there is no sign of an upsurge in 
inflation 
sprinkel said the economic growth rate would slow somewhat over 
the last nine months of the year from its firstquarter pace 
he said growth projections for 1989 and beyond were being 
revised downward slightly to offset the upward revision for 1988 
and the strongerthanexpected growth experienced during 1987 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
for 1989 the administration expects the economy to grow 31 
percent 
economic growth is measured two ways on an annual basis and on 
a fourth quarter to fourth quarter basis 
the 35 percent 1988 growth forecast is for yeartoyear change 
using the fourth quartertofourth quarter comparison the 
administration predicted the economy will grow at a 3 percent rate 
compared iwith the earlier estimate of 24 percent 
in revising the figures sprinkel noted that the economy had 
expanded faster than expected in the first three months of the 
year 36 percent 
we do expect slower growth over the remainder of the year 
he said 
the inflation estimate as measured by the consumer price index 
is still 43 percent the same as originally predicted on a fourth 
quartertofourth quarter basis sprinkel said 
the estimate for interest rates was revisd upward about a half 
percent 
as measured by rates for 91day treasury bills inflation was 
estimated at 6 percent compared with a 53 percent rate forecast 
earlier measured on the basis of rates for 10year treasury 
securities the rate was forecast at 85 percent compared with 8 
percent predicted earlier

for those of you who are always trying to figure out what we 
are thinking it means we envision some decline in interest rates 
later this year as the economys growth rate slows from the rapid 
first quarter rate and inflation continues to abate sprinkel 
said 
the forecast unemployment rate was slightly lower than 
originally estimated 55 percent for the year now as compared with 
an earlier projection of 58 percent

a top navy official whose phone was tapped in 
the massive pentagon bribery probe has begun cooperating with 
prosecutors while a justice department official said today that 
others are following suit 
deputy assistant navy secretary james gaines whose office was 
searched last week has begun telling prosecutors what he knows 
sources familiar with the investigation said 
one justice department official speaking on the condition of 
anonymity said today that there has been some interest shown on 
the part of some individuals in cooperating with the 
investigation he said that some information has already been 
obtained 
other sources familiar with the probe said the interest was 
coming from subjects who are working in the pentagon 
at the white house meanwhile president reagan told reporters 
he has arranged for a report on the present status of the 
investigation but did not say how soon he expects to receive it 
responding to a question as he posed for pictures with visiting 
australian prime minister robert hawke today reagan said i am 
asking and have arranged they are coming over to give me a full 
report he said the report would deal with the question of 
where are we now and how much do we know already 
the los angeles times reported today that investigators believe 
gaines was a principal supplier of pentagon documents to defense 
consultant melvyn r paisley who was assistant secretary of the 
navy and gaines boss until april 1987 
the times quoting government sources said paisley allegedly 
arranged an elaborate scheme under which highlevel pentagon 
officials smuggled classified documents out of the pentagon and 
allowed him to copy them with the aid of his wife 
the newspaper said paisley allegedly passed the sensitive 
information to mcdonnell douglas corp which had retained him as a 
consultant shortly after he left his pentagon post one source told 
the times that paisely received staggering fees from the 
company 
the 2yearold investigation focuses on allegations that private 
consultants many of them former pentagon employees paid bribes to 
obtain defense department secrets about upcoming contracts 
gaines made an appointment to hire a washingtonarea defense 
lawyer but then abruptly canceled the meeting after getting a call 
from a federal investigator who told him that you have until 9 
am tomorrow to decide whose side youre on according to one 
source gaines decided several days ago to cooperate said the 
sources 
while gaines is talking with prosecutors another pentagon 
official whose office was searched victor cohen is negotiating 
with the government on whether to do the same said the sources 
speaking on condition of anonymity 
after a meeting with the chief prosecutor in the probe one of 
the pentagons strongest supporters in the senate said people 
will really be shocked by the scale of wrongdoing involved 
it appears they have very good evidence sen strom 
thurmond rsc said after being briefed by henry hudson the 
us attorney for eastern virginia 
both gaines and cohen had key procurement jobs in the pentagon 
gaines was deputy assistant navy secretary for acquisition 
management while cohen was a top deputy to the deputy assistant air 
force secretary in charge of buying tactical command control 
communications and computer systems both men have been reassigned 
since the investigation became public 
while hudson was describing the case to congressional leaders on 
wednesday former defense secretary caspar weinberger was defending 
his pentagon management style and warning against public and 
congressional overreaction to the disclosures 
no matter how careful you are youre not going to be able to 
eliminate dishonesty weinberger said in an interview with the 
associated press 
hudson told congressional leaders in closed meetings that 75 to 
100 contracts worth tens of billions of dollars are under 
scrutiny according to rep john dingell dmich 
sen john warner rva ranking republican on the armed 
services committee said after hearing hudson that these 
contracts may have to be examined to determine if they were in fact 
tainted by these allegations 
hudson told reporters that there may not be any indictments 
until after the nov 8 election 
im hopeful that if indictments are appropriate in the case 
they will be secured by the end of the year the prosecutor said 
if we can proceed at a faster pace well attempt to do it 
house speaker jim wright dtexas said hudson also told 
lawmakers that no member of congress is a target of the 
investigation so far despite news leaks identifying several as 
under scrutiny 
no subpoena has been sought for any member of congress no 
wiretap has been directed at any member of congress and no search 
warrant has been directed at any member of congress wright said 
hudson said the investigation focuses primarily on the sale of 
inside information by private consultants who were acting as 
middlemen between the pentagon and defense contractors wright said 
in other developments 
the baltimore sun reported in thursdays editions that the 
investigation has spread to two dozen pentagon employees and about 
60 companies citing sources that it did not identify the 
newspaper said bribes ranging up to 50000 had been paid to some 
government employees for sensitive contract information and 
proprietary industry data 
joan galvin the 28yearold daughter of a defense consultant 
under investigation and an aide to rep andy ireland rfla was 
relieved on wednesday of handling military issues for ireland the 
congressman is one of five house members of the house whose names 
have come up in the case ms galvin remains on irelands staff as 
a legislative assistant dealing with other issues 
ms galvin was reassigned because she and ireland agreed she 
would be in an untenable position if she continued to handle 
military matters because her father defense consultant william 
galvin is a principal in the investigation said a spokesman 
for ireland doug hattaway 
ireland and the other four congressmen reported under scrutiny 
have all said they are not targets of the inquiry the others are 
reps bill chappell dfla chairman of the house appropriations 
defense subcommittee thomas downey dny samuel s stratton 
dny chairman of the house armed services procurement 
subcommittee and roy dyson dmd a member of strattons 
subcommittee ireland is also on the stratton panel 
weinberger one of president reagans closest friends and 
staunchest allies complained that the case was prompting congress 
and the public to lose sight of the continuing need for a strong 
defense 
you dont close a bank because theres been a bank robbery 
weinberger said the pentagon awards 52000 contracts every 
single day and inevitably there may be some faithless or dishonest 
people

roger charlesworth senior dealer at chase manhattan securities 
in london said the market was having a delayed reaction to 
wednesdays news of a halfpoint rise in the british commercial

to wring inflationary pressure from the economy but rather to 
stabilize the currency

rowntree plc on thursday agreed to a sweetened 
45 billion buyout offer from swiss foods giant nestle sa ending 
the monthslong candy bar war for the british confectioner 
nestles 255 billionpound offer edges out rival bidder jacobs 
suchard ag a swiss chocolate and coffee concern to create the 
worlds secondlargest confectioner behind mars inc 
the bid for rowntree maker of the kit kat candy bar is the 
largest offer for a british company by a foreign concern 
nestle will pay 1075 pounds a share or 1903 up from its 
initial bid of 21 billion pounds or 890 pence a share the 
confectioner increased its stake in rowntree to 22 percent thursday 
from a previous 158 percent 
suchard which holds a 299 percent stake in rowntree had 
offered 232 billion pounds or 950 pence a share 
tim potter an analyst with shearson lehman hutton inc in 
london noted that nestles bid not only is 13 percent higher than 
suchards offer but nestle got the board along with the 
agreement which is crucial in this takeover battle that is 
probably enough to win rowntree 
suchard declined to comment on its plans but walter anderau 
the companys vice president for corporate affairs said we are 
in no rush but he said suchard is still convinced that 
rowntree would be the ideal partner for us 
analysts predict suchard which will drop from second to third 
place among worldwide confectioners is likely to sell out to its 
rival at the current buyout price suchards profit would amount 
to about 205 million pounds potter said 
the battle for rowntree began april 13 when zurichbased 
suchard maker of the triangular toblerone chocolate bar snapped 
up nearly 15 percent of rowntrees shares in a dawn raid that 
move prompted nestle to enter the fray with an initial offer on 
april 26 suchard countered with its bid a month later 
in trading on the london stock exchange rowntree closed up 37 
pence a share at 1076 pounds a share 
nestle said it assured rowntree that the confectioners york 
headquarters will remain the center of the companys activities in 
britain and that the office also will serve as headquarters of 
nestles international chocolate and confectionery strategy 
in addition rowntree chairman kenneth dixon will be retained as 
an executive member of the nestle general management committee 
the assurances were an apparent attempt to fend off public 
criticism about the takeover 
rowntrees dixon said we believe that the price now offered 
is fair and shareholders and employees should both gain from the 
agreement which has been reached 
the competing bids by the two swiss companies sparked a 
controversy in britain where critics objected to the acquisition 
of the 263yearold british company by a foreign concern and feared 
job losses in york where rowntree employs 5300 of its 30000 
workers 
the governments decision not to intervene in the takeover bids 
sparked protests and divided members of prime minister margaret 
thatchers conservative party 
this is a sad but inevitable result of the governments 
refusal to defend british industry against foreign predators 
said bryan gould an opposition labor party lawmaker 
rowntree which traces its origins back to a quaker grocers 
shop in northeast england had a pretax profit of 112 million 
pounds on sales of 143 billion pounds in 1987 
nestle based in vevey switzerland had net profit of 18 
billion swiss francs or about 12 billion on sales of 352 
billion swiss francs or 24 billion last year 
helmut maucher nestles managing director said we look 
forward to building on the strengths of the two companies and 
creating a prosperous future for the combined group 
the previous largest foreign bid for a british company was 
australiabased elders ixls 1986 purchase of the courage brewing 
business from hanson plc for 14 billion pounds or 25 billion 
according to mergers and acquisitions magazine

irving bank corp failed to respond by a 
thursday deadline set by bank of new york co for accepting a 
sweetened 14 billion takeover bid 
bank of new york spokesman owen brady said the company was 
disappointed that no action had been taken and as a result the 
friendly offer had expired in a onepage letter sent thursday to 
bank of new york chairman j carter bacot irving outside director 
david l luke iii said the bank would be derelict in its duty if 
we tried to respond by the noon thursday deadline set by bank of 
new york on wednesday 
luke said several serious concerns remained among them whether 
bank of new york could proceed with its latest offer under the 
conditional approval the federal reserve board granted to its 
previous 12 billion offer that approval is scheduled to run out 
july 9 
irvings board of directors which favors a merger with the 
staterun banca commerciale italiana spa failed to reach a 
decision after meeting for several hours on tuesday company 
representatives also held a 1hour meeting with bacot 
brady said irving had plenty of time to respond the offer was 
out there for 10 days he said 
bank of new york had warned that unless irvings board of 
directors went along with its latest proposal it would push for a 
quick court decision on related lawsuits and proceed with a hostile 
11 billion tender offer the company is seeking among other 
things to remove irvings antitakeover poison pill 
bank of new york improved its offer last week by slightly 
raising the stock portion of the bid and adding other shareholder 
incentives including a special cash dividend 
it valued the revised bid for all of irvings 185 million 
shares outstanding at around 76 a share or 14 billion that is 
about 25 percent higher than the existing hostile 11 billion 
tender offer 
banca commerciale italys secondlargest bank is offering 80 
a share for 51 percent of irving or about 760 million the 
proposal is part of a complex defensive restructuring plan that 
includes among other things sale of irving assets costcutting 
measures and a special cash dividend

however its also a very wellknown fact that there is 
significant downside risk if the weather situation were to change 
the markets opened sharply higher on fears of deepening drought 
damage but only oat futures sustained the bullish momentum on 
reports estimating oat yield losses of at least 50 percent most 
oat contracts advanced the limit for daily trading for the fourth 
consecutive session 
soybean futures began falling sharply at around noon cdt after 
the price for july delivery reached 1099 a bushel corn and 
wheat followed suit 
the quote machines could not keep up ms leow said i was 
seeing quotes on my machine 10 cents behind what the market was 
trading i would not be compeletely shocked if we saw a record 
volume day today 
at the close wheat was 6 cents lower to 5 cents higher with 
july at 380 a bushel corn was 7 cents lower to 3 cents higher 
with july at 348 a bushel oats were 3 cents to 15 cents higher

the stock market retreated slightly today in 
moderate trading weakened by investors cashing profits from the 
strong gains of the previous two sessions 
some traders were disheartened by what they called the markets 
failure to sustain the momentum of a rally that began late tuesday 
and carried over into wednesday they said it reflected a 
reluctance by a broad range of investors to commit significant 
money to the market 
but others were more optimistic and said the slight retreat 
should be regarded as a positive sign of underlying strength 
the backtoback days of the magnitude we had are probably 
some cause for some profittaking said john j muldowney head

in richmond va im not at all discouraged by this

the european economic community may be 
unable to create a european central bank until britain changes its 
stance on monetary cooperation says jacques delors the eecs 
chief executive 
delors president of the eecs commission said thursday it was 
difficult to imagine creating such an institution as long as 
britain refuses to join the exchangerate mechanism of the 
eightnation european monetary system 
the ems was established in 1979 to minimize fluctuations in the 
exchange values of its members currencies britain has said it 
might be willing to join the system in the future but it has been 
cool to the idea of a central bank 
delors told a news conference that a meeting of eec government 
leaders next monday and tuesday in hanover west germany would 
discuss prospects for establishing a true european monetary and 
currency union including a european central bank 
eec officials have indicated they do not expect the meeting to 
produce any decision on creating such a bank 
west german chancellor helmut kohl who will chair the hanover 
summit would propose that a group of wise men be set up to 
study the central bank issue and to draw up specific plans delors 
said 
the eec has set a goal of eliminating all barriers to free 
movement of goods money and people among its 12 member nations by 
dec 31 1992

consumer electronics arent just for yuppies an 
industry group said thursday in releasing a gallup survey that 
found nearly twothirds of american homes owned a videocassette 
recorder 
ownership of vcrs has mushroomed to 65 percent of us 
households said the electronic industries association which 
sponsored the nationwide telephone survey of 1008 adults this 
spring 
televisions which topped the popularity list were owned by 99 
percent of the households surveyed 
among other items included in the survey telephone answering 
machines were in 24 percent of the homes personal computers in 18 
percent and compact disk players in 14 percent 
some people even claimed to have facsimile machines at home 
about 1 percent the gallup organization survey found 
our products are not luxuries owned by a privileged select 
few thomas p friel vice president of the trade organizations 
consumer electronics group said in a news conference 
not surprisingly the survey found the households with the 
highest incomes had the most consumer electronics products but it 
wasnt just rich singles ownership was higher among families with 
children for example about 78 percent of families with children 
had vcrs while only 40 percent of singlemember households did 
in general ownership of consumer electronics products was 
higher in the east and west than in the midwest or south 
for example telephone answering machines were in 36 percent of 
households in the west and 27 percent in the east they were in 19 
percent of the households in the south and 17 percent of those in 
the midwest the survey found 
on televisions the survey found that 31 percent of households 
owned one 33 percent owned two and 35 percent owned three or more 
fortythree percent of households with children own three or more 
televisions 
questions asked of the whole group have a margin of error of 4 
percentage points while questions asked of subgroups have higher 
error margins a gallup spokesman said 
since it was a survey done by phone the results are valid only 
for homes with telephones people without phones would tend to own 
less consumer electronics equipment

the dollar gyrated in world trading thursday but 
managed to finish mostly higher on key markets maintaining its 
recent gains amid profit taking and rumors of central bank action 
to keep the currency in line 
still traders acknowledged that despite the recent rally 
nothing fundamentally has changed to ensure a continued increase in 
the dollars value 
gold prices eased republic national bank of new york quoted a 
bid price of 44790 for a troy ounce of gold as of 4 pm edt 
down from 44880 late wednesday 
the dollar opened higher when the days trading began in asia 
but analysts said the bank of japan quickly began calling traders 
in an attempt to dampen their enthusiasm for the us currency the 
dollar quickly retreated when traders learned the bank of japan was 
unhappy with the currencys level and was monitoring the situation 
when trading shifted to europe however the dollar resumed its 
climb in an unusually volatile session 
dealers in london said there was no apparent reason for the 
rise although most concurred that positive sentiment following 
this weeks economic summit in toronto and a positive us trade 
report for april helped support the currency 
traders in new york downplayed indications that the major 
industrialized democracies would tolerate a higher dollar 
what is a slightly higher dollar ted wolicki a trader at 
continental illinois bank amp trust co in chicago asked rhetorically 
if the dollar is nudged up it will have to be slow and 
gradual its come up a bit too quickly over the past few trading 
days he noted 
james mcgroarty vice president at discount corp said the 
dollar did not have enough momentum to test the psychologically 
important levels of 130 japanese yen and 180 west german marks 
generally in north america there was a lack of appetite to 
drive the dollar sharply higher he said to push it higher we 
needed fundamental news and we didnt have any 
while the dollar was off for most of the domestic trading 
session a late wave of buying by australian and new zealand 
investors helped the currency finish mostly higher said robert 
ryan senior trader at irving trust co 
analysts said that while the dollar may be headed higher in the 
long term it is unlikely to test key levels on the upside until 
the release of the next set of us trade figures which could 
serve as a springboard for a further advance

common market leaders should remove 
obstacles to airline mergers by carriers based in different member 
nations western european aviation experts said thursday at a 
seminar here 
farreaching liberalization of the airline industry is 
essential to ensure a free flow of goods and services within the 
eec hans raben head of the dutch civil aviation agency told a 
news conference and it is crystalclear that obstacles against 
international mergers must be removed 
he spoke at the end of the daylong seminar in this southern 
dutch town on the future of the airline industry in the 
deregulated liberalized common market envisioned after 1992 
the conference convened by dutch transport minister neelie 
smitkroes drew 40 representatives from common market airlines 
civil aviation authorities and governments 
the european economic community has a 1992 goal of removing all 
trade barriers among its members including western europes 
patchwork of bilateral aviation agreements 
although some nations notably britain and the netherlands 
already have liberalized aviation agreements most european 
countries severely limit the freedom of operation for foreign 
airlines 
after 1992 european airlines would be free to choose their 
destinations and flight frequencies experts at the seminar 
predicted that only a few very large carriers will be able to 
survive 
seminar participants heard a report by the international 
foundation of airline passenger associations on possible effects of 
european airline mergers on the flying public the dutch transport 
ministry commissioned the report by the private genevabased 
organization 
in the report ifapas executive director geoffrey lipman said 
eec members should maintain some regulations to safeguard airline 
passengers he said that after the 1978 deregulation of civil 
aviation in the united states passenger complaints on congestion 
delays and bad service mushroomed 
raben said that while the us government abolished many of the 
regulations affecting the airline industry in one move were 
planning a gradual change in europe

the worlds sudden enthusiasm for the dollar is 
built on the vicissitudes of guesswork and opinion and it may not 
last 
after months of stability the dollar has jumped about 3 percent 
against the japanese yen and 4 percent against the west german mark 
since june 10 
investors who used to treat the us currency as a sick patient 
are speculating about how high it might rise 
many analysts are happy to explain why they believe the dollars 
rise is long overdue and welljustified but watertight 
explanations have proven notoriously leaky in the past 
certainly there have been some reasonable theories for the 
increase in the dollars value 
for example 
a sharp improvement in the us merchandise trade deficit for 
the month of april raised hopes that the nation was on a steady 
path to balanced trade 
japan reported extremely strong economic growth in early 1988 
raising the possibility that japanese inflation would increase and 
undermine the value of the yen in another potential inflation 
signal the japanese and west german money supplies have been 
growing rapidly 
the finance leaders of the group of seven industrialized 
nations left open the possibility that they would tolerate a 
further increase in the dollars value 
but those explanations and others notwithstanding the latest 
dollar rise is more of a quirk than a response to fundamentals 
the truth is that no one is certain what the dollars 
natural value is if there is even such a thing after all 
history shows the dollar can swing a long way from equilibrium 
in early 1985 the dollar was worth twice what it is worth now in 
terms of yen and marks in light of that experience who can say 
for sure it is properly valued now 
although the latest pressure on the dollar has been upward one 
group of economists says it should fall another 15 or 20 percent 
psychology the mass psychology of the markets is the real 
reason for the dollars latest move 
traders who make a living by trading currencies were bored and 
frustrated by the months of stability in the dollar some of them 
undoubtedly made profits by engineering a rally in the dollar 
the dollars strength is new and it could be shortlived 
as recently as the first quarter of this year private investors 
were so chary of the dollar that foreign central banks were forced 
to finance more than 60 percent of the us current account deficit 
foreign official assets in the united states rose 25 billion in 
the threemonth period more than in any quarter of 1987 notes 
carol stone senior economist of nomura securities international 
inc 
sometime around april ms stone said there was a massive 
change in psychology suddenly she said private foreign 
investors decided they werent afraid to hold dollars 
its one of the virtuouscircle kind of things the dollar has 
remained stable so people think the dollar will continue to remain 
stable it just keeps feeding on itself 
virtuous circles can quickly change to vicious circles 
as long as you are dependent on foreign capital inflows the 
dollar is extremely vulnerable noted jai p bajaj chief 
economist of new york life insurance co 
yes he said it is possible that the united states will move 
surely and steadily from trade deficit to trade surplus by sometime 
in 1990 congress and the next administration may make steady 
progress on reducing the federal budget deficit 
but then again illtimed moves in washington or a sudden 
deterioration in the trade account could inspire a run on the 
dollar bajaj said 
you can very easily fracture foreign confidence in us 
economic management he said i see lots of slippages lots of 
danger

strong gains of the previous two sessions 
the dow jones average of 30 industrial stocks which had risen 
nearly 70 points over tuesday and wednesday to the highest level 
since the october crash lost 391 points to close at 214829 
broader indexes were largely lower 
some traders were disheartened by what they called the markets 
failure to sustain the momentum of a rally that began two days 
earlier they said it reflected a reluctance by a broad range of 
investors to commit significant money to the market for a prolonged 
period 
when a market or a stock breaks out and its in good shape 
what you normally do is at for least several days put some legs 
under it said paul campbell a vice president and market 
technician at nikko securities co international inc in new york 
so i would have to argue that at least so far the fact were 
unable to follow through is a negative not a positive 
others were more optimistic and said the slight retreat should 
be regarded as a sign of underlying strength 
the backtoback days of the magnitude we had are probably 
some cause for some profittaking said john j muldowney head 
of equity and overthecounter trading at scott amp stringfellow inc 
in richmond va im not at all discouraged by this 
others said they expected large institutional investors and 
money managers to put cash into stocks over the next several 
sessions to bolster portfolios before the quarter ends june 30 
that development likely would raise prices 
in addition they said foreigners likely will be increasingly 
attracted to us stocks if the dollars strength is sustained 
that would be another positive for the stock market

all three measures of the nations money supply 
tumbled in midjune the federal reserve board reported thursday 
the fed said its narrowest measure of the money supply m1 fell 
21 billion in the week ended june 13 to a seasonally adjusted 
7718 billion from 7739 billion the previous week 
it said the measure known as m2 fell 48 billion to a 
seasonally adjusted 3013 billion from 3018 billion 
an even broader measure m3 fell 18 billion to a seasonally 
adjusted 3794 billion from 3796 billion 
m1 includes cash in circulation deposits in checking accounts 
and nonbank travelers checks m2 is m1 plus accounts like savings 
deposits and moneymarket mutual funds m3 is m2 plus lessliquid 
accounts such as certificates of deposit in minimum denominations 
of 100000 
the central bank considers the two broader measures of the money 
supply as well as the value of the dollar commodity prices and the 
difference between short and longterm interest rates in setting 
its monetary policy 
but most economists say that recent movements in the money 
supply do not appear to have played a very significant role in 
those deliberations 
in other reports thursday 
the federal reserve bank of new york reported commercial and 
industrial loans at major new york city banks rose 952 million in 
the week ended june 15 compared with a gain of 133 million the 
previous week

extended credit averaged 498 million a day in the week ended 
wednesday down from 562 million the previous week

mexicos stock market reeled thursday after a 
shakeup at the mexican stock exchange where the director the 
operations chief and billions of missing pesos had to be replaced 
exchange officials said wednesday they had accepted the 
resignations of directorgeneral mario segura quiroz and operations 
director reynaldo hernandez balsaldua who has been in a coma since 
attempting suicide last month 
guillermo nunez who was once vice president of the exchanges 
regulatory agency was named interim directorgeneral 
officials also said they were revamping the exchanges controls 
finances administration and operations 
the volatile market promptly nosedived closing down 1096895 
points about 545 percent 
its a big drop theres no question said timothy heyman 
author of a mexican bestseller on investing and head of investment 
strategy at a leading brokerage house here 
some analysts blamed the stock exchanges fall at least in 
part on the scandal saying it had shaken investor confidence 
others called it an expected correction 
theres never just one reason for things to happen heyman 
said in a telephone interview the market has risen rather 
sharply since midmay from 144000 to 203000 about 33 percent 
we expected a correction 
the reorganization came after an audit revealed the exchange was 
missing at least 157 billion pesos of its own not investors 
money or about 7 million 
it is still not clear whether the money vanished through fraud 
mismanagement or a combination of the two exchange officials say 
the shortage could reach 20 billion pesos or more 
exchange president alfredo harp helu said wednesday that the 
condition of the operations director in a coma since shooting 
himself on may 13 at the exchange has blocked a precise 
understanding of what happened to the money 
last year the mexican market was one of the worlds hottest 
but it fell 74 percent in 28 trading days following the worldwide 
stock crash in midoctober officials have been struggling to 
restore confidence in the market and minimize the growing scandal 
in addition to the reorganization members of the exchange 
replaced the missing money and agreed to a code of ethics 
some critics have complained about the exchanges failure to 
turn the case over to judicial authorities for a criminal 
investigation

soybean futures prices dropped sharply tuesday in frenzied 
trading that pushed the july contract to a 15year high near 11 a 
bushel before uncertainty about the weather caused a nervous wave 
of selling 
corn and wheat futures also retreated on the chicago board of 
trade while oats advanced the permissable limit for the fourth 
consecutive session and hit new record highs on fears of further 
damage to the droughtravaged crop 
on other markets cotton futures plunged livestock and meat 
futures fell steeply energy futures were mixed precious metals 
were lower and stockindex futures also lost ground 
were trading hysteria right now cathy leow a new 
yorkbased grain analyst with thomson mckinnon securities inc 
said of the soybean markets erratic performance 
the chicago grain and soybean markets opened sharply higher on 
fears of deepening drought damage but only oat futures sustained 
the bullish momentum on reports estimating oat yield losses of at 
least 50 percent 
soybean futures began falling sharply at midday after the price 
for july had traded up the 45cent limit to 1099 a bushel corn 
and wheat rapidly followed suit 
i was seeing quotes on my machine 10 cents behind what the 
market was trading ms leow said 
ms leow said she knew of no change in weather forecasts and 
blamed the selloff on a loss of nerve among inexperieced 
speculators 
but mario balletto soybean analyst with merrill lynch capital 
markets inc said some traders were worried that storms in the 
gulf of mexico could spawn a hurricane that might eventually bring 
some moisture to the farm belt 
the market is so nervous right now that even the remote 
possibility of rain was enough to trigger the big selloff today 
balletto said 
ms leow said some traders suddenly realized the enormity of 
their risk and decided to take profits 
wheat settled unchanged to 6 cents lower with july at 380 a 
bushel corn was 7 cents lower to 3 cents higher with july at

balfour maclaine corp 
cotton for july delivery settled 2 cents lower at 6640 cents a 
pound

cattle and pork producers to send more animals to slaughter

cattle and pork futures fell the limit early in the day then 
rose from their lows later in the session as soybean prices fell 
live cattle were unchanged to 110 cents lower with august at

a federal judge said thursday he found no 
evidence the association of flight attendants instigated a massive 
overtime boycott at usair which was forced to cancel 179 flights 
over the memorial day holiday 
although us district judge robert standish said the refusal of 
many flight attendants to work overtime during the threeday 
weekend was part of a concerted refusal to fly he said 
evidence was insufficient to prove the union ordered or encouraged 
such a job action 
the judge stopped short however of denying usairs request for 
a preliminary injunction barring future overtime boycotts he said 
he would issue a ruling on the airlines request friday 
although neither side would claim victory or defeat flight 
attendants union attorney deborah greenfield said clearly he 
standish hasnt found any proof of union involvement so far 
usair spokesman david shipley declined to comment on the judges 
actions until a ruling is issued he said the airline has no plans 
to change its longstanding tradition of scheduling overtime for 
its flight attendants 
about 11000 passengers were affected when hundreds of flight 
attendants refused to work overtime during memorial day the 
airline said it lost an estimated 11 million 
usair officials testified during the twoday hearing that about 
onethird of the airlines flight attendants routinely work more 
than the 85 hours a month mandated by their contract 
under their twoyear pact which expires in august usairs 
3000 flight attendants can choose to work up to but no more than 
95 hours a month 
usair sued the union last week amid stalled contract 
negotiations with the 1000 flight attendants of pacific southwest 
airlines which merged with usair in april 
flight attendants union spokeswoman dee maki said major 
unresolved issues in the negotiations which began in july and 
currently are being mediated include an airline proposal to pay 
pacific southwest airlines former attendants at a different rate 
than usairs 
usair has a twotiered pay system for its flight attendants and 
the proposal for pacific southwest airlines workers would create 
two additional tiers until parity is attained in three years she 
said 
if usair could have proved union involvement in the memorial day 
job action the flight attendants union could have been in 
violation of the federal railway labor act which prohibits 
organized work slowdowns strikes sickouts and other such actions 
during contract negotiations 
on thursday ms maki testified she told attendants at union 
meetings and in written memos in may that extra flying time was 
voluntary but did not try to discourage members from working 
overtime 
we told them we will not sponsor anything like that she 
said 
but usair attorney thomas reinert said impromptu notices posted 
in crew lounges encouraging an overtime boycott and statements ms 
maki made to the press expressing her delight over the job action 
were evidence of union involvement

the national association of securities dealers 
said thursday it has asked federal regulators for permission to 
begin an electronic bulletin board for price quotations of 
lowvolume overthecounter stocks 
the nasd currently runs an automated quotation system for 
highvolume stocks but lists prices for smaller stocks by paper in 
the socalled pink sheets 
the association told the securities and exchange commission that 
the new bulletin board system which it wants to operate for a 
sixmonth trial would cover about 7000 of the 20000 to 30000 
pink sheet stocks 
many of the issues are lowpriced but some although traded 
thinly or held by only a few owners are highpriced it said 
the proposed electronic bulletin board will bring new 
visibility and orderliness to a large and heterogeneous market 
nasd president joseph r hardiman said in a statement it is 
expected to speed the process of trading the stocks 
the nasd said it hopes to get sec approval for a trial run in 
time to begin between july and september

said jabalpur is 347 miles southeast of new delhi 
the petition said a union carbide request that bhopal district 
judge mw deo excuse himself from hearing the lawsuit against the 
giant us chemical company amounted to contempt of court

carbide for a toxic gas leak from one of its subsidiary pesticide 
plants in bhopal india the gas leak in december 1984 killed 
nearly 3000 people and injured more than 20000 others in the 
worlds worst industrial disaster 
judge deo ruled last december that union carbide must pay 192 
million to the gas victims as interim relief

union carbide because the company said deo had not ruled on the 
merits of the case union carbide lawyers then filed an application 
asking deo to excuse himself 
deo in a ruling last week refused to dissociate himself from the 
case saying there were no legal grounds for the request 
the contempt of court application thursday said that union 
carbides request was a direct attack on deo and an attempt to 
intimidate him it was designed to obstruct the course of justice

rockwell international corp and two 
employees have been ordered to show why they arent in contempt of 
court for failing to provide documents to a federal grand jury 
a rockwell spokesman issued a terse statement late thursday 
denying that the incident is related to a major investigation into 
pentagon procurement practices and saying the company believes it 
has now resolved the dispute 
the order signed wednesday by us district judge david hansen 
and released thursday did not provide much insight into the 
matter as hansen ordered other court documents sealed to preserve 
the confidentiality of grand jury proceedings 
the order instructed david gilbert whom the company later 
identified as an employee of its collins government avionics 
division to appear next monday in federal court to show why he 
should not be held in civil contempt of court for failing to honor 
a june 15 order requiring production of original computer tapes 
that order was in turn a response to a grand jury subpoena of 
rockwell on may 25 the court order said 
it also orders both the company and gary black rockwells 
assistant general counsel to show why they shouldnt be held in 
both civil and criminal contempt for the same reason judge hansen 
gave the men and the company until 430 pm friday to respond 
the avionics division makes electronic aviation communications 
and navigation equipment for military use 
the court order declared everything except this order to be 
sealed including records of preceding court matters to preserve 
secrecy of the grand jury 
company spokesman mike humbert later released a statement from 
rockwell that said 
this matter has nothing to do with the government 
investigation reported to be underway in washington dc the only 
issue here is a misunderstanding between the collins government 
avionics division and the cedar rapids us attorney concerning the 
governments right of access to information concerning our 
commercial businesses we believe that matter has been resolved 
he declined to elaborate

a toughtalking federal judge on thursday 
kicked off pretrial sessions of a massive 18state antitrust 
lawsuit against some of the nations major insurance companies 
accused of a conspiracy to cut liability coverage for government 
and business 
reporters were told there could be as many as 15 more plaintiffs 
presently unnamed companies from around the country before the 
complex case goes to trial years from now 
california deputy attorney general thomas greene leading the 
plaintiffs said after the twohour session that he would be 
happy if the trial could begin three years from now the states 
are asking for unspecified damages and an injunction to prevent the 
insurers from repeating alleged violations 
a major contributor to the insurance crisis was an illegal 
boycott because the companies pressured the insurance services 
office a 1400member industry trade group to quit distributing 
standard forms to make it difficult for individual companies to 
continue offering certain liability coverage 
there will be no emotional jurytype pleadings only the facts 
us district court judge william w schwarzer warned a huge 
ceremonial courtroom of more than 100 lawyers representing the 
plaintiffs and 32 insurance companies underwriting agencies and 
brokers 
there will be no duplicate arguments the judge sternly 
ordered 
the opening session was the lawsuits status conference roughly 
the judges procedural road map aimed at narrowing the issues 
setting rules and limits for discovery and naming motion argument 
and hearing dates leading to trial 
san francisco attorney guido severi said he anticipated that 14 
or 15 more plaintiffs would be joining the action he said a 
multidistrict panel would decide how the new complaints would be 
heard 
schwarzer referring to himself as a resource of the case 
forced to limit the volume of documents laid before him 
strenuously resisted efforts to convince him to handle defendants 
on an individual basis 
some defense lawyers estimated that the plaintiffs two years of 
investigation had produced 100000 pages and that the companies 
were entitled to see them as part of discovery the judge said he 
wasnt so sure of that 
the judge limited to 25 pages pleadings pertaining to the law 
principally the mccarranferguson act that says insurance 
companies cant be sued for antitrust violations unless conspiracy 
is involved 
the plaintiff states are california maryland connecticut new 
york new jersey pennsylvania ohio colorado montana 
washington alaska michigan massachusetts west virginia 
arizona alabama wisconsin and minnesota texas filed a similar 
suit in its own state court 
regarding discovery information either side is entitled to 
learn about the others case the judge said he would take a dim 
view of efforts aimed at broad exploratory disclosures 
discovery is limited to issues that are essential to deal with 
the issues on both sides ruled schwarzer one of the nations 
most respected jurists on management of issues of disclosure 
the judge ordered a limit of six months for discovery all 
motions to be filed by dec 16 state responses on april 18 1989 
arguments june 16 1989 and a hearing july 7 1989 
the leading defendants are hartford fire insurance co allstate 
insurance co aetna casualty and surety co and cigna corp they 
are accused of arranging among themselves starting around 1984 to 
make liability insurance unavailable or prohibitively expensive 
anticonsumer revisions were made in the forms as a result 
of boycotts threats intimidation and other coercive conduct by 
the defendants said the california complaint by state attorney 
general john van de kamp

the writers guild of america voted 
31 to reject the latest contract offered by movie and television 
producers and to continue its 4monthold strike union officials 
said thursday 
the producers alliance immediately responded by declaring there 
was nothing more to negotiate and that it would produce as many 
fall tv shows as possible and begin layoffs if unable to complete 
the schedule 
negotiations with the writers guild have concluded said 
herb steinberg a spokesman for the alliance of motion picture and 
television producers we have nothing else to discuss with the 
writers guild no further meetings are scheduled 
other than a few shows whose producers have signed contracts 
independent of the alliance for such programs as the cosby show 
and the tonight show virtually all fall entertainment 
programming is threatened by the strike 
the writers voted was 2789 to 933 or 749 percent in favor of 
rejection and 251 percent in favor of acceptance 
we remain ready willing and able to conclude negotiations 
union president george kirgo said 
kirgo said the rejected offer was substantially better than the 
preceding two offers and he credited chief executive officers of 
major studios who joined with us in attempting to end this 
strike 
steinberg said the only further talks would have to be a 
telephone call saying theyre willing to sign the strike settlement 
offer as is 
we are now moving ahead to produce as many programs as we can 
we will do everything we can to get the town back to work if we 
cannot produce our fall schedules in their entirety we will curtail 
operations as required 
steinberg said that meant layoffs and shutting down facilities 
the message to the companies is loud and clear said mona 
mangan executive director of the writers guild east our 
members want a contract that resolves the key issues of the strike 
if the companies end their inflexibility which forced the strike 
and prolonged it we can end this strike quickly and put everyone 
in our industry back to work 
ballots were cast during an often tumultuous membership meeting 
wednesday night in los angeles and another gathering in new york 
writers opposing rejection of the proposed contract had conceded 
they would lose but hoped to get enough votes to convince union 
negotiators to end the strike quickly the union has 9500 members 
the writers coalition a union antistrike group that includes 
some of hollywoods top writerproducers had said that 600 to 700 
votes for the pact would compel union negotiators to listen to the 
coalition said a coalition spokesman who talked on condition of 
anonymity 
there is no victory here said coalition member lionel 
chetwynd the strike goes on were all losing 
business people from lighting suppliers to restaurant and deli 
owners said thursday the contracts rejection would hurt 
if the television shows dont show up in august and september 
the whole industry will be hurting said john clairmont whose 
clairmont cameras supplies television crews 
members voted in person or by proxy on the latest offer from the 
alliance of motion picture and television producers an umbrella 
group representing about 200 studios 
chief union negotiator brian walton received a standing ovation 
late wednesday when he told the crowded meeting inside the 
hollywood palladium i think the strike will end sooner and it 
will end on fairer terms if the latest offer is rejected 
the rancorous meeting included shouted obscenities hallway 
arguments and booeddown speakers as it moved into the late night 
hours 
producers claim their fouryear package will be worth an extra 
71 million to writers and offers an acrosstheboard increase in 
residuals of 147 percent payments to writers at present total 
about 360 million a year producers spokesman herb steinberg said 
the guild claims its negotiators accepted a flexible formula for 
payment on onehour televison shows sold for reruns but was not 
rewarded with a more generous offer for shows sold overseas the 
union has linked the two items in an economic package 
with the new production season upcoming lack of a contract 
could hurt businesses who deal with major production companies that 
have not signed independent contracts with the guild 
other firms which have dealt largely with independent 
production companies that have signed seperate contracts or hired 
nonunion crews have said the strike has had little or no effect 
some are hurting and some are cleaning up with all the 
nonunion work this has created when this strike started we 
started shipping tons of equipment to canada said ed phillips 
president of matthews co a burbank firm that supplies camera and 
lighting equipment 
ron dahlquist president of key lite said his firm supplies 
lighting equipment to the major studios and has been affected 
we have had quite a bit of slowdown weve had to lay people 
off and had a slowdown of production dahlquist said 
we have gone through this before said dahlquist there 
will be some independent productions regardless of a strike and 
there is usually a tremendous surge after the strike is over and 
that more than makes up for the losses 
at arts deli in studio city near the universal studios lot 
owner art ginsburg bemoaned empty lunchtime tables 
we are off a good 10to15 percent he said not only are 
the writers and producers not coming in but also the agents 
meeting with clients the drivers and all the related businesses

deputy assistant navy secretary james gaines 
suspected of being one of several pentagon officials who smuggled 
classified information to a defense consultant has begun telling 
prosecutors what he knows about the pentagon corruption case 
sources said thursday 
there has been some interest shown on the part of some 
individuals in cooperating with the investigation said a justice 
department official speaking on condition of anonymity he said 
some information has already been obtained 
according to other sources gaines whose office was searched 
last week is believed to be one of several people who passed 
procurement information to pentagon officialturnedconsultant 
melvyn paisley 
the los angeles times reported thursday that paisley copied the 
documents with the aid of his wife 
paisley allegedly passed the sensitive information along to his 
major client mcdonnell douglas corp said the sources 
paisley and gaines worked together at the boeing co in seattle 
in the 1970s 
an attorney for the paisleys lawrence barcella rejected the 
accounts of the paisleys alleged activities and criticized the 
government for leaking information about the investigation he said 
it is ironic that leaks are occurring in a case in which the 
government is alleging improper disclosure of sensitive 
information 
meanwhile a former boeing co executive james durst said he 
passed along information to the government more than six years ago 
that paisley had bragged of committing a felony wiretapping 
operation and of conducting bribery internationally on military 
projects 
dursts information was contained in a feb 4 1982 letter to 
former idaho republican gov don samuelson who gave it to sen 
paul laxalt of nevada president reagans close friend durst said 
in a telephone interview thursday night laxalt said in an april 
21 1982 letter to samuelson that the matter had been referred to 
the defense department said durst who said he has a copy of the 
letter abc news reported thursday on dursts allegations and the 
exchange of letters 
barcella called dursts accusations unfounded and said the 
fbi had conducted a full background check on paisley before he was 
appointed to the pentagon post he left last year 
at the heart of the investigation are allegations that defense 
contractors and consultants many of them former military men 
bribed pentagon officials for contracting details that could be 
vital in winning contracts prosecutor henry hudson told 
congressmen wednesday he is looking into 75 to 100 contracts worth 
tens of billions of dollars 
while gaines is talking with prosecutors another pentagon 
official whose office was searched victor cohen is negotiating 
with the government on whether to do the same the sources said 
both gaines and cohen had key procurement jobs in the pentagon 
gaines was deputy assistant navy secretary for acquisition 
management while cohen was a top aide to the deputy assistant air 
force secretary in charge of buying tactical command control 
communications and computer systems both men have been reassigned 
since the investigation became public 
at the white house president reagan told reporters thursday he 
has arranged for a report on the present status of the 
investigation 
responding to a question as he posed for pictures with visiting 
australian prime minister robert hawke reagan said i am asking 
and have arranged they are coming over to give me a full 
report he said the report would deal with the question of 
where are we now and how much do we know already 
in an interview with the associated press richard p godwin 
who was brought into the pentagon as an undersecretary to reform 
its procurement system said former defense secretary caspar 
weinberger is 100 percent wrong in defending the way the 
defense department spends 160 billion a year on purchases of 
weapons and other goods and services 
we have institutionalized a bad system said godwin who 
like weinberger had been an executive at the bechtel group a vast 
construction conglomerate 
godwin said he quit in frustration last fall after 18 months at 
the pentagon where he was supposed to carry out reforms 
recommended by a commission headed by california industrialist 
david packard 
weinberger told the ap on wednesday he thought procurement 
procedures in effect at the pentagon are proper 
the fbi meanwhile said thursday that it had searched several 
more sites in the last two weeks that it had not revealed 
previously including kane paper co of baldwin ny which was 
searched this week 
last week investigators searched the home and office of dennis 
mitchell of poquott ny who works in the surveillance and fire 
control division of unisys corps great neck ny plant the fbi 
said the fbi had announced last week that it had searched that 
unisys plant as well as the malverne ny home of charles 
gardner a former unisys vice president 
in addition the fbi revealed thursday that it had served search 
warrants on scott lamberth of farmington ark who works with 
whittaker corp a defense electronics firm which had been searched 
last week and james neal of oakton va it could not be determined 
immediately if the agents had searched their homes or offices or 
both 
chief pentagon spokesman dan howard said defense secretary frank 
c carlucci held his first meeting with hudson on wednesday 
carlucci like reagan and like weinberger was not briefed about 
the affair until just before it became public knowledge 
howard declined to discuss the substance of the briefing 
received by carlucci from hudson the us attorney for eastern 
virginia or say how frequently the defense secretary expected to 
be updated on the matter 
the spokesman also acknowledged the pentagon has not taken steps 
yet to inhibit the business dealings of defense consultants whose 
names have surfaced in the fbi probe 
earlier this week carlucci ordered gaines cohen and four other 
pentagon officials identified in the investigation temporarily 
reassigned to other jobs 
we simply cannot take an action on the basis of press 
reports howard said now we have asked the department of 
justice to inform us of the names of individuals who may be 
involved in the investigation the department of justice has 
provided us with no names beyond the limited number in this 
building 
and until and unless we are given such information we cannot 
take any action we will take appropriate steps at the appropriate 
time but we are in a kind of limbo here at the moment until this 
investigation proceeds further howard said 
defense department inspector general june gibbs brown told 
reporters she didnt consider the pentagon a soft touch when it 
came to contract fraud and thought the department was getting the 
message across to industry that whitecollar crime doesnt pay 
the number of contractor suspensions and debarments has soared 
from roughly 80 a year in 1981 to about 900 a year now and criminal 
prosecutions also have climbed significantly she said 
i think were doing a very aggressive job in this area she 
said adding that the current probe is a perfect example of how 
the system is working 
prosecutor hudson meantime dropped plans to release by friday 
the affidavits filed by fbi agents in support of requests for 
search warrants he had said earlier this week he hoped to unseal 
them 
sharon dibbley a spokeswoman for hudson said we really 
havent set a time for releasing the search warrants and 
affidavits 
once the search warrants are returned they are usually 
opened she noted they will be but not right now 
asked the reason for the delay she said we dont feel it 
would be beneficial to have them opened at this time 
navy secretary william ball discussed the case thursday with the 
senate armed services committee and several other senators and 
chairman sam nunn dga later announced that hearings will be 
held after congress july 4 recess on the militarys contracting 
system to find whether there are a few rotten apples or many 
rotten applies or basic flaws in the procurement system 
the house armed services committee tentatively scheduled 
hearings for next week on the procurement system
