two attackers thought to be leftist 
guerrillas fired rocketpropelled grenades at the us embassy 
wednesday night and an embassy spokesman said the roof was slightly 
damaged but no one was hurt 
the assailants apparently were siding with panamas military in 
its standoff with the united states 
the embassys chief security officer said the assailants fired 
rocketpropelled grenades he spoke on condition his name not be 
used for fear of reprisals 
police initially said rockets were fired at the building from a 
distance of 150 feet witnesses later said they saw men firing a 
recoilless rifle 
the round apparently hit the fence surrounding the embassy and 
exploded prematurely the security officer said we think it 
went off over over the building we went up on the roof and there 
was absolutely no damage 
us embassy spokesman steven gangstead told the associated 
press in a telephone interview that a projectile hit the embassy 
roof causing minor damage but that no injuries resulted 
the attack took place at 805 pm 
the two terrorists fled in a taxi people at a restaurant across 
the street from the embassy told an ap reporter 
anonymous persons calling the bogota television stations 
noticiero nacional and ultimas noticias said the attack was by the 
omar torrijos brigade of a leftist guerrilla group the april 19 
movement also known as the m19 
omar torrijos was head of panamas military at the time he was 
killed in a plane crash in 1981 
gen manuel antonio noriega now head of panamas defense 
forces has been indicted in the united states on drug charges and 
has been resisting us efforts to oust him as military chief he 
is de facto leader of panama 
m19 pamphlets found outside the bogota radio station santa fe 
said the guerrilla attack was because of us intervention in 
panama and the presence of us troops in honduras 
the united states sent 3200 troops to honduras last week after 
honduras said nicaraguan soldiers penetrated honduran territory 
chasing ussupported contra rebels nicaragua denied the charge 
the embassy is in a section of downtown bogota known as the 
bunker for the elaborate security systems designed to protect the 
homes and diplomatic missions in the area 
in washington state department spokeswoman sondra mccarty said 
the agency heard press reports about the attack but she did not 
immediately have any information or comment 
the m19 has claimed responsibility for dozens of bombings 
against us interests in the last 10 years 
bogota police and the army set up roadblocks throughout bogota 
wednesday night trying to catch the terrorists 
drug traffickers opposed to extradition of colombians to the 
united states to face drug charges claimed responsibility for a car 
bomb that exploded alongside the embassy in november 1984 
a woman was killed and six persons were injured all were 
passersby

with only four weeks left in the season cbs is 
facing its first thirdplace finish in the 35 years that the ac 
nielsen co has been rating television programs 
the network has finished first 26 times including six 
consecutive years until nbc broke its streak in 198586 the first 
time nbc had won a season in three decades 
times change now nbc is predicting it will win this season by 
the widest margin ever 
cbs is barely behind abc in seasontodate ratings the numbers 
that networks and advertisers use as a basis for negotiating 
advertising rates the margin may be small but last place is still 
a blow to prestige at least for cbs it leads the two other 
networks in evening news ratings 
after the 26th weeks of the season nbc led the three networks 
with an average primetime rating of 163 abc had a 139 and cbs 
a 136 the rating is a percentage of the nations 886 million 
households with televisions cbs would have to beat abc by just 
under two points each of the remaining four weeks to tie for second 
place that is unlikely last week for instance cbs edged abc for 
second but only by a third of a point 
cbs regular series lineup is higher rated on average but abc 
won the two weeks it had the winter olympics in prime time and cbs 
conceded it would finish last when a slew of new comedies failed to 
make a dent in the ratings last week 
of the new shows trial and error finished secondtolast in 
the 77 nielsen rankings a reprise of my sister sam was 
thirdtolast and coming of age ranked 59th eisenhower amp 
lutz added to the already strong monday lineup ranked 31st 
cbs has been struggling to draw younger viewers its 
highestrated shows are the venerable newsmagazine 60 minutes 
and the longrunning murder she wrote both on sunday 
of its shows that are new this season cbs can count only friday 
nights beauty and the beast as a ratings success other new 
cbs shows like franks place tour of duty and 
wiseguy have drawn critical praise but have not found a 
sizable audience 
the executive responsible for the 19871988 season schedule 
former cbs entertainment president b donald grant departed the 
network in midseason and was replaced by kim lemasters who wont 
really make his mark on the networks schedule until next season 
look for a major revamping of the cbs lineup next fall with new 
comedies due from gtg entertainment the production company of 
former mtm production chief and former nbc chairman grant tinker 
who has an exclusive deal with cbs cbs also will have mary tyler 
moore back in a comedy and another new show will feature her 
onetime sitcom costar dick van dyke

when the farmworkers union failed 
to persuade civilian officials to remove mario espinal as head of 
the national agrarian institute it took its case to the armed 
forces chief 
in going to gen humberto regalado and the military high command 
the national association of honduran campesinos made plain its 
feeling shared by others that real power in honduras does not lie 
with the civilian government of president jose azcona hoyo 
the union is seeking espinals ouster from the cabinetlevel 
post on grounds that he was stalling on agrarian reform 
espinal nevertheless remains in his post confirmed once again 
by azcona hoyo and so far as is known regalado has not acted 
the campesinos tactic was also used in the past few years by 
bus drivers teachers business leaders and other sectors it 
underscores the powerful even dominant role still exercised by 
the armed forces six years after honduras restored civilian 
government 
honduras has a long history of military governments most 
recently in the 197282 period 
the people know where the source of power lies said anibal 
puerto vice president of the independent human rights commission 
and a critic of azcona hoyos administration even government 
supporters acknowledge the imbalance of power 
longstanding vices are not gotten rid of from the night to the 
morning said joaquin luna mejia president of the honduran 
council on private enterprise 
in an interview with the associated press he said consolidation 
of civilian power is coming along well but he also observed 
here as in all countries interests are managed according to the 
real powers and if those powers are ambitious we could fall again 
into old vices 
no honduran politician is going around saying weve got to 
put the military back in the box because here the military never 
has been in the box said a western diplomat 
compared to its neighbors honduras has enjoyed a degree of 
stability and peace during a decade of regional conflict but the 
civil wars surrounding it have caused big problems 
we have become a sanctuary said luna mejia of honduras 
tens of thousands of refugees from el salvador nicaragua and 
guatemala all torn by guerrilla wars we are victims of the 
entry into our country of irregular forces 
he referred to the contras who since 1982 have been trying to 
topple the sandinista government in nicaragua until last year a 
contra force estimated at 6000 to 12000 men had waged the better 
part of the campaign from base camps in honduras along the 
nicaraguan border the rebels say most of their forces are now 
inside nicaragua 
by congressional vote the united states has cut off further 
military aid damaging prospects for longterm effectiveness inside 
nicaragua 
there is a great concern that the contras if defeated will 
try to come back here said luna mejia 
gen regalado told journalists in february he hoped the contras 
would be able to keep up their fight but said if they cannot they 
are not welcome back in honduras 
we have instructed immigration authorities along the border to 
ensure that they do not return he said 
puerto sees a connection between the contra problem and 
continued military preponderance in honduran politics citing 
honduras very strong alliance with washington he said to whom 
does the honduran army owe its allegiance everything indicates it 
owes its allegiance to the united states and not to its own 
people 
he said civilian government and close alignment with the united 
states had done little to alleviate the poverty of hundreds of 
thousands in this mainly agricultural country of 45 million people 
people expected something different from civilian government 
but they got more of the same puerto said if things continue 
like this people may lose faith in socalled democracy and look 
for other less desirable forms of struggle 
azcona hoyo is past the midway point in the fouryear term to 
which he was inaugurated in january 1986 elections are scheduled 
in november 1989

blunt criticisms of art censors have come to 
be expected from chinas most famous movie director wu tianming 
even more than the evocative and provocative films produced by his 
studio 
it takes no prompting to set him off 
those people censors were used to making hypocritical 
propaganda wu grumbled in a recent interview people who have 
feudal and ultraleft ideas and bureaucrats get in the way of 
our work 
even the censors however have been unable to stop the cascade 
of domestic and international honors awarded in the past four years 
to wus movies and those of young directors who work under him at 
the xian film studio in chinas ancient capital 
since wu became its director in 1983 the debtridden studio in 
arid northwestern china has become a prolific producer of 
hauntingly beautiful technically innovative movies that have 
raised chinas standing in the international film community many 
in one way or another also have been seen as affronts to socialism 
for example wus own old well about a poor villages 
efforts to dig a well won top honors last year at the tokyo 
international film festival and a special prize at the hawaii 
international film festival and received critical acclaim in new 
york 
but its release to prudish chinese audiences was delayed for 
months because of the movies depiction of a love triangle 
including several kissing scenes of unusual passion 
the black cannon directed by huang jianxing one of wus 
stable of young directors aroused heated debate because it 
attacked mindless bureaucracy it eventually was named best movie 
of 1985 by chinas ministry of broadcast film and television 
another xian studio release the horse thief directed by 
tian zhuangzhuang never was shown to general chinese audiences 
because of its depiction of poverty among tibetan horsemen 
from his brick office compound with peeling paint and leaking 
pipes the 48yearold wu said he wants to expand the limits of 
what is acceptable in chinese filmmaking largely restricted since 
1949 to socialist morality tales 
wu said the studio does not seek to create controversy but it 
often results because he and his fellow directors are trying to 
depict the often harsh realities of life in china 
this frightens conservative bureaucrats accustomed to propaganda 
movies he said they lived illusions they cannot accept any 
movie that reflects the dark side of life 
its a side of life wu knows well he was born in the mountains 
of shaanxi province north of xian where perpetual drought keeps 
many peasants in poverty during the 196676 farleftist cultural 
revolution he was denounced as a rightist and paraded through 
xians streets wearing a signboard proclaiming his political sins 
afterward he said he went home and shut my door and 
studied for the rest of the tumultuous decade during which china 
made almost no movies 
wu is willing to take risks not only for his own movies but 
those of other directors at the xian studio one reason it has 
attracted talented young directors and cinematographers 
on his movie the black cannon huang said the moment we 
saw the film for the first time we knew it would be controversial 
but we had a common idea he said pointing to wu that 
this film should reflect life we felt some pressure when the film 
was not immediately approved but mr wu said at one meeting if 
problems occurred he would be held responsible 
another attraction is wus readiness to give young directors 
free rein 
asked if he gives advice to the less experienced 34yearold 
huang wu laughed and said he does fine on his own if i were to 
help him i might stifle him 
there would be great prosperity in chinas literature and arts 
if all artistic leaders followed my example to let artists do what 
they like 
wu is harsh in his criticism of standard chinese movie fare 
sixty percent of chinese movies are seriously lacking he said 
but he is no kinder to foreign movies 
he disliked steven spielbergs empire of the sun partly 
filmed in shanghai about the japanese invasion of china in world 
war ii wu also said he does not seek to copy western movies 
he says his studios movies are the best being made in china 
now and was confident his own old well will sweep the chinese 
critics and government awards for best movie of 1987 
several upcoming xian movies appear ripe to arouse debate one 
is about army chief peng dehuai purged in 1958 for daring to 
criticize mao tsetung another concerns three youths whose lives 
are failures despite their efforts to get ahead 
maybe some people will think its too gray huang said of 
the latter movie which he is directing to be called floating 
out of the sea 
his own output is relatively slim in addition to codirecting 
two movies he has directed just three old well life 
1984 and river without a buoy 1983 all three have received 
prizes at home or abroad 
the demands of running a studio that employs 1450 and is 
perpetually in debt will keep him from starting his next movie 
before next year he said 
will it be controversial 
yes wu said emphatically using one of his few english 
words definitely

the shortage of good books in the soviet union is 
being assaulted in a twofront war with 3500 previously banned 
titles being published and a new law in the works that will allow a 
vanity press 
soviets have complained for years that while state bookstores 
are overflowing with political reflections moralistic fiction and 
the works of communist party officials people are hard pressed to 
lay their hands on the best writing of soviet russian and foreign 
authors 
two newspapers referred to the book deficit on tuesday in 
announcing programs aimed at expanding the pool of quality 
literature available at bookshops or public libraries 
the communist party daily pravda said authors willing to risk 
their own money will be able to publish their works sharing in 
earnings from government sales or absorbing the loss if the 
material fails to draw a following 
alla a kozdreva a legal consultant at the state publishing 
committee that will oversee the private project told the 
associated press restrictions will be established on content and 
the size of press runs during meetings to be held later this month 
but the decision to allow publishing by authors willing to pay 
has been made in principle ms kozdreva said 
the project is primarily aimed at luring freelance writers into 
the public market and keeping them from turning to unsanctioned 
underground presses under existing regulations on use of printing 
facilities only fulltime stateapproved authors can get their 
prose and poetry produced legally 
the state publishing committee also is seeking new sources of 
revenue in these days of financial accountability pravda said 
under mikhail s gorbachev government agencies have been 
instructed to generate revenue to cover operating expenses 
gorbachevs tenure has also seen a major rethinking of 
government policy on the arts and artistic freedoms including the 
printing of books that were once banned 
in addition to the vanity press venture state presses soon will 
be turning out new editions of highly popular works by mikhail 
bulgakov author of the master and margarita and boris 
pasternak who won the 1958 nobel literature prize for his novel 
doctor zhivago it has not yet been published in book form in 
his homeland 
the newspapers did not say whether foreign literature was 
included among the books to be made available foreign writers such 
as jack london ernest hemingway and emile zola are very popular in 
the soviet union and some have been available for years 
no details were given on the pricing system to be used for books 
published by their authors 
this is not going to be a cheap venture for the author 
pravda warned depending on the number of copies and the volume 
such a publication will cost roughly 2000 rubles and more 
that sum the equivalent of 3340 represents nearly a years 
pay for the average industrial worker 
the author in return will receive 20 percent of the sales 
income pravda said 
the program has not yet been put into the form of law pravda 
noted but already state publishing houses have many applications 
from authors who want to pay to see their works in print 
by offering an alternative to creation of publishing 
cooperatives the state publishing committee retains a monopoly on 
what gets into print 
on a related subject the newspaper soviet culture disclosed 
tuesday that glavlit the state body which for decades has been 
responsible for censorship is conducting a review of 6000 books 
held in special detention storehouses 
most of the fiction and nonfiction titles were banned during 
the 29year dictatorship of josef v stalin and removed from 
library shelves and book kiosks because their authors were deemed 
to have espoused politically hazardous ideas 
the vast majority of those books were works whose authors were 
subjected to repression during the years of stalins personality 
cult vladimir a solodin a member of the review committee told 
soviet culture the others had other faults for example 
forewords written by such repressed politicians quotes from their 
works or their photographs 
among the blacklisted books were 180 that contained references 
to nikolai i bukharin and 70 that mentioned alexei i rykov two 
prominent political figures from the early years of the soviet 
government executed by stalin but recently rehabilitated by 
gorbachev 
glavlit or the chief directorate for the protection of state 
secrets in publishing was created in 1922 to ensure freedom of the 
soviet press from ideological impurity it has served since as the 
chief censorship agency and would have banned the blacklisted 
books in the first place 
a glavlit committee went through 4000 of the banned titles in 
the past year and returned 3500 to the public domain the 
newspaper said it gave no examples of the works returned to 
readers but said the review was helping to resolve the deficit in 
good literature 
the 500 books left in special detention are mostly profoundly 
instigatory literature and nationalistic writings that could be 
used for ill purposes if allowed into general distribution solodin 
said 
the decision to keep them under wraps is not final and the 
glavlit committee will take another look at them once the initial 
screening is completed solodin said

cancer patients whose bone marrow was 
destroyed by therapy regained marrow function after injections of 
their own blood cells suggesting an alternative to marrow 
transplants says a study released today 
the bloodcell technique may permit aggressive cancer treatment 
in patients who cannot get marrow transplants said margaret 
kessinger associate professor of medicine at the university of 
nebraska college of medicine 
marrow transplant experts said its nearterm usefulness would be 
limited but that it may have potential for wider use 
bone marrow creates the blood cells of the diseasefighting 
immune system marrow transplants are used in cancer therapies when 
the doses of anticancer drugs or radiation are so high they will 
destroy the marrow 
in some cases marrow is withdrawn from the pelvic bone of the 
patient while the patient is under general anesthesia it is stored 
in the laboratory while the cancer therapy is performed then 
injected back in the person the marrow cells migrate to the bones 
and multiply until they replenish the marrow lost in the therapy 
for other patients a donor is preferable but only 30 percent of 
such patients have a willing donor usually a sibling whose marrow 
is similar enough for their bodies will accept said kessinger who 
spoke to science writers at an american cancer society seminar 
about 4000 people a year in the united states give up marrow to 
have it returned after treatment said david golde chief of 
hematology and oncology at the university of california los 
angeles school of medicine 
worldwide about 1500 marrow transplants from one person to 
another are done annually said robert peter gale professor of 
medicine at ucla who performed bonemarrow transplants on soviet 
radiation poisoning victims from the chernobyl nuclear power plant 
fire 
kessinger said the experimental technique involves extracting 
white blood cells from a patients blood in fourhour sessions 
every day for six days blood is removed and returned to the 
patient after white cells are removed she said the body replaces 
the white cells about as fast as they are extracted she said 
the goal is to harvest a kind of cell called the pluripotent 
stem cell which essentially replaces lost bone marrow 
the pluripotent stem cells cannot be identified in human blood 
but apparently are removed with white cells kessinger said 
she described a study of 26 patients who went through the 
procedure and were watched for evidence of marrow function 
in comparison with 83 patients whose bone marrow was harvested 
by conventional means the experimental group first showed white 
cells in the blood three days sooner for an average of eight days 
after the procedure she said 
both groups took the same amount of time to recover other marrow 
function she said 
results suggest the procedure could be used in patients who 
could not give their own marrow because of prior radiation to the 
pelvis or cancer in their marrow she said that could come to 
several hundred patients a year she said 
it might also help increase the pool of donors for those who 
need another persons marrow since the donor would not have to 
undergo general anesthesia she said donors not related to the 
patient might be willing she said 
gale estimated that the pelvicradiation situation would apply 
to fewer than 100 patients a year as for those with cancer in 
their marrow cancerous cells may also be in the blood and the new 
technique might simply plant them in the renewed marrow he said 
kessinger said studies suggest that that would not necessarily 
cause cancer in the marrow 
gale said the technique could have considerable use if that 
issue were overcome and if it proved an attractive alternative to 
anesthesia for unrelated donors 
in any case it must be studied for any effect on cancer 
survival rates he said

cornell university is cataloging books 
personal papers videotapes and periodicals with names like mom 
guess what and fag rag hoping its new gay archives will 
help bring the study of human sexuality out of the academic closet 
the materials comprising one of the nations most extensive 
collections on homosexuality are nearly all gifts from the 
mariposa education and research foundation founded in 1979 by 
physiologist bruce voeller who felt universities were neglecting 
human sexuality 
the basic endowment for maintenance of the archives 824000 
came from the estate of david goodstein a cornell alumnus who 
became wealthy on wall street and later published the national gay 
magazine the advocate until his death in 1985 
the first materials arrived last month and are being stored in 
103 acidfree cardboard boxes in the basement of cornells olin 
library the collection available for research this fall 
eventually will include hundreds of thousands of items dating to 
world war ii university archivist h thomas hickerson said the 
school also intends to collect materials dealing with other aspects 
of human sexuality 
the mariposa collection includes material from anita bryants 
bruising battle with gay activists in 1978 over a proposed gay 
rights constitutional amendment in florida 
the militant homosexuals are at it again read one of 
bryants mailed appeals it warned that passage of the amendment 
would help homosexuals legitimize their perversion and recruit 
our children 
among the 50 or so gay periodicals in the collection is mom 
guess what a 10yearold monthly published in sacramento calif 
there are rare foreign periodicals some no longer published 
nouvel homo from france bergensnyt from norway 
emancipation from berlin another the circle was 
published years ago in german french and english in switzerland 
in hindsight its interesting to read how goodsteins own 
periodical the advocate ranked aids ninth on its list of 
top 10 gay stories of 1982 behind such largely forgotten 
stories as the appointment of a homosexual minister to the staff of 
a united methodist parish in denver since then the us death 
toll from acquired immune deficiency syndrome has reached 31836 
forcing drastic changes in social and sexual practices among 
homosexual men its primary victims in this country 
among the collections personal papers is a march 1976 letter to 
the horace mannbarnard school protesting the prep schools refusal 
to print biographical material in its alumni magazine about the gay 
rights activities of two graduates one of whom was martin 
duberman a member of the national gay task force and a history 
professor at lehman college in new york city 
the mariposa collections only rival in size and breadth is at 
the kinsey institute at indiana university but the cornell 
collection differs in stressing sexuality in its political 
historical and social context rather than focusing on clinical 
aspects 
harvard has collections of lesbian materials brown yale and 
the university of michigan also have collections relating to 
homosexuality but such archives remain rare as are nonmedical 
courses on human sexuality generally 
a computer search of 137000 university collections turned up 
only 19 containing anything on homosexuality and seven are at 
cornell 
the prime force in getting the archives to cornell was 
goodstein who for years shared a house in los angeles with 
voeller he felt very strongly that its inexcusable that so many 
things center around human sexuality and we have so little 
scholarly knowledge voeller said in an interview from his office 
in topanga calif mariposa also has offices in new york and san 
diego 
after trying unsuccessfully to interest the new york public 
library in the collection a decade ago goodstein turned to his 
alma mater in 1983 
at first said cornell provost robert barker we didnt 
understand the seriousness of the proposal but goodstein a 
man with a short fuse who did not take lightly to being brushed 
off pressed his case and went to the student and local 
newspapers 
soon after university librarians inspected the materials and 
concluded the collection had great scholarly importance 
university officials say there was little debate over the 
decision to bring the collection to cornell alain seznec 
libraries director said the lack of commotion is perhaps a sign of 
how far american campuses have progressed 
there are some battles that are past us somehow he said 
getting this archive is not some courageous stand by cornell 
there undoubtedly will be outraged alumni who will say cancel my 
subscription to the alumni bulletin not that well do anything 
about it

stronger economic sanctions against south 
africa would only strengthen proapartheid forces create problems 
for the us economy and weaken us influence in that nation 
reagan administration officials said tuesday 
in testimony before a joint hearing of two house foreign affairs 
subcommittees representatives from the departments of state 
defense commerce and treasury maintained that the tougher 
sanctions currently before congress would not speed up the end of 
apartheid 
charles w freeman jr deputy assistant secretary of state for 
african affairs warned that proposed new sanctions including a 
total investment and trade embargo would play into the hands of 
the white and black extremists who seek our departure from south 
africa 
we have to decide whether the united states will continue to 
be involved in the struggle to end apartheid peacefully or whether 
we will become more and more irrelevant he added 
the pretoria government has moved toward the brink of 
wholesale authoritarianism and international isolation since 
congress overrode the presidents veto on the first us sanctions 
in 1986 freeman said 
he maintained that this has weakened us influence there and 
threatens to curtail other us assistance to apartheid victims 
but rep ronald dellums dcal said that to be true to its own 
democratic standards the united states cannot be in bed in some 
fashion with the evil and the horror and the oppression of south 
africa 
he is the author of legislation calling for a total ban on us 
investment and trade with south africa as well as cooperation in 
military and intelligence affairs his is one of five bills calling 
for stricter sanctions aginst south africa 
dellums said existing sanctions permitted back door us 
financing of the south african government and economy and that us 
firms were paying much more in south african taxes than for 
projects to uplift the black community 
james b kelley deputy assistant secretary of commerce note 
that that us firms in south africa had decreased from 320 in 1984 
to 127 today and insisted that what little us influence is left 
will be lost if the remaining firms are forced out 
calling the proposed legislation nonsensical and destructive 
assistant treasury secretary robert a cornell said the measures 
would harm the interests of the nonwhite population by 
reducing their opportunities while expanding the economic power of 
the south african whites 
barring us exports and oil companies from operating in south 
africa would cost us jobs but not hurt south africa because other 
suppliers would step in cornell said

largest insurer at least 8 million 
prudential insurance co of america is offering the payment to

held was listed as worth 92885 instead of 92885000 
us bankruptcy judge howard buschman iii heard closing 
arguments on the proposed settlement tuesday and is expected to 
rule in several days 
why because of a clerical error should we give up 92 
millionplus prudential spokesman joseph vecchione said tuesday 
if buschman knocks down the proposed settlement and decides the 
lien is only worth 92885 prudential would collect only that 
much the rest of its claim would be thrown into the pool with 
other creditors 
the case is part of the chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings of 
mclean industries inc parent of united states lines prudential 
holds the lien in connection with mortgages on eight of the 
companys container ships 
the sale of the eight lancerclass ships was expected to raise 
at least 51 million all of which ordinarily would go to 
prudential because the lien puts it at the head of the line of 
creditors 
but the missing zeros have weakened prudentials standing 
prudential is proposing to pay the shipping company 17 percent 
of the sales net proceeds an estimated 8 million that money 
would be distributed among other creditors most of whom support 
the proposal 
but general electric capital corp which shares a second 
mortgage on the ships with prudential opposes the deal saying the 
lien should be considered worth 92885 
the settlement is not in the best interests of the bankruptcy 
estate sandy mayerson a lawyer representing ge capital said 
tuesday 
prudential says the clerical error repeated on at least 20 
documents was committed by someone at a law firm it once used 
haight gardner poor and havens 
prudential has said it has not decided whether to file 
malpractice lawsuits against haight gardner and its overall 
outside counsel on the transaction dewey ballantine bushby palmer 
amp wood both law firms have declined to comment

the most detailed survey of the milky way 
will start thursday at the worlds most sensitive radio telescope 
an array of 27 dishshaped antennas spread across new mexicos 
desert 
without a doubt this will give us the most comprehensive 
picture of our galaxy yet obtained in any kind of wavelength 
including visible light and radio and infrared radiation said 
robert h becker associate professor of astronomy at the 
university of california davis 
the 1 million twoyear survey will be conducted by becker and 
astronomer david helfand of columbia university they will use the 
very large array radio telescope a set of 27 antenna dishes each 
about 80 feet in diameter that move on 20 miles of tracks west of 
socorro nm 
the telescope which started operations in the late 1970s can 
detect fainter radio signals than any other radio telescope becker 
said tuesday during a telephone interview 
more complete surveys of the heavens beyond our galaxy have been 
conducted using powerful optical and infrared telescopes aimed to 
look above or below the milky ways flattened disk 
but such telescopes cant survey our own galaxy very well 
because visible light is blocked by tremendous amounts of dust 
between the milky ways stars and because the galaxy is so full of 
infrared light sources that its hard to distinguish various 
objects becker said 
the survey will construct maps of the 70 percent of the milky 
way visible from the northern hemisphere by detecting objects that 
emit radio waves which penetrate the dust 
such objects include supernovas or dying exploding stars vast 
dustandgas clouds where new stars are born and very dense 
supernova remnants called neutron stars pulsars and black holes 
what this kind of survey can do is give you the overall 
picture becker said until you catalog the contents of your 
own galaxy youre never going to have a clear picture of what the 
galaxy is 
the diskshaped milky way contains an estimated 100 billion 
stars clumped in spiraling arms that stretch across 100000 light 
years or about 588000 trillion miles of space earth is located 
roughly 22000 light years or 130000 trillion miles from the 
galaxys center 
becker said the survey undoubtedly will produce unexpected 
discoveries but also could help astronomers determine the 
frequency and location of supernova explosions invisible to optical 
telescopes 
shock waves from such explosions are thought to compress gas and 
dust to create new stars 
the survey will help determine if that theory is correct by 
showing if there is a link between the location of supernovas and 
regions of star formation becker said 
while some stars leave nothing behind after they explode as 
supernovas other supernovas collapse into dense neutron stars 
rotating neutron stars called pulsars or even more dense objects 
called black holes which have gravity so intense that not even 
light escapes 
becker said the survey should help astronomers learn what 
proportion of supernovas become neutron stars pulsars or black 
holes because such objects generate radio signals 
while the survey wont detect life that might exist elsewhere in 
the galaxy it could help scientists improve estimates of the odds 
that such life exists becker said 
if one wants to estimate the probability of finding 
intelligent life elsewhere in our galaxy you have to know what the 
environment of our galaxy is including the number of objects 
that may be orbited by inhabited planets he said 
recent improvements to the very large array gave it a much 
larger field of view so it will take fewer pointings of the 
telescope to map out the milky way becker said 
becker and helfand will have 300 hours of viewing time during 
the survey they then will spend another year or two using 
computers to contruct maps using the detected radio signals 
the first 20 to 24 hours of surveyrelated observations will 
start thursday and end saturday with more intermittent 
observations regularly scheduled during the next two years each 
time the antennas are reaimed becker said 
the survey is financed by the university of california the 
national science foundation and lawrence livermore national 
laboratory

a prosecutor told the arizona senate on 
tuesday that gov evan mechams 80000 loan from a protocol fund 
to his car dealership was an intentional and wrongful act 
while the defense acknowledged it was not politically smart 
the statements came as the senate turned to the second of three 
charges against mecham at his impeachment trial misusing state 
funds 
mecham who has not attended the trial except when he testified 
last week said tuesday in a radio interview that he probably will 
appeal to the us supreme court if the state senate convicts him 
in his impeachment trial 
the governor also said that if he is acquitted and allowed to 
resume his job he will fire state department of public safety 
director ralph milstead one of his chief accusers in the trial 
theyll probably say this is another one of those gaffes but 
a lot of the rats have come out of their holes thats been after 
me and now we know a lot more who they are mecham said quite 
frankly ill be a lot wiser governor from here on out 
mecham said if he is convicted by the senate it will 
certainly not be on the basis of evidence and on that well go and 
appeal it of course probably direct to the us supreme 
court 
if they were to try to forbid me from holding office without 
showing that there was some justification i dont think they could 
prevail 
at the trial a mecham campaign adviser and a deputy county 
attorney testified that the 80000 was raised by mechams 
inaugural ball and put into a protocol fund to be used for gifts 
such as indian dolls and ashtrays for visiting dignitaries 
deputy maricopa county attorney howard schwartz who helped 
draft the agreement to place the money in the protocol fund said 
that when he heard about the loan i personally was shocked and 
initially felt betrayed 
i was very surprised and disappointed and saddened by the 
entire situation said warner lee a former state attorney 
general who advised the mecham inaugural committee such an 
application of the funds was never anticipated by anyone involved 
schwartz and lee acknowledged mechams defense lawyers 
suggestion that everyone expected the money to be invested 
i dont think anyone assumed the money would be placed in a 
cigar box somewhere said lee 
later mechams former chief of staff jim colter who signed 
the 80000 check testified that mecham asked him not to record a 
document securing the loan colter did not explain why mecham would 
not have wanted it recorded 
i asked the governor do you want this deed of trust 
recorded colter recalled he said i would rather you 
wouldnt i dont think anything more was said 
colter said he felt that the loan was politically unwise but 
did not feel that any law was being broken such a thought never 
entered my mind or i would have objected he said 
earlier after a heated debate a senator withdrew a motion 
consider the firstterm republicans expulsion from office merely 
on the first count obstruction of justice sentiment in the 
senate was clearly against the move 
it would be our everlasting disgrace if we do not consider all 
of the evidence from both sides in such a historic and important 
case said republican sen jon hays 
democratic sen carolyn walker said she was withdrawing the 
motion because it appears i will be accused of depriving gov 
mecham of his rights 
had mecham been convicted on the first charge the trial would 
have ended because he would no longer be governor 
the first of three broad impeachment charges alleges that mecham 
obstructed justice by trying to thwart an investigation into an 
alleged death threat the final testimony on that charge was heard 
tuesday 
mecham the first us governor to face an impeachment trial in 
six decades also is charged with concealing a 350000 campaign 
loan 
mecham is scheduled for an april 21 criminal trial on felony 
charges of concealing the 350000 loan he also faces a may 17 
recall election 
in a lowkey 15minute opening statement house prosecutor 
william french told senators the 80000 loan to mecham pontiac 
was wrong 
defense attorney jerris leonard responded that the loan broke no 
law 
it was not politically smart theres no question about that 
said leonard but i think the evidence will establish it 
certainly wasnt evil 
french said mechams inaugural committee planned to use the 
92000 raised by the ball to reduce mechams campaign debt but 
learned that a state campaign spending law might forbid it and 
agreed to the protocol fund instead 
in july 1987 french said an 80000 check was written on that 
account to mechams car dealership 
french scoffed at mechams oftstated contention that he helped 
the state by paying higher interest than the money would get from a 
bank 
the evidence will show it was not a good loan said french 
it was a bad loan because of the financial condition of mecham 
pontiac the money was loaned to mecham pontiac because they 
had a desperate need for it 
leonard promising a return appearance to the witness stand from 
mecham said the governor would stand by his contention that the 
loan was fiscally wise and noted the loan was repaid before the 
charges were filed 
meanwhile a lawyer defending mecham on the criminal charges 
sought dismissal on grounds that the governor has been singled out 
for prosecution because he is unpopular 
other republican politicians including attorney general bob 
corbin whose office sought the indictment oppose mecham and 
they believe that the party would be better if he is out of 
there defense lawyer michael scott told judge michael ryan of 
maricopa county superior court 
however prosecutor michael cudahy said its a crazy 
allegation and there is no support for it 
ryan did not immediately rule on the motion to dismiss the 
charges on grounds of selective prosecution

while president reagans veto had little 
chance of killing the 1988 civil rights bill it certainly made 
life uncomfortable for republican presidential candidates george 
bush and bob dole 
both reverted to type as congress overrode the reagan veto bush 
playing the totally loyal second banana dole dancing on both sides 
of the issue 
im going to stand with the president said the vice 
president who has demonstrated in recent weeks the political plus 
of sticking by your boss at the same time bush was at pains to 
say he thought the government should do what the bill seemed to be 
doing 
dole said he supported the bill that reagan opposed 
nonetheless he said he would side with the president if his 
vote were needed to sustain the veto the kansas senator offered 
his help from the safe distance of about 1000 miles as he 
campaigned for survival in wisconsin 
were these just statements by two politicians trying to get on 
both sides of a delicate issue 
or was their discomfiture a symptom of something deeper an 
uneasy feeling that reagans legacy may be a mixed blessing for the 
gop presidential nominee next fall 
reagan has succeeded in maintaining a remarkable level of 
popularity for more than seven years 
but like it says on many prizes reagans popularity is 
redeemable only by him it is not transferrable in a republican 
primary maybe but not in a general election 
richard darman former reagan aide was quoted by hedrick smith 
in his new book the power game as pointing out that 
reagans programmatic agenda is simply not the majority agenda 
according to darman the political system tells reagan look we 
like you youre an icon you represent almost everything we ever 
loved about america 
but the same system has demonstrated opposition to such reagan 
proposals as constitutional amendments to ban abortion and restore 
prayer in schools as well as his budget priorities 
anybody said darman who tries for too long to run against 
the majority simply will not hold power to govern a president has 
to move toward the middle 
but reagans presidency is winding down governing is a problem 
for his successors 
and figuring out how to separate themselves from the less 
popular parts of the reagan agenda is a particular problem for 
republicans 
i think the vice president made a serious mistake said rep 
bill green rny who voted to override apparently he felt 
caught between his basic support of civil rights and his loyalty to 
the president and went with loyalty 
the vice president is in a box said former party chairman 
richard richards a bush supporter if he deviates one iota 
there are some rightwing nuts out there who will say he cannot 
carry on the reagan revolution 
i dont think youre going to find him looking for areas of 
disagreement said peter teeley a bush aide the fact is six 
months ago everybody was writing that george bush had to disagree 
with the president in order to get the nomination everyone now 
sees that that was a myth 
no question that bushs identification with reagan was a big 
plus for the vice president in the new hampshire primary and in the 
south two areas where the presidents popularity is very high 
likewise it dragged bush down in iowa south dakota and 
minnesota midwest states where reagans magic has faded 
civil rights is an area where reagan has always taken a narrow 
legalistic view 
to the president the bill did not assure rights for potential 
victims of discrimination so much as it allowed the government to 
intrude into areas where it didnt belong 
he called it a dangerous bill and a washington power 
grab 
at high noon on tuesday the senate overrode reagans veto and a 
few hours later the house followed suit 
at issue was legislation that would cut off federal aid to 
organizations or institutions any part of which discriminated 
against minorities women the elderly or the disabled four years 
ago the supreme court in a case involving grove city college in 
pennsylvania ruled that existing law only permitted the cutoff of 
funds for programs in which discrimination was demonstrated 
speaking to a black audience bush said the bill was 
imperfect the imperfections should be corrected but then he 
went on to say he supported its purpose the federal government 
must require that organizations that get tax dollars comply with 
our civil rights laws 
dole got himself in a terrible tangle 
i have always supported legislation to overturn grove city to 
restore the broad civil rights coverage that existed prior to that 
case he said 
campaigning in wisconsin the day of the vote dole said he 
would support overriding the veto if he were in washington but he 
added if it were the deciding vote i would side with the 
president 
at any rate he wasnt in washington

eastern airlines is telling a federal judge 
that his order prohibiting the carrier from selling its east coast 
air shuttle service plunges the financially troubled company into 
even deeper problems 
the airline asked us district judge john h pratt on tuesday 
to reverse his own march 10 contempt finding against eastern and 
allow it to begin taking steps to sell its profitable shuttle 
operation 
the company also asked the judge to partially rescind penalties 
that he levied againts eastern on monday including the threat of 
future 10000aday fines 
in its court papers eastern said that forbidding the shuttle 
deal will tie the hands of management struggling to cope with 
ongoing financial losses of a troubled company 
the documents filed by john j gallagher a lawyer for eastern 
called the judges orders unprecedented and gravely dangerous to 
eastern 
an attorney for the union that has sought to block the shuttle 
deal said the labor group would continue its struggle 
this argument that somehow theyre paralyzed is really aimed 
more at trying to get the sympathy of the court said john 
edmond a lawyer for the international association of machinists 
and aerospace workers the iam has never attempted to stop 
eastern from running a business 
under the stay eastern has requested the airline would be 
allowed to proceed with its efforts to sell the shuttle but would 
not be permitted to complete the deal until the entire case was 
decided in the meantime eastern would face no penalties 
the case stems from a bitter dispute between eastern and its 
largest union the machinists 
the machinists who represent 12000 eastern mechanics and other 
ground workers have opposed various efforts by eastern and its 
parent company texas air corp to sell some of easterns most 
valuable assets 
corporate officials say eastern needs the cash generated by the 
asset sales but the unions say the sales are designed to reduce 
the airlines size and labors clout 
in the proposed deal eastern would sell the shuttle to a new 
texas air subsidiary for 225 million the shuttle flies between 
boston new york and washington dc 
eastern lost 182 million last year 
last july 2 pratt ordered eastern to refrain from making any 
changes in the working conditions of the unions members in 
issuing his contempt finding the judge ruled that eastern violated 
that stricture by trying to sell the shuttle 
the disputes between eastern and texas air and their unions are 
gaining increased attention from congress on tuesday sen frank 
lautenberg dnj chairman of the senate appropriations 
transportation subcommittee and three other senators introduced a 
resolution urging the department of transportation to investigate 
eastern and texas air 
a similar bill introduced in the house on march 10 has 28 
sponsors

federal manufacturing safety inspectors will 
begin actually checking the factory floor rather than just office 
records in a major reagan administration policy reversal on the 
eve of congressional hearings 
beginning next week occupational safety and health 
administration inspectors will start walking through 
highhazard areas of every factory they enter instead of just 
looking at plant office records of job illnesses and injuries the 
agency said tuesday 
the change will take effect monday a day before the senate 
begins hearings on a twoyear congressional investigation into what 
critics maintain has been oshas excessive reliance on employer 
records in ferreting out job hazards 
now when we go into a plant the inspector is going to see 
what it looks like beyond the office said assistant labor 
secretary john a pendergrass who ordered the new policy our 
compliance officers will see the conditions as they exist in the 
work areas 
pendergrass and other osha officials denied that the hearings 
ordered by sen edward m kennedy dmass chairman of the senate 
labor and human resources committee were the impetus behind the 
new policy 
weve been discussing a change like this for two years and 
its just now coming to fruition said frank white the agencys 
deputy administrator 
in 1982 a year after reagan took office osha began exempting 
plants in highhazard industries from inspections if their logs 
showed injury rates that were below the nationwide average for 
manufacturing 
ever since unions and officials in some other federal agencies 
have complained that the exemptions encouraged employers to 
underreport injuries and illnesses in osharequired lost work 
day reports in order to avoid more comprehensive plant 
inspections 
their case was bolstered by the death of a worker from cyanide 
poisoning at a film processing plant in chicago in 1983 just six 
months after osha had pronounced the company in compliance with 
regulations based on an examination of its injury and illness logs 
a later inspection of the plant itself showed widespread health 
and safety hazards in violation of the law resulting in a 
recommendation for criminal prosecution of some of the companys 
officials 
that case has been in everybodys mind pendergrass said 
tuesday its something we dont want to happen again 
he said the walkthrough examinations in addition to the 
document inspections at some 2000 plants each year will give the 
agency better confidence on what the conditions are on the shop 
floor 
osha officials tried to downplay the significance of the change 
describing it as a logical next step in a crackdown on job safety 
violators that began two years ago when william e brock became 
labor secretary 
soon after taking office brock ordered a 10fold increase in 
the fines levied for osha violations including those classified as 
willful discrepancies in employer records brock said the 
higher fines would act as a deterrent keeping more companies 
honest 
instead of levying fines in the thousands of dollars osha began 
seeking penalties in the hundreds of thousands and in a few cases 
millions of dollars it also began treating each instance of an 
alleged violation as a separate charge instead of lumping them 
together 
margaret seminario assistant director of the aflcios 
occupational health and safety division said tuesday that the 
agency began losing the reagan ideology two years ago 
but until this they really hadnt put in anything else she 
said of the inspection order 
osha officials disagreed saying they have done a lot more in 
the past two years in reducing their dependence solely on employer 
records 
for example they said the agency two years ago began expanding 
the records checks to include some random inspections of job 
floors inspectors two years ago also were required to start 
validating employer injury and illness reports by comparing them 
with other records such as first aid logs and workers compensation 
claims

supporters of a civil rights bill enacted over 
president reagans veto say it will help cure an epidemic of 
discrimination that followed a 1984 supreme court decision 
limiting federal protection for many groups 
discrimination in federally funded institutions is occurring 
at accelerated rates rep don edwards dcalif said tuesday as 
the house joined the senate in overriding reagans veto of the 
civil rights restoration act 
edwards chairman of the house judiciary subcommittee on civil 
rights said the education department closed or suspended hundreds 
of sex bias cases after the court ruling 
heaven knows how many thousands of complaints have not even 
been filed he said we are facing an epidemic of 
discrimination 
both chambers of congress came up tuesday with the twothirds 
majorities needed to override reagans veto the ninth such rebuff 
he has suffered since taking office the votes were 7324 in the 
senate and 292133 in the house 
even as the voting occurred reagan was calling the bill a 
power grab by the federal government but the white house later 
issued a statement acknowledging the override and saying the 
administration would work to implement the new law 
congress was tied in knots for four years over how to handle the 
high court ruling that only specific programs or activities 
receiving federal aid had to comply with four major civil rights 
laws protecting women minorities the elderly and the handicapped 
lawmakers finally settled on a restoration act that bars 
discrimination by entire institutions government agencies and some 
corporations that receive any federal aid if a college athletic 
department discriminates for example the federal government can 
cut off aid to the whole school even if that specific department 
received no assistance 
ralph neas executive director of the leadership conference on 
civil rights called the override a bipartisan reaffirmation of 
civil rights the conference a 185member coalition of major 
religious organizations and groups representing labor women 
minorities and senior citizens was the moving force behind the 
bill 
education department spokesman michael jackson said the 
department had closed or narrowed more than 200 sex bias cases 
through 1986 as a result of the court decision we simply dont 
know yet what their fate will be he said were going to have 
to assess what our responsibilities are 
marcia greenberger managing attorney of the national womens 
law center urged the individuals who filed those complaints to 
bring them back to the attention of the government and ask for 
the protection that the country thought the law provided to them 
all along 
reagan and his congressional allies contended that the act would 
infringe on religious liberty and expand federal control of the 
private sector they supported a less sweeping alternative that 
would have gotten more religious schools and corporations off the 
regulatory hook 
but even some republicans said they were sorry reagan had vetoed 
the bill 
sen lowell weicker rconn who has a retarded son harked 
back to earlier days when such people were relegated to dark 
corners to the darkness of despair to being a nothing in 
america 
this legislation is about your neighbor its about flesh and 
blood he said it says were not going to subsidize 
discrimination we dont want to see those dark corners anymore 
we dont want to revisit the past 
sen edward kennedy dmass said reagan was the first 
president to veto a civil rights measure since andrew johnson more 
than 100 years ago 
a number of lawmakers including some gop leaders who supported 
the veto castigated the conservative moral majority group for 
spreading what they called misinformation and distortions 
they said they had received hundreds of calls from people saying 
they had been told the bill would force their churches to employ 
homosexual drug addicts with aids as youth pastors and bar church 
contributions by social security recipients 
no bit of legislation is important enough to put out 
falsehoods under the name of religion to the american people i 
find if reprehensible said rep bill hefner dnc a baptist 
gospel singer with ties to religious communities around the country 
the restoration act says entire institutions and government 
agencies must not discriminate if any program or activity within 
them receives federal aid entire corporations are covered if they 
provide a public service such as health care or if the aid goes to 
the business as a whole as in the chrysler corp bailout 
jerry c nims president of moral majority predicted dire 
consequences from the law and said it is likely to be the major 
political issue for evangelicals in the 1988 elections 
if enough people are not voted into office to change whats 
occurred we will have entered the moral dark ages nims said 
farmers receiving crop subsidies people using food stamps and 
other individuals receiving federal assistance are not subject to 
regulation under the new law an institutions refusal to perform 
or pay for abortions will not be considered discrimination against 
women under the law 
the supreme court decision applied specifically to title ix of 
the 1972 education amendments barring sex discrimination in 
federally funded education programs but the precedent was 
interpreted also to cover the 1964 civil rights act barring racial 
discrimination in federally assisted programs the 1973 
rehabilitation act barring discrimination against the handicapped 
in any program or activity receiving federal aid and the 1975 age 
discrimination act barring employment discrimination against older 
people

senior police officers say the dramatic 
increase in weapons seizures at the capitol last year involved not 
lethal guns or knives but small canisters of chemical sprays that 
women visitors carry in their handbags for selfprotection 
house sergeant at arms jack russ created a stir recently when he 
reported that capitol police confiscated 1162 weapons in 1987 a 
startling 147 percent increase over seizures in the previous year 
but capitol police chief frank kerrigan said in an interview 
that the 1162 cited by russ were all canisters of mace or other 
brands of nonlethal chemical sprays some in lipstickstyle 
containers that are used to immobilize wouldbe attackers 
chemical sprays are illegal throughout the district of columbia 
including the capitol where police classify them as weapons 
subject to seizure and destruction 
in fact kerrigan said 1270 weapons were seized last year and 
selfdefense sprays accounted for the vast majority of them 
seizures of guns actually declined by 50 percent last year 
kerrigan said 
russ said he must have misinterpreted data he obtained from the 
capitol police when he reported that the 1162 spray seizures 
represented all weapons confiscated last year 
russ cited that figure at a house appropriations subcommittee 
hearing to justify his request for 185 million to tighten 
security on the house side of the capitol arguing that police face 
a growing threat of violent attacks 
rep vic fazio dcalif chairman of the house panel said russ 
left the impression that most of the weapons seizures last year 
involved guns which probably was a misimpression on the part 
of the sergeant at arms 
but fazio said his subcommittee intends to take a much closer 
look at the issue in consultation with the senate before making 
any decisions we wont be stampeded he said 
rep jerry lewis of california ranking republican on the house 
subcommittee said he didnt know whether russ had manipulated the 
weapons figures to attract support for his security plan but said 
any such proposals should be studied with caution 
theyre pushing very hard to increase security everywhere up 
here lewis said we must protect ourselves in this modern age 
of terrorism but i tend to resist any unnecessary steps that would 
hinder the publics access to the capitol 
of the 1987 total kerrigan said the 1162 chemical spray 
seizures represent a sharp increase over the previous year when 
470 such sprays were confiscated 
the rest of last years total included guns knives and other 
potentially deadly weapons including clubs blackjacks and brass 
knuckles and nonlethal stun guns which knock out their victims 
with electrical shocks authorities said 
stun guns aside the total of deadly weapons seized last year 
increased by only three over those confiscated in 1986 kerrigan 
said last years total included only 14 guns exactly half the 28 
that were seized in 1986 the police said 
kerrigan said the escalating weapons seizures probably reflect 
improved use of metal detectors in the capitol building and six 
nearby office buildings better training of police officers and 
more thorough searches of visitors 
considering the sharp increase in discovery of the chemical 
spray canisters kerrigan said it could be that people are more 
aware of the need to protect themselves 
kerrigan said 63 people were prosecuted at the capitol last year 
on illegal weapons charges compared with 50 people in 1986 
generally visitors carrying deadly weapons are arrested but those 
with chemical sprays are not he said 
asked by sen harry reid dnev how many visitors enter the 
capitol with evil intent senate sergeant at arms harry henry 
giugni said he didnt know but he recalled that an 85yearold 
woman from tennessee was found carrying a handgun that would have 
blown up in her hand if shed tried to fire it 
giugni said the woman told capitol police that her hometown 
sheriff had advised her to take a gun if she planned to visit 
washington

the agriculture department wants to hire a new 
editor for its singlesheet publication ag am which provides up 
to two dozen or so news blurbs daily for agency brass pay 33218 
a year to start with a top of 60683 
so far there have been 41 applicants including some usda 
information specialists who see an opportunity to boost their 
career prospects 
the ag am report is issued five days a week monday through 
friday except on federal holidays of course mostly it consists 
of single paragraphs summarizing stories from newspapers wire 
services and news magazines 
ed curran who retired in 1984 after 20 years working for the 
departments office of information was privy to the inside 
workings of ag am since it began during the carter administration 
now publisher of his own private newsletter curran offers a 
look at the history of the publication and how it grew 
someone in usda thought the white house practice of providing 
president carter with daily news summaries would be good for 
thenagriculture secretary bob bergland curran said in his latest 
issue 
at first the daily summaries were sent only to the secretary and 
his office staff but bergland who had read the news blurbs 
began talking about things in the news that were not known to 
senior aides including the deputy secretary and assistant 
secretaries 
so the press run of ag am was increased and the information 
office staffer who was responsible for its publication had to begin 
work earlier by 6 am for example instead of the later regular 
starting time 
by the time the reagan administration came upon the scene ag 
am was a staple at usda curran said being on the offical list 
to get one was sort of like the government equivalent of a key to 
the executive washroom 
the daily press run was increased to 100 copies to take care of 
the demand from all the deputy assistant secretaries 
administrators of agencies and staff economists 
meanwhile the bureaucrats in the usdas information office 
heard on the grapevine that agriculture secretary john r block 
was so smitten with ag am that he demanded copies to be telexed 
to him when he was on trips curran said however blocks 
successor richard e lyng could care less about the news 
sheet he added 
one thing bureaucrats learn early in the game is that when 
something has the sweet smell of success about it get behind it 
with all youve got curran said so why not devote more time 
to ag am make it a fulltime job 
curran wryly observed that the information office meanwhile 
scuttled its longstanding weekly farm paper letter which was 
the departments main contact with the nations farm magazine 
editors and farm editors of its daily newspapers 
curran named his twicemonthly newsletter the farm paper letter 
after the publication he wrote during his 20year usda career 
today 100 copies of ag am are delivered to lyngs office area 
alone curran said in all the press run is 350 copies a day 
this from an outfit thats vowed to save us money he said 
dave lane director of the office of information told the 
associated press it may take some time to select a new fulltime ag 
am editor the previous editor died earlier this year 
was there any consideration given to canceling ag am no lane 
said why not 
i guess because of the importance of that publication to 
inform our top officials he said its one of the most widely 
distributed of all the things that we put out 
besides the copies distributed within usda here the daily news 
blurbs are now sent electronically to universities state 
agriculture departments and other government offices the report is 
also available to private users of usdas electronic information 
system

advocates of continued trade protection for 
the american steel industry are citing a new congressional study 
concluding that quotas cant be blamed for last years steel price 
increases 
the congressional research service said in a 23page report 
tuesday that last years steel price hike of about 47 percent 
probably had more to do with changes in the exchange rate than with 
the reagan administrations import restraints 
the report comes in the last full year of the administrations 
program of signing agreements with japan south korea and other 
major steelexporting nations to curb the flow of subsidized 
foreign steel into the united states 
the fiveyear program ends in september 1989 and big steel 
companies are already pushing for commitments from congress and 
presidential contenders on whether the import barriers will be 
extended 
imports account for about 21 percent of the american steel 
market down from nearly 26 percent when the quotas began in late 
1984 
opposing continuing the quotas are american companies that rely 
on imported steel and which claim that the reagan program has 
stifled competition raised prices and caused harmful shortages 
erwin l klein president of the american institute for imported 
steel said in december that it would be improper for more 
government intervention to determine the future of the american 
steel market and the united states economy instead we believe 
free enterprise must prevail 
the institute represents 70 steel importers in the united states 
the congressional report however said changes in exchange 
rates have helped raise the price of steel imports by about 45 
percent nearly identical to the price rise in the domestic 
industry that suggests that there is considerable competition in 
the us market the report said 
the report said many countries covered by the reagan plan appear 
not to have filled their quotas last year the argument can be 
made that domestic steel buyers were able to obtain as much 
imported steel as they wanted before being confronted by the import 
barriers it said 
the report was released by sen john heinz rpa who had 
pushed the white house for import relief before the program began 
in 1984 
heinz said the report ought to be the final americanmade nail 
in the coffin for these nagging complaints that the steel program 
has boosted domestic prices 
the congressional research service said nothing in this 
report should be taken as an argument in favor of or opposed to 
the import restraints of the presidents steel program it said 
the reports goal was merely to evaluate claims that the quotas 
caused prices to rise 
david e levy spokesman for the american institute for imported 
steel reiterated the groups position against extending the 
quotas but said he had not seen the report and could not comment 
on it

from copyrights to civil rights congress has 
overridden nine of the 63 vetoes president reagan has exercised 
since he took office in 1981 
this gives reagan a better batting average than his last 
republican predecessor president ford but not as good a one as 
president carter who had democratic majorities in both houses of 
congress 
ford with the opposition party controlling both the house and 
senate sent up 66 vetoes and had 12 of them or 18 percent 
knocked down 
carter vetoed 31 bills and had only two of them overridden well 
under 10 percent 
counting tuesdays override of his civil rights bill veto 
reagan has struck out 14 percent of the times he has used his 
constitutional power to disapprove legislation 
reagan has faced democratic control in the house throughout his 
more than seven years in office the senate however was under 
republican control from 1981 until last year 
it takes a twothirds majority of both houses to overcome a 
presidential veto 
records of the white house executive clerks office show that 
five reagan vetoes have been sustained in the other 49 cases the 
question of an override was not put to a vote 
once reagan squeaked through by one vote that was on june 5 
1986 when the senate sustained a presidential veto allowing a 
weapons sale to saudi arabia to proceed the count was 6634 just 
shy of the 67 votes needed for a twothirds majority with all 
senators voting 
on another occasion it took nearly eight months to round up the 
votes to block the house from overriding the presidents veto of 
trade legislation curbing textile apparel and shoe imports reagan 
vetoed the bill on dec 17 1985 the house put off action until 
next year and it was not until aug 6 1986 that it voted the 
count was 276149 or eight votes short of the two thirds needed to 
override 
tuesdays house and senate votes marked the 101st time in us 
history that a presidential veto has been overridden there have 
been 2452 vetoes beginning with the administration of george 
washington 
andrew johnson had the worst veto record in history the 
postcivil war president vetoed 29 bills and was overridden 15 
times 
the bills previously put into law over reagans veto were 
an act to amend the manufacturing clause of the copyright law 
vetoed july 8 1982 
a 142 billion supplemental appropriation for the fiscal year 
ending sept 30 1982 vetoed on aug 28 1982 
an act authorizing a transfer of federal land in lane county 
ore vetoed oct 19 1983 
an act to authorize continuation of a program of water 
resources research vetoed feb 21 1984 
an act revising authorization laws governing the national 
institutes of health and national research institutes vetoed nov 
8 1985 
an act providing economic sanctions against the white minority 
government of south africa vetoed sept 26 1986 
the water quality act of 1987 a 20 billion antipollution 
measure vetoed jan 30 1987 
the federal aid highway act of 1987 an 88 billion highway and 
mass transit measure vetoed march 27 1987

it has been more than 160 years since the first 
american indian newspaper was published and its editor clashed with 
tribal leaders and newspapers on the reservation still struggle 
for their independence today 
elias boudinot opened the cherokee phoenix on feb 21 1828 in 
new echota ga and resigned four years later rather than accept 
censorship from the cherokees primary chief 
things havent changed much in 160 years journalists reported 
at a meeting of the native american press association tribal 
leaders still are not convinced of the value of objective reporting 
on tribal politics and other news 
although some tribal constitutions had free press provisions as 
early as the mid1800s the us constitutions first amendment 
rights did not extend to the reservations until 1968 when congress 
passed the indian bill of rights 
todays indian journalists the first generation to try to 
exercise those rights on the reservation are hampered by 
reservation poverty that limits advertising revenue and forces 
tribal governments to underwrite the newspapers 
ten financially selfsufficient newspapers are operating most 
begun in the last decade precipitated by the need for editorial 
independence said richard lacourse a yakima indian writing a 
book on the native american press 
the rest of the 464 indian newspapers and bulletins on 
reservations and in urban indian communities are owned by the 
tribes and controlled by tribal leaders who often interfere with 
news operations lacourse said 
tribal leaders have fired editors for taking opposing sides in 
elections or in editorials cut off newspaper funds forced the 
hiring of their unqualified relatives excluded reporters from 
meetings and suppressed stories by threatening editors and 
reporters lacourse said 
at the napa meeting last week one editor reported being ordered 
by tribal leaders not to report the conviction of one leader on a 
child molestation charge 
the editor said she agreed because as a single parent she felt 
she could not risk losing what was one of the few fulltime jobs 
she could find on the reservation 
a reporter for one of 25 indianowned radio stations said her 
tribal leaders once took over the station for several hours to air 
their views on a subject they thought the station had not covered 
sufficiently 
tim giago a cofounder of napa who owns two independent tribal 
newspapers says the interference will continue until journalists 
buy their publications from the tribes and operate them as 
profitmaking businesses 
if the tribe is paying your salary why should they let you 
say anything that is going to undermine their position he asked 
in a telephone interview from his offices in rapid city sd 
because his lakota times of martin sd and ojibwe times of 
bemidji minn rely on advertising revenue giago said we have 
the freedom to criticize the tribal government my responsibilities 
are to my readers im not beholden to the tribal government 
an example of tribal leaders influence was the navajo times 
today a onetime weekly that became the first and only daily 
native american newspaper in 1984 and was closed in 1987 
shortly after his election tribal chairman peter macdonald 
ordered an audit that found the newspaper was 750000 in debt he 
shut it down and fired its 49member staff 
the times reopened as a weekly with a new mostly nonindian 
staff several months later 
the main reason the times was killed was because we couldnt 
be controlled former editor and publisher mark trahant who made 
the times a daily newspaper said in a speech to about 150 napa 
members 
trahant an investigative reporter for the arizona republic in 
phoenix said the times apparently caused animosity when it 
sponsored a tribal election campaign debate that degenerated into a 
namecalling shouting match 
macdonald did not return a telephone call to tribal headquarters 
in window rock ariz seeking comment 
the first indian publisher boudinot clashed with cherokee 
chief john ross who wanted to fight the relocation law that 
eventually forced the cherokees and four other tribes to give up 
their east coast lands and move west 
ross tried to fire him but boudinot resigned first in the 
summer of 1832 and moved his family to oklahoma in 1838 in advance 
of the trail of tears when 4000 cherokees died on a forced 
march from appalachia 
on june 23 1839 in park hill okla boudinot was stabbed and 
hacked to death in what was described then as a revenge killing

japanese curbs on beef and citrus imports are 
costing consumers in tokyo two to four times what their american 
counterparts pay and should come down us farm and trade 
officials say 
it seems to us the japanese consumer should have a right to 
choose the products at a price that is much better and they would 
if the quotas were eliminated agriculture secretary richard lyng 
said tuesday 
lyng and us trade representative clayton k yeutter said at a 
news conference however that thus far the japanese have not 
budged on quotas that limit imports of american beef and citrus 
we still have to hear from the japanese on their willingness 
to liberalize beef and citrus lyng told the session called to 
spotlight the march 31 expiration date of a beef and citrus 
agreement with the japanese 
under the 4yearold agreement the united states has not 
challenged the quotas but officials are now saying that it is time 
for them to end 
in response japanese officials say that lowering the barriers 
would bring on a torrent of lowpriced american products that would 
wipe out their home countrys beef and citrus sector 
the two american officials produced charts showing that american 
navel oranges that sold for 33 cents each in washington on march 1 
were selling for 65 cents each in tokyo 
grapefruits selling for 32 cents each in washington sold for 73 
cents in tokyo on the same day they said they said consumers in 
the nations capital were paying 499 a pound for strip sirloin 
while consumers in japans capital were paying 2056 a pound for 
comparable steak 
it remains unclear whether eliminating the import curbs would 
bring on unemployment among japanese cattle ranchers and citrus 
growers yeutter said he said it would depend on whether our 
japanese friends are resilient enough to cope with intensified 
competition 
if it did mean some structural adjustment thats the price we 
pay for a free and open trading system yeutter said weve had 
some adjustment too 
one option open to the united states would be to seek a ruling 
against the japanese for unfair trade practices under the general 
agreement on tariffs and trade the officials said they said

a group of women serving long prison terms at 
an underground facility in lexington ky allege in a suit that 
they are being treated inhumanely because of their political 
beliefs 
the suit in us district court in washington filed by civil 
liberties groups on behalf of the five inmates at the lexington 
control unit names attorney general edwin meese iii and eight 
other federal officials 
it seeks the immediate transfer of the inmates from the 
highsecurity facility to the general population of a federal 
womens prison 
opened in november 1986 the small basement facility has 
virtually no natural light and is illuminated 24 hours a day by 
fluorescent lights said the suit prepared by the national prison 
project of the american civil liberties union and other attorneys 
the women the suit said are monitored continuously by staff 
and video cameras have no opportunity to participate in any of the 
activities available to the general prison population and are 
subjected to random strip searches 
we believe the womens lives are in danger said susan 
waysdorf a spokeswoman for civil libertarians supporting the suit 
theyre beginning to experience signs of behavior modification 
general disorientation vision problems loss of appetite 
sleeplessness 
among the inmates are silvia baraldini convicted of 
racketeering and conspiracy in aiding a 16 million brinks 
armored car heist in nyack ny that left a guard and two police 
officers dead another inmate at lexington is susan rosenberg 
linked by law enforcement officers to the same bungled brinks 
robbery 
baraldini serving a 40year term was transferred to lexington 
after refusing to be interviewed by an fbi agent the suit said 
rosenberg serving a 58year term for possession of weapons and 
explosives in connection with a 1985 police raid in new jersey was 
told that she would be confined to the unit until she changes her 
political beliefs the suit alleges 
the us bureau of prisons said in october it will phase out the 
unit the only highsecurity unit for women in the federal prison 
system 
a new medium and highsecurity facility for women will be 
opened in june in marianna fla and the phaseout in lexington 
will be completed shortly thereafter said bureau of prisons 
spokeswoman kathryn morse she declined to comment on the suit 
the primary purpose for the creation of the unit was to 
confine prisoners whose political associations and affiliations 
were determined to pose a security threat said the suit which 
alleges violation of the womens constitutional rights all the 
women in the unit are suffering psychological and physical harm as 
a direct consequence of their isolated confinement in this 
underground segregation unit 
when civil liberties groups began to expose lexington as a 
political prison federal officials hurriedly brought in two 
other women serving long sentences a coalition of civil 
libertarians said in a statement about the lexington unit 
one of the women brought in later sylvia brown serving a 
27year term for probation violation and escaping from a federal 
prison was told that her release from the unit would depend on her 
lack of interaction with the political activists the suit said 
baraldini rosenberg and brown filed the suit

sen paul simon calling himself an 
underdog fighting for the underdog says he hopes wisconsins 
progressive political tradition can carry him to victory in the 
states april 5 primary 
simon who won the democratic primary in his home state of 
illinois last week needs another victory to keep his candidacy 
alive while he did not predict a win here he said he expects a 
strong finish 
i grew up in the progressive tradition said simon im an 
underdog whos fighting for the underdog 
simon appeared at a news conference at a shopping center built 
adjacent to the allischalmers corp plant a oncemighty farm 
equipment company which filed for bankruptcy reorganization last 
year 
we have to restore and revitalize our manufacturing base 
simon said noting how high paying jobs at the factory have 
disappeared while low paying service jobs at the shopping center 
have grown 
the senator sprinkled his comments with references to former 
wisconsin sen robert lafollette founder of the progressive party 
who simon said stood up to individual and corporate greed 
simon said he would try to stop the erosion of the manufacturing 
sector by offering tax breaks for companies that create jobs while 
removing tax incentives for companies that move production overseas 
simon flew to washington earlier in the day where he joined the 
successful majority in the senate in voting to override president 
reagans veto of a sweeping civil rights bill 
its another indication of the insensitivity of the 
administration to women to people with disabilities to 
minorities simon said of the veto 
simon has criticized the reagan administrations sending of 
troops to hnduras 
we should use tools of diplomacy rather than weapons of war 
simon said both sides should concentrate on working out their 
differences at the negotiating table not on the battlefield

spending big money on space age hospital 
equipment is not necessarily the best way to provide quality 
medical care says the federal governments top health official 
sometimes our hightech capability lures us into pursuing 
expensive answers when less costly ones are available dr otis 
r bowen said tuesday our veneration of technology has become a 
cultural blind spot that sometimes keeps us from pursuing practical 
solutions to our problems 
the health and human service secretarys remarks to a conference 
of the health care quality alliance came shortly after the 
28member coalition issued a report saying cost control should stop 
where quality of care and quality of life are adversely 
affected 
bowen said cost containment and quality care can coexist 
sometimes you can save money and also improve care like 
concentrating certain procedures in hospitals that specialize in 
them he said this not only leads to better results for the 
patient it also allows us to benefit from economies of scale 
one reason todays health care is so expensive is that the 
financing of that care is little more than a collection of 
disincentives to practice costeffective medicine 
hospitals in order to attract doctors and their patients 
have bought and often duplicated the latest in medical hardware in 
a kind of medical arms race 
he said exempting employerpaid health insurance coverage from 
federal income taxes has encouraged employers and unions to 
bargain for evergreater firstdollar coverage in health insurance 
plans 
compounding this folly most insurance plans cover expensive 
hightech procedures and slight preventive services bowen added 
and all of this has made patients and their families all but 
oblivious to costs since they pay so little out of pocket 
bowen said the establishment of the federal medicare health 
program for the elderly in 1965 created a powerful incentive for 
the health care industry to develop the technology to treat the 
chronic degenerative diseases that afflict the aging 
while that has improved the quality of life for americans of 
all ages bowen said the nation has yet to face difficult 
questions of how best to allocate health dollars in the modern era 
still to be decided is how much is too much he said how 
much heroic medical care and how many procedures to keep a dying 
patient alive are desirable for the patient the family and not 
least of all for society at large when is such care merely 
prolonging the act of dying rather than contributing to longer 
life or at least some type of quality to it 
bowen is a 70yearold physician whose first wife died in 1981 
after a long battle with bone cancer and whose mother recently died 
in a nursing home 
the alliance membership includes the american medical 
association the alzheimers disease and related disorders 
association the arthritis foundation the american cancer society 
the american academy of pediatrics and the national council on the 
aging

the department of defense has decided to begin 
aids testing on civilian workers destined for overseas assignments 
with an estimated 8000 men and women to be affected during the 
first year officials said tuesday 
no date for the start of civilian screening has yet been 
established said the pentagon which already operates the worlds 
largest aids testing program 
the aids blood test will be administered to civilian workers 
during a complete physical examination which will become mandatory 
for those drawing overseas assignments 
the approach is similar to that now used by the state 
department the pentagon officials said 
in another move deputy defense secretary william h taft iv has 
authorized the army to draft a legislative proposal that would make 
it easier to discharge service members on a medical disability if 
they test positively for the aids virus 
such legislation if ever enacted could provide the military 
with a means of discharging servicemen as soon as they test 
positively for exposure regardless of whether theyre showing any 
symptoms yet of the deadly disease itself 
one way to do that the sources explained tuesday is to broaden 
the legal definition of a military disability 
currently no individual on active duty who tests positively for 
aids on a blood test can be discharged without showing other 
medical symptoms of the disease 
the decisions involving aids policies were first disclosed early 
this month by defense sources who requested anonymity the defense 
department subsequently confirmed the actions while insisting in a 
written statement to the associated press that taft had issued 
preliminary guidance without yet signing any final directives 
the decision has been made even if a directive hasnt been 
signed countered one source he was presented options and made 
up his mind 
aids acquired immune deficiency syndrome attacks the bodys 
immune system and its ability to resist infection no cure has been 
found for the disease which can be spread through sexual contact 
and tainted blood 
the pentagon citing the need to protect military blood 
supplies routinely tests all 21 million men and women on active 
duty as well as all recruit applicants a service member who tests 
positively but who is not disabled by the disease is restricted 
to duty inside the united states and may be limited in job 
assignments 
a recruit who tests positively is denied admission to the 
military 
despite the massive commitment to aids screening which began in 
october 1985 the pentagon has until recently focused only on 
military personnel 
according to sources the army has repeatedly urged aids testing 
for all defense department workers as well as automatic discharge 
or dismissal for those testing positively defense health officials 
have always rebuffed those suggestions saying they were too 
farreaching 
the sources said taft had finally decided to take the middle 
road when it came to civilians focusing only on those who draw 
assignments outside the united states 
the new program is expected to cost roughly 16 million a year 
one official said

president jose napoleon duarte 
and the rightists who defeated his party in legislative and 
municipal elections have declared a willingness to work together on 
this countrys tremendous problems 
but the leftist guerrillas waging an 8yearold war against the 
usbacked government said tuesday the result of sundays vote 
would make the nation ungovernable a rebel commander said the 
electoral result an outright majority for the rightist opposition 
in the national legislature favors the guerrillas by giving the 
people a clear alternative 
in addition to the war el salvador has crippling economic 
problems 
the central elections council has not yet announced the 
apportionment of seats in the unicameral 60seat national assembly 
but the council president mario samayoa said on monday the 
rightist republican nationalist alliance known by the spanish 
acronym arena got a majority of votes cast nationwide which 
assured it of a legislative majority local media projected arena 
would get 33 or 34 seats the party said it had 35 
the governing christian democrats had 33 seats in the outgoing 
legislature they were expected to win about 22 seats with the 
remainder going to small rightist parties arena also won the 
mayoralties and town councils of about 200 of the countrys 262 
municipalities including san salvador 
arena is ready to work with the other parties and with 
president duarte so that together we might achieve the solution to 
the national crisis alfredo cristiani president of arena and a 
legislator said at a news conference it is time to work 
together on behalf of the heroic people who cast their votes 
despite threats and terrorist acts 
the guerrillas had called for a boycott of the elections and had 
stepped up urban and rural violence in the two weeks prior to the 
vote in what they called repudiation of the electoral farce 
they set off three car bombs sabotaged power lines in large parts 
of the country and ordered a nationwide transport ban that they 
enforced by burning more than a dozen vehicles 
the rebels contended the elections were part of an 
americanimposed counterinsurgency plan and that they were 
illegitimate in wartime 
despite the boycott call about 70 percent of the 16 million 
registered voters cast ballots many of them walked long distances 
to do so 
in the same way we have made this effort to strengthen the 
democratic process let us contribute our will and capacities to 
find together the road to peace duarte told the nation in a 
radio and television address monday night 
he said the parties in the legislature were along with the 
executive branch coresponsible for governing duarte said 
once final results were known he would meet with party leaders to 
search for consensus on how to solve the nations pressing problems 
besides the war which has killed 65000 people and made 
refugees out of 500000 el salvadors economy is crippled both 
inflation and unemployment are estimated at about 40 percent 
what is coming is that were on the road to a power void 
guerrilla commander joaquin villalobos said tuesday on radio 
venceremos the clandestine rebel station the country will 
become ungovernable with this composition of forces 
the big loser is the counterinsurgency project and the big 
winner is the people which has before it a clear alternative the 
fmln organization and struggle the alliance of five rebel 
armies is the farabundo marti national liberation front or fmln 
we must prepare to struggle decisively because today we 
confront a weakened enemy and we must take advantage of that he 
said 
despite the politicans conciliatory words there were those who 
speculated arena would use its position in the assembly to further 
erode popular support for the chistian democrats by opposing 
government initiatives 
presidential elections are set for march 1989 and arena could 
benefit from making the duarte administration appear even more 
ineffectual than it has been in addressing the national crisis

only enough nuclear waste to carry out 
experiments will be placed in the repository planned as the 
nations first resting place for defenserelated radioactive 
wastes the department of energy says 
the department said tuesday it was following the national 
academy of sciences recommendations to test whether wipp the 
waste isolation pilot plant in underground salt beds near carlsbad 
is suitable as a permanent repository 
the department also said that by june it would meet the 
academys request for a detailed fiveyear plan for its 
experimental waste disposal program for the repository which was 
designed to contain low and intermediate level wastes 
both recommendations were made in report of the wipp panel of 
the academys board of radioactive waste management on march 3 
about four months after scientists told congress that water seeping 
into the repository threatened its ability to safely store wastes 
that would remain radioactive for hundreds of thousands of years 
the academy panel however concluded that technical 
uncertainties regarding brine seepage at the plant were not serious 
enough to halt research at the site shipments of waste are to 
begin arriving in october 
energy department officials said tuesday the academy report will 
assist in resolving the issue of brine accumulation at the site and 
will be useful in burying waste in a manner that protects of the 
environment 
about 25000 barrels of waste will be delivered to the site in 
the first 1 years of the test the departments albuquerque office 
said tuesday the department originally had planned to entomb 
125000 barrels of wastes during the next five years

republican party figures say george bush is 
unlikely to break with president reagan on a major issue even 
though bush is trying to appeal to some groups reagan has not 
attracted 
bushs statement that he supports reagans veto of a major civil 
rights bill some observers say reinforces the view of some that 
bush is incapable of showing any independence from reagan 
but bushs top campaign spokesman pete teeley called this a 
nonissue and said the vice presidents loyalty to reagan is more 
important than a show of independence 
the fact is six months ago everybody was writing that george 
bush had to disagree with the president in order to get the 
nomination teeley said tuesday everyone now sees that that 
was a myth 
teeleys assessment came a day after bush when pressed to say 
whether he agreed with reagans veto of the sweeping civil rights 
bill told reporters that im not going to start differing with 
reagan after seven and a half years as vice president 
i dont think that youre going to see the vice president be 
critical of the president teeley said i do think you are 
going to see him lay out his own programs and proposals 
but two former gop national chairmen said they think bush 
sooner or later will have to show some differences between his 
views and reagans 
the vice president is in a box said onetime chairman 
richard richards if he deviates one iota there are some 
rightwing nuts out there who will say he cannot carry on the 
reagan revolution 
another former chairman howard bo calloway said that at 
some time there will be something pretty big where the vice 
president will say hey i love the man but i just have to 
disagree 
said mitchell daniels a former white house political director 
for reagan it points up what you could call the veeps disease 
that is to say that every vice president must confront this 
problem especially if youre no 2 to a very popular no 1 
with the republican presidential nomination in hand and 
loyalty to the president no longer the dominant or most powerful 
theme he can try his hand at establishing his own identity 
daniels said but he must be careful that that comes through 
extension rather than exception to reagan programs and policies 
the civil rights bill which had support from republicans as 
well as democrats in congress was seen by some as a chance for 
bush to break with reagan on an issue that reagan was going to lose 
anyway on senate and house override votes 
some also saw a bush break as necessary given statements by 
bush and his top aides indicating that the vice president was going 
to try to reach out to blacks and minorities groups that reagan 
failed to win in any substantial numbers in his two presidential 
election victories 
arthur fletcher a black and onetime assistant secretary of 
labor during the nixon administration said it was not essential 
that bush disagree with reagans veto of legislation to overturn 
the supreme courts socalled grove city ruling that limited 
federal protection for many groups 
he said that bush during an appearance before a black group 
monday night made a commitment that he is going to enforce all 
civil rights legislation the bottom line is that he was not 
elected by the delegation to be the vice president he was picked 
by the president to be the vice president 
bush has said on occasion that he would speak out on my own 
vision of america or how i would do things but he also has 
steadfastly insisted he would say nothing that could be taken as a 
direct criticism of the president 
last october for instance bush seemed to have gone back to his 
1980 position on abortion he said in iowa that he supported 
allowing the procedure to be performed in cases where the mothers 
life was in danger or in cases of rape or incest this was a 
departure from reagans position which is that abortion should be 
allowed only to save a mothers life 
the bush campaign heatedly denied that the vice president was 
reverting to his position of 1980 bush had muted his differences 
with reagan on this issue in 1984 when they ran for reelection 
together 
richards said tuesday that i think the time may well come when 
he takes a different position im sure that george bush doesnt 
agree 100 percent with everything that this administration does 
hes in a tough spot 
calloway agreed that bush has been faced with a very real 
problem from the day he announced his candidacy but he said i 
dont think he ought to go out of his way and find differences 
with reagan 
ill bet a nickel the president has told him look george 
youre running now youve got to be your own man calloway said

after gaining control of the 
national assembly the rightist republican nationalist alliance 
could block the presidents program and mount a strong challenge in 
the 1989 presidential race 
the stinging defeat in sundays election left president jose 
napoleon duarte and his christian democrats on the defensive 
duarte will be unable to enact economic reforms and the 
opposition will be able to put its stamp on the national budget and 
other legislation 
the rightist party known by its spanish acronym arena is 
trying to polish its image with an eye to next years presidential 
race 
former army maj robert daubuisson the partys founder who has 
been accused of links to el salvadors death squads is being kept 
out of the limelight as much as possible party chairman alfredo 
cristiani a useducated businessman and coffee grower now 
speaks for arena 
arena is trying to project an image of a conservative 
organization that wants to safeguard the countrys traditional 
values and restore law and order the party once was notorious for 
its diatribes against the dangers of communism and alleged 
interference by the united states in salvadoran affairs 
both messages are still there but the tone is more low key 
shortly before the elections cristiani told reporters the 
most important change the party has made was the decision to make 
arena a true political institution rather than a movement revolving 
around an individual and without the traditional bossism of 
salvadoran politics 
the strategy seems to have paid off striking a chord among 
salvadorans tired of eight years of civil war with leftist rebels 
that has killed about 65000 people and devastated the 
onceprosperous economy 
arena on sunday wrested control of the 60member national 
assembly away from duartes christian democrats and won a majority 
of the 262 city and town mayors nationwide including the 
traditional duarte stronghold of san salvador 
final returns are not in but projections show arena is assured 
of at least 30 seats in the new legislature and arena has as its 
ally the national conciliation party which may hold on to most of 
its 12 seats 
the christian democrats are expected to lose most of their 
33seat majority to arena which had only 13 seats in the old 
assembly 
the outcome will make duartes last year in office extremely 
difficult similar to his first year when the rightist opposition 
also controlled the assembly in 1984 duarte defeated daubuisson 
in a presidential race and he has governed with a christian 
democraticcontrolled assembly since 1985 
on monday duarte called on all parties to act responsibly to 
solve the nations serious problems 
daubuisson lost the 1984 election mainly because of his 
reputation of having been linked to the death squads that killed 
thousands of people in the first years of the war he has denied 
the accusations including one that he masterminded the march 1981 
slaying of archbishop oscar arnulfo romero the roman catholic 
prelate 
daubuisson a fiery orator held on to his seat in the 
assembly and seems sure to play a role in party councils 
if we get the majority in the assembly the next thing youll 
hear from the fish will be from behind bars because thats where 
were going to put the corrupt sons of their mothers daubuisson 
told a crowd last week the fish is the christian democratic party 
symbol 
cristiani a graduate of georgetown university in washington 
dc also won a seat in the new assembly he promised he would 
seek a consensus in the legislature on how to deal with the leftist 
rebels 
he said the rebels would be approached with a proposal for 
ending the war and if they refused then the legislature would 
back the government in declaring an offensive to wipe them out 
cristianis idea is that if only a military solution is left 
then the war should be pushed to the hilt instead of conducting it 
with a series of small confrontations like now 
this low intensity conflict idea should be erased he said

20 epa employees friday that data from experiments on concentration 
camp prisoners were included in an outside consultants draft 
report on phosgene gas thomas chief of staff craig deremer said 
tuesday 
as soon as we got the letter the administrator said 
theres no reason to proceed with that information in the report 
we dont need this data lets just not use this and then lets 
look at the broader issue deremer said 
thomas plans a broad review to look at the ethical issues on 
using this kind of data deremer said its sort of a new issue 
that we havent dealt with before 
there may be some arguments on the other side he added 
if there is data available no matter if it was raised in 
questionable means some people might argue that if its for the 
good of humanity we should use it 
the consultants study was designed to determine whether epas 
computergenerated predictions on how phosgene gas would affect 
humans were in line with what would actually happen due to exposure 
to the toxic chemical 
phosgene gas in high concentrations was used as a weapon in 
world war i and 52 prisoners were exposed to it in 1943 and 1944 by 
the nazis to test a possible antidote the new york times reported 
in todays editions 
four of the prisoners exposed at fort ney near strasbourg 
france died and many others who already were weak and 
undernourished developed pulmonary edema which causes extreme 
irritation in the lungs the newspaper said

eightyearold deandra anrig says 
she felt like winnie the pooh when an airplane snagged her kite 
line and lofted her on a 100foot ride 
i read about how winnie the pooh flies in the air on kites 
but i never wanted to try it said deandra who let go just as 
the kite carried her toward a tree i wasnt thinking anything 
but how scared i was 
she said it was just a big jerk that lifted her 10 feet into 
the air said deandras mother debby it carried her right 
over my husbands head all he saw was a shadow going over his 
head im just thankful she let go 
deandra escaped from her ride with bruises sympathetic 
neighbors delivered cupcakes tuesday to her home in dublin 30 
miles southeast of san francisco where she rested on an air 
mattress surrounded by ice packs and two of her stuffed animals 
deandra and her parents were picnicking sunday with friends at a 
park 2 miles from the palo alto airport when the accident occurred 
deandra was taking her turn flying the 12foot glidertype kite 
when a twinengine plane descending toward the airport caught the 
kites 200pound nylon test line 
mountain view fire marshal frank moe said the 70pound child was 
carried about 100 feet before letting go 
there was no way the people in the plane could have known what 
was happening said ken markowitz a lawyer for the reno flying 
service owner of the care flight medical transport plane that 
tangled with the kite

ritter said the plane sustained a 2inch gouge in one of its two 
propellers he was unable to estimate the cost of repair or the 
height of the plane when it caught the line

public utilities commission prohibits kite flying within 5 miles of 
an airport 
ritter said there frequently are kites in the park area but 
this was the first such accident

situation in panama where the military chief gen manuel antonio 
noriega is trying to stifle a huge opposition campaign backed by

often viewed as insensitive to latin america is thwarting regional 
attempts to bring peace to central america

of subversion that the problems of this area vital to the 
interests of the mexican people will be resolved de la madrid

an amateur astronomer has discovered his 
fourth comet in four years after going 19 years without spotting 
one 
im getting much more persistent about it and im becoming 
much more singleminded about it said david levy a research 
assistant at the university of arizonas lunar and planetary 
laboratory whose latest discovery came last weekend 
i take advantage of almost every opportunity to search for 
comets 
the find was confirmed tuesday by brian marsden of the 
international astronomical union who said levy now has more new 
comet sightings than any other living us amateur 
the comet was designated comet 1988e signifying it is the 
fifth comet discovered this year 
levy said he spends between one and four hours each clear night 
scanning the skies with one of his dozens of telescopes 
he has been searching for comets for 23 years after 19 years 
without a find he codiscovered comet levyrudenko in 1984 
in january 1987 he spotted the first comet of that year 
levy built a 6by8foot wooden platform atop his home last 
october to get a better view of the horizon three days after its 
completion he spotted his third comet 
he said he found his fourth comet about an hour before dawn on 
saturday just above the horizon he was using a 16inch telescope 
only six to eight new comets are discovered in an average year 
and some comet hunters search a lifetime without making a 
discovery marsden said last year a record 16 comets were 
discovered he said 
australian amateur astronomer william bradfield has discovered 
13 comets more than any other living comet hunter marsden said 
he said levy is now tied with canadian rolf meier for the north

a growing scandal over allegations of 
massive embezzlement and corruption by top officials is widely seen 
as part of a power struggle between president roh taewoo and his 
predecessor 
former president chun doohwans younger brother chun 
kyunghwan is the focus of the scandal an investigation into 
charges leaders of the powerful saemaul undong development group 
used government connections to amass fortunes prosecutors say 
dozens of government officials also have been implicated 
political observers say the saemaul revelations are among 
efforts by roh to discredit chun doohwan by exposing corruption 
under his government chun who stepped down feb 25 has been 
fighting to retain power within the government 
chun kyunghwan the former leader of saemaul new community 
became among the countrys most powerful figures while chun 
doohwan was in power 
many koreans believe there was corruption under president chun 
much of it centered around his family the korea times in an 
editorial tuesday said the saemaul affair should be considered 
typical of the unjust practices during the preceding 
government 
former president chun who has not been implicated directly in 
the scandal was to meet today with president reagan in washington 
he is on a private tour of the united states that includes meetings 
with many top american officials 
the investigation and the constant stream of revelations would 
not be possible without highlevel government backing according to 
officials and observers who declined to be identified further 
you can be sure this is coming direct from the blue house 
presidential mansion said one official 
the prosecutors general office says an initial investigation of 
the saemaul group indicates the younger chun and other top 
officials embezzled government and private subsidies forced 
corporations to make illegal donations and peddled government 
influence and contacts news reports indicate up to 50 million 
could be involved 
prosecutor kang wonil who is heading the investigation says 
officials of the home agriculture and fisheries education and 
sports ministries are also being investigated for aiding saemaul 
officials or covering up fraud to protect president chun and his 
family 
saemaul has evolved into a huge organization since its creation 
in 1971 to promote urban and rural development with activities 
ranging from construction of model communities and organizing city 
dwellers to keep neighborhoods clean 
opposition supporters and other critics contend saemaul also has 
worked closely with the countrys authoritarian governments in the 
past organizing government support and handing out patronage 
the younger chun who resigned in 1987 after being linked to 
gangsters locked in a bloody power struggle fled briefly to japan 
last friday when details of the investigation were made public 
the former saemaul chief who was appointed by his brother said 
after returning that there had been irregularities but gave no 
details 
dozens of saemaul officials and their wives are being questioned 
and have been barred from leaving the country 
roh a former general who helped put chun into power with army 
backing in 1980 has been trying to distance himself from his 
highly unpopular predecessor and to take complete control of the 
government 
the two men had been close since their days in the armed forces 
and chun picked roh to be his successor but roh started to 
distance himself from chun when massive antigovernment protests 
occurred last summer 
roh backed opposition demands for elections held in december 
that he won with 366 percent of the vote after rival opposition 
candidates split the antigovernment vote 
the new president has resisted chuns attempts to retain power 
ousting many of the former presidents supporters from the 
governing democratic justice party roh also curtailed plans for 
chun to act as a senior adviser to the government reducing the 
post to a largely ceremonial role 
roh has promised to end decades of authoritarian rule and 
introduce sweeping democratic reforms and is anxious to build 
popular support on the campaign trail he vowed that any official 
corruption under the chun government would not go unpunished 
daily revelations about the saemaul probe have received maximum 
attention in the media the staterun television networks devote 
much of their nightly news programs to the affair 
but some democratic justice party leaders and other officials 
are concerned the effort to discredit chun could backfire the 
opposition party for peace and democracy has charged that roh aided 
saemaul corruption while he was home minister in 1982 and demanded 
he be investigated 
the governing party also is worried that corruption revelations 
could hurt its chances in national assembly elections which are to 
be held next month

a lawsuit has been filed against the fbi alleging 
the agency illegally obtained the financial records of a human 
rights group with the help of a dallas bank 
the us district court lawsuit filed tuesday by the dallas 
chapter of the committee in solidarity with the people of el 
salvador names the fbi and merchants state bank as defendants 
the suit contends that the fbi obtained the chapters bank 
records beginning in june 1983 in violation of the 1978 financial 
privacy act it also contends that the bank failed to notify cispes 
as required by law 
bank officials and an fbi spokesman declined comment on the suit 
under the law federal law enforcement agencies may obtain an 
individuals or a groups bank records by subpoena by written 
request from a designated fbi supervisor or through a request from 
the agencys director indicating the records are being sought in 
the course of an investigation of foreign intelligence activities 
the law usually requires that a subject be notified and given 
time to seek a court review of the request unless the bank records 
are sought as part of an ongoing intelligence investigation 
the human rights groups national organization came under fbi 
scrutiny beginning in 1981 and the dallas group in 1983 when 
federal agents began trying to determine whether cispes members had 
contacts with hostile foreign governments or their agents or were 
involved in criminal or terroristic activities 
the investigation was terminated in 1985 after agents found no 
evidence linking cispes with terrorist groups in el salvador fbi 
officials have said 
joe k crews an attorney representing cispes said records 
obtained from the fbi through the freedom of information act do not 
indicate that the records request was made through the agencys 
director as part of an ongoing counterintelligence investigation 
officials of cispes say the fbi probe targted the group and 
dozens of others solely because of their opposition to reagan 
administration policies on central america 
the suit seeks 100 in damages for each of an unspecified number 
of privacy rights violations it also seeks unspecified punitive 
damages attorney fees and an injunction requiring the fbi to 
comply with federal privacy laws in future records requests

two young men from london zoo will set off from 
britain on thursday in search of the worlds largest earwig on st 
helena the remote south atlantic island where napoleon bonaparte 
died 
if we find any giant earwigs we will bring them back alive in 
hopes of getting them to breed in captivity at the zoo said dave 
clarke the expedition leader 
the nocturnal insect is 3 inches long reddish brown in color 
lives in a burrow and although a fearsome looking creature with 
two big pincers at the back is harmless to man unlike most 
insects it cannot fly 
nobody knows if there are any left clarke said in an 
interview tuesday 
clarke said the last giant earwigs were seen by belgian 
collecting expeditions in 1965 and 1967 
st helena with a population of 6000 is 1200 miles east of 
angola and 4400 miles south of england 
the island the only known habitat for the insect has been 
occupied by the british since 1659 and napoleon was exiled there 
after his defeat at waterloo in 1815 he died on the island in 1821 
clarke 25 works in the insect house at the zoo where he is on 
friendly terms with deadly black widow spiders tarantulas giant 
water bugs ants and locusts 
weve never had a giant earwig at the zoo and few people have 
seen one even the saints as the people of st helena are known 
havent seen any for a long time clarke said 
going with him is richard veal 24 who works in the zoos small 
mammals house an anonymous benefactor has donated the 6400 cost 
of the trip 
clarke said the zoo was alerted to the earwigs apparent 
disappearance by the international union for the conservation of 
nature and natural resources the genevabased group has a chapter 
in cambridge england which monitors rare species 
the earwig has been known to be rare for a long time but the 
union learned only recently that in the past 15 to 20 years it has 
become rare to the point of a serious threat of extinction said 
paul pearcekelly head keeper of the insect house 
there are 1000 species of earwig in the world pearcekelly 
said 
the giant earwigs latin name is labidura herculeana which 
could be translated as hercules hardlips he said 
pearcekelly said the search also will be difficult because 
the island habitat has undergone much destruction from goats 
rats and 10inchlong giant centipedes which came in on ships 
in their 3week search clarke and veal will scout two other 
scarce insects only found on st helena a giant ground beetle and 
the st helena dragonfly 
im hoping we will be in time to find the giant earwig and 
save it said clarke 
when asked why anyone should bother he replied everyone asks 
that 
the earwig was part of st helenas life long before we were 
around and it is unqiue as man created the conditions which 
threatened to exterminate it we should try to save it he said

kansas democrats have changed their minds 
and decided to allow local delegates pledged to the presidential 
runnersup in saturdays caucuses to vote at district conventions 
after all 
massachusetts gov michael dukakis won the kansas contest with 
278 of the 764 local delegates elected and jesse jackson finished 
second with 235 
however there was confusion over the local delegates pledged to 
tennessee sen albert gore jr and missouri rep richard gephardt 
and those who were uncommitted 
under state rules local delegates who supported a candidate who 
didnt reach a 15 percent threshold would be nonentities at the 
district conventions scheduled for april 23 
the state decided monday that those local delegates would be 
unable to vote at the district conventions and would be ignored in 
computing national delegates from the districts 
but after conferring with the democratic national committees 
compliance commission which interprets the national rules for 
electing delegates to the national convention the state party 
decided tuesday that all local delegates will be allowed to vote

ohio republican party chairman robert 
bennett says that the state party welcomes supporters of pat 
robertson notwithstanding his current or possible future bid for 
the partys presidential nomination 
bennett tuesday discounted notions that the former evangelist 
may try to take over the party from the ashes of robertsons 
current campaign either to push friendly candidates for state 
offices in 1990 or to launch a possible second run for the 
presidency in 1992 
in some states including ohio robertson supporters have 
entered races for local party offices triggering speculation that 
they may have an eventual party takeover in mind bennett said he 
doubts it 
he said the ohio activity is limited to cincinnati where some 
local party candidates who support robertson have been pushing for 
righttolife legislation in various public forums for years 
there is no concerted effort to take over the party 
organization in ohio bennett said he said many robertson 
backers are disenchanted former democrats and others new to the 
political process who seek republican values that he summed up 
this way married with 42 kids and go to church on sunday

as the government was reporting a slight 
increase in auto fuel efficiency last year two researchers said 
federal fueleconomy standards will cause thousands of traffic 
deaths in the next decade by discouraging the use of safer larger 
cars 
fuel economy regulation inevitably leads to smaller lighter 
cars that are inherently less safe than the cars that would be 
produced without a binding fueleconomy constraint said a study 
released tuesday by robert w crandall of the brookings institution 
in washington and john d graham of the harvard school of public 
health in boston 
they estimated the standards applied to 1989 cars during 10 
years of road use would cause 2200 to 3900 traffic deaths 
also tuesday the transportation department told congress that 
passenger cars sold in the united states got 282 miles per gallon 
last year overall up 02 miles per gallon from the previous year 
despite the good news on auto fuel economy transportation 
secretary jim burnley used the report to reiterate his support for 
elimination of the fueleconomy requirement saying it placed us 
manufacturers at a disadvantage against their foreign competition

the house has voted to continue and expand a 
program to encourage private companies to develop drugs for 
combating rare diseases 
the bill was passed on a 4011 vote tuesday and sent to the 
senate it extends the socalled orphan drug program through 
fiscal 1990 it would also expand the program which is overseen by 
the food and drug administration to include special devices and 
foods needed to help people with unusual maladies 
under the program companies are given tax credits and 
sevenyear exclusive marketing rights if they develop products for 
rare diseases without incentives the companies would not pursue 
development of those products because the small number of 
beneficiaries would not make it profitable according to supporters 
of the legislation 
the revised statute while expanding the program would triple 
its cost in the next few years the current annual authorization of 
4 million would grow to 14 million in fiscal 1990 
the reagan administration has said it has no objection to the 
legislation

million in transitional expenses for president reagans successor 
to move into the white house and cost reagan 1 million to move to 
retirement in california next january 
the government and operations committee tuesday approved a bill 
authorizing the funds although the democraticcontrolled panel 
rejected a republican move to increase the expense allowance to 
offset the effects of inflation for the outgoing president to 15 
million from 1 million the level in effect since 1976 
the proposed boost was opposed by rep jack brooks dtexas the 
panels chairman who said the budget squeeze requires congress to 
make some hard choices on spending cuts 
the panel approved raising the presidentelects allowance for 
transitional expenses to 35 million from 2 million the level in 
effect for the past 12 years it also rejected 249 a move by 
rep robert s walker rpa to forbid the presidentelect from 
accepting private donations to supplement federal transitional 
funds 
the 1 million for reagans initial retirement expenses if 
approved by the house and senate would cover his moving expenses 
from the white house to california and the costs of establishing an 
office for six months until funds for former presidents become

consular corps 
aristides de sousa mendes who died in poverty and disgrace was 
reinstated by a unanimous vote last week of portugals national 
assembly his son sebastian mendes 64 said tuesday 
de sousa mendes was portuguese consul to bordeaux france in 
1940 when during a threeday period he his wife and consul staff 
defied their governments orders and handwrote exit visas for 
30000 refugees including an estimated 10000 jews 
he decided that it was for him to take action and he took the 
action he saw to be the right action mendes said tuesday 
my father was very moral and not religious but very 
christian he believed in helping the unfortunate he wanted to 
assist the ones who are less fortunate than he he said in a 
telephone interview from his home in santa clarita 40 miles

discharged in 1945 mendes went to the san francisco bay area 
and began trying to restore his fathers name writing to 
newspapers approaching human rights groups and even writing a 
small book about his father 
portugal might have paid tribute to de sousa mendes sooner but 
the dictatorship that repudiated him lasted until 1974 
historians subsequently documented de sousa mendes work and in 
1976 portugals foreign ministry recommended his reinstatement he 
was awarded his countrys highest civilian medal last year but not 
reinstated until last week 
until his death at age 69 de sousa mendess achievement was 
acknowledged only by his closest relatives mendes said 
nevertheless mendes said he is glad that the final element of 
his fathers disgrace has been removed in my old age it 
happened and im thankful to god he said i thank god for

the tennessee valley authority is 
moving closer to reviving its longidled nuclear program after 
winning unanimous approval from the nuclear regulatory commission 
tva chairman marvin runyon said the federal utility would not 
compromise 2years of rebuilding by rushing the restart of 
sequoyah nuclear plant 
itll start when its ready itll be a safe start 
runyon said tuesday night after the nrc gave tva permission to 
restart the unit 2 reactor at the chattanooga plant 
the commisions 50 vote allows unit 2 to become the first of 
five licensed tva reactors to resume production of power since they 
were shut down in 1985 because of safety and management concerns 
the only condition for the restart was a lastminute problem 
involving temperature detectors in the plants pressurizer system 
its a relatively minor thing but we want everything to be 
ready said tva nuclear power manager steven a white who joined 
runyon at a chattanooga news conference after both returned from 
the nrc meeting in washington 
with the vote the nrc also indicated it did not feel a pending 
justice department investigation of white had anything to do with 
whether sequoyah is safe to operate 
white has been accused of lying to the nrc in 1986 when he 
certified in writing that another tva nuclear plant watts bar near 
spring city met federal quality assurance standards white has 
denied wrongdoing 
nrc chairman lando zech said commissioners had found no known 
regulatory reason to further delay restarting unit 2 
during the next few days sequoyah workers will complete final 
testing and documentation white said then the plant will slowly 
begin generating nuclear power 
it will probably be three weeks before unit 2 is at 100 percent 
power but it can produce usable electricity for the tva system at 
15 percent white said 
this is very similar to the startup of a new plant and i 
expect that we will experience a few problems he said 
however our personnel are trained and qualified to resolve any 
problems that are encountered 
tva still facing about 15 billion in longterm debts for the 
nuclear program hopes to have sequoyah unit 1 back on line in 
august with unit 2 at browns ferry following in december 
all three browns ferry reactors were shut down in march 1985 
sequoyah which began operation in 1981 shut down five months 
after the other reactors white took over the nuclear power program 
in a management shakeup early in 1986

the nations largest insurers conspired to 
fabricate a liability crisis which crippled businesses and forced 
nationwide cutbacks in police child care and other services 
according to suits by seven states 
the lawsuits filed tuesday in us district court here accuse 
dozens of insurance companies of collaborating in a global boycott 
of certain types of general liability insurance through secret 
agreements and internal pressure 
the suits filed by california new york west virginia 
wisconsin minnesota massachusetts and alabama named 32 insurance 
companies underwriters and associations including lloyds of 
london 
arizona planned to sue in the same court today and texas filed 
a separate suit in its state court because the state has one of 
the toughest best antitrust laws in the nation said texas 
attorney general jim mattox 
these defendants have sucked the blood of our nations 
economic wellbeing mattox said at a news conference in austin 
new york state attorney general robert abrams said the case was 
one of the largest ever tackled by a group of states in a federal 
court adding that the states had to take action because the 
federal government did nothing 
one of the companies aetna life and casualty co condemned the 
suit as another political move by political officeholders who 
have consistently opposed any and all efforts to address the real 
problems of the nations liability system 
a spokesman for the insurance services office a 1400member 
industry trade group also named in the suit called the allegations 
unfounded 
the lawsuits claim the companies targeted for elimination 
coverage for pollution accidents and general liability for damage 
discovered after the life of a policy known as occurrence 
coverage 
the companies instead favored more limited policies covering 
only losses that were suffered and claimed within the policy term 
excluding damage that was discovered later the suits said 
the lawsuits said four major insurance companies hartford fire 
insurance co allstate insurance co cigna corp and aetna 
started a campaign in 1984 to curtail coverage that was generally 
available in the industry 
according to the suits the companies got major us and british 
reinsurers including underwriters at lloyds of london to 
threaten a boycott of any us insurance company that provided the 
broader coverage 
at the same time the suits said major insurers and reinsurers 
pressured the insurance services office to stop distributing 
standard forms so that it would be impractical for individual 
companies to continue offering that coverage 
as a result the suits said property damage insurance for local 
governments nonprofit agencies such as child care centers and 
various businesses suddenly became unavailable or prohibitively 
expensive 
this illegal boycott was a major contributor to the insurance 
crisis that forced so many cities and businesses up against the 
wall california attorney general john van de kamp said 
it was the public and the consumer who paid the price for this 
collusive exercise in corporate greed 
in california and elsewhere local governments cut back or 
eliminated services such as parks and police because of insurance 
expenses van de kamp said many local officials blamed rising 
damage awards in injury suits and joined the insurance industry in 
efforts to restrict the right to sue 
van de kamp said the attorneys general decided to file together 
here because he has taken the lead on the issue and california law 
is favorable to the case and might be cited by the federal court 
among other things the plaintiffs seek to restructure the 
insurance services office by giving noninsurers a majority on its 
board and making public its data on insurance coverage losses 
dave ostwald the spokesman for the insurance services office in 
new york city said rates increased mainly because of a 
demonstrable increase in claims losses and a drop in interest 
rates slowing down insurers investment income 
he said pollution coverage was changed in response to expansive 
court decisions pollution insurance and occurrence coverage 
remained available with some restrictions he added 
the hartford insurance group called the lawsuit totally 
without substance and said it is confident that all charges 
eventually will be dismissed it said the rates in question are 
established from judgments that are legal and involve no other 
insurer or insurance organization

northwest airlines flight attendants are 
likely to ratify a tentative contract that forestalled a walkout by 
6500 workers a union official said 
were optimistic the agreement will be ratified or we wouldnt 
be submitting it to the membership marvin griswold 
secretarytreasurer of the teamsters los angelesbased airline 
division local 2707 said tuesday after the carrier and the union 
announced the tentative pact 
flight attendants had continued working through a feb 26 strike 
deadline but set a march 29 deadline that threatened a walkout 
during the airlines busy easter season 
the tentative pact reached tuesday first must be approved by the 
rank and file flight attendants negotiating committee which meets 
today or thursday then it must then be approved by the workers 
which could take about 30 days 
major details of the proposed contract were not released 
both sides acknowledged that the march 29 strike deadline 
provided the impetus to reach an agreement 
we wanted to see an agreement reached before the 29th the 
29th is a sincere and serious deadline griswold told a news 
conference 
it gave us a target said terry erskine northwests vice 
president of law and labor relations it gave us a focus 
if it a strike had occurred we would have been ready and 
would have operated the airline erskine said 
the talks for the last two days were conducted with the help of 
joshua javits a member of the national mediation board and 
federal mediator robert brown northwest said 
javits said the mediators provided a framework for the two sides 
to reach a settlement but the parties really did it themselves 
erskine said that pending ratification northwest would suspend 
the contract it was set to impose on april 1 the teamsters agreed 
not to engage in any job action during the ratification process 
the key issue in the dispute was northwests twotier wage 
structure of which the airline had proposed extending the 
lowerpaid scale to eight years from the current five years 
bscale flight attendants argued that the airline was trying to 
break a promise that they would earn higher ascale wages after 
five years 
the issue had intensified since northwest acquired republic 
airlines in 1986 about a third of the 2600 former republic 
attendants are on the lower scale and the others said northwests 
previous wage offer was inadequate 
jeff musto a teamsters spokesman in eagan said only one detail 
of the contract has been disclosed that all flight attendants 
hired by northwest will be required to join the union 
erskine said northwest found no evidence of guerilla warfare 
tactics the union had threatened as a way to keep the company off 
balance 
he also said northwest did not see its traffic diminish during 
the dispute although he acknowledged that some people may have 
booked flights on other airlines

four years after a big mining company 
decided to phase out its operations in copperhill the village 
tucked in the appalachian mountains of southeast tennessee has 
filed for bankruptcy protection 
i dont know where else to scratch copperhill mayor sylvan 
green said in a telephone interview calling tuesdays chapter 9 
federal court filing a last resort for the town of about 400 people 
about 60 miles east of chattanooga 
much of the problem for copperhill derives from a longstanding 
dispute over a sewer and water service deal with neighboring 
mccaysville ga the dispute began when tennessee chemical co said 
it was bailing out 
back in 1979 copperhills mining operations were owned by 
cities service co the town decided to buy extra water from 
mccaysville to supply what was easily polk countys largest 
employer 
that prompted mccaysville to float a bond issue on a new water 
plant and agree to pay copperhill for sewer service 
then in 1982 tennessee chemical co bought the mining 
operations two years later it said it couldnt compete with cheap 
imported copper and announced plans to lay off 900 workers by 1987 
suddenly copperhill no longer needed extra water and when it 
stopped paying for it mccaysville began withholding its 3000 
monthly payments for sewer service that was about two years ago 
they were to purchase almost 50 percent of our water 
depending upon the tennessee chemical company said mccaysville 
mayor barbara thomas 
of course the tennessee chemical company did not come through 
with their part of the bargain she said but that was not the 
contract we had we had the contract with copperhill 
mccaysville claims copperhill owes 255000 in back water 
payments copperhill wants payment for sewer service negotiations 
failed and lately said mrs thomas they havent even been able to 
agree on when to talk 
the loss of the sewer payments put such a dent in copperhills 
budget that green told officials last year that the city could not 
finish building its new police station 
in the petition filed in us bankruptcy court copperhill 
listed debts to 12 creditors totaling 30235549 
a chapter 9 bankruptcy is designed to allow a municipal 
government to maintain necessary levels of service while it 
implements a plan to adjust its debts

lot of people felt them finn said 
about 30 people telephoned santa barbara county sheriffs 
headquarters after the earth movement to confirm what they felt 
said deputy larry ralston 
they were just concerned and curious or like one who wanted 
to know if he had been dreaming ralston said

seismographs every increase of one number means a tenfold increase 
in magnitude 
an earthquake of 35 on the richter scale can cause slight

doctors had hoped that one of them would have bone marrow that 
could be transplanted to save luong tests showed however that 
their bone marrow was not compatible with hers

home to long island for five days earlier this month 
a week after she returned to the hospital she contracted an 
infection and never recovered rosette said

a deal to bestow prestigious harvard positions on 
a texas couple in exchange for a 500000 donation has drawn fire 
from a senior administrator of the universitys john f kennedy 
school of government 
executive dean richard cavanagh praised some aspects of the 
schools entrepreneurial style of raising money but complained 
about the tentative deal in a confidential report based on a 
twomonth study of funding efforts 
it is clear that this was an unusual unhappy and unfortunate 
incident the product of misunderstanding inexperience sloppy 
handling and hasty processing said cavanagh 
cavanaghs comments were carried in the latest edition of the 
weekly harvard gazette published by the university harvard 
officials confirmed the accuracy of his statements but declined to 
release his report 
the officials who spoke on condition of anonymity said no 
decision has been made on whether to conclude the agreement one 
official suggested that the controversy surrounding the deal was 
the reason for putting it on hold 
cavanagh was appointed in december and asked to examine the 
schools fundraising methods other harvard institutions also 
conducted fundraising surveys on orders from harvard president 
derek bok 
boks action followed publication by the harvard crimson student 
newspaper in november of parts of the draft agreement between the 
school and charles cameron dickinson iii and his wife joanne 
the donors will be appointed by the dean to appropriate 
positions in the school of government that will accord them status 
as officers of the university with the privileges associated 
therewith said the agreement tentatively approved by kennedy 
school dean graham t allison 
only fulltime instructors and administrators normally are 
appointed officers of the university academic administrative or 
advisory positions 
the crimson also published a inhouse memo by an allison aide 
stating that mrs dickinson wanted to know the most prestigious 
title she could buy for 250000 and asking how much it would cost 
to be on an advisory committee 
kennedy school officials confirmed the existence the memo but 
spokesman steven singer declined requests tuesday for telephone 
interviews with allison or cavanagh 
allison described the deal as a mistake shortly after it came to 
light 
dickinson a 1980 graduate of harvard divinity school comes 
from a wealthy texas oil family no one answered the telephone at 
the dickinson residence in wichita falls 
kennedy school officials acting on recommendations in the 
cavanagh report recently created a position of director of

nasa scientists are planning an 
international satellite system to study the atmosphere more 
completely a program moved into high gear because of recent 
ominous changes in the ozone layer and other problems 
the earth observing system will be an international network of 
spacebased polar laboratories focusing on the planets weather and 
ecology national aeronautics and space administration project 
scientist dixon butler said tuesday 
this will bring about a revolution in our understanding of the 
earth as a whole system butler said via satellite to scientists 
at agency centers across the country including the jet propulsion 
laboratory in pasadena 
the schedule for the program was recently accelerated because of 
worrisome changes in the earths atmosphere such as depletion in 
the protective ozone layer butler said from nasas goddard space 
flight center in greenbelt md 
the six satellite labs will also monitor the socalled 
greenhouse effect in which the earths temperature is 
gradually rising because of increased carbon dioxide in the 
atmosphere butler said 
the agency is asking for 20 million in next years budget to 
finalize planning and preparations for launches beginning in 1995 
said charles redmond a spokesman for nasas science division 
the project involves two satellites to be launched by japanese 
and european agencies as well as four by nasa it features an 
estimated 2 billion us price tag he said 
we need the intellectual resources of all mankind butler 
said we must have international cooperation 
nasa has already received about 870 letters from scientific 
groups proposing experiments he said he also said soviet 
participation is a possibility 
instruments to be used on the satellites include a synthetic 
aperture radar which uses radar waves to create images that would 
otherwise be hidden by clouds or vegetation 
another is a geodynamics laser ranging system that could 
detect the slightest movement along such geological features as 
californias san andreas fault butler said

eds new thruout to update with india canceling tennis visit 
figures on cost of uprising to israel cabinet to meet changes 
byline 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
india today canceled the visit of a tennis team 
to protest israels handling of arab riots and new figures showed 
that antioccupation violence in the west bank and gaza strip cost 
israel more than 335 million 
israels 10member inner cabinet was to meet later in the day to 
hear a report from prime minister yitzhak shamir on his talks in 
the united states 
shamir was greeted tuesday by thousands of singing and dancing 
supporters who welcomed his steadfast refusal to accept an american 
peace plan 
i return satisfied especially after people tried to frighten 
me before i left that the visit would be a difficult one and that i 
would hear harsh words shamir told an airport news conference 
im satisfied that didnt happen 
also tuesday defense minister yitzhak rabin told a 
parliamentary committee that israel had jailed 3000 arabs since 
dec 8 including 700 since sunday israeli newspapers said today 
in an underground leaflet circulated in the gaza strip the 
palestine liberation organization announced payments will be made 
to people who lose family members property or jobs because of 
clashes with israeli soldiers 
gad yacobi minister of economy disclosed that the violence 
that began dec 8 in the occupied lands has cost israel more than 
335 million in lost production exports and added security costs 
spokeswoman naama henig said today the tally does not include 
losses in tourism and agriculture 
if the situation continues it will have a significant impact 
on israels economy she quoted yacobi as telling israeli 
economic writers 
yacobi said there was a drop in overall production especially 
in construction of 10 percent to 20 percent a month during the 
last three months this resulted in a loss of at least 75 million 
he said 
he put the cost for extra security at 60 million 
the biggest loss was in israeli exports to the occupied lands 
reduced by 200 million thus far israeli exports to gaza and the 
west bank totaled 115 billion last year 
indian prime minister rajiv gandhi announced today that his 
countrys davis cup team was canceling a visit to israel to protest 
israeli repression and atrocities against arabs in the 
territories 
zvi meyer secretary of the israel tennis association said he 
was very surprised and disappointed by the decision he said 
israel had already sold 1500 seats for the threeday series that 
was to begin april 7 
it was the first protest cancellation of a sporting or 
entertainment event as a result of the clashes in the occupied 
lands although the violence has made it difficult for promoters to 
arrange such events 
for example an allstar tennis fundraiser for israels sharei 
tzadek hospital was canceled after officials said big name players 
such as chris evert would not come because of security concerns 
the underground leaflet distributed in gaza said families would 
receive a onetime payment of 2900 for martyrs killed in 
confrontations and 600 for anyone arrested according to un 
figures 107 palestinians have been killed by israeli soldiers or 
settlers since dec 8 in the territories israel seized in the 1967 
middle east war one israeli soldier has been killed 
merchants unable to open stores because of strikes would get 
1450 in compensation from the plo and police who resigned their 
jobs would get 1450 as a first payment 
israeli officials have taken steps to prevent the plo from 
compensating palestinians who suffered financial losses 
money changers have been particularly hard hit because one such 
measure is a ceiling of 1350 on the amount of money brought into 
israel by individuals or institutions an official said on 
condition of anonymity 
demonstrations subsided this afternoon in israels occupied 
lands although arab reports said a curfew was extended on deir al 
balah in the gaza strip after an overnight demonstration in which 
youths threw stones at soldiers 
all of gaza is under a nightly curfew until 3 am 
on tuesday a palestinian motorist was ambushed and killed near 
the gaza strip town of khan yunis and israeli troops shot and 
killed a palestinian in the west bank village of tubas

ugly is officially out in this community 
east of san francisco where residents now can be sent to jail for 
having eyesores in their yards 
not everyone is happy about the new law which critics say will 
turn neighbors into enemies 
the law which goes into effect march 30 will outlaw hanging a 
clothesline visible from the street leaving broken furniture or 
auto parts in the yard or even maintaining a house with most of 
its paint peeling 
provisions banning garbage cans building materials dirt piles 
packing boxes and broken appliances in front yards are part of a 
selfimprovement campaign by the city city officials said 
city councilman dave burton says the city has no business 
subjecting citizens to whiteglove inspections 
this is a sledgehammer approach to a problem of aesthetics 
burton said if you brought a pile of lumber to your house they 
could cite you 
city councilman paul moffatt said the law was needed to prevent 
public health and safety problems arising from the large number of 
people piling refuse in their yards and creating dangerous 
conditions for children in dublin a city of 19000 located 30 
miles southeast of san francisco 
we have old decaying trees where rodents can get in and we 
have some rabies out here said moffatt 
he explained a clothesline could be a hazard if constructed so 
it restricts the vision of a person taking a car around a corner so 
they couldnt negotiate the corner in a safe and orderly manner 
a first violation carries a 100 fine which increases to 500 
for a third infraction before a scofflaw can be charged with a 
misdemeanor and put in jail the ordinance will be enforced only 
when a citizen files a complaint

liberal politicians and a 
legal expert today criticized president pw botha for halting the 
murder trial of six soldiers charged with the killing of an 
activist in southwest africa 
helen suzman parliament member for the antiapartheid 
progressive federal party noted that bothas action came a week 
after he refused to intervene to spare the sharpeville six a 
group of blacks sentenced to hang for complicity in a 1984 mob 
killing of a black town councilor 
despite an international clemency campaign botha said his 
policy was to avoid interfering with the judicial process last 
thursday after bothas pronouncement a judge granted a onemonth 
stay of execution to the six in order to consider claims that a 
state witness committed perjury 
in light of bothas refusal to intervene in the sharpeville 
case mrs suzman said she was astonished that the president 
did not allow the ordinary course of justice to be followed in 
the case of the soldiers in southwest africa 
botha ordered the attorney general of the territory commonly 
known as namibia to halt prosecution under the defense act which 
exempts security forces members from court action if they act in 
good faith in combating suspected terrorism 
the six soldiers four officers and two enlisted men were 
accused of arranging for 50 black soldiers to disguise themselves 
in civilian clothes arm themselves with spears and knives and 
disrupt a political rally in 1985 
the rally was sponsored by the southwest african peoples 
organization which seeks independence from south africa swapos 
outlawed military wing has been waging a guerrilla war since 1966 
the man fatally stabbed at the rally immanuel shifidi was a 
swapo member 
dirk van zyl smit a criminology professor at the university of 
cape town said bothas intervention was the worst type of 
executive interference because unlike a pardon or reprieve it 
occurred before a judgment had been made 
dave dalling a progressive federal member of parliament said 
bothas action placed the army above the law and undermined public 
confidence in the judiciary 
in the namibian capital windhoek the local bar association 
expressed shock and disbelief at bothas action 
the labor party which represents most of the territorys 
mixedrace people said bothas arbitrary decision may give 
rise to further public violence bloodshed and chaos

when eleanore rose holds a burial next week for 
her murdered daughter allegedly a victim of killer ted bundy 14 
years ago the casket will contain denises favorite dress a rose 
and some photos 
but there will be no remains 
king county authorities who had kept the bones of 18yearold 
denise naslund as part of their investigation of the alleged serial 
killer misplaced them shortly after they were found in 1974 in a 
wooded area in the cascade foothills east of seattle 
a lawsuit filed by ms rose and relatives against the county was 
settled recently out of court and details were not made public but 
ms rose said the settlement and next wednesdays memorial are 
little consolation 
i cant forget the remains were lost she said tuesday 
her being murdered was bad enough all those years they told 
me they would give the remains back 
in 1974 police agreed to temporarily place the remains in the 
casket so a memorial service could be held afterward they were 
taken away by detectives and the casket wrapped in plastic and 
placed in the funeral homes basement 
ten years later when ms rose sought to have them released for 
burial she learned they had mysteriously disappeared possibly in 
an office move or an accidental cremation which would violate her 
roman catholic beliefs 
losing the remains is almost to me sacrilegious its almost 
like a crime was committed she said 
when the service is held at forest lawn cemetery in seattle ms 
naslunds casket will hold some of her personal effects including 
a favorite floralprint dress her mother said she plans to add a 
silk rose photos of herself and her daughter a crucifix and some 
letters 
in one letter county officials express their regret at losing 
ms naslunds remains another note is from ms rose to her 
daughter dear denise god forgive them for what they have done 
i love you mom 
ms naslund along with janice ott disappeared on july 14 
1974 two months later the bones of the women were found scattered 
in a remote area the cause of death was not positively determined 
no charges in washington were ever filed against bundy who is 
on death row in florida after receiving three death sentences for 
the 1978 murders of two florida state university sorority sisters 
and the february 1978 kidnap rape and murder of a 12yearold lake 
city fla girl 
however bundy has been described by king county police as their 
prime suspect in the unsolved slayings of ms naslund ms ott and 
six other young women in western washington in 1974 
in ms roses seattle home the walls of the small kitchen are 
crowded with photographs of her daughter whose bedroom remains 
much the same as it was when she disappeared ms naslunds 1964 
chevrolet impala is still parked outside

associated with business is gaining popularity in the religious 
society of friends a group not known for evangelism 
in kernersville a handful of quakers with telephones address 
lists and friendly voices hope to gather a new weekly meeting 
on tuesday night they gathered at the former site of spruce 
pines friends meeting a dwindling church that finally closed in 
november quakers from winstonsalem kernersville archdale and 
charlotte dial nightly in a fourweek campaign that has yielded 
more than 200 requests for information since sunday 
hi this is archie creed with the new north view friends 
church that will be opening off piney grove road in may said the 
churchs pastor in a call to a prospective member 
creed first asks if the person is actively involved in a local 
church if they say yes he thanks them for their time if they say 
no creed asks if the church can mail them a brochure 
each call is ranked according to the persons response fair 
good very good excellent first one tonight exclaimed ethel 
holmes a volunteer from kernersville after she marked one 
response excellent 
most of them are receptive even if they attend another 
church she said i have had no hangups 
holmes is sold on this unconventional method of evangelism 
people do not respond to doorknocking real well she 
explained but they usually dont mind a phone call she said 
the goal is 25000 calls which creed hopes will produce a 
mailing list of 2500 names

steve wood pastor of battle forest friends church in northwest 
greensboro is also sold on telemarketing 
his congregation recently completed an 8000call campaign on 
sunday the 85member congregation will celebrate its telephonic 
fruits at a service for new members 
wood a parttime real estate agent got the idea from 
telemarketing advertisements in real estate magazines if it works 
for business he thought why not use it in the church 
doortodoor visitation was out because it takes too much time 
for too few results wood said 
so far telemarketing by quakers has been very successful says 
billy britt superintendent of the nc friends yearly meeting in 
southern california such campaigns produced seven new churches he 
said 
about one percent of those called end up joining the church 
which means battle forest can expect to add about 60 people to its 
rolls 
if other quakers object to the technique they havent told him 
about it 
there has been no opposition to it britt said it is 
aimed at the unchurched theres no high pressure

a judge has ordered maria desillers to turn over 
additional donations that she recently told officials she had 
received for her late sons liver transplants 
all undeposited contributions must be listed and handed over to 
a courtappointed curator today dade circuit judge francis j 
christie said tuesday 
curator karen gievers requested the order after ms desillers 
said friday that she had found a substantial amount of unopened 
mail last november in warehouse where she stored furniture and 
other possessions 
the carton of mail included checks and cash donated for 
desillers 7yearold son ronnie who died april 29 at childrens 
hospital of pittsburgh while awaiting his fourth liver transplant 
when ronnies need for a liver transplant was publicized last 
year donations were received from wellwishers throughout the 
country including 1000 from president reagan 
an audit by the florida secretary of state found that ms 
desillers received almost 1 million in donations of which about 
175000 could not be accounted for 
ms desillers lawyer said tuesday that for four months his 
client didnt deposit the newly found donations which he said 
totaled only a few hundred dollars 
she has kept everything segregated and stapled together 
attorney harry robbins said she figured if she made any more 
deposits it wasnt going to look good 
the state has charged ms desillers with using donations for her 
personal expenses and failing to register ronnies fund as a 
charity ms desillers who faces a maximum 1000 fine will 
contest the charges at a may 10 hearing 
state investigators say ms desillers withdrew at least 47000 
in donations to buy jewelry clothing and furniture pay rent on 
her miami bayfront apartment and return 5000 loaned to her by a 
former boyfriend 
last fall childrens hospital sued ms desillers after she 
refused to pay 262000 of the 424300 bill that remained from her 
sons transplants ms desillers claimed the boy received poor 
care which hospital officials deny 
meanwhile the dade county state attorneys office is continuing 
a criminal investigation into whether ms desillers committed fraud 
or theft by using some of the donations for her expenses 
earlier this month christie froze the boys estate and 
appointed ms gievers to oversee the 239287 that remained in the 
childs bank account 
when ms gievers learned of the undeposited funds last week she 
requested that the money be turned over to her immediately by 
tuesday when she had not received the money she filed the 
petition in the dade court 
the money will be deposited in a restricted interestbearing 
account until the court rules how the remaining funds will be 
distributed ms gievers said 
robbins has said his client did not misuse any of the donations 
and that she is entitled to the estate because she is the boys 
natural heir

the roman catholic bishop whose 
diocese includes the ira stronghold of catholic west belfast said 
today the outlawed guerrilla organization is sheer evil 
the ira poses a very grave spiritual danger to the catholic 
community and we must realize that and have no illusions about 
it said bishop cahal daly in an interview with radio ulster the 
british broadcasting corps local northern ireland station 
this is a question of sheer evil and we have got to face that 
evil and have no truck with it he declared 
daly is bishop of down and connor the diocese includes west 
belfast where two british soldiers were killed saturday when they 
drove up to the funeral cortege for irish republican army guerrilla 
kevin brady 
in scenes that shocked television audiences around the world 
members of the catholic crowd in the funeral cortege for brady 
dragged the soldiers from the car stripped them naked and beat 
them unconscious with iron bars before ira gunmen shot them dead 
daly in a statement tuesday declared ira violence is often 
disguised with a mask of romantic rhetoric and militaristic mock 
ritual for a ghastly halfhour on saturday the mask slipped the 
real face of ira violence was shown and it was horrible to see 
he said the crowd saturday had a right to fear that they were 
going to be attacked the previous wednesday a protestant extremist 
killed three people and wounded 68 in an attack on an ira funeral 
but let us not be deceived this was not a momentary lapse 
from high ira principles and standards people would not have taken 
iron bars in their hands to batter soldiers into unconsciousness if 
they had not taken hatred into their hearts he said in tuesdays 
statement 
daly pleaded with those who joined the ira for idealistic 
reasons and out of sense of justice to quit the organization 
for gods sake for irelands sake let them leave the 
organization now before still more grievous harm is done he said 
sean kenny a sinn fein member of belfast city council 
dismissed the statement saying the bishop was an apologist for the 
british security forces sinn fein is the iras legal political arm 
brady was one of three people killed in a gun and grenade attack 
at the march 16 funeral at milltown cemetery of three unarmed ira 
guerrillas killed by british troops in gibraltar 
protestant michael stone was charged tuesday with three counts 
of murder in connection with the cemetery deaths and with murdering 
three other catholics in sniper attacks

president francois mitterrand said he will seek 
reelection because he can rise above frances fractious politics 
and keep the country together 
the 71yearold socialist announced on nationwide television 
tuesday that he will seek reelection next month prior to his 
announcement opinion polls put him in the lead 
mitterrand told a tv interviewer he decided to run because he 
thinks disunity threatens to tear the social fabric of france 
i saw a risk that the country might fall again into the 
quarrels and divisions that have hampered it so often i want 
france to be united not be taken in hand by the spirit of 
intolerance by parties who want everything by clans by 
cliques he said 
after mitterrand declared michel rocard until now the 
socialist partys only candidate withdrew and gave his full 
support to the incumbent the main conservative candidates are 
premier jacques chirac and former premier raymond barre 
the first round of the elections is to be held april 24 with a 
runoff between the top two candidates scheduled for may 8 
mitterrand led the leftist surge in may 1981 that ousted 
president valery giscard destaing and the centerright alliance 
that had controlled the national assembly for 23 years 
the victory avenged mitterrands defeats in the presidential 
elections of 1965 by charles de gaulle and 1974 by giscard 
destaing 
but frances love affair with the socialists was shortlived 
after five years french voters in the march 1986 parliamentary 
elections returned control to the right creating what became 
known in france as cohabitation between a socialist president 
and a conservative premier 
socialist policies had dragged mitterrands popularity rating in 
public opinion polls as low as 27 percent but under the unwanted 
marriage with the conservatives it soared again to a consistent 55 
percent or more 
that gave mitterrand the dubious honor of being in one 
sevenyear term both the least and most popular chief executive in 
the 30 years of the fifth republic 
in the beginning of his administration mitterrand pursued 
costly social programs after the socialists gained power then he 
reversed course instituting austerity measures 
economic troubles brought his party to power and caused its 
downfall five years later after the socialist defeat mitterrand 
eased into the role of elder statesman and held himself above the 
daytoday battles of governing commenting on issues only 
occasionally 
the french called him tonton or uncle 
mitterrand was born oct 26 1916 in jarnac and attended 
universities in paris earning degrees in law and letters he was 
drafted into the army in 1938 and shot and captured during the 
german invasion in 1940 
mitterrand escaped from a prison camp in germany returned to 
france and created a resistance network his feud with de gaulle 
began when mitterrand refused to unite his resistance group with de 
gaulles 
it was in the resistance days that he met danielle gouze and 
they married in 1944 soon after france was liberated he held 
several government posts including interior and justice minister 
in the early 1970s he built the moribund socialist party into a 
major political force but the union of the left he formed with the 
communists fell apart in 1977 
not until the final days of the 1981 campaign did the two main 
leftist parties join forces again to defeat giscard and oust the 
conservatives 
mitterrand shocked much of the west by bringing communists into 
his government but the union lasted only three years in 1984 the 
communists pulled out in a dispute over economic policy

ortho pharmaceutical corp says it will 
challenge a state appellate courts decision upholding a jurys 
verdict that the diaphragm manufacturer was responsible for a 
womans toxic shock syndrome 
in a 36page ruling tuesday the middlelevel court of appeals 
said there was sufficient evidence to justify a maricopa county 
superior court jurys 15 million verdict against ortho 
manufacturer of the ortho allflex diaphragm 
the verdict was the first to hold a pharmaceutical manufacturer 
responsible for a case of toxic shock syndrome according to the 
appellate court and the plaintiffs lawyer 
tss is an acute and sometimes fatal illness caused by a 
bacterium staphylococcus aureus that produces a poison the 
ailment is most closely associated with tampon use 
the case was brought in phoenix by roberta baroldy whose 
physician prescribed an ortho allflex diaphragm in april 1982 
about six weeks after the birth of her first child 
ortho pharmaceutical has since issued warnings on the 
possibility of toxic shock syndrome but court records show that 
the company had been warned by at least one doctor of a possible 
tss link nearly four months before mrs baroldys illness in july 
1982 and had not publicized the warning 
mrs baroldy was hospitalized for 41 days and was at times 
comatose and near death the 30 appellate ruling noted 
mrs baroldys medical witnesses testified that she would have 
physical problems for the rest of her life as a result of the 
disease 
we will appeal ortho spokesman rich salem said tuesday at 
corporate headquarters in raritan nj beyond that wed like a 
chance to actually see the opinion before we comment further 
the company a subsidiary of johnson amp johnson and has sold 
millions of the contraceptive devices over more than 40 years 
according to court records 
about 18 million diaphragms are sold each year in the united 
states salem said adding that he did not know orthos share of 
the market 
orthos attorneys argued on appeal that the theory under which 
experts claimed that mrs baroldy was stricken did not have the 
required general acceptance in the scientific community 
they also argued that the case should have been tried using 
north carolina laws because mrs baroldy was in north carolina at 
the time of her illness while her husband was taking parachute 
training at fort bragg 
but the appeals court said it was satisfied that testimony from 
a broad crosssection of experts showed general acceptance of a 
link between diaphragms and tss 
and the judges said arizonas product liability law was more 
appropriate than north carolina law because it was closer to the 
laws in new jersey where ortho is headquartered and because the 
baroldys who are from the globe ariz area were living in mesa 
at the time the suit was tried

the un command today rebuked 
communist north korea for refusing to return the remains of us 
soldiers killed during the korean war officials said 
the un command called for return of the remains at a meeting 
with north korean military officials at the panmunjom truce site 
un officials accused north korea of aggravating tension on the 
korean peninsula 
this irrational and inhumane action by your side on this issue 
is totally unacceptable and will be denounced by all fairminded 
people and the community of civilized nations worldwide said 
us army col charles coffman according to a un statement 
north korea refused to return the remains of two us soldiers 
who died during the korean war after the united states imposed 
sanctions against the country in january for its alleged bombing of 
a south korean commercial jetliner 
the united states south korea and other nations have accused 
north korea of bombing the airliner killing all 115 people aboard 
last nov 29 north korea has denied involvement 
a woman who flew on an early part of the flight confessed in 
january to being a north korean agent and said she planted a bomb 
on the korean air jet to disrupt the 1988 olympic games in seoul 
the two americans whose remains are being sought by the us 
have been identified as 1st lt jack j saunders of utah and cpl 
arthur i seaton of pennsylvania they reportedly died in north 
korean prison camps in 1951 
coffman acting as secretary of the un command complained 
that north korea was trying to stir up tension on the korean 
peninsula 
he also objected to repeated north korean charges that military 
exercises being held by us and south korean forces under the name 
team spirit were a prelude to a nuclear attack on the north 
your repetition of charges and your repeat of your annual 
litany of false allegations against team spirit filled with 
abusive language unfounded and irrelevant allegations obviously 
satisifed your propaganda purposes he said 
about 200000 us and south korean troops are taking part in 
the annual exercises between now and april the united states keeps 
40000 troops in south korea under a mutual defense pact 
the un command meets periodically with north korean and 
chinese representatives for meetings of the military armistice 
commission to supervise disputes and violations of the ceasefire 
that ended the korean war in 1953 
the war began in 1950 after north korean forces invaded the 
south and troops from the united states and other nations came to 
the assistance of the south

a 1millionayear program 
has relocated 62 sea otters to an island off southern california 
but 27 of the endangered beasts have vanished without a trace 
sure were concerned said jim estes who is monitoring the 
program for us fish and wildlife service we wish we had 62 sea 
otters there but weve only been at this six months we need more 
time with these animals 
in addition to 27 otters missing since aug 8 after being moved 
to san nicolas island about 60 miles off the coast eight have 
died and six are known to have left the area the state coastal 
commission learned tuesday 
weve lost most of the adults out there estes told the 
commission but added we have only just begun to look for 
animals that have dispersed from the island 
you stand before us and tell us that you cant account for 
almost onehalf of the population you transferred out there 
commissioner dorrill wright responded he said he was very 
unhappy about the report 
the otters were the first of several groups to be airlifted over 
five years to the small rocky island that was once a breeding 
ground of the animals which were hunted to near extinction before 
the turn of the century 
the california population of sea otters numbers about 1400 and 
lives along a 300mile stretch of the central california coast from 
morro bay to santa cruz 
the airlift to san nicolas was part of an effort to establish 
another population center for the animals off southern california 
state and federal marine biologists say the california population 
could be threatened with extinction if their breeding grounds are 
hit with an oil spill or disease 
the population transfer was opposed by local fishermen who 
feared that the otters would wipe out abalone lobsters and other 
marketable marine life 
of the eight otters that died three perished from stress 
related to the transfer three drowned in lobster traps and fishing 
nets one was shot and one was found dead of unknown causes 
according to the report 
officials have acknowledged that at least six otters have eluded 
recapture and managed to swim home to monterey another was caught 
off the northern los angeles county coastline and returned to its 
original capture site officials said 
wildlife officials hope to continue relocating sea otters to san 
nicolas island 
weve learned a lot and we are guardedly optimistic said 
david riley an assistant regional director with the us fish and 
wildlife service 
carol fulton representing friends of the sea otter a 
carmelbased group that claims 4500 members nationwide supported 
the project 
the issue has to be put in perspective she said we were 
losing over 100 otters a year in fishermens gill nets within their 
present range

a pastor who opposed his congregations 
decision to bar blacks from the church preschool has resigned at 
the request of the churchs deacons 
it all goes back to the integration issue i was like a toy 
two children were fighting over the rev kenneth newton said 
about his resignation and the split among members of northside 
baptist church 
in an unsigned letter to church members dated march 14 the 
deacons said they unanimously recommended that newton resign 
immediately the letter said the recommendation was based on 
matters of trustworthiness that had a significant effect on the 
church 
wyman lawson chairman of the deacons would not comment on the 
letter 
newton however said monday the mistrust was mutual 
the last pastor stayed here 16 months and said the deacons 
would not cooperate with him and left i was able to stay here 13 
years under adverse circumstances newton said 
the deacons letter said newton was offered 10000 in severance 
pay he accepted the money march 4 and resigned that day 
some church members who were opposed to the deacons action sent 
out a letter listing newtons accomplishments they said when 
newton first came to northside in 1974 the church was 90000 in 
debt 
the letter said the debt has been paid along with renovations to 
the church opening of the learning center for children and 
purchase of 76 acres of land and seven houses the group also said 
the churchs budget has increased from 60000 to 500000 under 
newtons leadership 
in a secret vote last october the congregation decided by a 
twothirds majority that blacks should not be accepted by northside 
baptist learning center afterward newton attacked the decision 
publicly angering some congregants

its a clammy situation scientists admit 
a year ago a species of tiny clams believed to come from the 
asian coast were discovered in san francisco bay now scientists 
say there are millions in the muck along the bottom 
its too early to determine if the clam might displace other 
species in the bay said jim carlton of the university of oregon 
an authority on marine transplants 
its brand new so the fullscale ecological consequences of 
the invasion probably wont be measured for several years as we see 
how it spreads and where he said 
carlton plans to send some specimens to asian scientists to 
determine the clams origins 
at one time the soviet union was thought to be the clams home 
because a similar mollusk was found there in the 1860s we know 
now thats not true said larry schemel of the us geological 
survey it appears right now that theres a higher probability 
that the clam came from china 
one things certain though they said there is little chance 
the clam will end up on menus at the citys fashionable restaurants 
the maximum size is half to threequarters of an inch so 
were not even talking about an hors doeuvre carlton said

the postmaster who found a stolen claude 
monet painting worth 175000 will get a pat on the back but he 
wont collect the 17500 reward because he was simply doing his 
job 
steve reutter spokesman for the st paul fire amp marine 
insurance co which paid a 175000 claim after the theft said 
postal rules prevent charles polley and other employees from 
collecting rewards for things done in the line of duty 
we asked them and thats what they said reutter said 
i really didnt expect it said polley you are here on a 
payroll and thats the way it is 
reutter said the company will make a good will offering to a 
charity in marshalltown in polleys name the amount and charity 
havent been decided he said 
the painting fishing boats under the cliffs of etretat was 
stolen from the fisher community center march 19 1987 and was 
recovered this month when polley found it in a mail drop box in 
legrand which is near marshalltown 
polley said he has a metal detector and goes hunting for buried 
treasures now and then but the monet discovery tops his list 
ive found the gold ring he said that was the most valuable 
thing ive ever found 
art experts say the painting is damaged but restorable the 
fisher foundation which operates the center will keep the 
insurance money to build a new gallery the insurers have said 
theyll probably auction the painting

most employers believe they benefit when workers 
have good child care available but the companies dont want to pay 
for it a survey of 141 businesses concludes 
nationwide about 800 companies have developed childcare 
centers on or near their business according to the survey being 
published in the april issue of personnel journal in costa mesa 
calif most of these are large companies or public agencies 
the majority of us employers are not establishing childcare 
centers wrote the authors toni a campbell of san jose state 
university in california and david e campbell of humboldt state 
university in arcata calif 
on the other hand they wrote in the survey released tuesday 
most employers surveyed thought they should be involved in family 
matters 
the problems are money and information the survey found 
the question appears not to be whether employers might 
involve themselves but rather how they can get involved without 
jeopardizing the bottom line the authors wrote 
certainly the focus on expense is a major issue for small 
businesses they added 
the survey found that eight of 10 companies surveyed believe 
productivity and the quality of the work force will improve if the 
organization helps employees with childcare problems 
but 71 percent said they dont want to provide space at the work 
site and 69 percent said they dont want to subsidize childcare 
programs 
the researchers said many employers offer options involving work 
schedules to help families flexible hours were offered by 60 
percent of the companies surveyed 71 percent offered parttime 
work 24 percent had job sharing and 71 percent gave leaves to 
care for a sick child 
the researchers suggested that small companies could share the 
cost of locating and implementing a childcare program for 
employees they said this could be coordinated through a local 
chamber of commerce or a trade group

president francois mitterrand said he will seek 
reelection because he can rise above frances fractious politics 
and keep the country together 
the 71yearold socialist announced on nationwide television 
tuesday that he will seek reelection next month prior to his 
announcement opinion polls put him in the lead 
mitterrand told a tv interviewer he decided to run because he 
thinks disunity threatens to tear the social fabric of france 
i saw a risk that the country might fall again into the 
quarrels and divisions that have hampered it so often i want 
france to be united not be taken in hand by the spirit of 
intolerance by parties who want everything by clans by 
cliques he said 
after mitterrand declared michel rocard until now the 
socialist partys only candidate withdrew and gave his full 
support to the incumbent the main conservative candidates are 
premier jacques chirac and former premier raymond barre 
the first round of the elections is to be held april 24 with a 
runoff between the top two candidates scheduled for may 8 
mitterrand led the leftist surge in may 1981 that ousted 
president valery giscard destaing and the centerright alliance 
that had controlled the national assembly for 23 years 
the victory avenged mitterrands defeats in the presidential 
elections of 1965 by charles de gaulle and 1974 by giscard 
destaing 
but frances love affair with the socialists was shortlived 
after five years french voters in the march 1986 parliamentary 
elections returned control to the right creating what became 
known in france as cohabitation between a socialist president 
and a conservative premier 
socialist policies had dragged mitterrands popularity rating in 
public opinion polls as low as 27 percent but under the unwanted 
marriage with the conservatives it soared again to a consistent 55 
percent or more 
that gave mitterrand the dubious honor of being in one 
sevenyear term both the least and most popular chief executive in 
the 30 years of the fifth republic 
in the beginning of his administration mitterrand pursued 
costly social programs after the socialists gained power then he 
reversed course instituting austerity measures 
economic troubles brought his party to power and caused its 
downfall five years later after the socialist defeat mitterrand 
eased into the role of elder statesman and held himself above the 
daytoday battles of governing commenting on issues only 
occasionally 
the french called him tonton or uncle 
mitterrand was born oct 26 1916 in jarnac and attended 
universities in paris earning degrees in law and letters he was 
drafted into the army in 1938 and shot and captured during the 
german invasion in 1940 
mitterrand escaped from a prison camp in germany returned to 
france and created a resistance network his feud with de gaulle 
began when mitterrand refused to unite his resistance group with de 
gaulles 
it was in the resistance days that he met danielle gouze and 
they married in 1944 soon after france was liberated he held 
several government posts including interior and justice minister 
in the early 1970s he built the moribund socialist party into a 
major political force but the union of the left he formed with the 
communists fell apart in 1977 
not until the final days of the 1981 campaign did the two main 
leftist parties join forces again to defeat giscard and oust the 
conservatives 
mitterrand shocked much of the west by bringing communists into 
his government but the union lasted only three years in 1984 the 
communists pulled out in a dispute over economic policy

an initial review of court documents 
indicates that the manufacturer of the copper7 birth control 
device did not attempt to mislead federal regulators about its 
potential hazards a government spokeswoman says 
gd searle amp co is being sued by women who claim use of the 
intrauterine device caused them to develop pelvic infections 
a lawyer for one of the plaintiffs contends court documents 
indicate an attempt to conceal known health threats from the us 
food and drug administration the papers were unsealed by a judges 
order 
fda spokeswoman susan cruzan said tuesday that investigators met 
with searle officials march 16 to go over the documents 
the fda has not had any reason to withdraw approval of the 
copper7 iud she said adding that could be the ultimate penalty 
if the fda determined the company did misrepresent the product 
cruzan said the fda will continue to review documents that are 
unsealed in the case brought by esther kociemba of melrose who 
claims that the copper7 made her infertile 
her attorney michael ciresi of minneapolis has said the 
unsealed documents will collectively establish without a doubt 
that the copper7 causes infection and searle knew about it but 
did not disclose it to doctors or to women 
ciresi said tuesday he could not comment on cruzans initial 
assessment because he does not know which documents the fda 
reviewed 
mrs kociembas case against searle is scheduled to go to trial 
may 16 in federal court in st paul 
the copper7 was approved for public use in 1974 from then 
until 1986 when searle withdrew it from the market because of 
mounting litigation costs it was the most popular iud in the 
united states searle recently resumed manufacturing the device to 
fill foreign orders

the 17 cases that have gone to court and says it has settled

democrat albert gore jr today called on 
the government to straighten out its economic policy to make 
heavy industry more competitive worldwide 
the tennessee senator campaigning in michigan for a share of 
the 138 delegates at stake in saturdays caucuses made his plea 
during a tour of a giant iron ore processing plant in the states 
upper peninsula 
gore spoke informally with some of the 700 workers at the tilden 
mining company facility and then noted the plants reduced 
production which officials attributed to lowered demands 
the candidate said the plant is competitive so long as the 
competition is not unfairly subsidized 
we need to straighten out our economic policy and stop 
borrowing 500 million every 24 hours so that were competitive in 
the world economy and we have to take steps to remove unfair 
trade barriers overseas he said 
gore donned a hard hat to tour the facility where iron ore is 
minded and rendered into small pellets he walked amid large 
whirling cylinders that grind and filter the iron and peered inside 
a giant rotating kiln that bakes the final product 
its an amazing place isnt it its like the inside of a 
death star gore said in apparent reference to the star wars 
movie trilogy 
gore was seeking votes in the states sparsely populated upper 
peninsula for a second day today after attacking vice president 
george bush and the reagan administration before high school and 
college audiences tuesday 
he was heading to wisconsin later today to address the state 
legislature in madison aiming toward wisconsins april 5 primary 
gore began airing television commercials there this week lashing 
out at corporate greed 
gore said bush represents the choice for voters to continue 
what were doing without change denouncing that choice he cited 
the irancontra affair us support for panama strongman manuel 
noriega in the face of evidence of drug involvement until recently 
and what he said was a general feeling of economic pessimism among 
americas youth 
i think if we continue what were doing now continuing down 
the same path were headed for trouble he told high school 
students who jammed an auditorium for an afterschool rally in 
traverse city 
he repeated those themes later in a speech to more than 1000 
students at lake superior state university in sault ste marie 
he denounced bush as lacking the gumption to disagree with 
president reagans veto on the civil rights bill which congress 
voted to override gore dropped plans to campaign in wisconsin on 
tuesday so that he could return to washington to vote to override 
the veto 
i was quite surprised that george bush belatedly announced he 
was in favor of the veto that surprised many people gore said 
but of course he has not been willing to disagree with president 
reagan on anything 
gore campaigned in northern michigan as polls of the states 
democrats published by both detroit newspapers showed him 
trailing far behind rivals jesse jackson and michael dukakis 
democrat richard gephardt is also campaigning in michigan which is 
a doordie state for his white house hopes 
facing those long odds gore has not waged an intensive michigan 
campaign and has aired radio but no television commercials much of 
gores michigan organization is based on the support of key state 
legislators including a legislative power from the northern 
region dominic jacobitti 
gore largely avoided mention of his democratic rivals however 
the closest he came was saying the country needs a president with 
foreign policy experience something he has in the past charged 
dukakis with lacking 
gore appeared before an enthusiastic audience of college 
students in sault ste marie and contended i am the first 
presidential candidate to campaign in sault ste marie since teddy 
roosevelt

a date for the next superpower summit and 
progress on arms control and human rights appeared in the offing 
today as soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze neared the 
end of three days of talks here 
his call on president reagan at the white house was expected to 
complete plans for a summit in late may in moscow with soviet 
leader mikhail s gorbachev at which the two sides hope to sign a 
treaty slashing their arsenals of longrange nuclear weapons by 30 
to 50 percent 
the negotiations are going fairly well shevardnadze said 
tuesday night as he returned to the state department for another 
round of talks with secretary of state george p shultz over a 
buffet dinner of hot dogs potato salad and popcorn arrangements 
also were made to show the film thats entertainment a 
retrospective of hollywood musicals during breaks in the 
discussions 
as they renewed their discussions this morning shultz told 
reporters we did a fair amount of business even so but he 
admitted im not very big on popcorn 
the pair met for 6 hours during the day and agreed their 
session on arms control and human rights was businesslike 
straightforward constructive and broadranging 
evidently it was not entirely harmonious however charles e 
redman the state department spokesman said there were a few 
laughs a few arguments he declined to provide any details 
shultz has been pressing the soviets to relax their emigration 
restrictions and liberalize cultural and religious practices the 
soviets on the other hand have made an issue of the homeless 
problem in the united states and what they describe as a poor civil 
rights record 
this time it was a much more detailed discussion vadim 
perfilyev the deputy soviet foreign ministry spokesman said we 
think that we have points where we have cooperation between our two 
countries and i think that now we have positive results it is 
much more of a twoway street 
during the day shultz and shevardnadze also received brief 
reports from us and soviet arms control experts discussion of 
the conflicts in afghanistan and nicaragua wars in which the two 
superpowers have armed rival forces was deferred until wednesday 
the arms control experts are trying to mesh us and soviet 
drafts of treaty provisions to scrap 30 to 50 percent of the two 
sides longrange bombers missiles and submarines and to devise 
measures to ensure compliance with the accord 
the treaty is the projected centerpiece of the summit meeting 
the treaty drafts also include data on the size and locations of 
us and soviet longrange weapons 
assistant secretary of state rozanne l ridgway said monday 
there were blanks in the information the two sides had 
exchanged she said lots and lots of disagreements remain 
two veteran negotiators paul h nitze and aleksei a obukhov 
headed the us and soviet expert groups they were to report back 
to shultz and shevardnadze on whether the differences narrowed 
reagan has said that if the treaty is not ready he might hold a 
second meeting with gorbachev later in the year to sign it 
during a break in their talks shultz and shevardnadze presided 
tuesday at the opening of a new communications center designed to 
reduce the risk of nuclear war matching centers in washington and 
moscow will be linked by satellite 
the facility will help us to remove misunderstandings and it 
will help us to reduce the risk of any outbreaks of hostilities 
between us shultz said 
shevardnadze said he hoped one day when we will have done 
away with any offensive arms such centers will be used for more 
humane purposes 
in contrast to that cooperative step the two sides are in 
conflict over central america and afghanistan 
in a brief exchange with reporters shevardnadze backed away 
from an earlier soviet pledge to withdraw the red army from 
afghanistan even if negotiators fail to agree on conditions for 
ending the war there 
arriving for his talks with shultz he declined to repeat the 
pledge made by a soviet foreign ministry spokesman last week in 
moscow after negotiations deadlocked in geneva 
i dont know when he said that shevardnadze said in 
russian we shall see it is better to have the document signed 
in geneva this is the better possibility

a norwegian journalist on leave from his 
newspaper to work for humanitarian organizations was killed in the 
ethiopian civil war a foreign ministry spokesman said today 
viggo gilberg of the newspaper fredrikstad blad apparently was 
killed last week when the eritrean popular liberation front 
attacked the city of afabet ministry spokesman lasse seim said 
afabet is 95 miles north of asmara the provincial capital of 
eritrea 
the rebels have been fighting for independence for eritrea since 
1962 when it was incorporated as a province of ethiopia 
the eritrean popular liberation front said it crushed three 
infantry divisions of government troops and captured three soviet 
advisers in what it described as its biggest victory in the war 
soviet officials in moscow said tuesday that the eritrean 
separatists had taken three soviet military advisers prisoner last 
week and that a fourth soviet was missing 
gilberg 31 was working for the star of hope and the eritrean 
relief association when he was caught in the fighting the national 
ntb news agency reported

medicines and blankets into a war zone where he knew there had been 
fighting recently the agency said 
seim said news of gilbergs death reached norway on monday from 
the eritrean relief association he said norway had no details 
about the situation and could not confirm the circumstances of the 
journalists death 
norways nearest diplomatic mission is in nairobi 
ntb said gilberg had visited africa several times before 
including a recent visit to mali to report about relief work there

a west virginia university professor 
who worked as a consultant for caterpillar co had his students spy 
on competitors of two caterpillar dealerships but a school 
official says theres no evidence the assignment was made to help 
the professors work 
i think inappropriate things were asked of them i think they 
were in an uncomfortable situation and responded in an unfortunate 
manner provost frank franz said tuesday 
two groups of graduate students in marketing 321 polled 
competitors of ho penn machinery co in armonk ny and yancey 
bros in atlanta both caterpillar dealers according to tuesdays 
wall street journal 
the students obtained inventory and sales volume reports and 
even new product information from competitors and gave the data to 
the caterpillar dealerships according to the report 
the aim of the assignment according to instructor terry wilson 
was to give students a firsthand taste of the ethical issues 
involved in industrial espionage 
theyll be facing these issues every day of their career they 
have to learn to deal with them i tell them to think through the 
tradeoffs wilson told the journal 
however he said his students no longer will be assigned similar 
projects 
franz said there was no evidence the students surveys were 
conducted to help wilsons consulting work 
its not clear from the article that theres any action that 
professor wilson took that was inappropriate he said 
wilson wont be disciplined said cyril logar dean of the 
college of business and economics because he taught students about 
the ethical considerations involved in the project including 
confidentiality before the students began their work although 
they still broke the rules so to speak 
i thought i was doing them a favor said ho penn machinery 
marketing manager milton long who helped direct students about 
what to ask whom 
the students identified themselves only as university students 
during the surveys and promised some dealerships that their 
identities would remain confidential the journal said 
however there was pressure at ho penn for students to 
name the competing dealerships and that information was provided 
one of the students mark wheatley told the wall street journal 
it makes me shudder to think about it he said 
long denied obtaining confidential information from the students 
wilson said he told his students to reveal who the information 
was being gathered for but only if those being surveyed asked 
and he said students should have known on their own not to divulge 
confidential information 
one of the businessmen surveyed said business owners let their 
guard down when dealing with college students allowing them to get 
information not ordinarily available 
thats not ethical in my mind said alan stith at the 
atlantabased stith equipment co

hungry families flocked to relief 
centers nationwide and food grew scarce in the third day of a 
general strike to oust gen manuel antonio noriega the military 
strongman again rejected a us call for him to go into exile 
panamanians by the tens of thousands stayed off their jobs today 
and noriegas opponents hailed the success of the work stoppage 
predicting it would continue until the general leaves the country 
were in this to the end said pierre legnadier one of the 
leaders of a coalition of business professional labor and 
political groups that called the strike 
but noriega appeared unwilling to step down 
i am a panamanian not a gringo noriega said tuesday after 
meeting with a small group of union supporters let the world 
know we are fighting the ultimate battle for dignity and against 
colonialism 
an estimated 90 percent of offices and industries were shut by 
the strike on tuesday most shops and stores were closed public 
transportation was halted and many government employees did not go 
to work 
panamanians today prepared to bury the first person to die in a 
wave of protests against the military strongman and opposition 
leaders warned of more clashes at the funeral 
the united states is using economic pressure against noriega 
withholding payments for use of the panama canal and freezing 
panamanian accounts in us banks to starve the government of the 
dollars it uses as its currency 
the government must meet several major payrolls by the end of 
the month including that of the 15000strong defense forces 
which noriega heads 
between the cash crunch and the strike the latest in a series 
of walkouts that began last summer to protest noriegas alleged 
corruption food has grown scarce 
eric arturo delvalle who was removed as president feb 26 after 
trying to fire noriega appealed for international food aid tuesday 
i am very concerned and fear for the health and lives of many 
panamanians delvalle said in a videotaped message from hiding 
the united states still recognizes him as panamas president 
relief officials said that more and more hungry families some 
of whom have not eaten in five or six days were flocking to 
emergency centers around the country and port workers said they 
had run out of food for their union members but voted to stay on 
strike 
opposition leaders scheduled a funeral today for a man who died 
after being hit with a shotgun blast in violent antinoriega 
protests last week it was the first fatality of the monthlong 
crisis that began after us grand juries in florida indicted 
noriega on charges of trafficking in colombian cocaine 
opposition leaders say the funeral and the arrival of an exiled 
oppositon leader could provoke confrontations with noreigas 
forces the head of the opposition christian democractic party 
ricardo arias calderon was scheduled to arrive from miami on 
thursday with a group of central american legislators 
noriegas government refused to let arias calderon come home 
from a trip after the crisis began 
in washington president reagan said tuesday that we feel 
noriega should leave panama 
last week noriega turned down a us plan for him to leave 
panama and live in spain reagan adminstration officials said they 
had offered to fly the general family members and friends into 
exile 
on monday the general said he would resign before next years 
presidential elections if the opposition would agree to a vaguely 
defined national dialogue the opposition scoffed at the offer and 
vowed to keep up the strike 
the strength of the strike is increasing jose mulino an 
attorney and leader of national civic crusade the opposition 
coalition said tuesday 
state department spokesman charles redman said the opposition 
rejection of noreigas offer was a clear message the strongman 
should resign 
the message from panama is clear he said for the good of 
panama noriega should leave

californias boalt hall law school to protest the lack of women and 
minority tenured faculty members ended in the arrest of 28 law 
students 
the students occupied dean jesse chopers office for most of the

the 28 students were cited and released tuesday evening after 
being taken into custody by campus police for investigation of 
trespassing

diversified faculty which organized the protest

in tenured faculty positions a woman in a halftime tenured law 
phd program and several other women and minorities in 
nontenured acting professor posts 
choper said the law school has been making its best effort to

a man who suffers from parkinsons disease 
can keep 20956 the social security administration said it 
overpaid him ruled a magistrate who noted the government spent 
more pursuing the case than it could have won 
it is ludicrous that the government has caused thousands of 
dollars of government attorney and court time to be expended during 
the time of a federal deficit crisis over a sum that is minimal 
to all but the plaintiff wrote us magistrate floyd boline 
gary bohnsack 44 of minneapolis was notified in april 1986 
that he had been overpaid supplemental security income benefits 
because he had received interest on a 950 burial account his only 
asset twice yearly the account earns 40 interest 
it was like i was penalized for being poor bohnsack 
disabled since age 10 said tuesday 
the case got stuck in a bureaucratic maze said sara 
morrissey a lawyer who worked on bohnsacks case for the legal aid 
society all bohnsack wanted to do is leave enough money to 
bury him 
eventually the government decided to drop the case but then 
bohnsack wanted a ruling on whether he could accumulate the 
interest in the burial account and the case continued 
bolines ruling monday dealt with a narrow interpretation of a 
section of the act governing supplemental income payments health 
and human services secretary otis bowen had taken the position that 
the interest on a burial account even if it accumulated rather 
than being paid to the individual was considered income when the 
recipient had no other resources 
in his ruling boline said it was clear congress intended burial 
funds and interest accrued on the accounts to be excluded from 
consideration as a resource the regulation since has been changed 
to conform with that position 
lawyers for the health and human services department said they 
could not comment on the ruling or why the case was pursued

the supreme court today dismissed a medicaid 
dispute between the reagan administration and california that the 
justices had been studying for over a year 
the court said recent action by congress has made the case 
legally irrelevant 
federal authorities had sought to limit state power to ease 
eligibilty for medicaid a combined federal and state program of 
medical assistance to the needy 
the california legislature decided in 1983 that aged and 
disabled medicaid recipients were unable to afford necessary 
medical care as well as other necessities under the programs 
existing income standards 
so the legislature increased from 544 to 709 the income adult 
couples may keep each month for nonmedical needs and still qualify 
for medicaid 
federal authorities had said the amount was illegally high 
in an unsigned opinion today the high court noted that a law 
recently enacted by congress required the secretary of health 
and human services to approve the proposed california amendment 
retroactively to the date of its proposal 
the court also noted that lawyers for california and the 
administration agree that these developments have rendered the 
controversy moot 
the case is bowen vs kizer 86863

countries with democrats abroad organizations and large american 
populations including israel france and canada

soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev today called 
for a transformation of the countrys inefficient agricultural 
system led by farms owned by farmers not by the state 
gorbachev in an address to a national congress of collective 
farmers at the kremlin said the possibilities of cooperatives were 
a brilliant discovery of soviet founder vladimir i lenin that 
have been underused by subsequent soviet leaders 
we should revive coops not in their old often too primitive 
forms but in the form of a modern highstandard cooperative 
movement gorbachev said 
collective farms where members jointly own farm buildings and 
machinery and share in earnings have faded in importance in recent 
years in favor of state farms where farmers like employees in a 
factory receive a basic wage 
there were 33000 collective farms in the soviet union in 1970 
but their number dropped to 26300 by 1986 in that same period 
the number of collective farmers dropped from 167 million to 126 
million 
gorbachev has been striving to persuade soviets to enter into 
cooperative ventures to make up for shortages in the staterun 
economy since reforms instituted last year nearly 14000 
cooperatives have sprung up to offer restaurant services pump gas 
make clothes and provide other goods and services in short supply 
a draft of a new law on cooperatives published earlier this 
month in the soviet press specifically prohibits government 
interference in their affairs but also forsees a progressive tax 
system to catch what gorbachev has called moneygrabbing 
gorbachev in remarks at the farmers congress summarized by 
tass said the new law aims to ensure the enhancement and 
development of cooperative and collectivefarm property and 
create legal machinery to protect cooperative democracy 
the summary of gorbachevs speech distributed by the official 
soviet news agency did not give any indication whether gorbachev 
would move give land to individual farmers 
tass said the cooperative law would be a main item of discussion 
at the threeday session of collective farmers it is the first 
such conference since 1969 
according to tass gorbachev said it was the cooperative 
movement that helped in many ways to overcome hunger and economic 
dislocation in the aftermath of the civil war mend the financial 
and monetary systems and get people more closely involved with the 
building of a new life 
gorbachev said his reemphasis on cooperatives is a result of 
greater democracy in soviet society and an important lever for 
furthering the democratic process and combatting administration by 
fiat and red tape 
soviet agriculture has been plagued by central planners who tell 
farms what and how much to plant lack of incentives for farmers to 
work the stateowned land inefficient production and poor storage 
and transportation facilities

the 3100 us troops dispatched to honduras 
as a warning to neighboring nicaragua are expected to return home 
next monday and tuesday pentagon officials said today 
the officials who insisted on anonymity described the 
withdrawal schedule as still tentative and subject to lastminute 
changes depending upon developments in the region 
but we said about 10 days for exercises and thats what it 
should be another source said 
the officials noted the soldiers had been airlifted to honduras 
over the course of two days last week and said that same procedure 
would be followed for the withdrawal 
four battalions two from the 82nd airborne division at fort 
bragg nc and two from the 7th light infantry division at fort 
ord calif were airlifted to honduras on march 17 and 18 after 
nicaraguan soldiers crossed the honduran border in pursuit of 
usbacked contra guerrillas 
the reagan administration insisted from the beginning that the 
us soldiers would be kept away from the scene of the fighting 
but said the deployment was necessary to demonstrate americas 
commitment to honduras and democracy in the region

police announced today they 
were abandoning a policy of staying away from ira funerals because 
five people including two british soldiers were killed during 
funerals last week 
protestant activists had demanded that police reinstitute the 
policy of clamping tight security on ira funerals 
describing the ira threat as deadly a police statement 
indicated security chiefs will order heavy police and troop 
presence at future ira funerals 
experience has shown that maintenance of the law and 
prevention of outrages will only be guaranteed through the firm 
presence of the police and army a statement from the royal 
ulster constabulary headquarters said 
the statement marked the swift collapse of a policy introduced 
under pressure from moderate roman catholic leaders in the hope of 
avoiding clashes 
at the first unpoliced ira funeral march 16 a protestant 
guerrilla launched a firearms and grenade attack from behind a 
tombstone in the catholic milltown cemetery killing three people 
and wounded 68 
at the ira funeral saturday for one milltown victim two british 
soldiers drove up to the funeral cortege in an unmarked car were 
brutally slain 
in britain prime minister margaret thatcher joined grieving 
relatives at northolt air base north of london where the bodies of

american troops will stay in 
honduras to complete emergency training exercises even though 
honduras says its border crisis with nicaragua is over a us 
military spokesman here said 
in washington pentagon officials who requested anonymity said 
the defense department was planning to withdraw the troops on 
monday and tuesday 
president reagan ordered 3200 american troops to honduras last 
week after nicaraguan soldiers allegedly penetrated honduran 
territory in pursuit of ussupported contra rebels 
on tuesday president jose azcona hoyo told the associated press 
that sandinista troops had retreated and the american military 
contingent will leave honduras very soon 
us military spokesman maj gary hovatter on tuesday said the 
soldiers first will finish their training exercises 
right now the plans are to make it a 10 to 14day exercise 
we have not received any directive as to when to begin 
redeployment he said adding the exercises were taking place 
tuesday at four sites 
in washington a pentagon source stressed the withdrawal 
schedule was still tentative and subject to change depending 
upon future developments in the region 
but we said about 10 days for exercises and thats what it 
should be another source said 
the officials noted the soldiers had been airlifted to honduras 
over the course of two days last week and said that same procedure 
would be followed for the withdrawal 
foreign minister carlos lopez contreras on tuesday said the 
border tension has virtually disappeared after both the 
sandinistas and the contras suspended hostilities and began truce 
talks in southern nicaragua 
some us soldiers expressed frustration on tuesday that they 
had not been allowed to join the fighting along the border 
they get you all hepped up and then theres nothing to do 
said pfc jose pena 23 of scottsdale ariz who was rushed in 
last week as part of what the white house called a measured 
response to the crisis 
most of us were hoping to get a little action he said at 
palmerola air base headquarters for us military operations 
one soldier said he came prepared for anything 
they told us it was a training exercise but if things got hot 
and heavy it was time for our training to kick in said spec 4 
duane mccarty a 25yearold helicopter mechanic from novi mich 
the deployment of the us troops bolstered the american 
military presence in honduras to about 6000 servicemen the reagan 
administration billed it as both a show of support for azcona and a 
warning to the sandinistas against further actions in the border 
region 
the united states has been carrying out joint exercises with the 
honduran military periodically for five years as part of the reagan 
administrations policy of isolating the sandinistas

nobel laureate elie wiesel a nazi death 
camp survivor who lectures on the holocaust canceled an appearance 
here after learning his fee would come from a grant by a 
conservative publisher once accused of being an agent of south 
africa 
wiesel had been scheduled as a speaker today at the john mcgoff 
distinguished lecture series at northern michigan university 
but mcgoffs reported links to the south african government and 
the universitys plans to pay wiesels fee from a 300000 grant 
from mcgoff brought protests from the schools faculty 
when it comes to apartheid you cannot make compromises 
wiesel said in explaining his decision 
philosophy professor james green who led the protests said 
wiesel said he would have declined to appear had he known mcgoffs 
money was being used to pay for his appearance 
mcgoff former chairman of the northern michigan university 
board of control was accused by the securities and exchange 
commission of illegally using south african money to try to buy 
us newspapers and lobby on behalf of the south african government 
mcgoff has denied acting as an agent for the south african 
government and the charges were dismissed 
mcgoff whose telephone number in williamston is unlisted could 
not be reached for comment today 
green said the university faculty voted to disassociate itself 
from the mcgoff lecture series friday the faculty voted 8262 
against using 3000 from faculty funds to finance wiesels talk 
green said faculty members asked the university for assurances 
that none of the mcgoff money to be used for wiesels lecture came 
from south africa but the university never provided such an 
assurance 
jim carter news director at the university said today the 
university received word late tuesday from the harry walker agency 
in new york city that wiesels appearance had been canceled 
we are making no further statement to that effect carter 
said declining to answer questions about how the cancellation came 
about 
wiesel said some faculty members had urged him to use the 
lecture as a forum to denounce apartheid which by law and custom 
establishes a racially segregated society in which the 26 million 
blacks have no vote in national affairs 
the 5 million south african whites control the economy and 
maintain separate districts schools and health services 
when it comes to mass humiliation a compromise is already 
playing the other sides game and what is apartheid but collective 
humiliation furhtermore it is legal humiliation said wiesel 
in south africa humiliation is the law of the land

the senate foreign relations committee today 
defeated the first attempt by sen jesse helms rnc to change 
the ussoviet treaty banning mediumrange nuclear missiles 
the democraticcontrolled panel voted 123 against helms 
amendment which would allow nonnuclear us cruise missiles to be 
deployed in europe 
the pact signed dec 8 by president reagan and soviet leader 
mikhail s gorbachev bans missiles of ranges from 300 to 3400 
miles the prohibition includes cruise missiles both 
nucleartipped and those armed with nonnuclear weapons 
the ban covers both types of missiles because theres no way 
to verify the distinction between the two said sen alan 
cranston dcalif 
but helms said the ban means the conventional imbalance in 
europe will be even greater than it is now because nato will lose 
a major weapon in the cruise missile 
cranston responded that the pentagon has no plans to build 
nonnuclear cruise missiles 
the vote came on the first of 43 pending amendments or 
reservations either to the treaty text or the resolution by which 
the senate would register its approval of the pact 
of those amendments 36 were proposed by helms the committees 
ranking republican and the chief opponent of the treaty three more 
were offered by sen larry pressler rsd who has also been 
critical of the pact 
sen claiborne pell dri the chairman of the committee told 
his colleagues that he intends to oppose all reservations 
conditions etc with the possible exception of amendments 
designed to solve a longrunning fight between the reagan 
administration and congress over treaty intepretation 
helms said today the committee shouldnt be a rubber stamp 
for the administration which has urged approval of the treaty 
without changes 
both democratic and republican leaders predict overwhelming 
ratification when the treaty reaches the senate floor and say only 
10 or 12 senators are likely to vote against it ratification 
requires a twothirds vote of the 100member senate 
i dont intend to obstruct the committees work on the 
treaty helms told his colleagues tuesday but he added im 
concerned that were about to rush to judgment 
given the large number of amendments pell said the panel now 
seems very unlikely to meet its original goal of finishing work 
by friday 
sen richard lugar rind told helms if you dont have the 
votes and you simply try to overload it with amendments that isnt 
fair 
most of helms amendments are designed to improve what he says 
are compliance verification problems and clear up ambiguities 
the majority of helms proposals would amend the ratification 
resolution which would not require new negotiations with the 
soviet union 
any change made by the senate in the actual text of the treaty 
would have to be accepted by the soviet union and administration 
officials have urged the senate to avoid socalled killer 
amendments that would cause the soviets to reject new talks 
the treaty requires the elimination of nucleararmed missiles 
with a range of 300 miles to 3400 miles and includes onsite 
inspection provisions among its verification system which is the 
most intrusive in arms control history 
the foreign relations committee heard endorsements of the pact 
tuesday from two other committees intelligence and armed services 
which had also looked at the treaty during the past two months 
but the congressional debate over the treaty has been clouded by 
the reopening of a long fight between the democraticcontrolled 
congress and the white house 
the complicated legal fight involves the question of whether an 
administration has the legal right to unilaterally change how the 
united states interprets a treaty reagan asserts the 
administration has such a right but sen sam nunn dga chairman 
of the armed services committee and other legislators have 
disagreed 
the fight involves the 1972 antiballistic missile treaty but 
it has spilled over into the debate on the intermediaterange 
nuclear forces treaty nunn told the foreign relations committee 
nunn said letters written by white house counsel arthur b 
culvahouse jr effectively undercut previous assurances from 
secretary of state george p shultz that administration testimony 
on the new pact is authoritative 
nunn said culvahouse asserted that some administration responses 
may be less authoritative than others 
culvahouse suggested that the testimony of a secretary of state 
may be more authoritative than that of other administration 
witnesses or responses in writing to questions by members of 
congress nunn said 
culvahouse has since issued a second letter asserting that his 
original remarks were not inconsistent with the shultz statement 
but nunn said he finds that unacceptable 
nunn said the new letter puts the shultz statement in the 
trashcan saying that certain testimony is not to be taken 
seriously 
the dispute should be resolved by the full senate instead of 
seeking another letter from the administration even from the 
president said nunn 
sen alan cranston dcalif said the dispute is the major 
stumbling block and could create grave perils if we dont resolve 
it

consumer prices restrained by lower food and 
energy costs rose a modest 02 percent in february the government 
said today in a report that shows inflation remains tame 
food prices fell 03 percent after rising 03 percent in 
january energy costs which had fallen 07 percent in the 
preceding month fell 06 percent last month 
presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater hailed the report and 
one showing that the nations gross national product had risen 48 
percent in the last quarter of 1987 as more good news on the 
economic front the economy is doing well the reagan miracle 
holds 
so far this year consumer prices have been increasing at a rate 
of 32 percent that compares to the moderate 44 percent rate for 
all of 1987 and the scant 11 percent 1986 increase 
some economists suggested that last months moderate food and 
energy cost hikes may be masking hefty increases for other goods 
and services 
subtracting these two volatile categories however the index 
for all other goods and services also advanced 02 percent in 
february after a 05 percent increase in january when prices 
overall rose 03 percent 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
a restrained consumer price index had been expected since the 
labor department reported that the companion producer price index 
also restrained by moderating energy and food prices had dipped 
02 percent in february 
the department gave these other specifics on february retail 
price activity 
grocery store prices fell 06 percent after a 02 percent rise 
in the previous month restaurant meals were up 03 percent the 
same as in january 
pacing the drop in food prices was a 40 percent fall in the 
costs of fruits and vegetables more than offsetting 04 percent 
rise for meats poultry and fish 
gasoline prices fell 17 percent down for the third month in a 
row gasoline prices had fallen 17 percent in december and 16 
percent in january 
heating oil prices were up 06 percent while the cost of 
natural gas and electricity rose 05 percent 
new automobile prices rose 03 percent 
clothing prices fell 03 percent 
alchoholic beverage prices rose 09 percent

last months 02 percent gain was equivalent to an annual 
inflation rate of 21 percent 
the february increase left the overall index at 1160 meaning 
that a hypothetical selection of goods costing 100 during a 
198284 base period would have cost 11600 last month 
unlike other figures in the report the overall index is not 
adjusted for seasonal fluctuations 
the labor department recently changed its base period had the 
former computation been used the february consumer price index 
would have been 3474 compared to a 1967 base of 100 
that means that the same selection of goods would have cost 
1300 more last month than in february 1987 when the cpi was 
3344

unexpectedly brisk economic activity is raising some economists 
concerns that inflation may pick up in the months ahead 
particularly as import prices rise further under pressure from a 
dollar that is now 50 percent weaker against key foreign currencies 
than it was three years ago 
a weaker dollar makes imports more expensive higher prices 
particularly for japanese and european products have been noticed 
on store shelves in recent months as a result of these 
exchangerate movements 
this is good for the us trade deficit because as imports get 
more expensive us goods become cheaper and more competitive 
overseas but analysts have long warned that any sustained increase 
in import prices could fuel overall higher inflation 
adding to worries about inflation was the february unemployment 
report showing that the jobless rate fell to 57 percent the best 
performance since l979 
as unemployment declines below a certain level pressure builds 
for higher wages to fill vacant jobs economists disagree on the 
exact level 
federal reserve board chairman alan greenspan told congress last 
week that he felt that inflation could be rekindled if unemployment 
fell another 05 percentage points 
i dont think inflation will be a problem probably for the 
whole year but the bond markets are worried said michael k 
evans president of a private economic consulting service

the reagan administration and house speaker 
jim wright said today reports of progress at ceasefire talks in 
nicaragua are encouraging and democratic leaders said agreement 
there likely would trigger a new package of strictly 
humanitarian aid for the contra rebels 
we want to be cautious but we are encouraged by the talks 
said white house spokesman marlin fitzwater they do seem to be 
making progress he said adding that was somewhat surprising 
in view of previous actions by the sandinistas 
we hope these talks succeed fitzwater said 
it is my earnest hope that we can obtain a bipartisan 
agreement on humanitarian aid so that the bill can be scheduled 
quickly wright dtexas told reporters that is the best way 
to encourage the peacemakers in central america 
house majority whip tony coelho dcalif said such a bill 
could be approved next week if the ceasefire talks in their third 
day in sapoa nicaragua bear fruit and if aid would be consistent 
with whatever agreement is reached by the contras and the managua 
government 
senate majority leader robert byrd dwva said it was time 
that there be a ceasefire between the congress and the white 
house on the issue but said he had no plans to bring an aid bill 
before the senate 
wright indicated that an aid proposal being advanced by rep 
buddy mackay dfla one of the swing votes on the contra 
issue would likely be acceptable to house leaders 
mackay said he and other centrist house members who have 
traditionally determined the outcome on the polarized issue of aid 
to the rebels were left skittish by last weeks incursion of 
nicaraguan troops into neighboring honduras in an effort to attack 
contra supply camps 
it had an impact on all of us mackay said in an interview 
tuesday the sandinista military action on the eve of renewed 
ceasefire talks with the contras was a reminder that relying on 
their good faith is just not realistic mackay added 
all we are trying to say is that leaving the situation as it 
is is unacceptable he said 
the compromise bill still being drafted tuesday was similar to 
a package put together last week by senate backers of the rebels 
it contained a oneyear 48 million infusion of humanitarian 
aid to include food clothing shelter and medicine it also would 
authorize the central intelligence agency to deliver existing 
supplies of weapons 
but in contrast to the senate version mackays would permit 
president reagan to call for an expedited vote on new aid for the 
rebels if peace talks break down but not to dictate the terms of 
the aid package it would be up to congress to decide what kind of 
aid to send he said 
mackay said he expected to formally introduce the package this 
week and hoped to have about half a dozen other moderates join him 
he said the effort is not intended to be a challenge to house 
speaker jim wright dtexas republicans have accused wright of 
using his scheduling powers to bottle up any aid bill that goes 
beyond a strictly humanitarian package democrats offered earlier 
this month but which was defeated 
president reagan on tuesday appealed to house republicans in a 
closeddoor meeting to unite behind a new aid bill but did not 
specify which provisions he would support 
we are determined to get continued assistance to the 
resistance and if we stick together this time well make it 
reagan told the lawmakers according to a white house transcript 
he also said democrats would be to blame if the contras are 
extinguished by the leftist nicaraguan government 
democrats insisted the republicans were responsible for the 
narrow house defeat of a package of strictly humanitarian aid 
on march 3 
what were seeing is a public relations campaign here said 
rep tony coelho dcalif the republicans are very nervous about 
it because the fingers pointed right at them 
a poll published in todays editions of the washington post 
found that 40 percent of the people surveyed support aid to the 
contras while 56 percent oppose it the support figure in the 
washington postabc news poll is the highest since 43 percent on 
july 15 1987 a day after lt col oliver north the indicted 
former white house aide testified before a congressional committee 
the survey completed monday also found 55 percent to 43 
percent disapproval of reagans decision to send the troops to 
honduras pollsters interviewed 1007 randomly chosen adults in the 
continental united states by telephone the poll had a margin of 
error of 4 points 
the rebels released a television advertisement to begin airing 
this week that makes a direct appeal to us viewers for 
contributions 
your congress abandoned us ernesto palazio a washington 
lobbyist for the rebels says somberly in the spot we have 
nowhere to turn but to individual americans like you 
the spot which asks for money for medicine blankets and food 
for our families and children was to begin running this week in 
washington charlotte nc and wrights home town of fort worth

a man whose exwife went to jail rather than 
let him see their children surrendered to authorities today after 
being indicted on a charge of sexually assaulting his daughter 
mark russell murabito 33 of derry was awaiting arraignment in 
rockingham county superior court after turning himself in to the 
county sheriff 
a grand jury indicted murabito on a charge of felonious sexual 
assault against his daughter now 5 years old county attorney 
carleton eldredge said tuesday 
eldredge said the indictment was based upon a course of 
conduct since march 1987 when a superior court judge found no 
evidence to back jesse murabitos allegations that her husband 
molested their daughter 
eldredge did not elaborate on the indictment as a condition of 
bail eldredge said he will ask that murabito be barred from seeing 
his children 
in his 19page divorce decree last march judge douglas gray 
admonished both parents to stop tearing the children to 
pieces and granted murabito unsupervised visitation with the 
girl and her brother now 3 
murabitos lawyer raymond kellett said tuesday his client will 
plead innocent to any such charges it is evident that mrs 
murabito will do anything and everything to keep the children from 
mr murabito kellett said 
mrs murabito said tuesday the case is not murabito versus 
murabito this is the state of new hampshire versus mr murabito 
she declined further comment 
the indictment is a turning point in mrs murabitos nearly 
twoyear struggle to convince the courts and child welfare 
officials that her exhusband was molesting their daughter 
gray could not be reached for comment tuesday evening there was 
no home telephone listing in new hampshire under his name 
in february 1987 gray jailed mrs murabito now 39 after she 
hid the children in defiance of a court order to let her husband 
see the children during supervised visits 
a week later he released her after she agreed to allow 
supervised visits pending a hearing 
in the subsequent order of march 20 1987 in which murabito was 
granted unsupervised visits gray said mrs murabito and experts 
she called as witnesses during a sevenday hearing had failed to 
prove allegations that murabito sexually abused the daughter after 
mrs murabito sought a divorce in late 1985 
of course the possibility exists that the court is wrong but 
that possibility exists in any judicial factfinding process 
gray wrote but to uphold the abuse allegations would be to 
engage in blatant speculation 
gray said mrs murabitos chief witness the childrens 
psychiatrist since spring 1986 based many of her assertions on 
hearsay mrs murabito had said she contacted the psychiatrist when 
she noticed the children were losing sleep and weight and becoming 
irritable 
gray cited an evaluation of the children by a courtappointed 
psychologist as by far the more clinically neutral and detached 
the psychologist found no evidence of sexual abuse and said 
actions by the father that had been construed by others as abuse 
could be interpreted otherwise

the reagan administration today condemned the 
reported use of chemical weapons by iraq that iran says killed or 
wounded 5000 people in kurdish border cities last week 
we condemn the use of chemical warfare and the gas use by 
anybody anywhere anytime said white house spokesman marlin 
fitzwater 
referring to television broadcasts fitzwater said i saw 
everyone in the administration saw the same reports you saw last 
night they were horrible outrageous disgusting and should serve 
as a reminder to all countries of why chemical warfare should be 
banned 
asked if the united states would convey its reaction to baghdad 
he said our views are known to all governments 
meanwhile the international committee of the red cross also 
condemned the use of chemical weapons in the 7yearold iraniraq 
war calling it a new and tragic escalation of the conflict 
and said it had taken urgent steps to end such attacks

the soviet government today ignored armenian 
demands for annexation of a predominantly armenian section of a 
neighboring republic and called for efforts to improve social and 
economic conditions in the area 
a session of the presidium of the national supreme soviet 
called after carefully orchestrated appeals by 13 soviet republics 
made no reference to the armenian demands 
the resolution today appeared to be a definitive response from 
the kremlin leadership to the demands regarding the 
nagornokarabakh region of the republic of azerbaijan 
armenian activists want the region united with armenia 
the presidium ordered the soviet council of ministers to work 
out all measures directed at deciding the immediate economic and 
socialcultural development of the nagornokarabakh autonomous 
region 
soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev and other top leaders 
participated in the meeting it called on officials of armenian and 
azerbaijan to bring to strict accountability those who with their 
actions destabilized the situation 
that statement appeared to indicate authorities would take 
action not only against those who have been arrested for violence 
in ethnic rioting that killed at least 32 people but also armenian 
activists 
earlier a moscow dissident said soviet authorities had sent 
back to armenia an activist who had been giving foreign journalists 
information about the ethnic unrest between aremanians and 
azerbaijanis 
alexander ogorodnikov a former political prisoner said 
armenian nationalist paryur arikyan was put on a plane for yerevan 
the armenian capital at 130 am 
he said calls to armenian activists in yerevan today indicated 
that arikyan had arrived from moscow 
another dissident source tamara grigoryants told the 
associated press on tuesday that police arrested arikyan in central 
moscow after he met with a western television journalist 
thousands of armenians protested last month for approval to 
annex nagornokarabakh 
on feb 28 rioting broke out in sumgait a city of azerbaijan 
in which officials say 32 people were killed 
armenian activists say at least 78 armenians were killed by 
azerbaijanis in sumgait 
arikyan who said he spent 17 years in jail for armenian 
nationalist activities arrived in moscow from yerevan last week 
and held news conferences for foreign journalists at ogorodnikovs 
apartment 
he said saturday that officials had confiscated his internal 
passport so he had traveled to moscow via soviet georgia and the 
russian city of tula to escape detection 
the tass news agency meanwhile announced the governments of 13 
soviet republics had addressed the violence in the republics of 
armenia and azerbaijan 
tass said the supreme soviets of kazakhstan lithuania 
moldavia latvia kirghizia tadzhikistan turkmenia and estonia 
passed resolutions calling for discretion and composure and at 
the same time for issuing a decisive rebuff to any illegitimate 
actions 
that followed a tass report tuesday that the russian federation 
and the republics of ukraine byelorussia georgia and uzbekistan 
had passed similar resolutions and urged the national supreme 
soviet to take action 
such concerted action by those 13 republics equal under the 
soviet constitution to armenia and azerbaijan was very unusual and 
almost certainly orchestrated by communist party authorities 
the government calls for action also came as the communist party 
newspaper pravda and the government newspaper izvestia ran 
articles sharply criticizing armenian activists 
pravdas article monday charging that the annexation campaign 
had a clear antisocialist spirit sparked a protest in yerevan 
the pravda journalist whose name was one of three attached to the 
article disassociated himself from it in a telegram to the papers 
editor

murray police sgt bill brusik said steven paul mack was taken 
into custody about 10 pm tuesday after police stopped him in his 
car about half a mile from his home in this salt lake city suburb 
mack a convicted forger and burglar who served two prison terms 
and was paroled in 1985 was being held without bail today in salt 
lake county jail on a felony homicide warrant issued in sacramento 
calif 
brusik said sacramento detectives were expected to arrive today 
to question mack and begin extradition proceedings

the senate refused today to limit debate on a 
bill that would require the government to individually warn 
thousands of workers each year that they face a high risk of cancer 
and other diseases from exposure to dangerous chemicals and other 
substances in their jobs 
in a key test vote democratic supporters of the housepassed 
legislation could muster only 33 of the 60 senate votes necessary 
to limit debate on the measure to 30 hours before an upordown 
vote on its passage 
sen howard metzenbaum dohio the primary senate author of the 
legislation offered today to accept amendments expanding 
exemptions for small businesses and farms in an effort to pick up 
more support in anticipation of another vote scheduled friday on 
cutting off debate 
the bills proponents had filed motions to limit the debate as 
soon the measure was brought to the senate floor on tuesday after 
republican and business opponents made it clear they would try to 
prevent a vote on the bill itself through the use of a filibuster 
ending a filibuster requires 60 votes while final passage of a 
bill requires only a simple majority or 51 votes if all 100 
senators are present 
sen orrin hatch rutah the leader of the opponents said 
metzenbaums willingness to whittle the bill down until he gets 
engouh votes to pass it demonstrates the problems with the 
legislation 
if its good enough for one its good enough for all hatch 
said the overwhelming majority of the business community opposes 
this bill business groups that support it hatch said have 
worked out exemptions for themselves to the exclusion of everybody 
else 
among the business supporters of the bill are the chemical 
manufacturers association the american electronics association and 
dozens of the nations largest companies including general 
electric ibm and atlantic richfield most already have their own 
worker notification programs 
opponents include the reagan administration the national 
association of manufacturers and the us chamber of commerce 
the bill would establish an agency in the department of health 
and human services to determine which workers are most at risk the 
national institute of occupational safety and health would then be 
required to send individual notices to between 100000 and 300000 
of them every year and employers would be required to provide 
medical monitoring programs for them 
the national association of manufacturers and other opponents 
claim that the monitoring programs and the possibility of 
subsequent lawsuits by workers and former workers against their 
employers could cost businesses up to 6 billion a year

roswell nm daily record on us involvement in central

liberal congressmen are obsessively fond of comparing us 
involvement in central america with what later developed into the 
vietnam war 
the trouble is their comparison is with the wrong war 
doubledealing by nicaraguas sandinista government along with 
house leaders blindness to the reality of the central american 
conflict is more reminiscent of the preliminaries to world war ii 
like the sandinistas now nazi germany claimed it supported

keeping the contras in the field if not in nicaragua seems to

march 18 in congress only two weeks ago congress couldnt 
even agree on a 30 million humanitarian aid bill 
the sandinista raid into honduras will probably turn around

daniel ortega has a history of snatching diplomatic defeat from 
the jaws of victory after a previous contra aid vote he flew off 
to moscow this time he decided on military action 
but president reagan wont get a free ride just by dispatching 
3200 troops to honduras 100 miles from the war zone he ignited

the hostages are rarely allowed to communicate with the outside 
world and their captors believed to be moslem fundamentalists 
rarely come out of the shadows 
the hostages in iran were freed after 444 days but one of the 
lebanon hostages associated press newsman terry anderson has 
now been held for a full three years 
anderson isnt the only victim of lebanese kidnappers but he is

westerly ri sun on toy guns that look real 
handguns both fake and real ones are sources of concern in 
what still seems to be a triggerhappy society given the 
shocking homicide rate in this supposedly lawrespecting country 
san franciscos city supervisors following the lead of los 
angeles have just banned the sale of toy guns not easily 
distinguishable from those they imitate 
san franciscos action came after police fearing for their 
lives when a mentally retarded boy pointed a reallooking pistol at 
them shot and killed the boy 
there is no justification for the manufacturers to continue 
putting on the market accurate toy replicas of lethal weapons 
it is folly to tolerate the manufacture and sale of toys 
that can easily be mistaken for real weapons sometimes with tragic 
consequences

400 penalty against a small businessman who paid two cents less 
than he owed has rightly outraged the public 
but the nations chief tax collector irs commissioner lawrence 
b gibbs offers a different perspective one that clearly shows 
congress to be the source of a lot of the troubles between the irs 
and taxpayers 
the tax code now includes 154 statutory penalties he told 
congressional investigators noting that congress has changed the 
tax code seven times in the last 10 years and enacted a seemingly 
endless array of ad hoc penalties 
gibbs in trying to carry out an unpopular job knows that the 
whole system depends on public confidence and that wholesale 
stupidness on the part of congress is quickly eroding that 
confidence 
its enough to make one sympathize with the irs

the seattle postintelligencer on irancontra indictments 
the indictments of the principals in the irancontra affair are 
heartening evidence that the judicial system is working properly 
this is a country based on the rule of law democracy cannot 
survive if it accommodates those who put themselves above the law 
corruption in government even for an avowed noble purpose cannot 
be tolerated 
thats why those charged should stand trial to have their guilt 
or innocence determined 
it should be kept in mind in the months ahead that at issue here 
is not the political question of what ought to be the proper role 
of the united states in nicaragua the question is whether these 
men broke the law 
obtaining a judicial answer to this question is important for 
the spiritual health of the country which depends on the faith of 
its citizens in the rule of law

of pardons needs some public discussion 
the guilt or innocence of adm john poindexter lt col oliver

the record hackensack nj on sending us troops into 
honduras 
president reagans emergency airlift of 3200 troops in response 
to a supposed nicaraguan incursion into honduras is an example of 
an administration driven to desperation as a result of its 
inability to win additional aid for the contras 
at best the airlift is a splashy way of stampeding congress 
into voting the rebels additional military aid if so it would 
seem to run counter to the prevailing viewpoint of most americans 
as well as congress 
the plain fact is that the white houses nicaraguan policy has 
failed the victim of scandals ineptitude and miscalculation and 
it will take more than a war scare to bring it back to life 
instead of a military drive this seemed to be a time for 
holding the line and reducing to a minimun the chances of added 
hostilities

charleston wva daily mail on mandatory use of seat belts 
the west virginia legislature has made the use of seat belts 
mandatory its the wrong idea done the wrong way for the wrong 
reason 
yes everyone should wear seat belts when driving but it is 
outrageous to have government decree such behavior 
first theres the approach itself lawmakers are using another 
one of those rankling 25 fines to get their way 
a more appropriate method would be to lower the amount of 
damages that juries award injured parties who were not wearing seat 
belts when they were involved in an accident 
the motive was also wrong lawmakers were pushed to pass the 
bill on grounds that it would help stop the us department of 
transportation from requiring air bags on cars 
ironically west virginias law contains exemptions which keep 
it from complying with the federal criteria for such laws 
the states new seat belt law may make lawmakers feel good but 
as a practical piece of legislation its a dismal failure

marietta ga daily journal on aid to the contras 
there is no joy in being able to say we told you so 
regarding aid to the nicaraguan contras when the criminal 
misjudgment of congress may cost us thousands of american lives 
when the vote on military aid for the contra rebels fighting to 
overthrow the illegal marxist government in nicaragua came up last 
month we argued that daniel ortegas recent peaceful overtures 
were merely for show and that if congress cut off military 
assistance to the rebels ortega would quickly resume his warring 
ways and attempt to wipe out the relatively defenseless rebels 
the sandinistas have now begun to do just that 
amazingly many liberals in congress have refused to recognize 
that the man who they thought was their friend ortega has sold 
them down the river 
they cannot see that they have been used as pawns by an avowed 
communist who exploited their weaknesses to achieve a military 
advantage

panama 
the reagan administration cuts off aid and payment of canal fees 
to panama and suddenly the rule of strongman manuel noriega is 
being challenged openly and violently in the streets by his own 
people 
there is a temptation to say that the white house finally found 
the right button to push to get a rebellion started but that 
interpretation is too simplistic by far 
the banks of panama have been closed for days they arent 
expected to reopen soon a canal fee payment due last week from 
the united states is not in the mail thats a 65 million 
shortfall right there 
its a lot but a ruler who had the support of his people could 
weather that much and more but the fact is the first 
demonstrations against the noriega regime occurred in panama citys 
streets last summer 
in the year of costa rica president oscar arias nobel peace 
prize for his regional peace plan there is even less of that 
commodity in central america than usual

problem at hand and it looks increasingly as if they aim to do

sandinista and contra rebel negotiators 
resumed their ceasefire talks today closer than ever to reaching 
agreement on steps to end nicaraguas sixyear war 
but as the two sides entered the third session of talks the 
staterun voice of nicaragua radio reported a contra violation of 
the truce agreed on for the talks duration 
the broadcast said the usbacked rebels ambushed an army truck 
near mulukuku in the northern province of matagalpa at 2 pm 
tuesday killing two soldiers 
bosco matamoros a spokesman for the rebels told reporters that 
there could be isolated cases but there is a clear will from 
both sides to respect that decision for a truce 
a defense ministry spokesman in managua who spoke on condition 
of anonymity said we have no information about the report 
but we will see if we can confirm it 
the main stumbling blocks facing the third round of talks 
appeared to center on the mechanics of how the contras would lay 
down their arms and be granted amnesty on tuesday both sides 
exchanged proposals that agree on major points 
defense minister humberto ortega who heads the government 
delegation said today that he was optimistic there would be 
success in todays talks 
tuesday he said he expected a concrete agreement to emerge 
from the discussions but sources close to the talks cautioned that 
they could still stall on final details one source said the talks 
could continue beyond today 
it is like a boxing match a sandinista official who spoke 
on the condition of anonymity said tuesday they were tense 
monday and they had some sparring tuesday 
adolfo calero political leader of the ussupported contras 
described the second round of talks as direct and frank 
the two sides stood far apart at the start of the talks which 
opened monday at this border post 90 miles south of managua and 
which represented the government and rebel leaders first 
facetoface meeting in nicaragua a battlefield truce that began 
monday appeared to be holding 
in other developments a pentagon source said today american 
troops are expected to return home monday and tuesday following 
emergency training exercises in honduras 
and white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said us troops 
should begin their withdrawal over the weekend 
fitzwater also expressed cautious optimism about the talks 
they do seem to be making progress he said adding that it 
was somewhat surprising in view of previous actions by the 
sandinistas 
the sandinista proposal outlined by deputy foreign minister 
victor hugo tinoco on tuesday calls for a truce of up to 90 days 
during which the contras would lay down their weapons and join a 
national reconciliation dialogue 
for every rebel who stops fighting the government would release 
a political prisoner the sandinistas consider eligible for release 
the government is holding an estimated 3300 political prisoners 
contrary to previous sandinista demands tinoco said rebels who 
put down their arms would be free from prosecution without applying 
for amnesty and could take part in nicaraguan political life 
they would be permitted to operate uncensored newspapers 
magazines and radio stations but television would remain a 
government monopoly many press liberties were barred for almost 
six years under a stateofemergency decree 
the contra proposal calls for a 45day ceasefire and would 
provide for zones to be set up for the estimated 10000 contra 
combatants to gather while a permanent truce is negotiated 
it does not mention when the rebels would be willing to give up 
their arms 
the proposal calls for total amnesty return of political 
exiles full press freedoms a suspension of the military draft 
during the truce and incorporation of contra representatives into 
the national dialogue process 
the sandinistas called for an international commission to verify 
an end to hostilities which the government says have claimed 
26500 lives since 1981 
the sandinistas according to sources who demanded anonymity 
also want the contras to be more specific about a final ceasefire 
the government also would not be expected to give in readily to the 
contra demand for suspending the draft during a truce or for an 
immediate total amnesty 
a national dialogue as well as the ceasefire are included in 
the regional peace plan signed aug 7 by the presidents of 
nicaragua el salvador costa rica guatemla and honduras 
that plan also calls for greater democracy and an end to foreign 
aid to insurgents and the use of one countrys territory for 
attacks on another

land reform the issue that helped 
trigger a 1973 military coup has disappeared from the countrys 
political agenda as effectively as the horsedrawn plow from the 
fields 
experts say the countrys ranks of landless peasants remain 
swollen and may be worse off than they were a decade or two ago 
but social and economic changes have dulled their oncefierce 
thirst for their own acre to till 
the loss of priority is evident in declarations by civilian 
politicians pressing for an end to the 14yearold military 
government of president augusto pinochet no longer do they cry out 
for expropriation of large land holdings for distribution among the 
poor a call that once chilled the blood of wealthy farmers and 
ranchers 
a recent 91page proposal by six opposition groups for a 
transitional government to restore democracy contained not a word 
on the issue there will be no land reform during any such 
transition patricio aylwin president of the christian democratic 
party told reporters 
the young are calling for a wellpaid job rather than for 
land said emiliano ortega a santiagobased agronomist and 
social scientists they remember the experience of their fathers 
who lost their land 
the issue of land reform began sweeping latin america in the 
1950s and 1960 in chile it reached its peak under the government 
of president salvador allende a marxist elected in 1970 his 
adminstration expropriated about 16 million acres for distribution 
among 60000 peasant families some farms were directly seized by 
leftist groups 
the upheaval helped trigger a 1973 coup that installed pinochet 
commander of the army and a fierce anticommunist 
pinochet quickly gave back more than half the expropriated land 
to its original owners or new farming companies and tens of 
thousands of peasants were booted off their newly acquired plots 
powerful peasant organizations often aligned with the political 
left were dismantled 
a freemarket economic program was launched stressing 
agricultural exports to compete in world markets farmers were 
pushed to modernize with costly tractors and other machinery 
fertilizers and insecticides many made the expensive switch from 
traditional crops such as wheat and corn to more profitable 
products especially fruit 
the result has been an extraordinary agricultural boom with 
production up by about half overall and annual exports soaring from 
about 20 million in the early 1970s to more than 500 million now 
but the peasants found themselves without a secure role the 
land reform efforts and ensuing modernization destroyed the 
traditional hacienda system under which peasants worked as 
tenant farmers or farmhands with free housing in addition many 
peasants who did receive land found competition too costly and sold 
their plots 
tens of thousands turned to seasonal and migrant labor working 
eight to 16 hours a day for a monthly salary equivalent to less 
than 100 said solidarity a churchsponsored magazine on human 
rights and issues the peasant became just another laborer 
ortega said that as a result of the changes the peasant of the 
1980s is more interested in his paycheck and working conditions 
than in being given land he cant afford to cultivate 
theres been a very strong cultural change and a strong change 
in labor relations he said its not going to be like in the 
past 
before peasants lived for generations on the land now they 
dont they dont live within the farms thus they dont identify 
themselves as much with a piece of land 
ortega estimated the number of seasonal farm laborers at about 
300000 and said they will represent a powerful political force if 
given the opportunity to organize

newspapers likened government 
press restrictions to those of the soviet union and said wednesday 
the closure of a militant newspaper for blacks endangers all south 
african news media 
the closing of the new nation is a chilling reminder of the 
lengths to which the government is ready to go in its attempts to 
impose thought countrol the star of johannesburg said in an 
editorial 
after this no other newspaper is safe south africas 
largest daily declared 
home minister stoffel botha who has censorship powers under the 
emergency in effect since june 12 1986 issued a decree tuesday 
prohibiting publication of the new nation for three months 
the weekly tabloid is financed by the roman catholic church its 
editor zwelakhe sisulu has been in detention for 15 months 
botha also warned a monthly cape town community paper 
grassroots that it faces closure or prior censorship if it 
continues publishing subversive propaganda 
grassroots was the eighth paper to receive a warning the first 
step in the closure process and the new nation was the first to be 
shut down 
an editorial in the cape times said 
if the newspapers continue on traditional lines in spite of 
such warnings will they share the fate of new nation the 
censorship system seeks to achieve a compliant press on pravdalike 
lines rather than a wholesale closure of publications which would 
be embarassing and inconvenient 
if it is really felt that newspapers are fomenting revolution 
why not charge them in the courts there are laws enough 
business day a conservative johannesburg daily declared 
the decision to close new nation for three months confirms 
what has been plain for some time south africa can no longer claim 
to have a free press and in this respect as in others it has left 
the ranks of civilized nations 
in the past it was possible to argue that the press was 
restricted but free and even to make selfflattering comparisons 
with the british official secrets act this is no longer so 
it seems idle to protest at the closing of a newspaper when 
that newspapers editor zwelakhe sisulu has been in detention 
without trial for more than a year governments opponents or 
those it deems opponents are locked away indefinitely for crimes 
which cannot be defined in the law and are punished without a 
chance to rebut the charges against them 
the decision to suppress new nation rests on the ministers 
opinion that the newspaper propagated communism but neither the 
minister nor the law can define the crime for which the newspaper 
is punished radical newspapers will be circulated as they are 
in the soviet union from hand to hand 
a progovernment daily the citizen took a different view 
newspapers still report most of the news that is fit to print 
and where reporting is restricted they still in the main give a 
fair picture of what is happening it said but south africa is 
in a state of emergency the press is subjected to stringent 
restrictions 
the citzen also said however that court proceedings would have 
been better than bothas action which was taken on the 
recommendations of a faceless panel of socalled experts exercising 
judgments that are personal based on no specific criteria or 
guidelines and cannot be tested in a court of law

a radio program which bills itself as the 
voice of indian america is fighting to survive as the only 
nationally broadcast native american news program its founder says 
first person radio is heard on 35 stations in 13 states 
down from 52 stations in 26 states said laura waterman wittstock 
and financial troubles for public radio have clouded the programs 
future she said 
were sort of passengers in a sinking ship so to speak 
because the indianowned radio stations are in equally distressed 
situations wittstock said recently 
the halfhour weekly news and commentary program is produced by 
migizi communications an 11yearold nonprofit organization 
based in minneapolis migizi is ojibwe for eagle 
the eagle symbolizes messages and also its a symbol of high 
standard wittstock said we wanted to have the highest 
standards of indian journalism to train more indians into 
journalism and to develop a national news service 
and the show enables indians around the country to feel a part 
of a community in southern alabama it serves 1859 members of the 
poarch band of creek indians 
were the only reservation in alabama the cultural exchange 
is really important said dale gehman a creek indian who is 
general manager of wasgam in atmore ala i dont know what wed 
do without it 
alaska public radio offers separate stories about indians which 
are distributed by national public radio but not in the format of 
a regular broadcast program according to npr 
correspondents in new mexico and idaho regularly file stories to 
give first person radio a national flavor wittstock said but 
affiliated stations have been unable to offer many stories because 
they are also struggling and have little time left over to make 
contributions she said 
the 80s have been disastrous for radio not just indian 
radio she said adding that interest in sponsoring minority 
radio programs has lost favor to shows with mass appeal 
so why do wittstock and dale means the shows program adviser 
struggle to keep first person radio on the air 
i feel there is a market for indian programming but nobody is 
doing it said means brother of former american indian movement 
leader russell means dale means helped start kilifm on the pine 
ridge indian reservation in south dakota that went on the air in 
1983 to mark the 10th anniversary of the wounded knee occupation 
early on kili and migizi which received promotional support 
from the american indian movement were criticized within the 
indian community because of that association means said 
it wasnt an aim podium so to speak thats one of the good 
things about the radio station he said on occasion it had 
some critical comments about aim itself 
but the issue no longer arises wittstock said weve proven 
ourselves 
before first person radio began in the late 1970s wittstock 
said you might get a little snippet about a demonstration or a 
little snippet about a murder or somebody going to jail for 99 
years or something like that that isnt indian news 
recent news stories have included coverage of federal college 
loan problems for navajo students an ongoing land claims dispute 
on the white earth indian reservation in northern minnesota and a 
law requiring labeling to distinguish wild rice harvested by 
indians from the paddygrown variety 
training young journalists is an important goal for wittstock 
50 the last director of the defunct american indian press 
association which distributed articles to about 100 indian 
newspapers nationwide 
she and means 46 run afterschool programs for students 
interested in learning about communications and have trained 50 
college students over the years

water officials facing what could be the 
states seconddriest year ever have declared an emergency shortage 
and warned 11 million customers that water rationing may be 
ordered for homes and businesses 
the east bay municipal utility district stopped short of 
imposing emergency restrictions but voted yesterday to approve a 
300000 campaign to teach the public water conservation methods 
we dont want to make this a draconian thing but we do want 
to save a lot of water district general manager jerome gilbert 
said at the board of directors meeting tuesday 
the board will meet again april 13 to consider rationing but is 
already divided over whether to allow more water in the warmer 
areas such as the san ramon valley 
directors from berkeley and richmond argued it would be unfair 
if affluent suburbs such as san ramon receive an extra share of 
water for their sprawling lawns and gardens 
water officials said studies show rain and snow runoff from the 
mokelumne river basin the districts major water source is 
estimated at 180000 feet 24 percent of normal 
this year has the potential to be the seconddriest year 
ever said ted way chief engineer 
officials stopped short of declaring a drought for the district 
east of san francisco but said river runoff from snow melt will 
average 60 percent of normal between april and july statewide

a nearly 2yearold lawsuit that accuses 
several irancontra figures of collaborating with colombian drug 
lords is under attack by the defendants who call the complaint 
legal terrorism 
the lawsuit filed in may 1986 several months before the 
irancontra affair was exposed publicly names some of the people 
in the private network that lt col oliver l north formed to help 
the nicaraguan contras 
the lawsuit has attracted widespread attention and the christic 
institute a liberal policy group representing the plaintiffs has 
used it as a vehicle to raise money 
daniel sheehan the christics chief counsel has traveled 
around the country speaking about the suit which was filed by 
martha honey and tony avirgan two american reporters based in 
costa rica 
the allegations in the civil lawsuit set for trial june 26 in 
federal court in miami are significantly different and much 
broader than the issues raised by lawrence walsh the independent 
counsel in the irancontra case 
last week a federal grand jury indicted four men on charges of 
conspiring to defraud the us government in the program to sell 
weapons to iran and divert the proceeds to the contras 
they are john m poindexter the former national security 
adviser north poindexters onetime aide and richard v secord 
and albert hakim two arms dealers who helped north run the 
irancontra program 
secord and hakim are among the 29 defendants in the miami 
lawsuit which does not cite any us government officials central 
to the lawsuit is the claim that the defendants conspired to 
traffic in drugs and plot assassinations in central america and 
elsewhere 
lawyers for both sides expect the trial to proceed despite 
walshs criminal indictments 
this case is going to trial said thomas spencer an 
attorney for retired gen john singlaub one of the defendants in 
the lawsuit 
honey and avirgan are represented by attorneys for the christic 
institute a liberal policy group based in the nations capital 
i think they the plaintiffs are desperately looking for a 
way to get out of the lawsuit spencer said they have come to 
the conclusion there is no basis for their case 
peter dykstra a spokesman for the washingtonbased institute 
rejected spencers claim we want a trial why else would we be 
doing this he said 
spencer and other defense lawyers have waged a concerted effort 
to discredit the lawsuit among other things they have obtained 
affidavits from some of the christics sources contradicting 
information in the lawsuit 
judge james lawrence king ordered the institute to reveal its 
sources 
secord meantime has filed a 5 million slander suit against 
eugene wheaton one of the institutes principal ources wheatons 
lawyer robert thompson said his client has not responded to the 
lawsuit 
at the heart of the honeyavirgan lawsuit is the allegation that 
a secret team headed by former cia official theodore shackley 
worked over two decades to manage a covert shadow government 
funded with drug profits there has never been independent 
confirmation of the charge 
shackley has waged a personal publicity campaign to defend 
himself and vowed to seek reprisals through the legal system 
in an article in the journal of defense amp diplomacy shackley 
described the plaintiffs as practitioners of character 
assassination through legal terrorism 
the christic institute stands by its charges and sheehan says 
he is developing more information that implicates the defendants 
but many of the institutes theories will not be tested in court 
because king has limited testimony in the case to events between 
1983 and 1986 
specifically avirgan and honey seek damages of 22 million to 
compensate avirgan for injuries he suffered inside nicaragua at a 
bombing at a may 1986 press conference held by former contra 
leader eden pastora three reporters died in the bombing 
the lawsuit claims the defendants who include known colombian 
drug smugglers pablo escobar and jorge ochoa conspired to 
kill pastora because he would not cooperate with other contra 
rebels 
smuggle cocaine into the united states to finance contra 
operations 
assassinate a us ambassador in costa rica in order to claim 
a bounty 
the special congressional committees that investigated the 
irancontra case last summer did not deal specifically with 
allegations raised in the lawsuit 
but a senate panel chaired by sen john kerry dmass is 
looking into reports of drugdealing by the contras the rebels 
have denied they trafficked in narcotics 
the irancontra committees however heard public testimony from 
glenn robinette a former cia security specialist who said secord 
paid him thousands of dollars to investigate the lawsuit in 1986 
over the past several months the institute has conducted 
depositions of witnesses many of whom have refused to talk citing 
their fifth amendment right to remain silent 
spencer said the lawsuit has cost singlaub 150000 in legal 
fees so far and that could double the institute has budgeted 3 
million to cover operational expenses 1988 with 90 percent of the 
money expected to be spent on the lawsuit

a bone marrow transplant researcher was named 
wednesday as recipient of the 50000 bristolmyers award for 
distinguished achievement in cancer research 
george santos professor of oncology and medicine at the johns 
hopkins university school of medicine in baltimore will receive 
the prize at a luncheon may 4 in new york 
bone marrow transplants are used to treat leukemia 
santos was among the first researchers to realize the importance 
of suppressing the immune system with drugs in bone marrow 
transplants to avoid a potentially fatal complication known as 
graftversushost disease said e donnall thomas director of the 
fred hutchinson cancer research center and a member of the award 
committee 
in the disease immune system cells from the donated marrow 
attack the recipients tissue as foreign 
santos said he and colleagues are now studying use of marrow 
transplants as part of treatment of cancers of the breast ovary 
and colon the research involves using higherthanusual doses of 
chemotherapy to kill cancer cells then doing transplants to 
restore marrow destroyed as a side effect 
another line of research is using the drug thalidomide in 
fighting graftversushost disease he said animal studies are 
encouraging he said in a statement 
thalidomide is best known for causing birth defects when taken 
by pregnant women as a sleeping pill in the 1950s but apart from 
that scientists say it has far fewer side effects than 
cyclosporine another suppressor of the immune system that can 
damage the kidneys

state republican party chairman ray shamie said 
today he will not challenge sen edward m kennedy this year 
instead longtime shamie aide joseph malone will run against the 
veteran democrat 
shamie a retired walpole millionaire told a news conference he 
had decided despite pleas from president reagan and other national 
party officials to remain state party chairman 
among other things shamie said he was concerned about giving up 
a chairmanship won only last year to run what most observers agree 
is an uphill battle to unseat kennedy who will be seeking his 
fifth full term 
shamie 67 endorsed malone saying that none of the other 
republicans who expressed interest in challenging kennedy would be 
serious candidates 
malone 33 of waltham has been a close aide to shamie since 
1982 when shamie emerged by mounting a credible challenge to 
kennedy currently malone is executive director of the republican 
party under shamie 
a graduate of harvard college in 1978 malone has helped operate 
a family trucking business and also is a partner in family real 
estate holdings 
i have devoted 10 years of my life working to help bring back 
a twoparty system to massachusetts malone said in an interview 
its important that we have a strong aggressive campaign in 
massachusetts 
the top gop party brass was concerned that a weak challenge to 
kennedy would leave him free to roam the country helping other 
democratic campaigns including the presidential race 
but state rep john macgovern said shamie did not like being 
used by other people like a battering ram he did not want to run 
youre just banging yourself up to keep ted kennedy busy 
malone is a virtual unknown in massachusetts except in political 
circles he is well off from his family business interests but said 
he is not a millionaire 
shamie spent 18 million against kennedy in 1982 when he lost 
61 percent to 38 percent he spent a record 23 million in 1984 
against john kerry for senate in a race kerry won 55 percent to 45 
percent

police on the lookout for terrorist attacks at 
the capitol report a 50 percent decline in seizures of handguns and 
rifles last year but a sharp increase in canisters of chemical 
sprays that visitors carry for selfprotection 
figures supplied by senior police officials appeared to 
contradict an earlier claim by house sergeantatarms jack russ 
that weapons seizures rose by a startling 147 percent at the 
capitol last year 
members of a house appropriations subcommittee said russ left 
the impression at a recent hearing that many of the 1162 
confiscated weapons were guns russ cited the figure in arguing for 
an 185 million plan to tighten security on the house side of the 
capitol 
but capitol police chief frank kerrigan said in a subsequent 
interview that all 1162 actually were canisters of mace tear gas 
and other nonlethal chemical sprays some in lipstickstyle 
containers that women carry to immobilize wouldbe attackers the 
same seizures totaled 470 the previous year 
tear gas and other chemical sprays are illegal in the district 
of columbia including the capitol grounds the capitol police 
classify them as weapons subject to seizure and destruction 
kerrigan said chemical sprays accounted for the vast majority of 
the actual total of the 1270 weapons confiscated at the capitol 
last year a 125 percent increase over 1986 the police said gun 
seizures actually declined to 14 from 28 the previous year 
the balance included knives explosive liquids clubs 
blackjacks and various exotic weapons plus nonlethal stun 
guns which use an electrical jolt to render victims temporarily 
harmless 
asked about kerrigans details russ said he must have 
misinterpreted the figures he received from the capitol police 
senior members of the house panel that heard russ testimony 
discounted suggestions that he might have given misleading figures 
in an attempt to gain support for his security plan 
but rep vic fazio dcalif the subcommittee chairman said 
house members responsible for capitol security intend to take a 
much closer look at the situation in consultation with the senate 
before any decisions are made 
fazio said he has heard conflicting arguments over the need for 
stricter antiterrorist measures we wont be stampeded he 
said 
i dont think jack was trying to mislead us but it does raise 
a question said rep john t myers rind a panel member 
rep jerry lewis of california the subcommitees ranking 
republican agreed with fazios goslow approach 
theyre pushing very hard to increase security everywhere up 
here lewis said we must protect ourselves in this modern age 
of terrorism but i tend to resist any unnecessary steps that would 
hinder the publics access to the capitol 
kerrigan said the sharply higher number of weapons seizures 
probably reflected improved use of metal detectors in the capitol 
building and six nearby office buildings better training of police 
officers and more thorough searches of visitors rather than any 
increase in the number of visitors with criminal intent 
russ said many of the visitors who carry firearms have 
outofstate gun permits but are unaware that the permits are 
invalid on the capitol grounds 
kerrigan said 63 people were prosecuted at the capitol last year 
on illegalweapons charges compared with 50 people in 1986

the general assembly voted overwhemingly 
today to condemn the us move to close the palestine liberation 
organizations un mission 
the assembly voted 1482 to deplore the us action and urge it 
to abide by the international un headquarters treaty which 
allows foreign missions to operate the united states and israel 
voted against the resolution 
general assembly resolutions are not legally binding but carry 
moral weight 
the vote came one day after the us justice department filed a 
lawsuit seeking to close the plo mission and freeze its funds in 
accordance with an antiterrorist law 
us ambassador herbert s okun the deputy permanent 
representative said the justice department was obliged by law to 
enforce the antiterrorist legislation which would close the 
mission 
but he said the united states would take no further steps to 
close the mission until a court has ruled on the us lawsuit filed 
in us district court in manhattan 
the plo envoy zehdi labib terzi told the assembly that the 
united states claims to be proud to play host to the united 
nations then he shouted 
what pride to you have in throwing your guests out 
is this the message the us delegation wants to bring to the 
world that guests have no respect the united nations has no 
respect international law has no respect 
this is not gunboat policy any more we are living in a stage 
where the human approach where obligations are respected said 
terzi he said the plo will fight the us lawsuit 
of the united states terzi said is this the country which 
claims to be the bastion of freedom and democracy afraid to 
permit the voice of the palestinians 
israeli ambassador johanan bein the deputy permanent 
representative told the assembly that the plo has been the 
principal terrorist organization of our time and it rejects the 
central un principle of peaceful settlement of disputes 
on tuesday the plo accused the united states of engaging in 
financial terrorism by seeking a court order to close the 
mission and force the plo to transfer its bank funds out of the 
united states 
the closure of the mission is required under the 1987 
antiterrorism act which found the plo and its affiliates were a 
terrorist organization responsible for numerous violent incidents 
including the murder of an american citizen during the hijacking of 
the cruise ship achille lauro in 1985 
the feud over the future of the plos mission on east 65th 
street has created a crisis in usun relations 
secretary of state george p shultz also has called the law a 
very bad piece of legislation which unnecessarily glorifies the 
plo 
terzi has said he will have to be dragged away from the plo 
mission and that if forced to move it will be to the united 
nations on international territory out of reach of us marshals 
in 1973 plo chief yasser arafat spent a night at the united 
nations because he could not stay on us territory

nobody was surprised when president francois 
mitterrand finally announced he would seek reelection but many 
were stunned by the pugnacity of his words and his version of 
charles de gaulles me or chaos alternative 
the 71yearold socialist president declared his candidacy in a 
television interview tuesday night waiting until five weeks before 
the first round of voting to end months of speculation 
mitterrand had said he preferred to step down but would run for 
a second sevenyear term if exceptional circumstances warranted 
it he said tuesday that after listening to the speeches of other 
candidates he was convinced france is in danger 
i see a risk that the country might fall into the quarrels and 
division that so often have undermined it he said i want 
france to be united and it will not be if it is taken in hand by 
intolerant minds by parties who want everything by clans by 
gangs there must be civil peace in france 
though he named no names the presidents remarks were aimed at 
his two main opponents conservative premier jacques chirac and 
former centrist premier raymond barre 
typical of the reaction in the conservative press wednesday 
gerard badel wrote in le parisien the chief of state has in 
sum confronted the french people with the choice that he had so 
often reproached gen de gaulle for me or chaos 
alain juppe spokesman for chiracs government said mitterrand 
goes to war against perils that do not exist 
if there is really danger one wonders why mr mitterrand 
waited so long to say so in reality all that is pure 
fabrication juppe said 
french presidential elections are run in two rounds the first 
april 24 pits mitterrand against chirac barre and a handful of 
minor candidates if as expected nobody wins a majority a runoff 
will be held may 8 between the top two votegetters 
for the past year the polls have indicated that mitterrand will 
win the second round handily no matter who his opponent is but he 
could slip now that he has had to abandon his strictly presidential 
role 
chirac remarked on what he called mitterrands language of 
rare violence and sectarianism that risked setting the french 
against one another the stakes he said are clear on one 
side there is the socialist party that wants to retake power and 
institute socialist policies on the other is the conservative 
parliamentary majority that has governed for two years in calm and 
union 
barre said he doubted mitterrand could unite the country adding 
that since the presidents election in 1981 he has been the 
president of one fraction of the french population against 
another 
the reality is that since the mid1980s french politics have 
moved toward the center the gulf between the left and right has 
narrowed to the point where it is difficult to distinguish the two 
without an overriding issue the campaign has evolved into one 
of personalities 
there is chirac 55 the harddriving almost frenetic 
political bulldozer and currently the leading rightist barre 63 
the thoughtful economics professor who is more toward the center 
and mitterrand who in the two years since the right ousted the 
socialists from control of the national assembly has become the 
sage father figure 
the vocabulary is the same each has presented himself as the 
only man capable of uniting the french 
few differences exist in foreign policy and defense even 
unemployment now at 104 percent has not emerged as a 
battleground both right and left have tried and failed to come to 
grips with it 
in his announcement mitterrand presented no program saying 
only that he would get to it later 
since cohabitation between the socialist president and the 
conservative premier was forced on french politics by the 1986 
legislative elections mitterrand has profited the most he has 
taken pains to distance himself from the socialist party which he 
founded and led for years and is trying to appear as a man above 
parties

the ailing leader of at least 150000 
pakistani refugees began a fast wednesday to demand that islamabad 
take back the refugees stranded here since 1971 
if the pakistan government does not respond favorably to our 
request for early return to our country hundreds and thousands of 
our brothers and sisters will be on fast unto death said nasim 
khan 64 who began his fast outside the national press club 
khan suffered a heart attack two weeks ago he told the 
associated press its better to die struggling to go back to our 
homeland than live in vice hunger and disease ridden camps in an 
alien country 
khan and the others were stranded in 1971 when bangladesh 
formerly east pakistan became an independent country after a 
liberation struggle and a war between india and pakistan 
by 1973 174000 refugees returned to pakistan but the 
repatriation ended abruptly when funds ran out stranding 250000 
people about 100000 are believed to have returned since but the 
rest remain in refugee camps in bangladesh 
bangladesh foreign secretary nazrul islam told reporters 
wednesday that his government has renewed a longstanding request to 
pakistan to make arrangement for the return of the refugees 
islam said pakistan has agreed in principle to take back the 
refugees but a pakistani diplomat who spoke on condition of 
anonymity said sufficient funds for the transfer still were 
lacking moslem charitable organizations have been asked for help 
in raising the money 
as khan began his fast hundreds of other refugees held a silent 
march on a nearby street 
nasim khan bazlul huda 19 said i will burn myself to death 
soon if pakistan does not announce a timetable for our 
repatriation 
islam said that dhaka and islamabad had approached a number of 
countries and world organizations to raise enough money for a 
repatriation of refugees 
four years ago the stranded pakistanis planned a march to their 
homeland but border guards crushed it

gov evan mechams former chief of staff 
testified today there was no effort to cover up an 80000 loan 
from the governors protocol fund to mechams auto dealership 
i just forgot or failed to record the check in the funds 
checkbook register former chief of staff jim colter told the 
senate 
colter also told prosecutor william french that mecham had 
called his home on tuesday and left a message on the answering 
machine that i had done a good job or something to that effect 
in his earlier testimony 
meanwhile the senate voted 254 today to drop the longer 
schedule it had adopted in an effort to speed up the impeachment 
trial prosecution and defense lawyers complained the eight hours 
of testimony tuesday left them too little time for preparation and 
lawmakers agreed to return to a sixhour schedule 
voting against the shorter schedule were republican sens carl 
kunasek bob usdane tony west and peter kay 
the senate is now hearing testimony on the second impeachment 
charge which accused mecham of misusing 80000 from the 
governors protocol fund by loaning it to mecham pontiac 
there was certainly no effort to cover up the loan colter 
testified today 
colter testified tuesday that he warned the governor it would be 
politically unwise to borrow the money but mecham instructed 
him to write the check anyway 
you certainly were not anxious that the general public be 
aware of this loan were you french asked today 
no i did not broadcast it colter replied 
the former chief of staff acknowledged that he did not shop 
around for better interest rates before processing the loan to 
mecham pontiac but added as far as im concerned the loan was 
a good investment of the money 
it had nothing to do with the governors personal use 
colter said 
however democratic sen jones osborn questioned whether it 
would be a subsidy to mecham pontiac to loan it money if the 
interest rate were lower than the dealership would have had to pay 
to a bank 
colter said mecham also asked him not to record a document 
securing the loan although colter did not know why he testified 
however that he did not think any law had been broken or i would 
have objected 
the protocol fund created with fundraising revenues from 
mechams inauguration is intended to be used for state ceremonial 
gifts 
the prosecution contends the fund is public money and therefore 
the loan was illegal while the defense says the money can be used 
as mecham sees fit except to repay his campaign expenses 
however the first two witnesses to testify on the charge said 
they were shocked when they heard that mecham had loaned the funds 
to his auto dealership 
i was very surprised and disappointed and saddened said 
warner lee a former state attorney general who advised the mecham 
inaugural committee i thought that it was a very awkward thing 
politically to have done 
i personally was shocked and initially felt betrayed said 
deputy maricopa county attorney howard schwartz who helped draft 
an agreement for use of funds raised by mechams inaugural 
committee 
in an interview tuesday on ktar radio mecham said he considered 
the protocol fund to be private association money not state 
money 
he acknowledged he was told it was politically not a wise 
thing to do but i wasnt thinking of that the governor said he 
could have borrowed the money from other sources but decided on 
the protocol fund so it would earn the 9 percent interest being 
paid by mecham pontiac 
mecham the first us governor to be impeached in six decades 
also said if he is exonerated he will do a better job as governor 
theyll probably say this is another one of those gaffes but 
a lot of the rats have come out of their holes thats been after 
me and now we know a lot more who they are mecham said quite 
frankly ill be a lot wiser governor from here on out 
if he is allowed to resume his job mecham said he will fire 
department of public safety director ralph milstead one of the 
chief accusers in his senate trial 
a senate conviction mecham said will certainly not be on the 
basis of evidence and on that well go and appeal it of course 
probably direct to the us supreme court 
earlier tuesday the senate finished hearing testimony on the 
first impeachment charge that mecham tried to thwart an 
investigation of an alleged death threat by a state official 
against a former top mecham aide 
after heated debate a motion to vote on the first count 
immediately was dropped after it became clear most senators wanted 
to hear testimony on all three charges first 
the third charge accuses the governor of concealing a 350000 
campaign loan a twothirds vote of the 30member senate is 
required to convict mecham and remove him from office 
meanwhile a lawyer defending mecham at his april 21 criminal 
trial on six felony counts related to the 350000 loan sought 
dismissal of the charges the lawyer michael scott said the 
governor has been singled out for prosecution because he is 
unpopular 
the judge did not rule on the motion mecham also faces a may 17 
recall election

state republican party chairman ray shamie said 
today he will not challenge sen edward m kennedy this year 
instead longtime shamie aide joseph malone will run against the 
veteran democrat 
shamie a retired walpole millionaire told a news conference he 
had decided despite pleas from president reagan and other national 
party officials to remain state party chairman 
among other things shamie said he was concerned about giving up 
a chairmanship won only last year to run what most observers agree 
is an uphill battle to unseat kennedy who will be seeking his 
fifth full term 
shamie 67 endorsed malone saying that none of the other 
republicans who expressed interest in challenging kennedy would be 
serious candidates 
malone 33 of waltham has been a close aide to shamie since 
1982 when shamie emerged by mounting a credible challenge to 
kennedy currently malone is executive director of the republican 
party under shamie 
a graduate of harvard college in 1978 malone has helped operate 
a family trucking business and also is a partner in family real 
estate holdings 
i have devoted 10 years of my life working to help bring back 
a twoparty system to massachusetts malone said in an interview 
its important that we have a strong aggressive campaign in 
massachusetts 
the top gop party brass was concerned that a weak challenge to 
kennedy would leave him free to roam the country helping other 
democratic campaigns including the presidential race 
but state rep john macgovern said shamie did not like being 
used by other people like a battering ram he did not want to run 
youre just banging yourself up to keep ted kennedy busy 
malone is a virtual unknown in massachusetts except in political 
circles he is well off from his family business interests but said 
he is not a millionaire 
shamie spent 18 million against kennedy in 1982 when he lost 
61 percent to 38 percent he spent a record 23 million in 1984 
against john kerry for senate in a race kerry won 55 percent to 45 
percent

a physicist reported wednesday the discovery 
of a new superconducting compound that he believes may work at 
minus 100 degrees fahrenheit potentially setting a new temperature 
record for superconductivity 
the compound made of lanthanum copper and oxygen forms 
crystal structures that are relatively pure examples of the basic 
copperoxygen lattice found in all the new superconductors said 
stuart wolf who reported the development along with colleagues 
from the naval research labortatory 
because of their relative purity they may be able to attain 
superconductivity at higher temperatures than other materials he 
said 
the compound now appears to become superconducting at above 280 
degrees below zero fahrenheit but that could go to minus 100 
degrees fahrenheit or higher he aid 
the substance can be made only at temperatures of 2700 degrees 
fahrenheit and at pressures 65000 times those of the atmosphere 
but it can then be cooled and studied at normal temperatures and 
pressures he said 
allen hermann of the university of arkansas reported that he has 
now achieved superconductivity at a temperature of 234 degrees 
below zero fahrenheit with a superconductor he discovered late last 
year 
ibm scientists had been the first to push hermanns new 
superconductor to that temperature even before hermann himself 
could do it demonstrating how rapidly research is spreading and 
advancing 
when hermann and his arkansas collaborator zhengzhi sheng 
announced the discovery of the material within two days we had 
confirmation around the world he said almost before the ink 
was dry on his laboratory notebooks 
for physicists who are accustomed to working in exotic realms 
minus 234 degress fahrenheit is warm previous superconductors had 
operated at no higher than minus 418 degrees fahrenheit 
no one can yet be sure how much higher temperatures will go but 
many are optimistic that temperatures will continue to climb i 
think we have simply uncovered the tip of the iceberg said 
hermann 
the socalled hightemperature superconductors that have set 
physics ablaze offer the promise of dramatically cheaper 
electricity generation transmission and storage faster and 
smaller computers and 300mileanhour magnetically levitated 
trains 
but initial enthusiasm for those applications is now somewhat 
lower as each discovery raises as many questions as it answers 
physicists said 
we dont want to promise too much to society said robert 
cava of bell laboratories but the promise exists 
the latest batch of reports came at an unscheduled session held 
tuesday night during a meeting of the american physical society 
the meeting convened by researchers eager to swap their latest 
findings followed by one year the woodstock of physics in new 
york at which the first reports of the new superconductivity were 
presented to scientists in a session that continued until the wee 
hours of the morning 
physicists in new orleans discussed new experiments with two 
superconductors first reported earlier this year the 
thalliumcontaining compound found by hermann and sheng and another 
containing bismuth which was first reported by hiroshi maeda and 
colleagues in japan 
fears the new superconductors would be unable to carry currents 
large enough for practical applications have diminished the 
researchers said 
it has now been shown that the materials are potentially capable 
of carrying huge amounts of current and researchers reported that 
they have devised ways of making them that bring them closer to 
their theoretical currentcarrying capacity 
theoretical physicists are still trying to figure out how the 
new superconductors work but the availability now of four distinct 
superconductors has made some aspects of their operation clearer 
all the superconductors include sheets of copper and oxygen 
suggesting that these sheets are critical furthermore the 
materials that operate at higher temperatures have these copper 
oxide sheets as theyre called layered in twos and threes 
physicists are now trying to make compounds with the copper 
oxide layers grouped in fours on the hunch those materials will 
have even higher operating temperatures

a trial lawyers group has sharply criticized 
members of two prominent law firms for concealing evidence from 
families who sued their clients over water pollution alleged to 
have caused six cancer deaths 
in documents filed with a federal appeals court the 
massachusetts academy of trial attorneys said the conduct of 
attorneys representing beatrice foods co and the owner of a woburn 
tannery threatened to undermine the judicial system by encouraging 
lawyers to flout court rules 
the court must support those who abide by the rules and expose 
those who bend them to their own advantage the academy said in a 
brief filed to support the request by eight woburn families for a 
new trial in their suit against beatrice and the john j riley co 
tannery 
a wrongdoer should be unable to take comfort or benefit in a 
judgment obtained by cheating the academy said in the brief 
filed tuesday with the 1st us circuit court of appeals 
the lawyers group singled out beatrice attorney jerome facher 
of the law firm of hale amp dorr for its harshest criticism 
the concealment of information through misrepresentation and 
misconduct was accomplished by the lead attorney for the 
defendant the academy said as a senior member of the bar he 
commands respect and attention how the court determines the 
appropriateness of his conduct will not go unnoticed 
without naming her the academy also lambasted mary ryan of the 
law firm nutter mcclennen amp fish the attorney for riley which 
bought the tannery from beatrice the families blame the tannery 
for polluting the towns water supply 
neither facher nor ryan returned telephone calls wednesday from 
the associated press 
the academy frequently files briefs in cases involving complex 
and controversial legal issues it did not specify requested 
sanctions against the lawyers 
the filing with the appeals court followed us district judge 
walter jay skinners decision in january denying the families a new 
trial 
their original suit contended four parties were responsible for 
the pollution beatrice and riley wr grace co and unifirst a 
uniform supply company unifirst settled prior to trial and wr 
grace settled for a reported 8 million halfway through the trial 
skinner dismissed the portion of the suit against beatrice and the 
tannery 
the families asked for a new trial after their attorney learned 
of a 1983 report that was not disclosed by facher or ryan the 
report said it was possible that dumping on the tannery property 
contributed to groundwater pollution near two town wells 
skinner ruled that facher and ryan were aware of the report but 
failed to disclose it to the families but the judge refused to 
order a new trial saying he did not think the report would have 
affected the outcome of the case and that the families failed to 
prove the concealment was deliberate 
the families attorney jan schlichtmann and the academy said 
skinner applied the wrong standard in deciding the issue saying 
that he was wrong to speculate that the report would not have led 
to evidence favorable to the claim that pollution on the tannery 
property seeped into the towns water supply

republican presidential contender bob dole on 
wednesday accused michael dukakis and the rest of the democratic 
white house hopefuls of a failure of nerve as well as a failure 
of vision in responding to the sovietbacked regime in nicaragua 
the call to defend the freedom of nicaragua which should be 
easy for them to answer instead produces endless footshuffling 
and sophistry dole said in a speech that made little mention of 
his own presidential candidacy and avoided even a single reference 
to gop frontrunner george bush 
dole said the issue of the sandinista government in nicaragua is 
as symbolic for our time as hitlers brazen aggression was for an 
earlier generation 
he warned that failure to confront it might eventually lead to 
communist governments in costa rica panama or even mexico as the 
sandinistas strengthen their grip at home and begin supporting 
guerilla movements elsewhere 
what will the democrats say then he asked in a speech that 
marked the beginning of an effort to lay out his views on a variety 
of issues the kansas senator is far far behind bush in the race 
for delegates to the republican national convention and is widely 
viewed as a candidate for withdrawal after the wisconsin primary on 
april 5 
in his speech to the center for strategic and international 
studies dole addressed an issue that has divided republican 
candidates who favor military support for the contras fighting 
the nicaraguan government from the democrats who oppose it 
he turned his fire on massachusets gov dukakis the other 
democratic presidential hopefuls and the democratic left 
dole said dukakis says that the monroe doctrine which has 
defined americas security in its own neighborhood for some 200 
years is obsolete he says that this country has no choice 
but to tolerate the existence of soviet client states wherever 
subversion might install them 
broadening his attack dole added today all the democratic 
party presidential candidates sound themes similar to the dukakis 
doctrine for latin america instead of joining president 
reagan in challenging the thieves they have found ways to 
rationalize the loss of liberty in nicaragua 
doles charges brought a sarcastic reply from dukakis 
communications director leslie dach 
i guess bob dole is taking after michael dukakis because hes 
accomplishing what bob dole cant beating george bush in the 
polls dach said 
dole said democrats are guilty of an attitude that says 
america must not be too forceful that stems from the belief 
that america rather than the soviet union poses a threat to peace 
perverse but pervasive this attitude has enveloped the 
democratic side of the primary campaign like nerve gas he said 
dole cited anticommunist stands taken by democratic presidents 
harry truman and john f kennedy but said the party has abandoned 
its heritage 
the question among democrats has become whether we should 
bear any burden at all will the liberal democrats pay even a small 
price one reckoned in american money rather than american lives 
he said 
dole said what we see on the democratic side of this 
presidential campaign is a failure of nerve as well as a failure of 
vision 
he added today we stand and watch as nicaragua slowly twists 
in the wind and the fate of the americas begins to tilt

the club lady in illinois never knew what a 
flap she caused when she wrote the president of the united states 
asking to use air force one as a party room for the spectacular 
event she had to plan 
frankly we cant think of anything which would be more 
thrilling she wrote to richard nixon who was president then 
you can land on our property seven secluded acres 
the letter which has rested all these years in a file folder 
was only one document out of 400000 that were opened to public 
view for the first time tuesday by the national archives but while 
hundreds of people begged for a ride on the presidential plane it 
was the only one that asked to use it for something other than 
transportation 
her answer came directly from ralph d albertazzie an air force 
colonel who was the presidents pilot 
landing air force one on seven acres of ground would certainly 
be a spectacular event in itself albertazzie wrote i can only 
say for reasons far too numerous to enumerate no 
according to the records that didnt sit too well with gen 
james d hughes who was nixons military aide in a note he 
chewed out the colonel for making light of a sincere effort on 
the part of the writer to score a million in one shot for her 
club a chastened albertazzie replied ive goofed and a 
white house functionary wrapped up the whole thing with a note 
for obvious reasons please keep this in your restricted file 
a ride on the presidents airplane a blue and silver boeing 707 
with the united states of america lettered boldly across each 
side is the ultimate status symbol and a lot of americans want one 
dear mr president one letter began my nephew will be 
leaving shortly to start his three years as a law student at 
georgetown school of law in washington dc 
with some of his money he purchased quite an expensive stereo 
with speakers and we are quite reluctant to ship mail or whatever 
this item is it permissible in any way for this stereo and 
speakers to be transported on air force one when you return to 
washington from your sojourn in california 
no 
i see you are flying to california and i wonder if i can hitch 
a ride a young man wrote im going there to see a girl i 
havent seen in 14 months im a small guy and i wont take up much 
space all ill have is a small suitcase and my guitar 
no 
correspondence and memos about air force one renamed the 
spirit of 76 for a time in the nixon tenure fill a halfdozen 
thick file folders in the national archives such requests 
undoubtedly come to every president 
if politicians wanted to be seen on air force one and they 
did desperately the white house reciprocated by using rides as a 
political tool 
it is a prized thing to ride on air force one and we intend to 
keep it that way said presidential appointments secretary dwight 
chapin in chewing out political adviser murray chotiner for 
inviting a congressman 
no one is allowed to place a guest on the presidents aircraft 
without prior approval of the president chapin wrote 
chapin also asked another presidential assistant for a memo 
detailing the responsibilities and duties of the handholder when 
he travels on air force one handholders chapin explained are 
people carried on the plane for the purpose of massaging vips 
another time chapin complained to hughes that the wife of white 
house chief of staff hr haldeman was placed in a threeabreast 
seating area whereas there was a forward compartment with sundry 
military personnel in twoabreast and more comfortable seating 
the pleasures of riding air force one were more image than 
comfort a dozen memos complained about lousy food others griped 
about the temperature in the cabin being too cold in one chapin 
groused that meals used to be served with crystal glasses and china 
and now plastic seems to be the inthing 
there also was a curious memo from chotiner to chapin he asked 
for a ride in the event the president has a plane going to 
california for his nieces wedding a handwritten notation

the reagan administration said wednesday it 
would be premature to impose new economic sanctions on haiti 
because the new government of president leslie manigat has shown 
a determination to move haiti in a democratic direction 
while the administration is not prepared to seek a lifting of 
sanctions imposed on haiti after election violence late last year 
new incentives may be in order as the caribbean nation makes steps 
toward developing democratic institutions said richard holwill 
deputy assistant secretary of state for interamerican affairs 
if we hope to play a constructive role in haiti we will be 
obliged to consider incentives as well as sanctions and be willing 
to judge progress by specific interim milestones holwill told a 
house foreign affairs subcommittee 
we should not expect perfection before we offer assistance 
he said 
several members of congress have introduced legislation to 
impose a series of trade sanctions on haiti unless a more 
democratically elected government is installed the sanctions 
include revocation of haitis lucrative sugar quota and suspension 
of other trade preferences 
but holwill said the legislation would be counterproductive 
the haitian people not we should determine the fate of the 
manigat government he said they now appear willing to give 
that government a chance 
the administration last nov 29 suspended all direct aid to 
haitis government leaving in place only humanitarian assistance 
operated through private organizations 
the move cost haiti some 60 million in economic aid and about 
2 million in military aid in the current fiscal year the state 
department estimates while about 36 million in humanitarian aid 
continues to flow

we are not a political family said joseph bainbridge but

congressional supporters will seek about 100 
million in 1989 funding for the superconducting super collider 
project around a third the amount requested by president reagan 
rep carl pursell rmich said wednesday 
pursell and house members from five other states hoping to win 
the project met to map strategy for pushing appropriations through 
congress 
the 44 billion physics research center has been attacked by 
congressional critics who argue the massive project would siphon 
away money needed by research in other areas 
the energy department is expected to decide in november where to 
build the super collider 
in his 1989 budget reagan proposed spending 363 million on the 
facility 
congressional supporters of the project however are 
considering funding somewhere around the bottom of 100 million 
plus pursell said after the private meeting we have not fixed 
on exact figures 
the house members also discussed target dates in their drive to 
ensure the project survives congressional budget cuts 
as long as weve got good support from the leadership were 
sure we can get through the budget process pursell said 
the project proponents members of an ad hoc task force will 
meet soon with house speaker jim wright dtexas and minority 
leader robert michel rill to discuss appropriations for the 
facility pursell said 
the super collider involving a 53milecircumference particle 
accelerator will produce 4000 jobs and have an annual operating 
budget of 279 million 
physicists have said the project is necessary to gain a greater 
understanding of the physical structure of the universe 
besides michigan states that remain in the running for the 
project are arizona colorado illinois north carolina tennessee 
and texas 
arizona was unrepresented at wednesdays meeting pursell said

a man accused of making millions by 
selling worthless mailorder cures for ills from impotency to 
baldness to obesity has been banished from living and working in 
florida 
mitchell friedlander the 38yearold owner of robertsontaylor 
co entered pleas of no contest tuesday to 13 charges of operating 
a scheme to defraud 
in return for his pleas broward county circuit judge mel 
grossman gave him a suspended oneyear jail term put him on 
probation for five years and barred him from doing business or 
living in florida 
grossman withheld adjudication in the case meaning friedlander 
will have no criminal record if he complies with probation terms 
if he forms a corporation owns retail outlets or warehouses or 
obtains a mail drop in florida he can be sent to prison 
friedlanders mailorder company which had 400000 customers

washington federal collectivebargaining laws should take 
precedence over state laws protecting union employees who are fired 
for filing workers compensation claims a lawyer told the supreme 
court on wednesday 
giving states the authority to govern union contracts would be 
a threat to collective bargaining said charles c jackson a 
chicago attorney representing the norge division of magic chef inc 
federal laws regulating collective bargaining agreements provide 
for arbitration to resolve unfair labor practices 
but the lawyer for an illinois woman fired by norge said federal 
law never was intended to thwart state statutes prohibiting 
retaliatory firings 
if this were not true all states rights could be channeled 
away by arbitration lawyer paul alan levy contended 
the supreme court agreed to weigh both arguments before ruling 
probably in july in the case of jonna lingle who was fired in 
late 1984 from her job at herrin ill 
the woman had notified norge that she was injured on the job and 
asked the company under the state workers compensation law to 
pay her medical bills norge fired mrs lingle a week later 
contending she filed a false claim 
however her union contract contained a provision protecting 
workers from dismissal without just cause and the union filed a 
grievance the day she was fired 
an arbitrator ruled the firing violated the justcause provision 
and ordered her reinstatement but before the ruling was issued 
mrs lingle filed a lawsuit contending the dismissal was contrary 
to illinois law 
the relief available through the courts was greater than what 
she could receive through arbitration which did not include 
punitive damages and compensation for lost overtime 
a us district court judge threw out her lawsuit ruling that 
the state law was preempted by the arbitration remedy available 
under federal labor law and the 7th us circuit court upheld the 
dismissal in june 1987 
levy asked the supreme court to overturn the lowercourt rulings 
the right of action is available to both union and nonunion 
employees alike levy argued if there is any state cause of 
action that is independent of a labor agreement lingles case 
ought to be one of them 
but jackson said congress gave states authority to supercede 
federal law only on health and safety issues and said the power 
does not extend to rules against retaliatory firings 
if independent state laws were enacted that flew in the teeth 
of a labor contract they were preempted he said mrs 
lingles claim is exactly what arbitration is all about this is 
why we have collective bargaining agreements 
a brief filed on mrs lingles behalf by the state and local 
legal center in washington said 21 states and the district of 
columbia have laws protecting workers filing workers compensation 
claims 
it identified the states as california connecticut hawaii 
illinois louisiana maine massachusetts minnesota missouri 
montana new jersey new york north carolina ohio oklahoma 
oregon south carolina texas virginia washington and wisconsin

massachusetts gov michael dukakis today picked up the 
endorsement of new jersey sen bill bradley once mentioned as a 
possible rival for the democratic presidential nomination 
the endorsement came as dukakis campaign was under attack from 
democratic and republican presidential candidates on issues ranging 
from trade to central america 
bradley who for months has fended off suggestions that he would 
enter the presidential race if no frontrunner emerged today 
called dukakis the candidate who can beat george bush 
he can beat george bush because he is tenacious innovative 
resilient and disciplined and he has the personal depth and life 
experience tht embodies the promise of america bradley said 
dukakis who appeared with bradley at a new jersey park said 
the endorsement came from one of the most respected and one of 
tghe most accompliched pubblic figures in america today 
meanwhile democratic presidential contender richard gephardt 
today accused dukakis of talking tough on trade to entice michigan 
voters 
bush too came under fire for supporting president reagans 
veto of a major civil rights bill 
gephardt who has staked out michigans caucuses on saturday to 
revive his battered presidential campaign issued a statement today 
accusing dukakis of trying to have it both ways 
he may talk tough on trade in michigan but everywhere else he 
has opposed tough legislation gephardts statement said 
and sen bob dole a candidate for the republican nomination 
also attacked dukakis today for failing to stand up to 
sovietbacked subversion in central america 
he says that the monroe doctrine which has defined americas 
security in its own neighborhood for some 200 years is 
obsolete dole said of dukakis he said this country has 
no choice but to tolerate the existence of soviet client states 
wherever subversion might install them 
gephardt hammered away at dukakis as a new poll suggested he 
trailed the massachusetts governor by a 21 margin in michigan 
which holds democratic caucuses on saturday 
according to the survey dukakis had 35 percent jesse jackson 
29 percent gephardt 17 percent sen albert gore jr 6 percent and 
sen paul simon 5 percent with 9 percent undecided detroit 
television station wjbk said tuesday night the telephone poll of 
400 democratic or independent voters with a margin of error of 5 
percentage points was taken over the weekend 
gephardt who has made trade a campaign centerpiece questioned 
the sincerity of dukakis support for senate trade legislation 
calling it a political ploy to win workers votes in michigan 
who is for a tough trade policy who is going to be for a 
tough trade policy after michigan gephardt asked dick 
gephardt is mike dukakis hasnt been isnt and wont be 
but the dukakis campaign countered with a taperecorded 
interview in which dukakis praised the senate trade measure as long 
ago as last year 
i think the senate bill which is very very different from 
the gephardt amendment is sound policy i would have voted for 
it the governor told the des moines register on july 11 
the dukakis camp also hinted that if gephardt keeps up the 
accusations it will strike back a dukakis aide speaking on 
condition of anonymity said our gun is loaded and ready if any 
salvos are fired at us 
dukakis collected endorsements from connecticut gov william 
oneill and sen christopher dodd on tuesday a week before the 
states primary oneill said he expected dukakis who has won in 
every new england state so far would do extremely well 
meanwhile a survey published in todays washington post 
suggested dukakis was the only democrat who could outpoll bush 
fifty percent said they would vote for dukakis in an election held 
today and 45 percent said bush the newspaper said the survey 
conducted with abc news had a margin of error of 4 percentage 
points 
bush was the chief target of democrat gore who faulted him for 
lacking the gumption to break with reagan over the presidents 
veto of a civil rights bill which congress overrode tuesday 
gore interrupted his campaigning to fly back to washington and 
vote for the override as did fellow democrat simon 
when push comes to shove the vice president never disagrees 
with president reagan gore said in traverse city mich he 
really has not carved out an identity of his own in this election 
simon hailed the civil rights measure and attacked the white 
house for trying to quash it 
its another indication of the insensitivity of the 
administration to women to people with disabilities to 
minorities simon said 
jackson used the occasion to blast both reagan and bush 
when you have a president who vetoes a civil rights act and a 
vice president who suports him theres a leadership gap in 
washington he told an audience at benton harbor high school in 
michigan 
too many lives were lost in the struggle for civil rights to 
stand on the sideline while those policies are abandoned said 
jackson a onetime associate of slain civil rights leader martin 
luther king jr 
bush announced on the eve of the veto vote that he supported the 
president although he said he agreed with the main thrust of the 
bill new jersey gov thomas kean who had endorsed bush just hours 
before the vice president sided with reagan said tuesday it was 
time for bush to start speaking his mind 
the vice president in this instance should have said publicly 
the way he felt he said instead that he was going to be loyal to 
the president kean said 
bush wasnt the only one put on the spot by the veto override 
bob dole who did not vote on tuesday said if he were casting the 
deciding vote he would have sided with the president but he 
indicated tuesday night on cnns larry king live that 
otherwise he would have voted for the override 
dole stressed hes not conceding the nomination yet but said 
he wouldnt mind if his wife elizabeth ended up on a ticket with 
bush 
it would be all right with me he said id probably get a 
car and driver out of it 
mrs dole stepped down as transportation secretary to campaign

the government reported wednesday that the 
us economy performed even better than previously thought from 
october through december growing at a robust 48 percent rate 
which further eased fears of a recession triggered by the october 
stock market collapse 
the commerce department said the increase in the gross national 
product the total output of goods and services was the fastest 
advance in almost two years and represented an upward revision from 
last month when the gnp gain was put at a slightly lower 45 
percent 
especially encouraging to economists was the upward revision in 
particular sectors the new gnp report said that both consumer 
spending and business investment were not as weak as previously 
feared and us export sales were even stronger than originally 
reported 
when the fourth quarter gnp report was first released many 
economists expressed concern because the bulk of the growth came 
from production of unsold goods which was occurring at the same 
time that consumer spending was falling sharply 
many analysts worried that this overhang of excess business 
inventories would cause a big drop in factory production and job 
layoffs at a time when consumers were already worried about the 
impact of the huge 508point drop in the stock market which 
occurred on oct 19 
some analysts even forecast that a recession would start in 
early 1988 caused by weak consumer spending and falling industrial 
production 
but the economic evidence so far this year shows those worries 
were overstated many analysts while still looking for 
significantly slower growth than last year are now predicting the 
economy will get through this presidential election year without a 
downturn 
one thing is clear the economy has shrugged off oct 19 
pretty well said donald straszheim chief economist for merrill 
lynch we will not have a recession in 1988 
the brighter economic outlook is certain to cheer republicans 
campaigning to hold onto the white house president reagan 
speaking to a group of business executives wednesday boasted that 
the country is now in the midst of its longest peacetime economic 
recovery with the percentage of the labor force at work at an 
alltime high 
with the new revisions the economy during 1987 grew 4 percent 
almost double the 22 percent increase turned in during 1986 and 
the best showing since 1984 this figure measures growth from the 
fourth quarter averaging all the quarters the gnp grew 29 
percent in 1987 identical to 1986 
the administration is forecasting gnp growth of 24 percent this 
year with almost half of that gain expected to come from a further 
rise in export sales 
private economists whose original forecasts were well below 
that estimate have been busy revising their own projections upward 
william dunkelberg dean of the business school at temple 
university said he believed many private economists are still 
underestimating economic strength citing the february unemployment 
report which showed the jobless rate dropping to an 8 year low of 
57 percent 
i think the economy is going to look a lot stronger in the 
first half of the year than people have been predicting he said 
we see tremendous strength in the export side of the economy 
the 48 percent gnp growth in the fourth quarter followed growth 
of 43 percent in the julyseptember quarter and was the fastest 
quarterly growth rate since an increase of 54 percent in the first 
three months of 1986 
the rapid growth occurred without a pickup in inflation a 
price index tied to the gnp rose at an annual rate of 36 percent 
in the fourth quarter little changed from a 34 percent third 
quarter increase 
in a second report the commerce department said us 
corporations aftertax profits rose 16 percent in the fourth 
quarter closing out a year in which business profits shot up 84 
percent reflecting the boom in export sales that boosted the 
fortunes of american manufacturing companies

the state council on the arts under fire 
for funding homosexualoriented art projects espouses freedom of 
expression and not points of view chairwoman kitty carlisle hart 
said wednesday 
the process is like democracy the actress told a joint 
legislative committee hearing it may not be perfect but its 
the best thing weve got 
hart was summoned before the assembly and senate arts committees 
following a new york post report last week that the council had 
provided 7200 to help pay for a photographic exhibit on 
transvestism sponsored by the national gay and lesbian task force 
fund for human dignity 
other council grants went to create an archive on gay and 
lesbian writers and to fund a feminist magazine with an emphasis on 
writing by lesbians 
hart who complained of being put on the hot seat said the 
council supports a variety of groups in the name of artistic 
expression 
we fund art she said we are neutral as far as anyone 
else is concerned we dont fund anyones point of view 
about 100 spectators watched the hearing with the majority 
applauding lawmakers who defended harts viewpoint 
assemblyman philip healy said the arts council should show 
delicacy and discretion in how it spends taxpayers money he 
said he sees an element of propaganda creeping in with some of 
the programs funded 
to have only one side portrayed on any level be it the war in 
nicaragua or lesbians shows a lack of judgment healy said i 
dont know if this was an overt act or a mistake i hope its a 
mistake 
fellow republican assemblyman frank talomie said the arts 
council should have a greater system of checks and balances to 
ensure proper funding decisions 
i think theres a concern regarding the publics best 
interests and the taxpayers dollar that we have to go back and 
justify to our constituents he said 
hart said each funding request is reviewed by the arts council 
staff and a peer group committee before it is approved or 
turned down by the 20member council council members are appointed 
by the governor and serve without salary 
mary hays the councils executive director said the council 
funded 3633 different programs last year from 6000 requests 
i defy you to find any prejudice or imbalance in what we do 
she said

use data from a nazi poisongas experiment on prisoners of war and 
will study whether such data should ever be used an agency 
official said wednesday 
the decision was prompted by a letter to epa administrator lee 
m thomas from 20 agency employees many of them scientists asking 
that the issue be studied and the report in which the data appeared 
be put on hold 
we dont need this kind of data was thomas response 
according to craig deremer an assistant to the administrator 
the gas is phosgene used as a weapon in world war i and used 
today in the production of other chemicals there is a wealth of 
data from animal experiments and other human exposure 
deremer said thomas was ordering a study of the issue probably 
by the agencys risk assessment forum an interoffice group that 
tries to forge common policies in epas programs 
this has not been nailed down yet deremer said wednesday 
epa has listed phosgene which forms hydrochloric acid in the 
lungs among the most toxic 406 chemicals that communities should 
consider in disaster planning 
small quantities can be deadly since effects may take three or 
four hours to appear the occupational safety and health 
administration permits exposure of only 01 part per million over 
an eighthour shift and says 2 ppm represents imminent danger to 
life or health 
the agency is considering whether to add phosgene to the 
airborne chemicals it regulates and as part of that work asked a 
consultant to validate some computer models deremer said it 
was the consultants report that prompted the letter to thomas 
the report of the consultant icfclement inc referred to the 
findings of a french military court which tried those responsible 
for exposing french prisoners to phosgene according to one of the 
signers of the letter who saw the report microbiologist morris 
levin 
levin said he believed the consultant found the court report in 
its own research but deremer said he understood epa officials had 
called it to the attention of icfclement when they discussed the 
work to be performed 
the icfclement vice president in charge did not immediately 
return two telephone calls wednesday 
some have suggested that such data if scientifically sound 
and verifiable should be used if some good to humans can 
result the letter to thomas said others feel that to use such 
data debases us all as a society gives such experiments legitimacy 
and implicitly encourages others perhaps in less exacting 
societies to perform unethical human experiments 
his own view levin said had changed in discussions in the 
group of 20 from acceptance of use to the belief that such findings 
should never be used the use of radiation data by epa and others 
from the us nuclear bombing of hiroshima and nagasaki japan in 
1945 is not in the same category but close levin said 
the german phosgene results he said are useless they had no 
proper controls an untested group used for comparisons and no 
idea what the dose was until halfway through if anyone had brought 
us those results from mice we would have said do it over

a former army captain who was 
paraguays most famed political prisoner fled virtual house arrest 
wednesday with the help of two opposition leaders and sought asylum 
in the colombian embassy residence 
colombian ambassador vicente ramirez emiliani told the 
associated press a diplomatic note had been sent to the paraguayan 
foreign ministry advising that napoleon ortigoza had taken refuge 
in the residence and asked for political asylum 
the colombian government will proceed to study the 
situation he said adding that he did not know how long that 
might take 
hermes rafael saguier a leader of the opposition authentic 
radical liberal party said he and attorney felino amarilla went to 
see ortigoza 56 at the home where he has been held under armed 
guard since completing a 25year prison sentence for his 
involvement in a 1962 slaying and an alleged plot against president 
alfredo stroessner 
at first the guards wouldnt let us in or let ortigoza out 
saguier said by telephone from the embassy residence 
then we asked ortigoza if he was prepared to recover his 
freedom and he said yes and we forced our way past the guards 
and put him in a car and drove him to the residence of the 
colombian ambassador saguier said 
the last thing we heard were three or four shots saguier 
added i cant tell you for sure because we were too scared to 
listen 
saguier said no one was injured 
the opposition leader whose party is a frequent critic of the 
34yearold stroessner government said the colombian residence was 
chosen because it is only a block and a half from where ortigoza 
was confined 
half a dozen armed police blocked the entrance to the embassy 
residence 
ortigoza was released from an asuncion prison on dec 19 and 
confined in a hotel in san estanislao 135 miles northeast of 
asuncion on feb 9 he was taken to asuncion and confined under 
guard in a house belonging to his invalid mother 
saguier said he and amarilla decided to remove ortigoza from the 
home after attorney general clotildo jimenez benitez told reporters 
tuesday that the ortigoza case was closed and the former captain 
was in complete freedom 
questioned about the presence of armed guards at the house the 
attorney general said they had been there to protect ortigoza and 
not restrict him 
ortigoza was sentenced to 25 years in prison in 1962 after he 
confessed to having participated in the slaying of army cadet 
alberto benitez also convicted in the case was sgt guillermo 
ovando who was freed in 1984 after spending 21 years behind bars 
the former captain who never was allowed to appear in court in 
his own defense maintains his confession was obtained under 
torture 
paraguayan human rights leaders have said ortigozas 
imprisonment was meant by the government to serve as a lesson to 
those who might conspire against stroessners authoritarian rule

the men wore firefighting gear and a fire 
truck was parked on the street but the firefighters served a 
search warrant and made an arrest on drug charges 
the men were deputies disguised to trick occupants of the house 
into opening the door it worked but it made fire officials angry 
orange county fire chief john hunt said he didnt know one of 
his subordinates had lent the truck and he said he would not 
permit a recurrence 
people could become suspicious that firefighters are really 
police and real firefighters could come under fire he said 
and hunts boss deputy county administrator phil brown said 
tuesday that nobody told the deputy sheriffs they could use the 
coats hats and boots firefighters wear 
police officials disagreed 
were not at all upset about the way we did this we got two 
stolen guns and some drugs off the street said sheriffs 
spokesman randy means 
i dont think there is any threat to firefighter safety 
said sheriffs sgt mike foreman this was the safest way to 
execute the search warrant it involved us not having to make any 
forced entry 
the head of the 427member firefighters union jerry polk said 
he wouldnt object in some situations such as those involving 
hostages 
lets say there was a kid in there and the police needed a 
decoy to get in that is within the realm of reasonable judgment 
polk said but going into the criminal community is a daily 
occurrence the police world deals with to intermingle the fire 
department which has no protection well thats not a very smart 
move 
deputies arrested sammie battle 66 on a charge of possession 
of cocaine they said they found less than a fifth of an ounce of 
rock cocaine also seized were two stolen guns battle was released 
on bond

mikhail s gorbachev called for greater freedom 
for collective farmers and other cooperatives wednesday to 
rejuvenate the soviet unions struggling agricultural sector and 
enable the nation to feed itself 
gorbachev called the possibilities of cooperatives a brilliant 
discovery of soviet founder vladimir i lenin that had been 
underused and even despised by subsequent rulers 
we should revive coops not in their old often tooprimitive 
forms but in the form of a modern highstandard cooperative 
movement extensively integrated with governmentrun enterprises 
and organizations he said speaking at the first national 
congress of collective farmers to be held since 1969 
the soviet leaders remarks opening the threeday session in the 
kremlin were carried by the official tass news agency and broadcast 
on staterun tv 
collective farms where members of a cooperative jointly own 
farm buildings and machinery and share in earnings have faded in 
recent decades in favor of state farms where workers like 
employees in a factory have traditionally received a basic wage 
there were 33000 collective farms or kolkhozes in the 
soviet union in 1970 but their number dropped to 26300 by 1986 
in that same period the number of collective farmers dropped from 
167 million to 126 million 
gorbachev has been striving to persuade soviets to enter into 
cooperative ventures to make up for shortages in the staterun 
economy under reforms instituted last year nearly 14000 
cooperatives have sprung up to offer restaurant services pump gas 
make clothes and provide other goods and services in short supply 
starting in the late 1920s when josef v stalin was soviet 
leader cooperatives were liquidated and kolkhozes were transformed 
into stateowned farms a taste for giant staterun enterprises was 
accompanied by bans on private farm plots gorbachev said 
the consequences of such an attitude to kolkhozes to 
cooperatives as a whole are wellknown he said to it must be 
laid the delayed solution of the food problem the deficit and 
narrowness of an assortment of many consumer goods the limited 
nature of the service sector 
soviet agriculture has been plagued for decades by central 
planners who tell farms what and how much to plant lack of 
incentives for farmers to work the stateowned land inefficient 
production and poor storage and transportation facilities 
gorbachev said grain harvests meat production and milk supplies 
are improving but the soviet union still is forced to spend 
millions of dollars of its hard currency every year for imported 
grain 
a wider role for kolkhozes and coop ventures should help the 
country become selfsufficient in foodstuffs gorbachev said 
by breeding the feeling of ownership initiative and 
enterprise coops are able to render substantial help in solving 
the food problem in increasing the output of goodquality consumer 
goods gorbachev said 
to define the widened prerogatives and responsibilities now 
envisioned for cooperatives a draft law was published this month 
in the press that prohibits government interference in their 
affairs 
gorbachev said the new law aims to ensure the enhancement and 
development of cooperative and collectivefarm property and 
create legal machinery to protect cooperative democracy 
he said however that the land farmed by kolkhoz members would 
continue to belong to the state the law also foresees a 
progressive tax system to catch what gorbachev has called 
moneygrabbing 
his reemphasis on cooperatives is a result of greater democracy 
in soviet society and an important lever for furthering the 
democratic process and combatting administration by fiat and red 
tape he said 
gorbachev the son of a south russian peasant was the communist 
party official responsible for agriculture before becoming the 
partys general secretary in march 1985 
he said it was essential to increase the growth rate of grain 
harvests by at least 50 percent and to begin harvesting from 260 
million to 280 million tons of grain annually under the next 
fiveyear economic plan in 199095 
grain harvests for the past two years have been about 210 
million tons well above figures for the previous several years but 
below the government targets of about 240 million tons which 
western experts regard as unrealistic 
he also stressed the importance of the small individual plots 
whose produce soviet farmers are allowed to sell for themselves 
and called for steps to help people manage them 
gorbachev said the ruling politburo had decided to hold a 
special meeting of the central committee the partys policymaking 
body to consider national agricultural policy 
reforms enacted last year permit the farms to sell directly to 
shops and restaurants up to 30 percent of the fruits and vegetables 
planners require them to produce excess production can be sold at 
farmers markets where prices are not controlled or to state 
stores

michael dukakis fighting to establish himself as the democratic 
presidential frontrunner picked up a key endorsement wednesday 
but also came under fire from rival richard gephardt for his trade 
views and from republican bob dole for a failure of vision on 
foreign policy 
new jersey sen bill bradley once mentioned as a possible 
candidate for the democratic nomination announced his support for 
dukakis at an old railroad terminal in jersey city nj 
among the candidates of both parties he would make the best 
president and among the democratic candidates he is the one who 
can beat george bush bradley said with the candidate by his side 
the senator said dukakis can defeat the vice president in 
november because he is tenacious innovative resilient and 
disciplined 
dukakis who is expected to draw strong support in the states 
june 7 primary election with the endorsement called bradleys 
decision a very important endorsement because it comes from one 
of the most respected and one of the most accomplished public 
figures in america today 
dole setting aside his attacks on republican rival george bush 
focused on the democrats in general and dukakis in particular in a 
foreign policy speech at the center for strategic and international 
studies in washington 
after the speech dole flew to hartford conn to address the 
state legislature but before he landed top connecticut gop 
officials announced their backing of bush for the presidential 
nomination 
bush and dukakis were heavily favored to win most of the 
delegates at stake next tuesday when connecticut holds its 
presidential primary 
in his washington speech dole said dukakis says that the 
monroe doctrine which has defined americas security in its own 
neighborhood for some 200 years is obsolete he said this 
country has no choice but to tolerate the existence of soviet 
client states wherever subversion might install them 
the kansas senator went on to say that what we see on 
democratic side of this presidential campaign is a failure of nerve 
as well as a failure of vision 
michigan which holds democratic caucuses on saturday was the 
next major battleground for dukakis and his rivals and gephardt 
was hammering away at the massachusetts governor for allegedly 
waffling on trade 
the gephardt campaign produced a sheaf of dukakis quotes 
opposing trade legislation and used them to support the missouri 
congressmans contention that dukakis support for senate trade 
legislation was a political ploy to win workers votes in 
michigan 
the president of the united states today has all the authority 
he needs to do something about those unfair trade practices 
gephardt quoted dukakis as saying during a debate last august in 
iowa we dont need more laws or more amendments 
campaigning in michigan gephardt asked who is for a tough 
trade policy who is going to be for a tough trade policy after 
michigan dick gephardt is mike dukakis hasnt been isnt and 
wont be 
the dukakis campaign produced a taperecorded interview in which 
dukakis praised the senate trade measure as long ago as last year 
i think the senate bill which is very very different from 
the gephardt amendment is sound policy i would have voted for 
it the governor told the des moines register on july 11 
a new michigan poll commissioned by detroit television station 
wjbk said dukakis was leading in the state with 35 percent support 
jesse jackson had 29 percent gephardt 17 percent sen albert gore 
jr 6 percent and sen paul simon 5 percent with 9 percent 
undecided 
connecticut gop state chairman robert s poliner announced his 
support for bush saying among republicans i believe george bush 
has the best chance of winning the presidency in 1988 
im sure that a connecticut ticket led by george bush and 
us sen lowell weicker will be strongly supported by many 
independents and democrats as well as most republicans and will 
give connecticut republicans a chance to increase our numbers in 
congress and in the state legislature poliner added predicting 
that bush would take 25 of the 35 connecticut delegates at stake in 
next weeks primary 
a poll published wednesday by the hartford courant showed bush 
favored by 64 percent of likely gop voters while his nearest 
rival dole is the choice of 20 percent the margin of error for 
the random sampling of 432 likely republican voters was 55 percent 
gore also talked about trade as he toured a giant iron ore 
processing plant in ishpeming mich and said we have to take 
steps to remove unfair trade barriers overseas 
in london democrats living overseas picked a largely 
uncommitted delegation to the partys national convention dukakis 
who won a nonbinding preference poll picked up a fraction of a 
delegate 
democrats abroad send 22 delegates to the convention where they 
will cast nine votes nine of those delegates were uncommitted one 
was backing dukakis

corporations aftertax profits shot up 84 
percent in 1987 the best performance in three years as american 
manufacturers benefited from the weaker dollar the government 
reported wednesday 
the commerce department said aftertax profits rose to 1374 
billion last year the first increase since a 12 percent rise in 
1984 
in 1985 corporate profits plunged 123 percent and they dipped 
another 1 percent in 1986 as the widening trade deficit cut into 
sales by american manufacturing firms 
us companies have been enjoying an export boom this past year 
as declines in the dollar made american products competitive again 
on overseas markets 
for us manufacturing 1987 was a turnaround year exports 
rose and american companies benefited tremendously from previous 
costcutting measures said allen sinai chief economist for the 
boston co 
analysts said the rise in profits was particularly significant 
because it occurred at the same time corporate taxes were being 
boosted substantially by the landmark 1986 tax overhaul law 
sinai predicted further gains in corporate profits in 1988 
estimating they should rise by between 6 percent and 7 percent 
we will see continued increases in corporate profits until the 
start of the next recession he said 
the report said the dividends corporations paid to stockholders 
rose along with their improved profit picture increasing 81 
percent to 938 billion this followed a 68 percent increase in 
dividends paid out in 1986 
for the fourth quarter aftertax profits rose 16 percent at a 
quarterly rate following a 55 percent increase in the third 
quarter

corporate leaders on wednesday described the 
nightmares of doing business with federal agencies that refuse to 
pay their bills on time and pleaded with congress to crack down on 
washingtons bureaucratic deadbeats 
small businesses cannot afford to carry any customer for an 
indefinite period of time even if it is the us government 
joseph a schaedel of the national federation of independent 
business told a house hearing 
kenton pattie of the international communications industries 
association said the defense department was more than 19 months 
late paying its 142415 bill to a small virginia supplier and 
didnt pay the delinquent penalty required by law 
worse he said an alabama company waited nearly two years 
before the air force paid the 8833 due for some playground 
equipment after sen howell heflin dala was enlisted to exert 
pressure 
when the air force check finally arrived the company was 
cheated out of 64821 in interest penalties 
one contractor frustrated after waiting three months for the 
navy to pay for a shipment of steel pipe drove a truck to the main 
gate at the philadelphia naval shipyard and told guards we want 
it back the navy returned the goods pattie said 
an august 1986 report by the general accounting office the 
investigative arm of congress estimated that 24 percent of all 
federal agency bills were unpaid for more than 30 days 
members of a house government operations subcommittee listened 
sympathetically as other legislators and witnesses for small 
businesses industrial contractors and trade associations urged 
congress to close loopholes in the 1982 prompt payment act which 
requires the federal government to pay its bills within 30 days 
the witnesses endorsed amendments which the senate approved 
unanimously last october that would provide a stricter statutory 
definition of when a federal agency receives an invoice which 
triggers the 30day time clock for payment 
the senate bill also would set a fiveday limit for an agency to 
accept or reject a suppliers goods or services eliminate a 15day 
grace period for payment of late penalties require automatic 
payment of penalties with a double penalty if not paid within 10 
days and prohibit agencies from taking an earlypayment discount 
after payment is due 
raymond s wittig of the us chamber of commerce said the 
governments late payment of bills causes the most damage to small 
businesses which lack large capital funds and depend heavily on 
cash flow to finance their operations 
they often do not have the resources to battle the federal 
bureaucracy over late or incorrect payments wittig said as a 
result small businesses concentrate on selling to customers who 
pay on time 
he added if the government does not pay on time all 
taxpayers and citizens are injured because fewer businesses choose 
to sell to the government this decreased competition raises the 
costs of goods and services purchased by the government

scientists have triggered 
diseasefighting defenses in bone marrow transplant recipients with 
an experimental procedure a scientist said wednesday 
the recipients had their immune system defenses raised against 
poisons that are produced by tetanus and diphtheria bacteria 
showing they benefited from vaccines given marrow donors a week 
before the marrow was harvested said albert donnenberg of johns 
hopkins university in baltimore 
those diseases are not particular problems in marrow recipients 
but the experiment suggests that a similar process might one day 
protect against potentially lethal fungal and viral infections that 
do appear in recipients he said 
recipients had to be immunized within 35 days of their marrow 
transplants or else the transferred immunity was lost he said 
donnenberg described results to science writers at a seminar 
sponsored by the american cancer society 
marrow transplants are performed in cases where radiation or 
chemotherapy for cancer is powerful enough to destroy a patients 
own marrow bone marrow produces the white blood cells of the 
immune system as well as red blood cells and platelets 
the experiment included 38 recipients who got marrow from 
immunized donors that was then treated with a technique designed to 
prevent graftversushost disease this is a potentially fatal 
complication in which immune system cells from transplanted marrow 
attack the recipients body 
the technique uses a centrifuge to strip the marrow of about 99 
percent of the white blood cells called lymphocytes that cause 
graftversushost disease 
the experiment designed to look for side effects rather than 
effectiveness found the technique did little to reduce the 
incidence of the disease but it did appear to reduce the number of 
moderate to severe cases in comparison to standard experience with 
nontreated marrow donnenberg said 
the transfer of vaccine effects from donor to recipient occurred 
because the processing of the marrow enriched it in the 
lymphocytes remaining with a memory for the vaccine 
donnenberg said 
such transfer has been shown before said david golde chief of 
hematology and oncology at the university of california los 
angeles school of medicine 
a key research problem now is how to retain some 
diseasefighting capability in marrow recipients but not enough to 
trigger graftversushost disease he said in a telephone interview 
another study reported at the meeting found that cancer patients 
whose marrow had been destroyed by therapy regained marrow function 
after injections of their own blood cells 
such injections may allow aggressive cancer treatment in 
patients who cannot get marrow transplants or store some of their 
own marrow for use after cancer treatment said margaret kessinger 
of the university of nebraska college of medicine in omaha 
marrow transplant experts said the techniques nearterm 
usefulness would be limited but that it may have potential for 
wider use 
kessinger said the experimental technique begins with extracting 
white blood cells from a patients blood 
the goal is to harvest a kind of cell called the pluripotent 
stem cell which essentially replaces lost bone marrow 
kessinger described a study of 26 patients who went through that 
procedure and received the injections of blood cells rather than 
marrow after cancer therapy 
in comparison to 83 patients whose marrow had been harvested by 
conventional means and later returned the experimental group first 
showed white cells in the blood three days sooner for an average 
of eight days after the procedure she said 
both groups took the same amount of time to recover other marrow 
function she said

the worlds only coon dog graveyard 
may need the help of some patrol hounds to keep vandals at bay 
caretakers of the key underwood coon dog memorial graveyard in 
northwest alabama say vandals have damaged the unique tombstones 
and littered the tourist attraction with beer and soda cans the 
florence timesdaily reported sunday 
it used to happen just once in a while william o bolton of 
russellville secretarytreasurer of the tennessee valley coon 
hunters association told the newspaper but its been happening 
more frequently lately 
underwood started the graveyard when he buried his coon dog 
troop on the 10acre site in 1937 many of the graves are marked 
with elaborate epitaphs stones with statues of dogs or wooden 
crosses 
i just think some people are jealous for some reason said 
bolton i think they go out there and drink beer and smoke pot 
and i guess they want to do something bad before they leave 
erecting a tall fence around the graveyard as some people have 
suggested is not a solution because it would discourage visitors

the kremlin on wednesday rejected demands by 
armenians who want to control an area of neighboring azerbaijan 
and it threatened to crack down on armenian activists who cause 
further ethnic unrest 
the presidium of the supreme soviet the countrys highest 
executive body did not directly address armenian demands to annex 
the nagornokarabakh region of azerbaijan but it made it clear 
that the government would not bend to pressure to change internal 
borders 
at least 32 people were killed in riots after armenians demanded 
that the predominantly armenian section of azerbaijan be united 
with armenia aremenians are mostly christian while the azeris are 
mostly moslem 
in what appeared to be the soviet unions definitive statement 
on the territorial dispute the presidium ordered government 
ministries to make efforts to improve the economic social and 
cultural development of the nagornokarabakh autonomous region 
armenian activists have said such efforts would not meet their 
demands 
the meeting attended by soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev 
president andrei a gromyko and other senior officials was held 
after carefully orchestrated appeals by 13 soviet other republics 
a statement carried by the tass news agency said it was 
intolerable to use pressure to resolve complicated 
nationalterritorial issues 
such actions can lead to unpredictable consequences tass 
said 
armenians held a series of large protests in february to demand 
that nagornokarabakh which is threequarters armenian be annexed 
from azerbaijan ethnic rioting broke out in the azerbaijani city 
of sumgait on feb 28 and officials said 32 people were killed 
armenian activists put the death toll at 78 armenians killed by 
azerbaijanis most armenians are christian while azerbaijanis are 
predominantly shiite moslem 
the soviet officials condemned violence that caused loss of life 
and also called on armenian and azerbaijani officials to bring to 
strict account those who by their actions destabilize the 
situation 
that statement appeared to indicate an impending crackdown on 
armenian activists and on those arrested for taking part in 
violence 
in early february the policymaking communist party central 
committee turned down an appeal by armenians to annex 
nagornokarabakh but gorbachev promised in a feb 26 speech that 
the regions problems would be considered when the central 
committee meets to discuss problems between the soviet unions 
nationalities 
as recently as march 17 communist party officials in 
nagornokarabakh appealed for permission to join the armenian 
republic 
before the governments decision wednesday armenian activists 
had been planning a meeting for march 26 to determine their course 
of action 
wednesdays pronouncement was seen as an attempt to discourage 
further protests 
the presidium said armenian and azerbaijani officials must speak 
out against any nationalistic or extremist manifestation 
protect the rights of citizens of all nationalities it ordered 
armenia azerbaijan the national prosecutors office and the 
interior ministry to ensure order 
the soviet leadership also demanded that armenian and 
azerbaijani officials drastically improve their political and 
education work to ensure that riots do not happen again 
the presidiums pronouncement came at a time when the official 
press had started to sharply criticize armenian activists 
the activists said 7000 people turned out in yerevan on monday 
to protest an article by the communist party daily newspaper pravda 
that said the annexation campaign had a clear antisocialist 
spirit 
y arakyelan an armenian correspondent whose name was one of 
three attached to the article later disassociated himself from it 
at a news conference sponsored by the soviet foreign ministry 
yulian bromley director of the soviet unions institute of ethnic 
studies indicated that top government and party officials soon 
would establish an apparatus for handling differences between 
soviet republics after many years of pretending they did not exist 
but he and the institutes deputy director solomon bruk said 
transferring territory from one republic to another would not help 
gorbachevs effort to restructure soviet society bruk said 
economic development rather than ethnic differences would be a more 
likely reason for any changes in internal borders 
earlier wednesday moscow authorities sent home an armenian 
activist who had been providing foreign journalists with 
information about the unrest 
alexander ogorodnikov a moscow religious activist said paryur 
arikyan was put on a plane for yerevan the armenian capital

japan and the nato allies are doing more to 
ensure the free worlds security than they get credit for but the 
administration will continue to press them to assume a larger share 
of the burden defense secretary frank c carlucci said wednesday 
in a 14page report requested by congress carlucci said i 
intend to follow up personally on this issue and to reiterate at 
every opportunity the need for progress in improving both allied 
defense capabilities and the equity with which the roles risks and 
burdens of the alliance are shared 
carlucci while promising a more extensive report later this 
spring said it appeared that japan and eight european countries 
might have increased their defense spending by 3 percent or more in 
1987 matching the nato goal 
he identified the eight as greece italy luxembourg norway 
spain turkey france and portugal 
only greece however appears to be allocating as much of its 
gross national product to defense as the united states and there 
are substantial variations in the performance among the individual 
allies carlucci wrote 
while some are doing at least their fair share others are 
making a contribution that can best be characterized as mixed and 
a few are doing far less than their fair share he continued 
progress to date has likewise been mixed with the good 
performers generally making the greatest improvements in their 
defense postures while the others fall further behind

authorities have 
reopened hueco tanks to rock climbers ending a threeweek 
moratorium that gave rangers time to remove bolts climbers hammered 
into the rock to aid tricky maneuvers 
park officials had feared the bolts might have destroyed ancient 
indian rock paintings but said they found no damage 
hours after the moratorium was lifted friday park rangers were 
fielding calls from as far as europe 
hueco tanks is one of two good winterclimbing spots in the 
united states david cottom spokesman for the texas parks and 
wildlife department said wednesday the world climbing community 
is tightknit you wouldnt believe how fast word gets around 
officials closed the 860acre park about 35 miles east of el 
paso to climbers after rangers discovered the steel bolts they said 
had been placed mostly by european visitors some climbers had even 
used epoxy to create handholds and footholds on the sheer rock 
faces 
climbers often embed bolts into rock to secure safety ropes 
most climbers use bolts only to halt falls and consider it cheating 
to use them as handholds or footholds 
a lot of bolts are for safety but these arent for 
safety said ranger bob parker pointing at three bolts in the 
face of a 30foothigh boulder bolts like these are for 
acrobatics thats what we disagree with 
rangers removed 23 bolts and epoxy handholds and filled the 
holes with brown epoxy to blend in with the rock parker said 
drilling bolts is banned at hueco tanks though rangers have 
decided to leave bolts necessary for safety on the many established 
routes 
and park officials plan to call a conference of climbers next 
month or next winter to discuss the ethics of bolting a hot topic 
in climbing circles 
parker said he hoped the moratorium and the conference will get 
climbers to police themselves and report illegal bolting 
park officials want to make sure everyone follows the rules 
because the sport is growing fast at hueco tanks cottom said 
several hundred climbers from the americas europe and asia 
traveled to hueco tanks this winter a few years ago most of the 
parks climbers were from texas and new mexico 
hueco tanks and joshua tree national monument east of los 
angeles are the most popular north american winter climbing sites

israeli fighterbombers blasted 
palestinian and moslem guerrilla bases on the outskirts of sidon on 
wednesday destroying at least six in israels second 
antiguerrilla air strike in a week 
police said four skyhawks and eight phantom f4s roared in at 
405 pm and staged eight divebombing and rocketing runs in a 
onehour raid 
at least five bases manned by guerrillas of terrorist mastermind 
abu nidals fatahrevolutionary council went up in flames in the 
villages of bekesta majdelyoun and salhiyeh near sidons ein 
elhilweh refugee camp police said 
one rocket struck a guerrilla arms depot in bekesta setting off 
a twohour chain of ammunition explosions that demolished the 
building police said 
in a military communique fatahrevolutionary council claimed the 
jets raided only one of the organizations positions it vowed 
to severely strike back against the zionist enemys arrogance and 
barbarism at the adequate time and venue 
the attacks left a number of our heroic fighters martyred or 
wounded we will announce specific figures in a later communique 
the statement said this crime will be added to the black record 
of the zionist enemy 
a base of the moscoworiented democratic front for the 
liberation of palestine also was destroyed as the jets fired 25 
rockets and dozens of delayedaction bombs in the area police 
reported 
they said the warplanes also hit sidons power plant plunging 
the city into darkness sidon residents watched the raid from 
balconies 
guerrillas cordoned off the stricken targets after the raid 
preventing police and reporters from getting a casualty figure 
however police said two boys aged five and 10 were rushed to 
sidons hammoud hospital from bekesta 
israel radios hebrew broadcast said explosions in sidon 
prevented red cross vehicles from reaching the bombed areas it 
said residents of sidon and its palestinian refugee camps closed 
their stores and rushed in panic to bomb shelters 
a communique from the democratic front for the liberation of 
palestine said an unspecified number of lebanese civilians were 
injured in the raid 
the escalation of the enemys aggression reflects the 
deepening crisis engulfing israel as a result of the continuous 
palestinian uprising in the occupied west bank and gaza strip 
said the communique released in beirut 
it described the raid as the first fruit of israeli prime 
minister yitzhak shamirs recent visit to washington 
the israeli command said its planes destroyed buildings used by 
guerrillas for storing military hardware and vehicles 
police said israeli gunboats cruised off sidon 25 miles south 
of beirut during and after the raid it was israels fourth into 
lebanon this year 
the israelis said all planes returned safely to their bases and 
that the pilots reported accurate hits 
sidon police said the israeli pilots released air balloons that 
deflected waves of heatseeking sam7 missiles shoulderfired by 
guerrillas 
a communique issued by the popular liberation army militia of 
sidons sunni moslem nasserite leader mustafa saad said its 
positions east of the city were also hit by the israeli jets 
it charged the air attack was aimed at breaking the 
lebanesepalestinian nationalist alliance

the supreme court was urged wednesday to allow 
states to place strict new regulations on professional 
organizations that solicit contributions for charities 
attorney general lacy h thornburg of north carolina said the 
rules his state seeks to impose would not violate freespeech 
rights 
professional fundraisers are keeping too much of the money 
he said we want it to go back to the charities 
but charitable groups said if the north carolina plan were 
adopted nationwide it would severely threaten their ability to 
raise money 
the north carolina regulations invalidated by a lower court 
force fundraisers to tell prospective contributors what percentage 
of the money the solicitors raised over the past 12 months had been 
used for expenses and the fundraisers fees 
the law also could limit the fees paid by charities to the 
professional fundraisers a licensing provision of the statute 
presumes that in most cases if more than 35 percent of donations 
goes for the solicitors fee that is unreasonable 
errol copilevitz an attorney representing professional 
fundraisers and charities said the law creates a real and 
present danger of censorship 
im telling you professional representatives will not make 
their services available if this regulation is allowed to stand 
he said 
copilevitz particularly challenged the requirement that 
solicitors tell a prospective contributor at the outset how much 
money goes for expenses that could cripple fundraising over the 
phone he said 
by the time the solicitor provides that information he will 
have received a dial tone copilevitz said adding high costs 
are not a measure of fraud or the worth of a charity 
the north carolina law enacted in 1985 was designed to prevent 
fraud and assure that most of the money goes to charities and not 
fundraising costs 
us district judge earl britt declared the law unconstitutional 
in 1986 
britt said that without the help of professional solicitors 
many charities might be unable to communicate their views and goals 
the judge also said that requiring a solicitor to disclose his 
track record for the past 12 months is not relevant to the 
particular solicitation campaign he is involved with at the time 
during an hour of supreme court arguments wednesday the 
justices briskly questioned lawyers for both sides the court is 
expected to announce a decision by july 
chief justice william h rehnquist compared north carolinas law 
to a state regulation that sets a maximum price on theater tickets 
copilevitz said that would be permissible if the purpose was to 
make artistic performance more widely available 
but when justice antonin scalia asked whether a state could 
place a ceiling on the cost of a renting a hall for a political 
rally copilevitz said that would be unconstitutional 
justice thurgood marshall questioned the authority of states to 
tell charities how to allocate their resources 
could you stop them from throwing away their money he said 
thornburg said the charities need such protection he said a 
survey by north carolina officials showed that from 1980 through 
1984 the five largest professional fundraisers in the state spent 
approximately 80 percent of the money they raised on expenses and 
their fees 
the supreme court in 1980 and 1984 barred states from limiting 
the amount of money charities spend on fundraising thornburg 
argued that those rulings do not preclude the type of regulation 
north carolina seeks to impose 
many states require fundraisers to disclose to regulatory 
agencies how much is spent on expenses 
but copilevitz said north carolinas plan goes far beyond that 
he is representing the national federation of the blind the 
optimist club and professional fundraisers other charities have 
joined in urging the court to declare the north carolina law 
unconstitutional 
the case is riley vs national federal of the blind 87328

portugal has asked the united states to 
equip its air force with f16 fighterbombers to compensate for a 
shortfall in us funds for the use of a strategic air base a 
government official said wednesday 
the official who spoke on condition of anonymity said lisbon 
was seeking substantial us help in modernizing its armed forces 
the military assistance would offset cuts made by the us 
congress in aid paid for use of the midatlantic lajes air base 
prime minister anibal cavaco silva last month formally requested 
a review of the defense agreement under which the united states 
uses the submarinewarfare and refuelling base on the azores 
archipelago because of falling us aid to portugal 
the request for the f16s described as the worlds finest 
fighterbombers was presented to a us military delegation that 
visited lisbon march 15 the official said 
he refused to specify how many f16s portugal is seeking but 
indicated the number requested in the first phase of negotiations 
could approach 50 washington officials are studying the proposals 
he added 
the official said portugal also sought hawk missiles combat 
helicopters sophisticated radar equipment armored personnel 
carriers and m60 combat vehicles from the united states 
portugals request for f16s comes after neighboring spain asked 
the united states withdraw 74 f16s from an air base outside 
madrid there was no indication of where portugal would station the 
planes if they were supplied 
cavaco silva called for a review of the defense agreement after 
congressional cuts caused us aid to portugal to fall from 208 
million in 1985 to 117 million this year 
defense secretary frank carlucci visited lisbon to try to soothe 
portuguese dissatisfaction the two countries agreed to set up a 
joint task force to examine the posssibilities of supplying 
portugal with surplus us military equipment to make up for the 
shortfall in financial assistence 
apparently portugal rejected the offer 
we wanted to take the initiative by informing the united 
states of the equipment we need instead of being presented with a 
list of available surplus material that we can choose from said 
the government official 
he said the proposals for us military equipment supplies were 
based on portugals needs to modernize its armed forces so that it 
could adequately fulfill its defensive role within the north 
atlantic treaty organization

opposition parties on wednesday said 
the government must not cover up the growing scandal involving 
alleged corruption by the brother of former president chun doohwan 
the opposition alleged that corruption by chuns relatives and 
the saemaul development movement was widespread 
saemaul or new community which claims a membership of more 
than 5 million community leaders was formed in 1971 to improve 
rural and urban living standards 
we warn the government against minimizing covering up or 
whitewashing the scandal said park youngsook acting president 
of the party for peace and democracy the rival opposition 
reunification democratic party also called for an independent 
parliamentary probe 
kim taeryong rdp spokesman also demanded an investigation 
into the ilhae foundation a semiofficial think tank established 
by chun 
the government is investigating charges that saemaul while 
headed by chuns younger brother embezzled millions of dollars 
sold patronage and forced donations 
the former president who is on a private visit to the united 
states installed his brother kyunghwan as saemaul head chun 
kyunghwan resigned in 1987 after being linked to gangsters locked 
in a bloody power struggle 
many political observers contend the saemaul probe stemmed from 
a power game between president roh taewoo and chun with rohs 
supporters working to reduce the former presidents power 
roh a former general picked by chun to succeed him is widely 
thought to be building popular support by proving corruption under 
chun roh has promised reforms since he won the countrys first 
democratic election last december 
the new government faces an unavoidable challenge the 
burdensome legacy of the old government dona ilbo an 
influential seoul newspaper said in a commentary 
newspapers said the saemaul probe could be rohs efforts to 
distance himself from chun who tried to retain power but 
governing party officials fear the growing scandal would erode 
their chances in national assembly elections in april 
the prosecutor generals office said wednesday it had questioned 
about 50 government and saemaul officials about allegations of 
fraud embezzlement and influence peddling 
the prosecutors said saemaul was found to have diverted some of 
an estimated 130 million in funds to profitoriented projects 
land speculation and other irregular activities

a house subcommittee has quietly voted to 
delete funding for the trident submarine in next years budget and 
use that 14 billion to build two aegis destroyers instead 
lawmakers disclosed wednesday 
rep sam gejdenson dconn said the house armed services 
seapower subcommittee voted in a closed session tuesday to cut out 
all trident funding for fiscal 1989 a move pushed by rep charles 
e bennett dfla 
bennett chairman of the subcommittee is opposing an 
administration plan to sell two aegis ddg51 destroyers to japan 
fearing that the united states would lose technology secrets 
under the funding plan approved by the subcommittee the 
government would order five aegis warships in 1989 the 
administration had requested three the two extra ships would be 
deployed in japan under us control protecting japanese security 
interests while keeping the aegis technology under wraps 
gejdenson whose district includes the electric boat shipyard 
the division of general dynamics corp that builds tridents sought 
to play down tuesdays vote 
while i am clearly disappointed by the decision of the 
seapower subcommittee the subcommittees decision is only the 
first step in a lengthy and complex budget process gejdenson 
said 
the congressman who is not a member of the armed services 
committee noted that the seapower panel deleted funding for the 
trident two years ago but funding was later restored by congress 
gejdenson said he was confident trident funding would be 
restored again 
but bennett said in a telephone interview that he would fight to 
keep the trident out and the two extra aegis ships in he said the 
program which traditionally calls for one new trident each year 
would be continued in the 1990 budget 
a critical test comes next week when the full committee takes up 
the defense budget 
electric boat is the sole builder of the 18750ton submarine 
which is armed with 24 longrange multiwarhead missiles the subs 
are built at the companys yards in groton conn and north 
kingstown ri

the democratic partys chances in november 
would suffer if a noncandidate such as new york gov mario cuomo 
won the presidential nomination after a deadlocked national 
convention a top party official said wednesday 
it would be a difficult situation and there would be 
increasingly bad feelings lynn cutler vice chairman of the 
democratic national committee said at a news conference to the 
general electorate it might not make any difference at all but to 
the people who have to go out and win the election i think it 
would be very tough 
cuomo has said much the same thing but has refused to rule out 
accepting a draft if the convention is deadlocked he has also 
declined as yet to endorse any of the democratic candidates 
hes fully aware of the power of his endorsement and what it 
means ms cutler said it makes a national statement without 
question i think it would have a big impact in a place like 
california where theres a great deal of affection for the

officials have declared a water shortage 
emergency in the communities east of san francisco and are warning 
they may ration water to 11 million customers for the first time 
in a decade 
if a voluntary conservation plan approved by the east bay 
municipal utility district on tuesday fails the agency may impose 
water restrictions of up to 25 percent for homes and businesses in 
the burgeoning alameda and contra costa counties from may through 
september 
rationing measures under consideration include refusing water 
hookups to new housing developments and restricting new or 
expanded landscaping car washing and street washing swimming 
pools could not be filled after a certain date and lawns could be 
watered just two days a week 
the proposed conservation measures would be the most severe 
steps taken by the district since the 1977 drought when water 
customers were charged up to 10 times the normal rate for excessive 
water use district spokesman gayle montgomery said wednesday 
we dont want to make this a draconian thing but we do want 
to save a lot of water said district general manager jerome 
gilbert at a packed fourhour public hearing tuesday 
from oct 1 to march 1 precipitation was 85 percent of normal 
statewide water officials said that means theres much less snow 
in the mountains ready to melt and flow into rivers and reservoirs 
this spring 
state water resources department engineers said last week that 
river runoffs from snow melt will average below 60 percent of 
normal between april and july statewide even if spring rainfall is 
normal if rainfall stays sparse the situation will be even worse 
at least one farm irrigation district has already declared a 
drought emergency and cut back water allotments to its farmers 
the turlock irrigation district which serves central valley 
farmers in southern stanislaus to northern merced counties said 
farmers will be allotted only about onefourth their typical water 
amount this year 
without question we are in a drought situation said 
district general manager ernest geddes even with normal 
precipitation for the remainder of the spring the tuolumne river 
runoff will total no more than 50 percent of the historical 
average 
in the east bay municipal utility district gilbert said 
reservoirs that are halffull now could be onequarter full by 
september unless there are major storms during the next two months 
runoff this year is the secondlowest year on record in our 
area and follows a year that was the fourthworst said ted way 
the districts chief engineer he predicted this years dry 
conditions will become as severe as those in 1977 
if the dry spells continued into a third year the effect would 
be devastating said montgomery 
san francisco marin and santa clara counties face possible 
water shortages next year but are in better shape than alameda and 
contra costa because they have more water sources and have received 
more storms 
at a meeting in sacramento last week state water experts 
considered whether to declare a drought for the state as a whole 
deciding to take a waitandsee approach for the time being 
every day without a storm the picture gets worse said jack 
pardee a snowpack survey engineer with the state water resources 
department 
but maurice roos chief of the departments water supply branch 
said declaration of a drought is premature because even though 
river runoff from the mountains is substantially below average 
storage in reservoirs is only slightly below normal in most parts 
of the state 
water officials arent the only ones worried about the dry 
weather fire officials say it could be the sign of an early and 
dangerous fire season during the grim fire season last year 
lightningspawned blazes blackened nearly a million acres of mostly 
forest lands in california 
this is very similar to the weather pattern we saw last year 
at this time said maryn pitt assistant director of the state 
department of forestry it will only further distress the 
watershed and to date already this year weve had 520 fires over 
448 acres our 90day forecast for rain is below normal through 
may 
east bay water district directors will consider specific 
rationing proposals april 13 and judging from tuesdays hearing 
the issue threatens to set suburban residents against city dwellers 
i think we should share the pain said sandy skaggs water 
board president and a resident of an affluent development in san 
ramon where suburbanites take their lawns seriously 
but danville mayor beverly lane whose lawn died in the 1977 
drought agreed with landscapers that the area could suffer layoffs 
and financial losses if new landscaping was restricted or valuable 
grasslands allowed to die 
we are the hot weather part of the district lane said 
tuesday during four hours of spirited debate by more than 100 city 
leaders and landscaping and gardening industry representatives 
our needs are different than the cooler parts of the district

in a move some analysts called risky northwest 
airlines announced wednesday it will become the first major us 
airline to ban smoking on all domestic flights except those to and 
from hawaii 
the ban by the minneapolisbased carrier the nations 
fifthlargest airline also covers some foreign routes it goes 
beyond federal regulations that go into effect next month for 
domestic flights lasting two hours or less 
the stringent nonsmoking policy appears to be aimed at 
attracting new passengers but could backfire and cost the carrier 
some traffic some analysts believe 
it does run the risk of some loss of business said james v 
cammisa the publisher of travel industry indicators a new 
yorkbased newsletter i guess they northwest officials really 
stuck their neck out 
wall street seemed unimpressed by northwests smokefree 
innovation the airlines stock closed on the new york stock 
exchange at 4575 per share down 12 cents from tuesday 
the northwest ban is somewhat contentious from a marketing 
point of view said robert joedicke an airline analyst for 
shearson lehman hutton inc if there is a danger why try to be a 
leader 
it is fairly unlikely that the other big us airlines would 
match northwests policy creating a financial risk for the 
carrier some observers believe 
but northwest says the prohibition is a response to its 
passengers and employees requests ab sky magary 
northwests executive vice president for marketing told a news 
conference in new york that while the policy is not without risk 
we believe more nonsmokers will switch to northwest than smokers 
will leave 
he cited a northwest study showing that nine out of 10 
passengers prefer to sit in the nosmoking section of a plane more 
surprisingly about 30 percent of smokers express the desire for 
smokefree flights according to the survey 
the new policy called northwest clears the air will take 
effect on april 23 the same day as the less restrictive federal 
law it will apply to flights within the contiguous 48 states as 
well as flights to and from alaska mexico canada jamaica and the 
cayman islands 
northwest flights to and from hawaii and overseas will continue 
to offer smoking sections because those flights carry a greater 
proportion of foreign passengers who feel differently about the 
issue the airline said in a statement 
we still have competitors that are handing out cigars to 
passengers on board magary said 
about 30 percent of northwests domestic flights last more than 
two hours and could have kept their smoking sections under the new 
federal regulations the longest flights covered by the smoking ban 
are four or five hours according to the airline 
under those rules passengers who insist on lighting up will 
face civil fines of as much as 1000 and passengers who tamper 
with smoke alarms in airplane lavatories will be liable for as much 
as 2000 in penalties 
air canada which banned smoking on some flights between canada 
and the united states last april said it has gained customers as a 
result of its nosmoking policy its been very successful 
said steve pisni a spokesman for the carrier 
northwests announcement drew praise from several quarters 
including officials of the american cancer society the american 
lung association and the us surgeon generals office who 
participated in the news conference with magary 
rep richard durbin dill the prime sponsor of the new 
federal nonsmoking law also hailed northwests move he said he 
is sending letters to all the other major us carriers urging 
them to follow northwests lead 
this action by northwest just proves what weve been saying 
all along cleaning up the air in airplanes is a good business 
decision and a good health decision durbin said 
some travel agents also praised the new policy saying many of 
their customers have been pressing for a tougher stance 
i think its a good move because the public is the one 
that wants it said jack bloch owner of jbs world travel in new 
york

the house approved with rare bipartisanship 
wednesday a 11 trillion budget that would tighten domestic and 
military spending but boost highprofile items including aids 
research education the space program and the war on drugs 
the fiscal 1989 plan which follows the outlines of last falls 
budget summit between president reagan and congressional leaders 
was approved 319 to 102 a majority of both democrats and 
republicans voted in favor of the package 
the house brushed aside criticism from reagans budget director 
who said the plan used accounting gimmicks to stay within the 
prearranged spending limits it also rejected three alternative 
budget proposals 
many members conceded they were putting off tough 
deficitreduction decisions until next year but republicans and 
democrats praised the plan and spent much of the debate reveling 
about the absence of acrimony 
weve got a miracle said house speaker jim wright dtexas 
for the first time in many many years weve seen a budget 
resolution out before cherry blossom time or autumn leaves said 
rep silvio conte rmass 
lawmakers had far less to haggle over than in past years the 
totals for military foreign aid and domestic spending were 
predetermined by last falls summit between reagan and 
congressional leaders the tax increases envisioned in the summit 
14 billion for fiscal 1989 were enacted in december 
using the presidents own optimistic economic estimates the 
budget claimed a 134 billion deficit which is within the limits 
of the grammrudman budget balancing law 
like reagans plan the house budget would not touch social 
security the lawmakers rejected a cut in medicare the 
administration said was needed they also refused to go along with 
reagans plan to eliminate some domestic development and mass 
transit programs 
instead the electionyear plan would give most federal agencies 
a little more money to spend than in the current year but not 
enough to keep pace with inflation 
in addition the agencies would be required to find enough 
savings to absorb half of a 3 percent pay raise for federal 
employees reagan had proposed a 43 percent pay boost for the 
militay and 2 percent for civilian workers but the house made them 
equally 3 percent 
in selected areas spending was increased the budget authorizes 
15 billion for aids research a little more than reagan proposed 
and it would increase space and science spending though not as 
much as the president asked 
the 134 billion deficit figure for the year beginning oct 1 
was about 5 billion above the presidents mark largely because 
reagan wanted to sell more government assets the deficit in fiscal 
1987 was 1504 billion the administration estimates it will go 
down to 1467 billion this year 
the house budget claimed to hit exactly the limits in the budget 
summit pact for cash outlays and for budget authority the legal 
obligations by agencies for spending that could stretch over more 
than one fiscal year 
the pact included 2995 billion in budget authority and 2940 
billion in outlays for the military 1481 billion in budget 
authority and 1692 billion in outlays for annually appropriated 
domestic programs and 181 billion in budget authority and 161 
billion in outlays on foreign aid 
in crafting the budget the house budget committee ran into 
difficulty meeting the limits on domestic spending authority in 
the end the panel reclassified about 37 billion in spending 
authority out from under the categories covered by the agreement 
james c miller iii director of the white house office of 
management and budget said in a letter he was disturbed by the 
accounting shift in addition he said there appeared to be 
deliberate underfunding of certain programs that would require a 
supplemental appropriation next year 
rep william h gray iii dpa chairman of the budget 
committee said he considered millers letter a sign that the 
administration would keep working with congress to control 
spending he called the dispute a scorekeeping issue that would 
be resolved later 
the budget technique could lead to higher spending allowances 
when the fiscal blueprint is translated later into actual pending 
bills several lawmakers said that while the budget was in the 
spirit of the bipartisan summit it also avoided any tough 
belttightening in an election year 
this budget is in a real sense a delay budget said rep 
charles schumer dny 
next year is going to be the real problem said rep amory 
houghton rny 
the house approval of the budget was far earlier than in past 
years but it was still unlikely that congress would meet its april 
15 deadline for final approval of a budget resolution 
senate majority leader robert c byrd dwva said wednesday 
he did not expect full senate action on the budget before the 
second week of april

eugene oneills classic desire under the elms 
played to a soldout audience on a moscow stage wednesday night 
the first play directed by an american in the soviet union 
mark lamos 42 artistic director of the hartford stage co of 
connecticut received a standing ovation after the opening 
performance of oneills 1924 play about the struggle for dominance 
between father and son on a 19thcentury new england farm 
lamos had to confront linguistic and cultural barriers in 
bringing the play before a soviet audience 
the 870 people at the performance applauded politely in rhythm 
for the soviet actors and then rose to applaud energetically for 
lamos 
the director wearing a dappled blazer and red tie was given an 
ornately painted samovar and bouquet of flowers he plucked one out 
and presented it to the lead actress nina popova who was still in 
tears from the final wrenching scene 
the feeling of great personality is missing alexander 
aronov who writes for the youth newspaper moskovsky komsomolets 
said in an interview 
he said he believed lamos strayed from oneills conception 
although the actors movements and attire seemed more american than 
previous soviet performances of the play he had seen 
lamos said he believed his version was closer to oneills 
because the original russian translation was too poetic and smooth 
he said during a break in a rehearsal tuesday that he tried to tone 
down what he called the overemotional and unnatural style of the 
actors 
several soviets in the audience said they found the language in 
lamos version too crude 
aronov said part of the blame should be placed on the actors of 
moscows pushkin theater with the exception of ms popova 
oneill and tennessee williams are the best known and best loved 
american playwrights in the soviet union lamos said soviets know 
little about other american playwrights especially more 
contemporary ones whose work he prefers and was unhappy with the 
choice of desire under the elms for his direction 
the exposition of the play is a bit crudely done lamos said 
the play was chosen by the pushkin theaters artistic director 
yuri yeremin as an appropriate way to celebrate the centennial of 
oneills 1888 birth 
desire under the elms was the first play performed in the 
pushkin theater in 1926 and has become a standard in the soviet 
repertoire 
lamos was invited to stage the play in moscow after he met a 
group of soviet theater directors in new york last summer 
another american nagle jackson of the mccarter theater in 
princeton nj is directing a production of the glass 
menagerie by williams that is scheduled to open later this year 
at leningrads gorky theater two other americans are scheduled to 
direct plays in moscow in the fall 
lamos relied on a soviet interpreter to communicate with the 
allsoviet cast and crew 
language difficulties seemed especially severe when he was first 
reviewing the script with the actors and came across the phrase 
to pull the wool over his eyes he recalled 
when lamos explained that the phrase meant to fool someone the 
actors came up with a russian equivalent which translates into 
he has noodles on his ears 
the american didnt believe the expression was appropriate but 
he said one participant chimed in let me put it this way mark 
weve had noodles over our ears in this country for 70 years

police on wednesday said they 
were abandoning their policy of staying away from ira funerals 
following the slayings of five people including two british 
soldiers at rites last week 
prime minister margaret thatcher joined grieving relatives at 
northolt air base near london as the bodies of two british soldiers 
arrived home and were lifted from a transport plane to the strains 
of chopins funeral march 
mrs thatchers appearance marked the first time a prime 
minister had watched the coffins of soldiers brought home from 
northern ireland in the nearly 20 years since britain deployed 
troops in the province 
in central belfast police mounted heavy patrols at the cenotaph 
as 25000 people turned out for an emotional service for the 
soldiers 
the two corporals were dragged from their unmarked car beaten 
stripped and shot after they drove up to an irish republican army 
funeral on saturday no police had been assigned to the funeral 
a british army spokesman said that a security patrol ordered to 
intervene after an army helicopter reported disturbances at 
saturdays funeral arrived within three minutes of the shots 
having been fired at the british soldiers 
at another unpoliced ira funeral in belfast on march 16 a 
protestant fired shots and hurled hand grenades at mourners 
killing three people and wounding 68 
the nopolice policy was implemented at the march 16 funeral 
when three ira guerrillas shot by british commandos in gibraltar 
were buried moderate roman catholic leaders had urged police to 
stay away to avoid clashes with mourners 
michael stone a protestant guerrilla is accused of killing 
three people and wounding 68 at the funeral he told police he was 
on a mission of revenge against the ira and was charged with those 
three killings and three other sectarian slayings in the past four 
years 
the royal ulster constabulary the provinces police force 
announced wednesday that security chiefs will resume their presence 
at the funerals of ira members 
experience has shown that maintenance of th law and prevention 
of outrages will only be guaranteed through the firm presence of 
the police and army a police statement said 
sinn fein the outlawed iras legal political front sinn fein 
condemned the police decision 
any return to the violence of saturation tactics at funerals 
will only ensure confrontation said sinn fein vice president 
martin mcguinness all we want is to be allowed to bury our dead 
with dignity and peace 
at northolt mrs thatcher stood with the families of royal 
signals corp corporals derek wood 24 and david howes 23 as a 
hercules transport landed with the coffins 
the prime minister who presence underscored national outrage 
over the killings glanced around anxiously as woods mother and 
sister sobbed when the army band struck up and a bearer party 
carried the flagdraped coffins slowly toward hearses 
since 1969 563 british soldiers have been among the nearly 
2700 people killed in the sectarian violence in northern ireland 
of the soldiers killed 391 have been from mainland britain and 172 
from the locally recruited ulster defense regiment 
in another development britains two television networks gave 
police untransmitted video footage of the rampage at saturdays 
funeral after they were threatened with prosecution 
the networks had initially refused to yield the footage saying 
it would endanger the lives of their crews 
earlier the catholic bishop whose diocese includes west belfast 
denounced the ira as sheer evil in one of the strongest attacks 
yet by a prelate on the guerrilla organization 
ira violence is often disguised with a mask of romantic 
rhetoric and militaristic mock ritual said bishop cahal daly 
for a ghastly halfhour on saturday the mask slipped the real 
face of ira violence was shown and it was horrible to see 
the ira is fighting to unite northern ireland with the catholic 
republic of ireland under a leftist administration

the senate foreign relations committee cleared 
the way wednesday for an early vote to endorse the new arms 
reduction treaty with the soviet union after a series of lopsided 
tallies against amendments proposed by the pacts chief opponent 
sen jesse helms 
helms rnc had introduced a series of 36 amendments to the 
accord but he agreed to press for substantive action on just four 
of them after republican and democratic senators accused him of 
obstruction and deliberately engineering a series of delays 
committee chairman claiborne pell rri announced the panel 
will vote next tuesday afternoon on reporting the treaty to the 
senate floor with a favorable recommendation 
pell had promised to keep the committee in lengthy session to 
dispose of the helms amendments none of which had attracted more 
than three votes among the 19 committee members 
helmss reversal of course came after a morning session of the 
panel in which sen richard lugar rind complained were just 
in a delay stall situation which i find disagreeable 
if you dont have the votes and just try to overload it with 
amendments that isnt fair lugar said shortly before the 
committee defeated the first of the helms amendments 123 
i dont know what is the magical effect of racing to get this 
thing reported to the senate floor helms said at that point 
meanwhile pell and several other key committee members said the 
last major factor complicating senate consideration of the new 
agreement banning us and soviet mediumrange missiles is the 
dispute between congress and the reagan administration over the 
interpretation of treaties 
sen sam nunn dga chairman of the senate armed services 
committee seeks to add language to the treaty text declaring the 
senates understanding that administration testimony about the 
contents and impact of the accord is authoritative and binding 
the dispute stems from the administrations earlier 
reinterpretation of the 1972 antiballistic missile treaty to 
permit the deployment of a star wars missile defense system which 
most arms control treaty experts believed had been effectively 
banned 
senate majority leader robert c byrd dwva told the senate 
on wednesday he has concluded it will be essential to attach a 
reservation or understanding to the pact spelling out the senates 
position 
byrd said that while there have been exchanges of letters on how 
the treaty should be interpreted this matter is not going to be 
resolved in my judgment by any exchange of letters because a 
future administration can say we dont agree with that 
interpretation at all 
the initial 123 committee vote rejected a helms amendment which 
would have changed the treaty to permit the united states to deploy 
a groundlaunched cruise missile armed with conventional and not 
nuclear explosives 
only sens larry pressler rsd and frank murkowski 
ralaska joined helms in supporting the amendment 
adopting the amendment would mean reopening negotiations with 
the soviets sen alan cranston dcalif said and that would 
mean we would plainly not get a treaty anytime soon so this can 
fairly be labled as a killer amendment 
he said conventionally armed cruise missiles were included in 
the pact because it is impossible to differentiate them from 
identical weapons armed with nuclear warheads 
with the conventionally armed missiles excluded the treaty 
would not be verifiable cranston said 
but helms said the ban means the conventional imbalance in 
europe will be even greater than it is now because nato will lose 
a major weapon in the cruise missile 
however helms later relented the tuesday vote was set and the 
committee overwhelmingly rejected three amendments all of which 
were described by opponents as having the potential to kill the 
treaty by forcing the reopening of negotiations with the soviets 
an amendment by sen larry pressler rsd which would have 
delayed implementation of the treaty until negotiations reduced 
soviet surperiority in conventional arms in europe also was 
rejected 152 
both democratic and republican leaders predict overwhelming 
ratification when the treaty reaches the senate floor and say only 
10 or 12 members of the 100member senate are likely to vote to 
reject it ratification requires a twothirds vote

the house ethics committee wednesday sharply 
rebuked rep charles rose dnc after concluding he improperly 
borrowed funds from his campaign and then failed to publicly report 
the transactions 
finding clear and convincing evidence of house rules 
violations the committee also said rose wrongly pledged a 
certificate of deposit from his campaign as collateral on a 
personal loan and failed to report liabilities to financial 
institutions on his financial reports filed publicly by all 
lawmakers 
the panel formally the committee on standards of official 
conduct wrote rose that his behavior was deserving of 
reproach but the committee concluded there should be no 
punishment by the full house because the eightterm lawmaker has 
tried to rectify his mistakes 
the committee recognizes and takes into consideration the fact 
that all funds borrowed were replaced in full without the 
insistence of this committee and that this action was taken by you 
prior to this committee beginning a preliminary inquiry rose was 
told in the letter signed by panel chairman julian c dixon 
dcalif and ranking republican floyd d spence of south carolina 
furthermore the committee recognizes that the campaign 
certificate of deposit in question is no longer encumbered due to 
restrictions placed on it in connection with your personal 
financial dealings 
rose said he was very happy that the committee found that no 
further action was warranted other than the letter to me he 
said he did not expect the situation to hamper his future 
reelection bids and that the committees decision not to take 
tougher action demonstrated it considered his mistakes technical in 
nature 
im happy that its behind me im satisfied with the result 
and im glad i can move on to total concentration on what the 
people elected me to do he said in an interview my head is 
high 
a house rule restricts the use of campaign funds to bona fide 
campaign purposes the committee called the requirement crucial 
to maintaining public confidence in the fundraising system 
governing house members 
the use of your campaign funds as alleged and proved is 
entirely inconsistent with this principle the committee letter 
said 
the panel said the personal benefit rose received in each 
instance of borrowing and the lower interest rate received from 
use of the certificate of deposit are the kinds of abuses 
house rules were designed to prevent 
for this reason the committee instructs that you refrain from 
any future campaign borrowings andor use of campaign assets as 
collateral the committee said 
rose said he was disappointed the committee did not accept his 
contention that money he took from his campaign amounted to 
repayment of loans he said he apologized for signing his name to 
the certificate of deposit contending he hadnt known doing so 
violated house rules 
rose 48 was first elected to the house in 1972 the state 
republican party first raised allegations about roses finances in 
1986 but rose easily won election to an eighth term in the house 
where he is chairman of the agriculture subcommittee on tobacco and 
peanuts 
i rather expect that the republicans will be angry that the 
committee gave me the lightest possible action they can give he

the new president of a moderate group of 
southern baptists said wednesday the organization has no intention 
of forming a separate denomination but he acknowledged it appears 
headed in that direction 
the rev john thomason of jackson miss was elected president 
tuesday of the 25000member southern baptist alliance a group of 
moderates formed in response to fundamentalist control of the 147 
millionmember southern baptist convention 
the alliance which was formed more than a year ago concluded 
its annual meeting here wednesday 
while both factions generally are conservative they disagree on 
key issues including ordination of women and biblical inerrancy 
the view held by fundamentalists that the bible is the literal 
truth 
the fundamentalists have gained control of the sbc hierarchy 
through nine years of electing their presidential candidates 
during the next year thomason said in an interview he will 
keep pressing the concern of the alliance to continue sounding 
the word about our threatened heritage 
while some have accused the alliance of being the nucleus for a 
denomination thomason said we are not a fringe group we are 
not an avant garde faction of the southern baptist convention the 
great majority of sba members are denominational loyalists 
thomason acknowledged that the alliance may appear to be headed 
toward denominational status because of its publishing activities 
and its discussions concerning the possible need for a new seminary 
or divinity school 
whenever we take specific steps like that we are acting 
independently of the institutions of the southern baptist 
convention and that gives the appearance of independence but it is 
not our desire to forge a permanent split with the sbc thomason 
said 
he said the alliance has to be an advocate for groups and 
causes we feel are disenfranchised if this means acting 
independently of the existing agencies and channels of sbc life 
then for the time being we are willing to do that 
fundamentalists who oppose ordination of women say the bible 
is without factual error in historical scientific and religious 
areas moderates maintain there is room for interpretation 
especially in nonreligious areas 
before fundamentalists gained control of the sbc thomason said 
there was no creedal litmus test for appointees if the 
practice continues one by one we will see our institutions 
succumb to creedalism thomason said 
fundamentalists have clear control of southeastern baptist 
theological seminary in wake forest nc and the home mission 
board in atlanta 
r randall lolley resigned last year as president of 
southeastern rather than carry out the boards order that only 
biblical inerrantists be hired as professors the home mission 
board has refused to help pay women ministers 
thomason is pastor of the 561member northminster baptist 
church the third church to join the alliance after its formation 
in february 1987 the alliance includes 40 churches in 11 states

britains two television networks on wednesday 
gave police unbroadcast videotapes of a mob attack leading up to 
the killing of two british soldiers at an ira funeral procession in 
northern ireland 
the british broadcasting corp and independent television news 
had refused earlier to comply with police demands for the film on 
grounds that doing so would endanger their crews in the british 
province 
on wednesday night however the bbc in belfast said it gave 
police a 49second videotape from the funeral 
an irish republican army mob at the procession dragged the two 
soldiers from a car saturday and beat them with iron bars the 
soldiers were hauled away and later found shot to death nearby 
an announcement from itn said the commercial network also gave 
police untransmitted footage from the funeral in belfast the 
provincial capital 
having considered our legal position we have complied itn 
said the principle of withholding our untransmitted material 
remains important to us but itns policy is to observe the law 
bbc director michael checkland said the network relinquished the 
footage in response to a legal requirement after plainclothes 
officers visited its belfast office 
the bbc has never set itself above the law checkland said 
in dealing with this matter we have been concerned with the 
difficult and dangerous position of our crews in northern ireland 
i very much hope the bbcs future newsgathering in the province 
will not be damaged 
both networks had shown the mob attack but not the killings in 
their regular newscasts the royal ulster constabulary the 
provincial police demanded untransmitted film to assist its 
investigation 
network spokesmen said their untransmitted tapes did not show 
the soldiers being shot to death and would be of little help but 
police demanded the material under britains antiterrorist 
legislation 
officials of bbc itn and the irish network rte had said they 
would not release footage that had not been broadcast unless a 
court ordered it rte said wednesday the police had not yet made a 
formal request 
all the networks said terrorists had threatened the lives of 
employees who covered the funeral and argued that crews covering 
future violence would not be safe if they were thought to be 
cooperating with police 
prime minister margaret thatcher rejected the networks argument 
that they must maintain an impartial stance in their coverage of 
violence 
either one is on the side of justice or on the side of 
terrorism she told parliament on tuesday 
i believe everyone the media included has a bounden duty to 
do everything they can to see that those who perpetrated the 
terrible crimes we all saw on tv which disgusted the whole world 
are brought to justice

a witness at abbas hamadis 
kidnap trial testified wednesday that hamadi confided to a friend 
that he was involved in abducting one of two west germans kidnapped 
in lebanon 
the lebaneseborn defendant is accused in the separate 
kidnappings of the two germans in january 1987 in a bid to force 
the bonn government to release his brother mohammed hamadi who is 
charged with hijacking a twa airliner 
el saheli who was hired by west german investigators to listen 
in on abbas hamadis wiretapped telephone calls after the 
abductions testified that abbas hamadi acknowledged at least one 
kidnapping 
saheli said a lebanese friend asked abbas hamadi in one 
telephone conversation whether he helped kidnap businessman rudolf 
cordes

only bragging to make himself look good in the eyes of his 
lebanese friends in west germany 
in other testimony wednesday abbas hamadi said two members of 
the extremist proiranian hezbollah group prevented him from 
boarding a plane leaving beirut just before cordes was kidnapped on 
jan 17 1987 
hamadi said an employee of beirut airport whom he identified as 
l ham rachan could verify he was forced to miss his flight to 
europe 
the 29yearold defendant did not indicate what he thought 
hezbollahs motives might have been 
west german investigators suspect hezbollah was involved in the 
kidnappings and that hamadi had links to the group 
abbas hamadi returned to west germany from lebanon on jan 26 
1987 and was arrested at frankfurt airport 
since his trial began on jan 5 abbas hamadi has appealed for 
the release of cordes and has denied any role in the kidnappings

younger hamadi but has charged him in connection with the june 
1985 hijacking of a twa airliner in which 39 people were held 
hostage 17 days and a us navy diver was killed 
mohammed hamadi is being held in a frankfurt prison pending 
trial abbas hamadis trial is to resume on april 5 and a decision

a us diplomat was given 48 hours to 
leave panama on wednesday the third day of a general strike that 
has virtually shut down the country but not loosened gen manuel 
antonio noriegas grip on power david miller an economics 
counselor was the second american diplomat ordered out by the 
foreign ministry which gaveno reason for its decision 
in washington the state department said wednesday night it 
would ignore the order because the united states considers the 
government that issued it illegitimate it gave the same reason for 
rejecting the previous order against terence kneebone head of the 
us information service in panama who remains in the country 
panama is out of cash because washington cut off the supply of 
us dollars the panamanian national currency in its effort to 
drive noriega into exile federal grand juries in florida indicted 
noriega last month on narcotics and money laundering charges 
a us medical batallion truck returning from maneuvers with a 
dozen soldiers was surrounded and stopped by national police after 
straying onto a city highway wednesday afternoon 
the truck and men were held for an hour at the roadside then 
taken to fort amador a panamanian base with a us liason 
a panamanian soldier outside the military police office where 
the americans were taken would not allow reporters inside and said 
the incident was being handled as an administrative process under 
uspanama treaties such military trucks are prohibited outside 
the former canal zone 
the panama canal operated normally as it has through weeks of 
protest against noriega who holds the real power in panama through 
his position as commander of the 15000 soldiers and police 
officials say the daily average of 35 ships has been passing 
through the waterway throughout the months of unrest here 
some opposition leaders were frustrated wednesday that the 
strike had not loosened noriegas grip on the bankrupt nation 
were well aware of the situation that gen noriega appears 
unmoved by all the human suffering jose mulino an attorney 
told a news conference well be considering new strategies im 
not sure what it will take 
mulino is prominent in the national civic crusade an alliance 
of about 200 professional business labor and other groups formed 
last june to lead the campaign against noriega 
he and other opposition leaders vowed to continue the strike 
in a clear attempt to dramatize its cause the alliance 
sponsored a roman catholic funeral mass on wednesday for a young 
private security guard killed by a shotgun blast during riots 
rioting last saturday 
the site of the mass the church of christ the king was not the 
dead mans parish but has been the scene of several clashes between 
noriegas opponents and supporters 
after hearing the victim eulogized as a young man who died for 
patriotism more than 100 people stood at the church entrance and 
chanted justice and noriega your end is near 
about 300 people including several directors of the civic 
crusade attended the mass along with more than 100 journalists 
there was no disturbance 
officials of the panamanian committee for human rights say 
alcibiades vasquez 24 was killed by a progovernment paramilitary 
squad 
his death was the first in a nearly a month of often violent 
civil unrest that began after president eric arturo delvalle tried 
to fire noriega on feb 25 and was dismissed the next day the 
united states still recognizes delvalle who is in hiding in panama 
churches throughout panama have started soup kitchens to feed 
the destitute the catholic welfare agency caritas said it is 
feeding 6000 families in poor neighborhoods around the capital 
with donated supplies 
civic crusade leaders joined delvalle in appealing for donations 
of food from abroad through the catholic church or international 
relief agencies 
i am very concerned and fear for the health and lives of many 
panamanians delvalle said in a videotaped message from his place 
of hiding 
he has not appeared in public since the legislature dismissed 
him on orders from noriega 
another leading opposition figure ricardo arias calderon is 
expected to try to enter the country thursday after four weeks of 
forced exile in miami 
arias head of the christian democratic party and a presidential 
aspirant was denied entry when he returned from a business trip on 
the day delvalle was ousted 
hundreds of party faithful are expected at the panama city 
airport several central american legislators plan to accompany him 
as a guarantee of safety 
panamas economy already hampered by a 48 billion foreign 
debt started disintegrating when delvalles dismissal caused a run 
on the banks they were closed in early march and the cash shortage 
was aggravated by us economic sanctions

a judge has dismissed one of two drug 
charges against john zaccaro jr the son of 1984 vice presidential 
candidate geraldine ferraro 
district judge francis mccaffrey ruled monday there is 
insufficient evidence to support a charge of possession of cocaine 
with intent to sell 
mccaffrey also said defense attorneys cannot claim at trial that 
zaccaro was a victim of selective prosecution because it does not 
relate to guilt or innocence 
zaccaro was arrested in 1986 in a raid of his home and car while 
attending middlebury college his trial on a charge of sale of a 
regulated drug is scheduled to begin april 4 
mccaffrey in 1986 had ruled inadmissible eight grams of cocaine 
and records of drug transactions seized by police from zaccaros 
car the judge said at the time that the search warrant was based 
on insufficient evidence 
addison county states attorney john quinn argued he could prove 
the possession charge based on the observations of undercover state 
trooper laura manning 
but mccaffrey disagreed saying there is no evidence to 
show that the other packets observed by manning contained cocaine

demanding that saudi arabia remove the missiles which are capable 
of carrying nuclear warheads and of reaching israel 
in amman chairman sharifuddin pir zadeh of the organization of 
islamic conference said the group also would support saudi arabia

in the years first defense spending vote a 
house subcommittee decided wednesday to cut deeply into president 
reagans budget request for his star wars antimissile research 
project according to congressional sources 
the armed services research and development subcommittee also 
increased spending for the midgetman nucleartipped missile and 
sharply reduced the planned budget for deploying mx atomic weapons 
aboard trains said the sources who spoke only on condition of 
anonymity 
the committee met behind closed doors to make the decisions 
the votes by the subcommittee were the first step in the lengthy 
congressional budgeting process the full armed services committee 
will later consider its subcommittee actions before sending the 
pentagon budget bill to the floor of the full house the same 
procedure will also be followed in the senate 
the overall pentagon budget for the 1989 fiscal year will be 
299 billion a figure set by the white house and congress last 
december during negotiations aimed at reducing the federal budget 
deficit 
reagan had sought 45 billion in pentagon spending for star 
wars known formally as the strategic defense initiative 
but the subcommittee approved a 37 billion figure which would 
be an increase of only 3 percent over the current star wars budget 
the sources said 
the fight over the midgetman and the mx involves a pair of 
nucleartipped weapons which have been at the heart of a 
longrunning dispute between the reagan administration and the 
democraticcontrolled congress 
congressional democrats support the single warhead midgetman 
while the air force wants to build more than the 50 of the 
10warhead mx weapons allowed by congress the second 50 mx weapons 
would be based two each aboard 25 trains that would be housed on 
western military bases until a crisis 
reagan had wanted 1 billion for the two programs including 
800 million for study of the railbasing plan while the budget 
contained 200 million for midgetman that latter total was enough 
to keep the program alive until the president who succeeds reagan 
can make a final decision on the dispute according to defense 
secretary frank c carlucci 
as it worked through the budget the subcommittee rejected a 
republicanbacked plan to spend 650 million for mx railroad basing 
plans and another 350 million for midgetman according to the 
sources 
then the panel turned down a democraticproposed plan to spend 
500 million for midgetman and nothing for the mx 
finally the panel agreed to split the 1 billion figure giving 
500 million for research into each weapon

president reagan marked the fifth anniversary 
of his plan for a star wars missile defense system on wednesday by 
asserting that the hightech program is an incentive to ussoviet 
arms control efforts 
in a written statement issued the same day he announced a date 
for his fourth summit with soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev 
reagan lauded the missile shield proposal known formally as the 
strategic defense initiative as vital to our future security 
we must recognize that we live in an imperfect often violent 
world one in which ballistic missile technology is proliferating 
despite our efforts to prevent this reagan said we would be 
doing a grave and dangerous disservice to future generations if we 
assumed that national leaders everywhere for all time will be 
both peaceful and rational 
the president warned as he has many times that the soviets 
not only are ahead of us in ballistic missiles but also are 
deeply engaged in their own sdilike program if they are allowed 
to keep their nearmonopoly in defenses we will be left without an 
effective means to protect our cherished freedoms in the future 
the president announced his proposal for the missile shield 
defense program on march 23 1983 
i put forward the vision of a future free from the threat 
of the most dangerous weapon mankind has invented fastflying 
ballistic missiles reagan recalled in his statement 
reagan who has staunchly defended the plan despite soviet 
efforts to curb it and congressional efforts to cut its funding 
said it had provided a valuable incentive for the soviets to 
return to the bargaining table and to negotiate seriously over 
strategic arms reductions 
and as we move toward lower levels of offense it will be all 
the more important to have an effective defense reagan argued 
the president has repeatedly insisted however that he will not 
use sdi as a bargaining chip in negotiations with the soviets 
reagan following an oval office meeting with soviet foreign 
minister eduard shevardnadze announced he will go to moscow from 
may 29 to june 2 for his fourth meeting with gorbachev 
the highlight of the summitt was intended to be the signing of a 
treaty to slash the superpowers longrange strategic weapons but 
reagan has suggested that the agreement will not be ready due to 
time limitations 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said the issue of sdi did 
not come up in wednesdays meetings between us and soviet 
officials at the white house 
in his statement reagan said the hightech program now faces 
problems that are largely political 
congress has cut funds for the program every year reagan said 
asserting this has put the program one to two years behind 
schedule 
capitol hill slashed reagans 1988 request for the program from 
56 billion to 39 billion he is seeking 46 billion in 1989 
in the years first defense spending vote a house subcommittee 
decided wednesday to cut deeply into reagans budget request for 
star wars approving 37 billion which would be an increase of 
only 3 percent over the current star wars budget according to 
congressional sources speaking on condition of anonymity the 
request will later go to the full house armed services committee

senate republicans succeeded wednesday in 
delaying any votes on a bill to require the government to warn 
millions of workers they risk cancer and other diseases from job 
exposure to hazardous substances 
democratic supporters of the high risk occupational disease 
notificiation and prevention act were unable to break off lengthy 
orations by opponents led by sen orrin hatch rutah aimed a 
preventing a vote on the bill 
in a key test vote the bills chief author sen howard 
metzenbaum dohio was able to muster only 33 of the 60 senate 
votes necessary to limit further debate to 30 hours 
the legislation is aimed at what the national institute of 
occupational safety and health says are the one in every four 
americans who have been exposed to carcinogens or other hazardous 
substances on the job most of them unware of it 
metzenbaum and other supporters of the bill on wednesday put 
together what he said were weakening amendments aimed at 
diminishing opposition from farmers and small businesses before 
making another attempt to limit debate on thursday 
hatch however prevented votes on the amendments as well 
holding control of the sente floor for hours but saying he might 
allow their consideration on thursday 
i dont consider this a filibuster hatch said a 
filibuster is reading from the phone book this is a discussion 
that is very necessary this bill could cost taxpayers and 
consumers millions or billions of dollars 
later wednesday sen edward m kennedy dmass chairman of 
the senate labor and human resources committee substituted the 
bill entirely with a new version including several weakening 
amendments on which hatch had been blocking action 
the new version effectively exempts companies with less than 50 
workers and farms from having to continue to pay wages and benefits 
for up to a year to workers ordered off the job because of the 
danger continued hazardous exposure would raise for them 
it also puts restrictions on what information from the program 
that workers and former workers could use in pursuing liability 
suits against employers and places a 250 ceiling on the medical 
monitoring expenses that companies would have to pay for each 
covered worker 
do we have a for sale sign on the legislation so that you 
keep watering it down until you get enough votes to pass it 
hatch asked rhetorically calling kennedys action a 
reprehensible tactic 
democrats admitted that kennedys parliamentary maneuver 
although allowed by senate rules could be used to keep repubicans 
from offering amendments of their own but they maintained that was 
not the intent 
democratic leader robert c byrd acknowledged the unfairness 
that has been circumstantially brought about with no malicious 
intent 
because of that byrd said that on thursday he would vote 
against his own motion that was part of a second attempt to bring 
an end to the republican delaying tactics 
metzenbaum attempting to salvage the measure in what appears to 
be a swell of opposition to it said he would urge fellow 
supporters to also vote against putting a limit on the gop delay 
tactics 
a similar bill was passed by the house on a 225186 largely 
partyline vote last october despite vehement opposition from the 
reagan administration 
unions have been seeking the legislation for the past four 
years contending the administration effectively had defanged 
the occupational safety and health administration from protecting 
workers from hazards 
over the past two years metzenbaum had succeeded in winning 
support for the bill from several trade groups and corporations 
including the chemical manufacturers association the american 
electronics association ibm general electric occidental 
petroleum and wr grace and co 
but hundreds of other business groups led by the national 
association of manufacturers and the us chamber of commerce 
remained opposed to the measure in any form 
jerry jasinowki the nams chief economist called the 
legislation a ticking time bomb that could subject employers up 
to billions of dollars in lawsuits each year from workers and 
former workers that the government identifies as being at risk to 
occupational diseases 
the bill would set up a panel of seven scientists in the 
department of health and human services to identify hazards and the 
groups at risk from exposure to them 
the national institute of occupational safety and health would 
then be required to send individual notices to between 100000 and 
300000 individuals every year and employers would be required to 
provide medical monitoring programs for each

iran accused iraq on wednesday of using 
poison gas against civilians and warned it might retaliate with its 
own chemical weapons and the united states urged a un security 
council protest 
the international committee of the red cross called the use of 
chemical weapons a new and tragic escalation in the 7yearold 
war between iran and iraq 
also wednesday iranian gunboats attacked a cypriot freighter in 
the persian gulf leaving it in flames and iran fired six missiles 
into iraqi cities 
iraq claimed a number of civilians were killed or wounded by an 
iranian missile fired into iraqs capital baghdad 
iranian prime minister hussein musavi claimed iraqi troops 
killed 5000 iraqi kurds with poison gas last week after their home 
villages and towns were liberated by iranian troops fighting 
with the autonomyseeking kurds he called the use of poison gas 
one of the greatest crimes of the middle east 
it depends on international measures taken to stop these iraqi 
crimes musavi was quoted as saying by irans official islamic 
republic news agency monitored in cyprus 
western journalists who toured the affected area in northeast 
iraq and the hospitals where victims were taken corroborated the 
claims 
irans war information minister kamal kharazi said iran may 
retaliate with its own chemical weapons if the un security 
council does not condemn iraq for its use of such weapons 
iraq has denied using chemical weapons 
the international committee of the red cross said in geneva that 
it had taken urgent steps to end such attacks and had informed iran 
of its readiness to provide emergency assistance for the 
victims

the 1925 geneva protocol against chemical warfare said spokesman 
charles e redman he said there was also evidence iran may have 
fired chemical artillery shells against iraq 
we call upon iran and iraq to desist immediately from any 
further use of chemical weapons which are an offense to 
civilization and humanity redman said 
refering to film footage on american television showing victims 
of the alleged attacks white house spokesman marlin fitzwater told 
reporters we condemn the use of chemical warfare and gas use by 
anybody anywhere at any time 
i saw everyone in the administration saw the same reports 
you saw last night they were horrible outrageous disgusting and 
should serve as a reminder to all countries of why chemical warfare 
should be banned

a littleknown 33yearold gop leader will run 
against edward m kennedy in the fall for the senate seat kennedy 
has held without serious challenge since 1962 the republican state 
chairman said wednesday 
joseph malone of waltham executive director of the 
massachusetts gop will challenge kennedy said party chairman ray 
shamie who himself declined a request from president reagan last 
week that he take on kennedy a second time 
the kennedy campaign insisted the fiveterm democrat will take 
nothing for granted and will wage a statewide grassroots 
campaign 
in washington bj cooper a deputy white house press 
secretary said the white house had no comment on shamies decision 
shamie aide charles manning said that malone represented a new 
generation of republicans and that as a catholic of italian 
descent malone would be a departure from the yankeeprotestant 
line of new england republicans 
malone will have neither the name recognition nor the cash of 
shamie who sold a high tech business three years ago for more than 
60 million 
kennedy 56 was first elected for an interim term from 1962 to 
1964 filling the seat once held by his brother john he went on to 
victories against a succession of oldline republicans like george 
cabot lodge and josiah spaulding 
a 1978 graduate of harvard college malone has helped operate a 
family trucking business and also is a partner in family real

its important that we have a strong aggressive campaign in 
massachusetts 
state democratic party chairman chester atkins said malone is 
too closely tied to shamie to present himself as a new

will be even harder still for them to accept his understudy he

while he lost in a landslide 61 percent to 38 percent it was

students at west virginia university 
who passed on to caterpillar co confidential information gathered 
during a class exercise acted on their own after grades were 
issued dean said wednesday 
the wall street journal reported tuesday that professor terry 
wilson who did consulting work for caterpillar had students 
gather information on rival heavyequipment businesses as part of a 
class exercise 
several current or former wvu graduate students told the journal 
they then released the information to two caterpillar dealers the 
students charged they felt pressure to do so in part because of 
wilsons connection to caterpillar 
we were worried about getting through the course mark 
wheatley told the journal wheatley no longer attends the 
university and is not listed in the morgantown telephone directory 
whatever the students might have done was done after their 
grades were issued said cyril m logar dean of wvus college of 
business and economics what their grade was based on was all 
legitimate he said 
wheatley and some other students in wilsons marketing class 
were assigned to do work for the two caterpillar dealerships ho 
penn machinery co in armonk ny and yancey bros in atlanta 
last spring as part of a project designed to give them practical 
experience 
at the two dealerships direction the graduate students 
obtained inventory and sales volume reports on those dealers 
competitors according to the newspaper 
during the survey those in the class identified themselves only 
as university students not mentioning their link to the 
caterpillar dealers and promised that information would remain 
confidential the journal reported 
but that promise was broken students said and former student 
herman flinder who has since returned to his home in norway 
likened the work to spying 
wilson did not return phone calls to his home and office 
wednesday the professor told the journal the exercise was good for 
students but added that he will no longer assign similar projects 
spokesmen for both equipment dealers denied asking the students 
to do anything unethical 
it was my understanding that the information would be made 
available to all the participants said goodloe yancy iv general 
manager of yancy bros there are situational ethics involved at 
no time were any of the students told to compromise their personal 
ethics 
they chose whatever path they chose he said 
milton long marketing manager for ho penn said he never 
asked for or received the names of competitors used in the study 
logar said that wilson who is on sababatical would be told to 
boost the emphasis on ethics in the curriculum

the jury in the preppie murder trial of a 
man accused of strangling a teenager during sex in central park 
deliberated a seventh day wednesday rehearing testimony about the 
autopsy on the woman 
the jury was interested in the internal injuries revealed by the 
autopsy performed by dr maria alandy associate medical examiner 
in new york city she testified about injuries to jennifer levins 
mouth neck head and internal organs 
the jury deliberated until early evening and will return 
thursday morning 
the jurors apparently were trying to discern how badly miss 
levin 18 was beaten and how much physical force it would take to 
cause the injuries a day earlier their request focused on how 
long miss levin had to be choked to produce pinpoint hemorrhaging 
on her eyelids 
the prosecution contends robert chambers punched miss levin 
before strangling her in a rage the defense contends the death was 
accidentally caused when he yanked her backward during rough sex 
as chambers said in a videotaped statement to police 
after the reading of the testimony jurors spent several minutes 
sitting in the jury box speaking with one another before returning 
to deliberations which is highly unusual 
chambers 21 is accused of seconddegree murder in the death of 
miss levin on aug 26 1986 
the jury which got the case last thursday could also convict 
chambers of the lesser crimes of first or seconddegree 
manslaughter or criminally negligent homicide

civil fine in the departments 10year enforcement of federal

violations in connection with operations of supermarkets in saudi

fraternal organizations which support israel

the 
iraqi air force has begun using a second type of sovietbuilt 
bomber on its forays against iranian oil shipping in the persian 
gulf us naval officers said wednesday 
the supersonic tu22 a twinjet aircraft known in natos 
military lexicon as blinder apparently carries only iron bombs 
instead of the airtosurface missiles that are on iraqs other 
attack aircraft in the gulf 
the us officers who spoke on condition of not being 
identified also said blinders operating over the gulf fly at about 
450 mph that is faster than other iraqi warplanes but less than 
the aircrafts top speed of 900 mph 
one officer said it was possible that the blinders were flying 
training missions to prepare for regular action against iranian 
tankers 
this guidedmissile frigate observed several of the soviet 
bombers in action during a recent 14day assignment in the northern 
gulf 
the officers wouldnt indicate whether the flights began before 
or after a visit to baghdad by an american military delegation last 
month the meeting was set up to discuss the problem of iraqi 
aircraft flying down the gulf in a manner that appeared to pose a 
threat to us warships 
the talks were known to have dealt with flights by iraqs 
frenchbuilt f1 mirages and sovietmade t16 badgers both of 
which are armed with antiship missiles 
many us officers have expressed concern that the flight 
patterns of the iraqi aircraft could lead to another mistaken 
attack such as that which devastated the frigate stark last may 17 
killing 37 of its crew 
as the roberts sailed toward the strait of hormuz on tuesday an 
iraqi warplane ventured further down the pipe than usual 
posing no threat but far enough for a call from the ships combat 
information center to interrupt the skippers dinner 
the plane veered eastward toward iran before it reached the 
point at which cmdr paul x rinn said he would have ordered a 
precautionary increase in alert status 
on wednesday the roberts went to what rinn called a modified 
condition zebra an upgrading of damagecontrol precautions when 
it entered waters about 20 miles from abu musa a small island that 
iran uses as a base for gunboat attacks on gulf shipping 
us military sources in washington say iran has recently begun 
installing launch platforms for its chinesemade silkworm antiship 
missiles on the island 
rinn a native new yorker who now lives in summerville sc 
told members of a pentagon news media poll that there has been no 
change in navy procedures around abu musa and there was no 
evidence of the silkworms having been placed on the island 
weve always been careful around abu musa because its a base 
for the iranian speedboats he said 
iranian gunboats on the lookout for warrelated materials bound 
for archenemy iraq were heard conducting their usual challenges of 
commercial vessels as to their cargoes and destinations

troops detained hundreds of arabs in a huge 
crackdown to contain four months of unrest in the occupied lands 
and israeli jets bombed palestinian guerrilla bases in south 
lebanon wednesday for the second time in a week 
overnight raids which went into wednesday morning were israels 
latest strategy for ending a rebellion which by un count has 
killed 107 arabs and one israeli soldier 
arab reports said about 500 palestinians were rounded up 
defense minister yitzhak rabin said 3000 have been detained since 
riots began dec 8 in the west bank and gaza strip 
israeli troops in gaza shot and wounded an arab protester in 
jabaliya refugee camp shifa hospital officials said they said 
another arab from deir al balah camp was badly hurt with beating 
injuries to his head 
the number of major demonstrations and clashes has fallen 
dramatically in recent days and rabin credited israels tough 
policies of mass arrests and economic sanctions 
the phenomenon of large violent demonstrations has been 
substantially reduced as a result of the general activity of 
the army the security forces the riot police rabin told 
officers on a tour of gaza we feel a certain tiredness among the 
arab population 
prime minister yitzhak shamir said simply restoring quiet was 
not enough 
no doubt it is possible to turn the situation back to normal 
and even a better one shamir said wednesday on israel 
television but i think its not enough today to restore order 
and normal life we have to prepare ground so this does not repeat 
itself 
there are things to be done to prevent the return of these 
dangerous events he said without elaborating 
nearly all the 107 palestinians killed died by israeli army 
gunfire or beatings the israeli soldier was shot to death by an 
arab last weekend 
india protested israels handling of the arab rebellion by 
canceling a match in israel by its davis cup tennis team scheduled 
for next month it was the first such cancellation of a sports or 
entertainment event 
gad yacobi israels economy minister said the violence and 
strikes have cost israel more than 335 million in lost production 
exports and added security expenses he said the figure did not 
include losses to tourism and agriculture 
in the air raid israeli pilots destroyed buildings used by 
guerrillas to store weapons and equipment near sidon a port in 
south lebanon the military said it was the fourth israeli air 
raid in lebanon this year 
the army did not identify a guerrilla group but beirut radio 
stations said the warehouses belonged to yasser arafats 
palestinian guerrilla group fatah and lebanese moslem militias 
shamir reported to the 10member inner cabinet on his talks in 
washington a minister who attended said shamir had found no signs 
the united states would yield to israeli requests for changes in 
its middle east peace proposals which involve trading territory 
for peace 
the army said it might allow israelis to volunteer for three to 
six months of paid reserve duty in addition to annual compulsory 
duty last week the army increased the compulsory tour from 42 
days to 50 
according to the arabrun palestinie press service and arabic 
daily al quds soldiers detained about 500 palestinians overnight 
including 200 from hebron and the nearby west bank village of dura 
palestinian witnesses said the army sealed off villages and 
refugee camps after midnight then went from house to house with 
lists of names the arab news agency said 80 people were arrested 
in attil 12 miles north of nablus 
army spokesmen confirmed mass arrests overnight but would not 
give numbers 
an israeli official said rabin told a parliamentary committee 
israel has jailed 3000 arabs since dec 8 including 700 since 
sunday 
he said on condition of anonymity that 1000 more arabs had 
been arrested and released the official also confirmed a report in 
the daily haaretz that the army planned to put 300 arabs under 
administrative detention meaning they could be jailed for up to 
six months without trial 
a palestine liberation organization leaflet circulated in the 
gaza strip said payments will be made to arabs who lose family 
members property or jobs because of clashes with israeli soldiers 
it cited 2900 for martyrs killed fighting soldiers 600 
for anyone arrested and 1450 for a merchant unable to open his 
store because of a strike arab policemen who resigned would get 
1450 as a first payment the leaflet said 
israel had imposed rules limiting the flow of money into the 
territories in an attempt to prevent such compensation and other 
plo financing of the rebellion

a house subcommittee has decided against 
seeking perjury charges against the chairman of the nations 
largest meatpacker for testifying falsely last year that only one 
set of injury records was kept at its dakota city neb 
packinghouse 
rep tom lantos dcalif chairman of the house government 
operations committees subcommittee on employment and housing said 
that although the testimony by ibp corp chairman robert peterson 
was misleading the panel will not ask the justice department to 
prosecute him 
peterson testifying before the panel last may denied charges 
from the united food and commercial workers union that the company 
was keeping two sets of injury logs one for internal use and the 
other to be shown to government inspectors at its dakota city 
plant 
afterwards the company sent the subcommittee a 28page 
statement again denying there were two sets of records later 
however peterson wrote lantos a letter saying that he had learned 
that two sets of logs were in fact kept 
at a subsequent hearing last september ibp officials said their 
earlier testimony was based on misunderstandings between the 
plants medical director and a vice president of the company 
while some of the explanations offered by top ibp officials 
strained credibility or were incongruent and raised serious 
questions there is insufficient evidence to warrant referring the 
matter to the justice department for perjury proceedings lantos 
said tuesday 
he made the statement in presenting the subcommittees report on 
the occupational safety and health administrations handling of the 
ibp case to the full 39member government operations committee 
committee officials said they expect that report to be released 
within the next two weeks 
ibp then a subsidiary of occidental petroleum co and the ufcw 
were engaged in a bitter lockout turned strike at the dakota city 
plant during the subcommittees first hearing 
as the result of proddings from the union osha initiated a 
thorough inspection of the plant and subsequently fined ibp more 
than 2 million for a series of health safety and record 
violations 
at the time it was the largest fine ever levied by osha ibp 
has contested the osha charges and is appealing the fine

texts for an afghan peace settlement have been 
sent to lawyers for finishing touches but there still is no 
agreement on two essential issues sources close to the geneva 
negotiations said wednesday 
the sources said one question still open was whether the current 
afghan government or another would oversee implementation of the 
deal the other is the future of aid to afghanistan from the soviet 
union which now has an estimated 115000 soldiers in the country 
helping fight moslem insurgents 
moscow and its communist allies in kabul say both issues are 
outside the scope of the geneva talks and raising them with a third 
country pakistan in this case would constitute interference in 
afghanistans internal affairs 
diego cordovez the un mediator was said to be confident a 
third problem could be resolved by compromise language that 
problem arose last week when abdul wakil the afghan foreign 
minister accused pakistan at a news conference of creating new 
complications by reviving an old border dispute 
it concerns the durand line a boundary between afghanistan and 
british india agreed upon in 1893 it was accepted by pakistan 
after independence in 1947 but afghanistan claimed an area south 
of the line 
pakistans chief negotiator in geneva acting foreign minister 
zain noorani told reporters on the same day wakil made his 
allegations that his delegation never raised any question as to 
the pakistaniafghan border 
he said the border was a nonissue and pakistan accepts the 
passage in the agreements requiring the parties to refrain from 
violations of the existing internationally recognized boundary 
between the two countries 
pakistan acts as spokesman for the afghan guerrillas

gov evan mechams auto dealership would 
have been overdrawn and unable to meet its payroll if he hadnt 
borrowed 80000 from a state fund an accountant testified at 
mechams impeachment trial wednesday 
the testimony contradicted mechams claim that he didnt need 
the money and that he borrowed it in july solely to help the state 
earn higher interest than it was receiving on the money 
an accountant hired by the prosecution to analyze the financial 
records of mechams company indicated the money was badly needed 
unless these funds had been paid from the protocol fund 
mecham pontiac would have had an overdraft the following wednesday 
in excess of 60000 said randall sorensen referring to the 
payday following the loan 
the senate is investigating allegations mecham misused the 
funds which were raised by his inaugural committee but transferred 
to the protocol fund because of a state law barring use of such 
contributions to pay campaign debts 
sorensen took the stand after former mecham chief of staff james 
colter acknowledged he filled mechams request for the 80000 loan 
to his car dealership without checking the companys financial 
condition 
when sen manuel pena suggested to colter who left the mecham 
administration in the fall that mecham pontiac was overencumbered 
when the loan was taken colter said if thats so its a bummer 
deal but it was repaid so i guess it wasnt a bummer deal 
prosecutor paul eckstein noted that mecham testified before the 
house that his company did not need the money to pay the bank for 
overdue loans on cars 
however sorensen said mecham pontiac paid first interstate bank 
81309 owed for six cars on july 17 1987 the same day that the 
80000 loan was received 
on crossexamination mechams lawyer jerris leonard suggested 
that the mecham car dealership had assets that could have been 
converted to cash when needed but sorensen said he saw no records 
indicating such assets 
leonard also said the dealership had a net worth of 425 
million but sorensen said some of the figures he saw indicated 
otherwise he did not elaborate 
prosecutors had said they would show that mecham pontiac was in 
deep financial trouble and desperately needed the loan to 
survive 
in his statement tuesday leonard said of mechams loan the 
governor is going to tell you he did it for one purpose and one 
purpose only to try to improve the earnings of the fund 
the governors lawyers had objected vehemently to testimony 
about the dealerships financial condition but were overruled 
before the trial recessed for the day former arizona attorney 
general jack lasoto testified that he analyzed state laws relating 
to the mecham loan and found it was improper 
he said it was clear that money placed in the governors 
protocol fund became public money intended for promoting arizonas 
image 
also wednesday mechams former legislative aide testified she 
quit because she was worried that people could possibly go to 
jail if the loan was discovered 
donna carlson who was the subject of an alleged death threat 
investigated earlier in the trial testified she and other mecham 
staffers believed the fund could be used only to promote the 
interests of the state of arizona 
in addition to charges of obstructing the investigation of an 
alleged threat against ms carlson and of misusing state funds 
mecham is accused in the impeachment trial of concealing a 350000 
campaign loan 
ms carlson described a conversation with colter late last 
summer which she said involved both loans 
mr colter was extremely upset said ms carlson he said 
i dont think the governor understands the magnitude of the debt 
he said i had to loan him 80000 out of the protocol fund 
i believe i came out of my chair ms carlson said i made 
a remark that people could possibly go to jail for something 
like that 
witnesses have said that ms carlson was the subject of an 
alleged death threat just before she was called to testify before a 
grand jury about mechams campaign finances 
the firstterm republican governor also faces an april 21 
criminal trial on felony charges of concealing the campaign loan 
mecham the first us governor to face an impeachment trial in six 
decades also faces a recall election may 17 
during intensive quizzing by senators colter insisted he never 
tried to cover up the protocol fund loan to the dealership even 
though it was never recorded in the funds check register 
im a poor recordkeeper he said

an ominous warming of the atmosphere and 
depletion of earths protective ozone shield have given urgency to 
plans by nasa japan and europe to launch four satellites to study 
the planets ecological system 
the project will bring about a revolution in our understanding 
of the earth as a whole system said dixon butler project 
scientist for the national aeronautics and space administration 
which plans to spend more than 2 billion on its share 
instruments planned for the first satellite include a laser to 
measure movement along faults such as the san andreas in 
california radar that can by peer through clouds and vegetation 
and devices to measure wind speed and direction air temperature 
and humidity 
officials said the polarorbiting satellites could improve 
weather forecasts by allowing meteorologists to study developing 
weather patterns worldwide 
other instruments also are scheduled to be placed on the space 
station which is set for operation in the mid1990s but the eos 
is being designed so it will work even if the space station is 
delayed 
the program recently moved into high gear because of ominous 
changes in the earths atmosphere butler said tuesday speaking 
via satellite to scientists at nasa centers across the country 
including the jet propulsion laboratory in pasadena 
the four satellites will operate for 15 years and one of their 
tasks will be to monitor the greenhouse effect in which earths 
temperature is gradually rising because of increased carbon dioxide 
in the atmosphere butler said from nasas goddard space flight 
center in greenbelt md 
the satellites also will keep track of depletion of earths 
protective ozone layer he said 
scientists fear the greenhouse effect may cause crop failures 
and raise sea levels threating threaten coastal cities loss of 
highaltitude ozone will let more harmful solar ultraviolet rays 
reach earth increasing skin cancer and possibly killing 
microscopic ocean organisms that are at the bottom of the food 
chain scientists say 
nasa plans to launch its first eos satellite a 60footlong 
spacecraft carrying 20 instruments in 1995 followed by the launch 
of a european space agency satellite in 1997 nasas second 
satellite could lift off in 1997 followed by a 1998 launch for the 
fourth satellite which would be japanese 
butler said the soviet union which has many satellites in polar 
orbit also may participate 
nasa is asking for 20 million in next years budget to 
determine what instruments should be placed on the satellites then 
will seek money in 1991 to build the equipment nasa spokesman 
charles redmond said 
satellites in polar orbit circle earth from north to south 
allowing onboard instruments to study the whole planet as it 
rotates

the legislatures chief abortion foe said 
the odds of a rape victim getting pregnant are one in millions 
and millions and millions because the trauma causes a certain 
secretion that kills sperm 
doctors specializing in reproduction dismissed the claim made 
by republican rep stephen freind as nonsense 
freind who made the assertion during an interview on a hanover 
radio station earlier this month said tuesday he stands by the 
claim and will provide medical documentation to support it in about 
a week 
gov robert p casey has said he will sign a bill that requires 
victims of rape or incest to report the crimes to be eligible for 
government funding of abortions 
in a debate with barry steinhardt of the philadelphia branch of 
the american civil liberties union freind said it is almost but 
not quite impossible to become pregnant on the basis of rape the 
odds are one in millions and millions and millions and there is a 
physical reason for that 
rape obviously is a traumatic experience he said when 
that traumatic experience is undergone a woman secretes a certain 
secretion which has a tendency to kill sperm 
theres no basis for that thats nonsense dr richard 
depp chairman of the department of obstetrics and gynecology at 
thomas jefferson university in philadelphia 
dr luigi mastroianni jr director of the division of human 
reproduction at the hospital of the university of pennsylvania in 
philadelphia said tuesday boy if i could find out what that 
secretion was id use it as a contraceptive 
mastroianni a past president of the american fertility society 
said there is no such secretion 
he said freinds statements reflect a lack of concern for 
women who have been victimized by rape by dismissing the act as 
not having consequence 
freind has been trying for years to get strong antiabortion 
laws through the legislature

president jose sarney on wednesday 
hailed the decision to keep the presidential system of government 
but some brazilians wondered how long sarney himself would be be 
allowed to keep the office 
lawmakers writing a new constitution ended a year of political 
uncertaintly tuesday by deciding to have a president rather than a 
prime minister as chief of government 
its a victory for the nation it is not a personal victory 
said sarney who has complained that uncertainty about the 
countrys political direction was a factor in brazils economic and 
social ills 
sarney told reporters this decision was better for the 
country congress understood that 
lawmakers decided 344212 to have a presidential system of 
government legislators who argued in favor of parliamentarism said 
a prime minister was a modern alternative and a protection from 
military leaders who have made it clear they favor a presidential 
system 
sarney said parliamentarism would bring chaos and threaten 
democracy an indirect reference to possible government 
intervention by the military 
lawmakers also voted a fiveyear term for the presidential 
office another victory for sarney 
but whether sarney can serve that long should be known in about 
a month when lawmakers are to vote on the remaining length of 
sarneys tenure 
his term likely will be the last item voted on by the 559 
legislators rewriting an authoritarian constitution the present 
constitution was handed down without a vote in 1969 by a military 
junta that seized power in a 1964 coup brazilians havent voted 
for president since 1960 
the countrys leftist faction and most brazilians according to 
polls would like to see sarneys term reduced by one year from 
five to four 
but some brazilians said trimming a year off sarneys term is 
harder now after congress voted to give the office of president a 
fiveyear term 
it would be hateful to have other presidents with five years 
and reduce sarneys to four said communications minister antonio 
carlos magalhaes 
the lawmakers vote was preceded by heavy lobbying by sarney and 
his supporters 
jornal do brasil the influential daily of rio de janeiro 
condemned the methods used to obtain victory and criticized 
sarney for not keeping a promise to step down in four years 
the intervention of the government was obscene said rep 
ronaldo cezar coelho of the brazilian democratic movement party 
indirectly elected in an electoral college election sarney was 
running mate on a liberal ticket headed by tancredo neves neves 
died before taking office and sarney became president in march 1985 
as former leader of the militarybacked party sarney was a 
compromise candidate to appease the outgoing generals 
the nevessarney team was to be a transitional marriage to 
smoothly lead south americas largest country to democracy but 
under three years of sarney brazil has had its highest inflation 
rate in history

authorities outlawed an independent 
students union at warsaw university on the grounds that it 
threatened to stir unrest and engage in antistate activities 
organizers of the group said wednesday 
members of the organizing committee of the warsaw university 
independent students union known by its polish initials nzs said 
they would defy the ban and organize a rally next week to protest 
delays in dormitory renovations 
the ban dated monday was signed by the citys 
socioadministrative department which has the power to decide the 
legality of organizations established by citizens 
student union activists announced at a march 8 campus rally 
attended by about 2000 students that they were giving up 
underground activities to work openly for more academic freedoms 
and to protect students material interests 
the banning order said the program of the nzs chapter shows the 
student unions intention is to undertake activities which could 
cause a threat to the peace and public order 
a copy of the order was made available to western reporters 
wednesday 
student activists have campaigned at several major universities 
this year for communist authorities to legalize the independent 
students union which was officially registered in february 1981 
but outlawed a year later after the martial law crackdown on the 
solidarity free trade union movement 
about 1500 warsaw university students have joined the warsaw 
university nzs chapter since march 8 said andrzej papierz a 
history student and union organizer 
also on wednesday a gdansk misdemeanor court meted out fines 
ranging from 30000 to 50000 zlotys 76 to 128 to 11 opposition 
activists who were detained monday at an antigovernment happening 
marking the first day of spring said maciej jankowski a gdansk 
opposition spokesman 
one of those fined cezary waluszko said he would file a 
complaint charging that police severely beat him after he was 
detained at the happening in which a doll with dark glasses like 
those worn by polish leader gen wojciech jaruzelski was thrown 
into the baltic said jankowski 
in wroclaw misdemeanor courts fined two people 50000 zlotys 
each for taking part in illegal political protests said barbara 
labuda a wroclaw opposition spokeswoman

the church was unavailable and the doors on 
other buildings are too small so a traveling exhibit on the us 
constitution will be displayed at the horse around bar when it 
reaches town next month 
people are kind of enthused about it said bar owner galan 
hanson who added that he was surprised when he was asked to be 
host of the display in his buildings garage 
the exhibit on the constitutions bicentennial mounted on large 
panels that cant be squeezed through an ordinary door frame is 
making the rounds of all 53 counties in north dakota and is due in 
slope county on april 1216 
folks here say amidon is believed to be the smallest county seat 
in the nation the 1980 census listed the population as 43 but 
hanson thinks that overstates the case there are 29 people who 
live here all the time he said 
the doorframe problem ruled out amidons courthouse and its 
school and the only church in town with big enough doors couldnt 
work the statesponsored exhibit into its schedule 
we came up with the idea that they have large enough doors at 
the horse around bar said lois anderson county superintendent 
of schools 
hansons business is a former gas station and auto shop the 
exhibit will be in the shop area separated by a wall so visiting 
schoolchildren will be spared the sight of anyone downing a brew 
while they ponder the founding fathers 
well just have to move some things around hanson said 
ill have to move my pickup out 
the tavern will be the most unusual place the exhibit has been 
displayed said john schmaltz of the state department of public 
instruction which helped create the exhibit 
weve been booking it primarily in schools public libraries 
shopping malls and in some cases courthouses he said but in 
the town of amidon its going to be in the horse around bar

a bomb explosion injured 16 people 
wednesday in a department store in southern davao city on mindanao 
island and a larger bomb was defused in the same building police 
said 
the bomb exploded shortly before midnight in a building that 
also houses an office of the governments passport bureau said 
police sgt dominado balicoco 
he said those hurt were passersby hit by flying glass balicoco 
said police found a larger explosive device later in the same 
building and defused it 
it was the second bombing in a major mindanao island city in two 
days on tuesday two air force sergeants were killed when they 
tried to defuse bombs found at andrews air force base in zamboanga 
city 270 miles west of davao 
police said they did not know who planted the bombs but there 
was speculation moslem rebels were responsible both davao and 
zamboanga are largely christian cities but mindanao is the 
stronghold of the 5 millionstrong moslem minority 
the leader of the nations largest moslem rebel group called on 
wednesday for an uprising against president corazon aquino and said 
her government was planning to resume genocide in our homeland 
nur misuari head of the moro national liberation front claimed 
in a telephone interview with radio station dzxl that the 
government wanted to wipe out moslems seeking autonomy on mindanao 
and other southern islands 
he spoke from amman jordan where he was attending the annual 
meeting of foreign ministers of the 46nation organization of 
islamic conference 
the government had no immediate comment on misuaris charge 
fighting between moslem rebels and the government has claimed 
more than 50000 lives since 1976 by official count but has been 
reduced to only occasional skirmishes in recent years 
the military said eight people were killed tuesday when gunmen 
believed to be from the moro national liberation front attacked a 
marine detachment on basilan island 
defense minister fidel ramos predicted less trouble with moslem 
rebels in mindanao because the islamic conference rejected the 
moslem groups bid for membership indicating it considers the 
rebellion strictly a philippine matter 
but misauri denied the conference rejected his groups 
application 
jordans foreign minister taher masri the conference chairman 
told reporters tuesday the group was not qualified for membership 
they are not a state and therefore their status cannot entitle 
them to become a member masri said 
the islamic conference has been mediating the philippine moslem 
conflict since shortly after rebel factions began a secessionist 
war on mindanao and the sulu island chain in late 1972

a jury wednesday ruled that a radio station 
owned by jimmy swaggart ministries owes 28000 in back taxes to 
the city of shenandoah 
swaggart ministries based in baton rouge la had claimed 
kjojfm qualified as a place of worship and was therefore tax 
exempt but city officials said it owed 64043 in real estate and 
personal property taxes from from 1980 to 1987 
the state district court jury decided 102 that the ministry 
should pay 28000 because only half the building qualifies as a 
church the other half was real estate and leased property the 
jury said 
shenandoah city manager natalie kelly said city council will 
consider an appeal 
swaggarts ministry has been rocked by allegations swaggart 
hired a prostitute to pose nude for him 
michael darlow representing the city of shenandoah had told 
jury what happens if you grant jimmy swaggart ministries a 
religious exemption what if a restaurant opens up and has passages 
from the bible in its menu and says theyre a place of religious 
worship 
we have to stop somewhere i suggest the place to stop is here 
and now darlow said 
swaggart ministries attorney james bradford argued the ministry 
is asking to pay real estate taxes only on the half of the building 
not used for the radio station he said the ministry should receive 
a full tax exemption on personal property related to the second 
floor of the building which houses the station

secretary of state george p shultz on 
wednesday night ruled out any agreement to end the 7year war in 
afghanistan unless the soviet union suspends military aid to the 
marxist government there 
shultz also outlined sharp disagreements on central america and 
the middle east at the end of three days of talks with soviet 
foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze 
he said the soviets wanted us military aid to an unspecified 
number of central american governments halted as a condition for 
them to stop supplying nicaragua in its war with contra rebels 
it did not seem something we could pursue shultz said 
on the middle east he said shevardnadze envisioned an active 
role for moscow in arabisraeli negotiations 
shultz said that would get in the way of talks between the two 
sides the soviet concept is sharply different from ours 
shultz said 
on human rights however there was apparent progress 
shultz said shevardnadze gave assurances that moscow would 
consider changes in visa requirements for wouldbe emigrants and 
also in the way religious observances are treated 
but at a state department news conference shultz stressed the 
disagreements with shevardnadze especially over afghanistan 
he said the foreign minister had rejected a us proposal for a 
moratorium on new weapons shipments to kabul while the soviets 
withdrew their troops and for three months afterward 
he said the united states offered to suspend its support for the 
afghan resistance during the same period 
they didnt feel they could agree to that shultz said 
and yet shultz said those conditions are needed for us to be 
able to sign as a guarantor of an international agreement to end 
the conflict 
shevardnadze told a news conference that the soviet union had no 
intention of stopping its aid to the afghan government 
the aid is required by a sovietafghan treaty those are 
legitimate supplies and we are not going to rescind that treaty 
shevardnadze said 
he repeated statements by a soviet spokesman last week that 
moscow is willing to undertake a troop withdrawal even without an 
agreement at afghan peace negotiations under way in geneva 
but he did not give a date for withdrawal 
shultz said the soviets were willing to withdraw the red army by 
the end of the year beginning with a 50 percent pullout during the 
first three months in which the agreement was in effect 
the guarantee of a withdrawal filled a great big hole in the 
situation shultz said 
but he said soviet military aid to the marxist government must 
cease for stability to return to the wartorn country and for an 
estimated 5 million refugees to go home 
the proposal remains on the table shultz said if our 
thought or something close to it is accepted we would be pleased to 
sign on as a guarantor 
the negotiations are being conducted by diego cordovez a united 
nations mediator between afghanistan and pakistan

president reagan announced wednesday he would 
go to moscow from may 29 to june 2 for his fourth summit meeting 
with soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev and his first visit to a 
nation he once branded an evil empire 
the fiveday visit will mark the first trip to moscow by an 
american president since richard nixons 1974 summer meeting with 
leonid brezhnev later that same year in november gerald ford met 
with brezhnev in the soviet port city of vladivostok 
the summits intended centerpiece is the signing of a treaty to 
scrap 30 percent to 50 percent of the superpowers longrange 
bombers missiles and submarines however reagan already has 
suggested an agreement will not be ready saying time is too 
limited 
secretary of state george p shultz and soviet foreign minister 
eduard a shevardnadze reported wednesday night that differences 
remained between the two sides on the accord 
at separate news conferences they also disclosed sharp 
disagreements on explosive regional issues afghanistan the middle 
east and central america 
shultz told reporters at the state department that he ruled out 
any agreement to end the war in afghanistan unless the soviet union 
suspends military aid to the marxist government the united states 
will continue aiding afghan rebels 
he said shevardnadze rejected a us proposal for a moratorium 
on new weapons shipments to kabul during the soviet withdrawal and 
for three months afterward the united states would suspend its 
support for the afghan rebels during the same period 
i have ruled out this shevardnadze told a news conference 
he said the aid was a soviet treaty obligation and were not 
going to rescind that treaty as shevardnadze spoke the chants 
of critics of soviet policies in armenia demonstrating outside the 
soviet embassy could be heard in the room 
shultz said the soviets wanted military aid to an unspecified 
number of central american governments halted as a condition for 
them to stop supplying nicaragua in its war with the contra rebels 
as for bringing peace to the middle east the soviet concept 
is sharply different from ours shultz said 
the two said in a joint statement they would meet again in 
moscow on april 2125 and also in may but did not indicate where 
that session would be held 
both sides have worked hard and some progress has been 
realized in a number of areas but much more needs to be done 
the statement said 
asked wednesday if a treaty would be completed reagan said i 
have no way of answering that and added that the two nations were 
committed to the cutback 
shevardnadze asked if a treaty would be ready said through a 
translator it is possible this is not an easy task this is a 
very complicated task but we are becoming convinced that it is 
doable 
there are many difficult questions of a technical nature 
mostly in verification but in principle this can be done the 
foreign minister said as he left the white house following two 
hours of talks and lunch with reagan 
the summit announcement capped three days of meetings between 
shevardnadze and shultz after a morning round of talks at the 
state department shevardnadze went to the white house 
within minutes of his arrival shevardnadze and reagan stepped 
from the oval office to the sunsplashed rose garden to disclose 
the longawaited summit dates 
we have set the date and now we shall take care of good 
substance good content for the summit shevardnadze said 
the soviet foreign minister returned to the state department in 
midafternoon and met with shultz past the dinner hour they 
received reports from separate groups of us and soviet experts 
working on arms control human rights and regional issues including 
afghanistan central america the middle east and the iraniraq war 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said the president would 
spend all of his time in the soviet capital following the pattern 
set by gorbachev when he remained in washington during his december 
summit with reagan however first lady nancy reagan is planning a 
day trip to leningrad 
white house planners are exploring the possibility of setting up 
meetings with soviet dissidents and refuseniks as well as 
arranging a presidential trip to a performance by the bolshoi 
ballet 
asked what the summit would achieve if an arms agreement is not 
sealed reagan said there are a number of other subjects that we 
continue to discuss with each other 
in recent weeks a number of dates were rumored for the summit 
all of them in the week before may 29 
fitzwater said the timing was not finally settled until 
midmorning wednesday we had a set of dates at the end of may 
they had a set of dates at the beginning of june these are the 
compromise dates we came up with he said 
at the white house talks shevardnadze devoted most of his 
presentation to the strategic arms talks reagans star wars 
missile defense system which has been an obstacle to an arms 
agreement did not come up fitzwater said 
reagan will leave washington on may 26 or may 27 stopping two 
or three nights in helsinki finland the spokesman said that is 
intended to let him adjust to the eighthour time difference 
between washington and moscow and to make a scenesetting speech 
for the talks with gorbachev 
before returning to washington reagan will stop in london to 
brief allies and make another speech summing up the trip fitzwater 
said a news conference also is planned after the summit but that 
the location has not been determined 
the actual summit in moscow probably will be confined to three 
days the same as the december meeting in washington fitzwater 
said the fiveday schedule includes arrival and departure dates 
he added 
reagan who built his political career as an ardent 
anticommunist came into office in 1981 saying kremlin leaders did 
not hesitate to lie or cheat to achieve their goals toughening his 
line he later called the soviet union an evil empire 
however he softened his tone in his second term and worked out 
a treaty signed in december to abolish us and soviet 
mediumrange nuclear missiles 
reagan has said gorbachev is different from other soviet 
leaders with his campaign for openness and reform after the 
december summit he said he felt the soviets no longer were intent 
on world domination and that the two superpowers can live in peace

the postal rate increase that will push the 
cost of mailing a firstclass letter to 25 cents next month is 
likely to affect consumers in a host of other areas as well as 
businesses pass along their own higher costs 
while firstclass rates will be most readily noticed the 
charges to businesses for mailing bills and advertising and sending 
books and magazines to american homes also affect individuals 
prices and subscription rates may well increase with the postage 
costs being cited as a factor 
the new rates for example would add about 115 to the annual

department envoys who encouraged him to step down as commander of 
panamas defense forces and to accept a spanish offer of political

henry kissinger alexander m haig jr and 
other advisers to president nixon from 1969 to 1974 rejected 
proposals for a more outspoken policy on soviet human rights and 
refused to let some jewish groups use the white house as a 
platform according to newly released presidential documents 
the advisers favored a more lowprofile effort involving 
behindthescenes negotiations with the soviets the documents 
indicate 
the guidance from general haig is that we should not get the 
president involved in our replies to soviet jewry correspondence 
aide a denis clift said in a memorandum on how the white house 
should respond to letters from critics of soviet policies 
kissinger himself wrote there is virtually no way the united 
states could exert public pressure on the soviet union to improve

church people prefer being led by 
ordained clergy rather than lay professionals even though the 
clergy are not considered very effective a national study of roman 
catholics and protestants finds 
catholics were found somewhat more confident in lay leadership 
than protestants but also favored ordaining women and married men 
which catholicism forbids to keep up the clergy supply 
the yearlong study by hartford seminarys center for social and 
religious research was prompted by growing concern over a clergy 
shortage 
lay leaders at more than 200 parishes across the country were 
asked to consider 12 leadership tasks rating them according to 
importance and how effective the clergy handle them 
for preaching liturgical leadership pastoral counseling 
directing religious education parish evangelization and parish 
planning the gap between importance and effectiveness ranges from 
30 perceent to 40 percent among catholics the study found 
the gap among three protestant denominations surveyed ranged 
between 20 percent and 30 percent the protestants studied were the 
episcopal church the lutheran church in america and the united 
methodist church 
the study also found both protestants and catholics somewhat 
cool toward professional lay leaders but with catholics more 
willing for lay professionals to perform many of the chores now 
undertaken by the clergy 
aproximately 60 percent of members of each denomination 
expressed strong or moderate agreement that the morale in their 
parish or congregation would be adversely affected were they not 
able to secure a fulltime ordained pastor 
also except for lutherans 52 precent over 60 percent of all 
respondents agree that the average lay person responds best to 
ordained leadership the researchers wrote 
when asked what option they would chose if unable to afford a 
fulltime pastor more than 80 percent preferred some form of 
ordained parttime leadership to either fulltime or parttime lay 
leadership 
the seminary an interdenominational theological center 
released a preliminary report on its yearlong study last week a 
fuller report is due later this year 
one purpose was to examine attitudes toward professional lay 
leadership and its comparative costs 
in general protestant clergy were compensated at a rate nearly 
double what catholic priests receive an average of 45005 a year 
for an episcopal priest compared to 26376 a year for a catholic 
priest compensation includes salary plus such items as housing 
health care and retirement benefits 
the study said protestants would save if professional lay 
leaders replaced clergy to run parishes for catholics the costs 
would be closer to the same 
fulltime lay professionals earn an average of 23246 a year 
among united methodists the top among protestants compared to 
16754 among episcoplians and 18527 a year among catholics 
the research team included jackson w carroll hartford 
seminarys research director dean r hoge a sociology professor 
at catholic university in washington dc and the rev francis k 
sheets a church management specialist 
they gathered information from eight metropolitan areas nashua 
nh trenton nj orlando fla mobile ala dallas 
cleveland colorado springs colo and bremerton wash 
the 2209 lay leaders in 201 parishes submitted 1829 completed 
questionaires 
the question of who will minister to churchgoers in the future 
is of critical importance to church officials 
among catholics its estimated that the number of priests will 
decline by 40 percent by the year 2000 the number of catholic 
seminarians declined from 8885 in 1965 to 4063 in 1985 the 
researchers said 
among protestants there is an oversupply of clergy for some 
larger welltodo parishes while theres an increasing shortage 
among smaller parishes unable to afford the cost of fulltime 
clergy members researchers said 
the study found that catholics pay substantially less per 
household to suport their priests compared to protestant 
households catholics contribute an average 28 per household 
annually to pay for priests compared to lutherans who topped the 
survey with an annual contribution of 342 per household 
among other findings 
about 75 percent of catholic lay leaders compared to about half 
the protestants believe most tasks currently done by ordained 
pastors can be done equally well by lay persons with special 
competence for the task 
about half the catholics prefer priests rather than lay people 
give sermons compared to 75 percent among protestants 
more than twothirds of the protestants want their priests to 
lead the confirmation classes compared to 25 percent among 
catholics

churches can be effective partners in helping

house subcommittee he said churches and other private groups have 
labored valiantly to take up the slack caused by erosion of 
government programs 
but he said the private sector cant substitute for the 
essential responsibility of the government 
increased church efforts he said are a desperate attempt to 
feed hungry people when others have abandoned their 
responsibility but we cannot pretend that soup kitchens and 
shelters are sufficient 
they cannot substitute for a national commitment to end hunger

parker stevenson smiles at the suggestion 
that his character on the new abc series probe appears to be a 
cross between sherlock holmes and tom swift 
austin james is an eccentric scientist who uses his remarkable 
mental skills to fight crime his knowledge has made him fabulously 
wealthy but he prefers to avoid the think tank he founded and live 
in an old warehouse he calls the batcave 
i think of him more as sherlock holmes and elmer fudd said 
stevenson since there is a fumbling aspect to his personality 
im playing a whacko hes clever but whacko thats what made me 
anxious to go back and do another series i dont see myself 
getting bored doing this 
he sleeps naked in an isolation tank actually its a tool 
cabinet he drink martinis and eat blocks of frozen peas hes 
different than macgyver or the knight rider you always know 
that sherlock holmes can figure it out in some episodes youre 
never really sure if austin james will get it 
austin james in probe is sort of a oneman brain trust he 
solves crimes by being receptive to data that other people miss 
ashley crow plays naive and inexperienced mickey castle his dr 
watson 
her point of view becomes valuable to him stevenson said 
and shes fascinated enough by what he does to stick around and 
put up with the grief 
the onehour series was created by famed sciencefiction writer 
isaac asimov and michael wagner former story editor of hill 
street blues asimov came up with the characters and concept and 
wagner wrote the pilot 
ive never met isaac said stevenson but id love to have 
him come on the show as my mentor and throw me a few words of 
wisdom if i start to run amok isaac lives in new york and wont 
fly 
probe appears on abc at 8 pm est thursdays where its up 
against nbcs the cosby show and a different world 
fortunately for stevenson its not up against nbcs cheers 
which stars his wife kirstie alley 
this is the first series for stevenson since he did a 
halfseason on cbs falcon crest in the 198485 season before 
that he was in the hardy boys in 197779 
i was a bad guy on falcon crest which was fun he said 
you dont want to do the same kind of character all the time the 
last few years ive been doing different kinds of roles its 
helped me rediscover why i went into this business in the first 
place 
i think the intention was to bring me in and kill me off i 
did more episodes than i thought i would but they still ended up 
burying me in a graveyard 
in recent times hes also played an amoral newspaper reporter in 
the cbs movie betrayal of trust and in episodes of alfred 
hitchcock presents and the hitchhiker 
last year he was in the second part of the abc miniseries 
north and south he played bill hazzard from the northern 
family who married genie francis from the southern family kirstie 
alley played his sister in both installments 
stevenson grew up in new york city where he started doing 
commercials and movies when he was about 14 his first movie was 
a separate peace he was also in the cult film lifeguard 
with sam elliott 
the hardy boys got me established he said i learned 
about directing studios networks it was a paid education then 
came the hangover which has to do with being typecast and 
inexperienced i feel ive had several shots at an acting career i 
feel lucky because usually you have only one chance in this 
business 
and the answer to that lingering question is yes he and 
jameson parker of cbs simon amp simon are frequently mistaken 
for each other we get each others mail he said i got an 
invitation for an expensepaid trip to florida to attend the 
premiere of one of his movies the funny thing is jameson and i did 
a commercial together in new york years ago now we laugh about all 
the mixup

at 92 val browning piles his two 
dogs into a car each day and drives 17 miles to keep alive the name 
and reputation of the most prolific firearms inventor in history 
browning is the former president and now honorary chairman of 
the board of the firearms company named for his father john m 
browning who designed more than 80 military and sporting arms 
a list of john brownings inventions could serve as the 
framework for any history of firearms over the last century it 
includes the winchester model 1886 leveraction repeating rifle 
americas first smokelesspowder sporting rifle the automatic 
shotgun the colt 45 automatic pistol and all the machine guns 
used by us troops on land sea or air from world war i to the 
korean war 
he was a most unpretentious man you would never know he was a 
man of any renown to meet there was never any kind of show says 
val browning whose description of his father could apply equally 
to the son 
respected firearms inventor himself with 48 patents generous 
benefactor of colleges and hospitals decorated by belgian royalty 
val browning nevertheless has lived his life in the shadow of a 
giant 
he was such an extraordinary genius and accomplished so much 
that there wasnt much left to do in firearms design except to take 
advantage of modern materials and methods val browning said of 
his father during an interview at corporate headquarters 
indeed val brownings two most satisfying inventions were 
improvements to his fathers designs a quickloading feature for 
the automatic shotgun and a singletrigger mechanism for the 
overunder doublebarrel shotgun 
vals son john val browning 62 was president of browning for 
14 years until just before it was acquired in 1977 by fabrique 
nationale darmes de guerre of belgium he speaks with insight 
about the challenge his father faced as a son of the great inventor 
its a very difficult problem for him the younger browning 
said but i think that he always understood it he was always 
striving to do something on his own he just didnt sit down and 
live off the fame of his father and what he could do he did 
two years ago father and son returned to belgium where val 
browning had charge of his fathers firearms interests from 1920 to 
1935 and to northern france where as a young second lieutenant in 
1918 he instructed american troops in the use of two john browning 
inventions the 30caliber watercooled machine gun and the 
fabled browning automatic rifle or bar 
i was up at the front to keep track of them and to report on 
their performance val browning said 
his fathers 50caliber machine gun was produced too late for 
use in world war i a conflict triggered in 1914 when a john 
browningdesigned 32caliber pistol was used to assassinate 
austrian archduke franz ferdinand and his wife sophie at sarajevo 
eight years after the war at the fabrique nationale plant at 
liege john browning 72 suddenly took ill val browning who was 
with him recalls the moment 
he said son i think im dying i said no i dont think 
so i was of course trying to encourage him but he was and he 
did 
returning to his native ogden utah in 1935 val browning 
became president of the jm amp ms browning co and browning arms 
co a post he held until 1962 when he was succeeded by his son 
john 
but today only val browning remains associated with the 
sporting arms company formed the year after his fathers death 
thats one reason why i stayed on so there would be somebody 
with the name connected with it he said 
like his father val browning is a habitual walker and was 
before injuring his shoulder four years ago an avid hunter of 
duck pigeons and small game 
if i didnt eat what i shot i wouldnt shoot it he said 
touching on reasons he believes the sporting arms business has a 
rocky future 
population growth dwindling wildlife habitat and the general 
feeling against firearms in this country make it so that its 
rather an undesirable business to be in he said 
his son puts it another way the idea of going out hunting is 
considered somewhat reprehensible the same sensitivity does not 
seem to extend to fish 
val browning father of four and a widower since 1975 embraces 
life with an avidity and humor that belie his years his dogs beau 
and jill join him as he drives up weber canyon to company 
headquarters at mountain green he keeps busy there for three or 
four hours a day sometimes testfiring brownings latest line 
an early riser who walks two miles a day he quit smoking 50 
years ago when an errant cigarette ash ruined a good suit 
also i used to like a cocktail very much indeed and 
sometimes three of them but hes learned to sort of listen to 
what my system was trying to tell me and a single cocktail every 
couple of months in social settings to ease a natural shyness is 
all he allows himself 
he has the blood pressure of a 16yearold says his cook 
nancy clifford 
more refined than his frontier father he reads constantly has 
a substantial art collection and loves music 
im trying to understand atonal music but i think im a 
little bit too old for that he says in the deadpan that sets up 
the punchline in other words i cant whistle it

the death of an ibm executive in a 1985 airplane 
crash deprived him of more than 6 million in earnings according 
to a federal jury that awarded 795 million to the estates of the 
man and his wife 
attorneys for delta air lines immediately moved to set aside the 
verdict delivered monday night after five hours of deliberations 
in the case brought by the estate of philip d estridge 47 of new 
canaan conn and his wife mary ann who also died in the crash 
tuesday another ibm executive who lost a daughter in the crash 
and claimed his career was damaged by his emotional reaction to 
that loss won a 35 million damage judgment against delta in a 
case that was tried in west palm beach fla the flight originated 
in fort lauderdale 
attorney lee kreindler who represented the estridge estate 
said the sum awarded in the new york case was a record for 
compensatory damages in a wrongfuldeath suit the breakdown was 
625 million for estridges loss of earning 750000 for loss of 
enjoyment of life and 100000 for mental anguish 
for the estate of mrs estridge the jury awarded 750000 for 
loss of enjoyment of life and 100000 for mental anguish the 
couples three daughters had sought 25 million for estridge and 5 
million for mrs estridge 
we dont think anything could have happened any better and 
were definitely relieved its over said evelyn eubanks one of 
the daughters it doesnt make it better but it helps us to live 
with it 
estridge who received much of the credit for moving ibm into 
the personal computer market and his wife were among 137 people 
killed when a lockheed l1011 crashed on approach at dallasfort 
worth international airport on aug 2 1985 
ibm chairman and chief executive john f akers testified at the 
trial that there was a strong possibility estridge would have 
become one of the companys six senior executives 
those executives make an average of 350000 per year with an 
additional 150000 per year in ibm stock which cannot be sold 
until retirement shortly before his death estridge was named 
overseer of ibms worldwide manufacturing operations at a yearly 
salary of 240000 
akers also testified there was a competitive market for computer 
executives and estridge could have moved to another company 
offering more money 
although the trial was held in new york city the award was 
reached under the law of estridges home state of connecticut to 
allow for the salary projection figures kreindler said 
delta lawyer john sabetta declined to comment on the award but 
asked us district judge john e sprizzo to set the jury award 
aside shortly after it was announced legal briefs on that motion 
are due may 21 
delta spokesman bill berry referred calls to the companys 
insurance carrier us aviation underwriters and had no other 
comment a us aviation spokesman bob albert was in a meeting 
and unavailable to comment 
in the florida case a federal jury deliberated less than two 
hours before awarding dennis and gayle zarnt of boca raton 35 
million for the death of their 15yearold daughter julie who 
coincidentally was aboard the same flight as the estridges 
ibm executives testified in videotaped depositions that the 
girls death left zarnt a member of the management team 
responsible for the introduction of the original ibmpc an 
emotional basket case unable to continue what had been an 
outstanding career 
delta attorney howard barwick who had argued to the jury that 
an award of about 500000 would be adequate declined to comment 
on the verdict the zarnts attorney robert m montgomery jr 
said he expected delta would appeal he had sought 5 million in 
damages 
much of ibms development of the personal computer was done at 
boca raton and the estridges had formerly lived there

down but not out of its battle for federated 
department stores inc campeau corp has launched a counterattack 
a sweetened buyout offer and a proposal for a friendly merger 
campeaus move on tuesday appeared to give it back the edge it 
recently lost to rh macy amp co inc in the highstakes campaign 
to acquire the cincinnatibased retailer 
campeau raised its twostep allcash offer to approximately 73 
a share or 653 billion from 68 a share or 618 billion 
under the new offer campeau said it would pay 82 each for 705 
million federated shares and 37 for the remainder of federateds 
895 million outstanding shares in a subsequent merger 
campeau also extended the expiration of its offer to midnight 
est april 4 when macys competing 63 billion offer is to expire 
campeau a torontobased developer also proposed to federateds 
board of directors an alternate friendly merger under which it 
would pay 73 a share for 705 million shares in a tender offer and 
73 for the remaining shares following the merger 
federated has agreed to merge with macy which is offering 
7735 a share in cash for 7043 million federated shares for a 
total of 54 billion macy would exchange shares in the merged 
company and issue convertible debt securities for the remainder of 
federateds 895 million outstanding shares 
federated stock was up 237 to 6925 a share in new york 
stock exchange composite trading tuesday campeau announced its 
sweetened offer an hour before the end of the session 
campeau had been expected to sweeten its offer or propose a 
friendly deal after the company lost two rounds in court to 
invalidate federateds poison pill takeover defense 
campeau contended its bid could not go forward while the pill 
was in effect leaving macy with the upper hand following the court 
rulings 
the defense makes a takeover prohibitively expensive by allowing 
federated shareholders to buy more of the companys stock at a 
steep discount 
it was not immediately clear how a simultaneous expiration of 
both offers would affect the application of the pill over which 
federated has sole discretion 
thats not something we can really comment on at this point 
said jim sluzewski a federated spokesman 
nancy raeside a campeau spokeswoman said the company would 
continue its legal battle to strike down the defense 
on monday a federal judge rebuffed campeaus proposal that he 
remove the pill in exchange for campeau extending its tender offer 
to expire simultaneously with macys offer 
us district judge leonard sand said the pill would remain in 
place at least until federated makes a final recommendation to its 
shareholders ms raeside said on friday sand denied campeaus 
request to invalidate the pill 
before sands ruling analysts had given campeaus allcash 
offer the edge over macys cashandstock bid but campeau appeared 
to regain the advantage with its sweetened offer said edward 
johnson an analyst with prescott ball amp turben inc 
johnson said federated shareholders likely would jump to take 
advantage of the higher price in the first stage of campeaus 
offer it puts campeaus bid ahead and leaves the ball up to 
macys he said 
macy had no immediate comment on campeaus move said maureen 
milano a spokeswoman for the retailer 
federated spokesman sluzewski said if the federated board 
received a revised offer from campeau the directors would consider 
it he said the board was scheduled to meet this week but would 
not confirm that the revised offer would be on the agenda 
in a letter to the federated board campeau proposed that a 
campeaufederated merger be structured along lines similar to the 
retailers agreement with macy 
campeau said it also would continue fighting federateds 
agreement to pay macy millions of dollars in fees if the 
macyfederated deal falls through

lucky stores inc a takeover target for 
the second time in two years is highly regarded in the supermarket 
industry for its quality management and shrewd marketing practices 
the company is on a roll analyst jonathan ziegler of sutro 
amp co inc said tuesday after american stores co made an 
unsolicited 45 a share 172 billion buyout that sent luckys 
stock soaring 
i think american wants luckys management as much they want a 
stronger foothold in california ziegler said 
lucky said from its headquarters in dublin 30 miles east of san 
francisco that it was not prepared to comment on the surprise 
offer 
but investors reacted quickly sending luckys stock climbing 
1450 a share to 4637 tuesday in heavy trading on the new york 
stock exchange the rise above american stores offer could 
indicate speculators believe the bids will go even higher some 
analysts say 50 a share is not out of the question 
if successful the acquisition by salt lake citybased american 
stores would create the nations largest supermarket chain 
lucky stores the nations no 6 grocery retailer has 480 
stores and had 64 billion in 1987 sales american stores the 
third biggest has 1600 stores and 141 billion in sales 
the bid for lucky came just over a year after takeover 
strategist asher edelman formally dropped a hostile takeover 
attempt in return for the companys agreement to 28 million of 
his legal costs 
lucky thwarted edelman partly by selling off nongrocery 
divisions and adopting antitakeover measures that make it 
difficult but not impossible for an unwanted suitor to grab the 
company 
a lot of people were looking to see how the restructured 
luckys would wind up said ron rotter an analyst for morgan 
olmstead kennedy amp gardner in los angeles 
theyre seeing a very healthy company that got out of its one 
link the midwest and is left with very strong market shares in 
much of the country he said 
in its defensive restructuring lucky stores closed its popular 
gemco department stores and sold other nongrocery divisions 
shedding thousands of employees in the process 
industry observers say the slimming gave company management the 
impetus to make longneeded structural changes that have been 
beneficial in the long run 
the poison pill antitakeover measure adopted during the 
edelman battle clash limits the voting power of any shareholder who 
acquires more than 10 percent of luckys stock 
today the company is a major force in the discount supermarket 
business its main competitors are oaklandbased safeway the 
nations largest grocery chain in northern california and vons 
and ralphs in southern california 
the one thing that makes them luckys successful is they 
have a clearly defined identity as the everyday lowprice 
leader said rotter even the competition will admit that they 
are the king at that 
other stores are constantly shifting what their identity is 
rotter said 
if successful american stores is expected to merge its weaker 
alpha beta grocery chain in california with luckys stores 
according to ziegler 
i think it makes a lot of sense for american stores and 
luckys management would get a chance to shake up alpha beta he 
said 
if the dublinbased chain fights the bid its might attempt a 
leveraged buyout or to seek a white knight friendly suitor to 
make a more attractive offer but lucky stores which had been 
exploring a possible acquisition of ralphs and further expansion 
in the food retailing business may not be able to stand on its own 
through a second takeover battle analysts said 
until tuesday the companys stock had been creeping up 
gradually since the october stock market crash it stood at 35 a 
share last oct 1 then fell to 21 before recovering to the levels 
it held before the american stores offer

in an unexpected twist real estate developer 
donald trump has offered to end his bid for resorts international 
inc and back a rival offer by entertainer merv griffin but only 
if griffin agrees only to seek stock with lesser voting rights than 
that owned by trump 
mr trumps position is quite simple his attorney jack 
nusbaum of new york said tuesday if mr griffin wishes to buy 
the other stock and become mr trumps silent partner god bless 
him 
griffin who raised his cash offer for resorts by 70 million 
to 295 million on tuesday quickly rejected trumps proposal as 
ludicrous said spokesman mark gill 
we are trying to buy the entire company gill quoted griffin 
as saying we arent interested in fooling around with portions 
or in sparring on the board with mr trump 
trump who is resorts chairman controls 88 percent of the 
companys voting power by owning nearly all of its 752000 class b 
common shares which have 100 votes each 
the company also has 57 million class a common shares with one 
vote each trump owns none of those shares 
nusbaum said if griffin amended his offer to seek only the class 
a stock trump would withdraw his bid and recommend that 
shareholders accept griffins 
griffin on raised his cash bid for all of the companys stock to 
4573 per share from his initial offer of 35 per share made last 
week 
trump is offering 22 per share for the resorts stock he doesnt 
already own principally its class a shares 
resorts class a stock price jumped 362 to 3225 on tuesday 
that is up from 2187 before griffin began his overtures 
the entertainers privatelyheld investment concern griffin 
co said it decided to boost its offer after spending the weekend 
studying resorts appraisal documents released late friday by trump 
a new yorkbased real estate developer 
those documents show a 13 billion appraisal of resorts 
properties including a whencompleted value for its luxurious but 
troubled taj mahal hotelcasino in atlantic city nj 
resorts which is based on north miami fla has operations in 
new jersey and the bahamas 
the documents also say the appraiser would be willing to support 
a 550 million bank mortgage loan secured by resorts that is the 
amount trump has said will be needed to complete the taj mahal 
whose estimated total price has ballooned to 9385 million 
currently from 535 million four years ago 
a 500 million suit griffin filed monday in new york federal 
court accused trump of failing to disclose material facts 
including the 13 billion appraisal to resorts shareholders in 
making his offer it also accused trump and resorts directors of 
breaching fiduciary duty by refusing to consider the griffin offer 
because griffins offer is contingent on getting the backing of 
trump and trump has repeatedly said he wont agree to that 
condition resorts board has declined to pursue griffins 
proposal saying it is moot 
griffins offer also hinges on trump agreeing to terminate a 
fiveyear management contract worth an estimated 100 million to 
operate resorts properties trump also has spurned that condition

the justice department says it will sue real 
estate developer donald trump for allegedly violating federal 
notification provisions in his purchases of stock in holiday corp 
and bally manufacturing corp 
at the request of the federal trade commission the department 
said it will file a lawsuit accusing trump of violating the 
hartscottrodino act fro aug 22 through nov 9 1986 when he 
bought stock in memphis tennbased holiday without complying with 
reporting and waitingperiod requirements 
the suit also will accuse trump an operator of hotels and 
casinos of violating the act from nov 13 1986 through jan 22 
1987 when he bought stock in bally without complying with the laws 
requirements 
discussions are under way to determine if a settlement can be 
reached the department said in a statement issued tuesday 
the act imposes notification and waiting requirements on 
companies and people over a certain size that are contemplating 
mergers or purchases of stocks or assets 
the law is intended to improve antitrust enforcement by ensuring 
advance notice to the government of significant mergers and similar 
transactions 
trump sought control of bally a chicagobased hotel and 
amusements company in 1987 but ended the attempt after bally 
agreed to buy 26 million shares back from him 
holiday disclosed in september 1986 amid unconfirmed takeover 
rumors that trump had purchased between 2 percent and 5 percent of 
its stock holiday later underwent a recapitalization and adopted a 
poison pill takeover defense to thwart potential suitors 
separately the justice department said it will sue wickes 
companies inc of santa monica calif accusing the company of 
violating the hartscottrodino act in its purchase of stock in the 
owenscorning fiberglass corp of toledo ohio in late 1986 
but the department will file a proposed consent decree under 
which wickes which sells lumber and other building materials 
would pay 300000 to settle the matter 
sanford c sigoloff wickes chairman and chief executive 
officer issued a statement saying his company did not believe it 
violated the disclosure requirements but settled the matter to 
avoid litigation costs 
sigoloff also contended wickes had filed under the law in 
connection with the stock purchase and the ftc initially had 
cleared the filing 
this settlement involves a longstanding technical dispute 
between the ftc and the investment community over the use of option 
agreements under the hartscottrodino rules sigoloff stated 
in a third case the department said it will accuse roxboro 
investments ltd and a subsidiary first city financial corp ltd 
both of vancouver british columbia and three officers of the 
companies with violating the hartscottrodino act they will be 
accused based on their purchase in early 1986 of stock in ashland 
oil inc of russell ky 
the three officers are samuel belzberg president of roxboro and 
first city and hyman belzberg and william belzberg vice 
presidents of the two companies 
the complaint will accuse the two companies and the three 
officers of violating the act from feb 19 through april 2 1986 
when they bought ashland stock without complying with some of the 
laws requirements 
first city attorneys issued a statement late tuesday saying they 
had been discussing a settlement with the department and believed a 
final agreement would be reached soon

japanese construction companies have proposed a 
meeting with their us counterparts to help defuse tension over a 
construction trade issue causing serious friction between their 
respective governments according to industry officials 
officials of the japan federation of construction contractors 
said tuesday it sent a letter proposing the meeting in response to 
an unofficial approach recently made by the international 
engineering and construction industries council iecic in the 
united states 
the japanese move came following last weeks breakdown in 
negotiations over the us demand that japan allow us companies 
to participate in various construction projects in japan 
the united states has given japan two weeks in which to come up 
with a satisfactory response or face retaliation 
last week the japanese government advised us commerce 
secretary william verity that it was working hard in order to 
present a further substantive offer and a fresh round of talks 
was expected to start in washington this week 
according to officials of the construction federation the 
letter noted the dispute has been escalating and the two nations 
differing viewpoints may have arisen from a perception gap the 
two trade rganizations should hold a privatesector meeting and 
find the ways of cooperating to defuse the tension the letter 
stated 
officials said construction companies in other countries had 
strong interest in gaining access to the japanese market where 
projects worth more than 50 trillion yen about 393 billion at 
current exchange rates are undertaken annually 
the federation last may established a special office to handle 
queries from other countries on legal and other procedures for 
taking part in construction projects in japan and reportedly 
received more than 30 queries

hostile suitor black amp decker corp has dropped 
its bid for american standard inc allowing the target companys 
245 billion leveraged buyout to go forward 
black amp deckers announcement tuesday that it would drop its 
monthslong pursuit of american standard followed a bizarre turn of 
events that halted trading in the companys stock for several hours 
for no apparent reason 
american standard agreed last week to a 78 a share leveraged 
buyout led by the investment firm kelso amp co thwarting the rival 
77 a share 24 billion bid from black amp decker 
under the agreement reached tuesday with american standard the 
towsonbased tool and appliance manufacturer withdrew its hostile 
tender offer and agreed not to purchase american standard stock 
until kelso had an opportunity to pursue the leveragd buyout 
kelso will pay black amp decker 25 million for withdrawing its 
bid and black amp decker reserved the right to mount another 
takeover of american standard if kelso terminated its offer or 
failed to acquire shares by may 2 
seventyseven dollars was our top price said barbara 
lucas a black amp decker spokeswoman ms lucas also said black amp 
decker initially had thought kelso would be unable to finance its 
proposal but tht apparently was not the case 
an american standard spokeswoman said the company had no comment 
on the agreement 
earlier tuesday the new york stock exchange halted trading in 
black amp decker and american standard shares for three hours in 
anticipation of an announcement by black amp decker that never 
materialized 
nyse vice president richard torrenzano said black amp decker 
initiated a call to the exchange and shared with us 
information concerning the american standard bid which materially 
could affect the price of their stock 
but after trading was halted at 1046 am est several 
conversations took place between black amp decker and exchange 
officials before it was determined that no announcement was 
forthcoming 
the exchange also conferred with american standard who 
advised us that it knows of no reason why trading in its stock 
should not resume torrenzano said the exchange resumed trading 
trading in both stocks at 143 pm est 
the stock exchange most often halts trading when announcements 
that could affect a companys stock price are anticipated 
typically however trading is only suspended for about 30 minutes 
while news is being disseminated torrenzano said 
it was unclear immediately whether the unusual turn of events 
would provoke an investigation by market regulators such as the 
securities and exchange commission 
on the day american standard shares dipped 12 cents to 7662 
per share on the nyse black amp decker rose 37 cents to 20 a share 
black amp decker made its initial offer of 56 a share in late 
january and sweetened it several times in response to rejections 
by american standard 
american standard a new yorkbased plumbing and air 
conditioning equipment maker several weeks ago proposed a 
defensive recapitalization aimed at making the company a more 
expensive takeover target by loading it up with new debt 
wall street analyst cornelius v sewell said the buyout led by 
kelso would leave american standard with a some very heavy debt 
they will presumably have a negative book value said 
sewell of argus research corp in new york 
sewell speculated that american standard was likely to sell its 
transportation products division valued at about 600 million to 
help pay off buyout costs

koppers co has spurned a sweetened 16 
billion cash buyout offer from british investor brian beazer and 
the investment firm shearson lehman hutton inc and said it still 
was pursuing alternative plans to remain independent 
the board continues to believe that the company remaining 
independent is a superior alternative to accepting your offer 
chairman charles r pullin told beazer in a letter released tuesday 
by koppers 
the beazershearson group raised its offer on sunday to 56 per 
share from 45 per share for the pittsburgh construction materials 
paving services and chemicals company 
pullin also declined beazers invitation to negotiate a friendly 
merger 
koppers stock declined 50 cents to 57 a share tuesday on the 
new york stock exchange 
koppers announced earlier it was considering a recapitalization 
plan that might include a special cash dividend to shareholders 
along with equity interest in the recapitalized company such a 
program would make koppers a more expensive takeover target because 
of the debt it would incur to make the cash payment to shareholders 
koppers said two major banks which it declined to identify 
have offered to arrange 1125 billion in credit to fund the 
recapitalization 
koppers has also said it might sell all or part of the building 
materials and paving services businesses sought by beazer 
the british investor has indicated he might settle for just

ailing first republicbank corp may have to divest 
itself of some of its banks to become more attractive to investors 
experts say 
first republicbank weakened by a run on deposits and recent 
multimilliondollar losses received a 1 billion injection of 
capital last week from the federal deposit insurance corp 
but because it could take as much as 5 billion to rescue the 
nations 13thlargest bank holding company banking regulators are 
considering selling first republicbanks individual operations as a 
marketing alternative 
fdic chairman l william seidman said such a move certainly is 
an option 
no spokesman for firstrepublic bank was available tuesday to 
comment on the idea 
the first thing you think of is splitting the company into 
bitesize morsels said james sexton a former fdic director of 
supervision who is a consultant at bracewell amp patterson an 
austin texas law firm 
the holding companys banks in major markets could be packaged 
together or in regional or in statewide combinations analysts 
said the holding company has banks in dallas austin houston and 
san antonio 
its a very large bank for someone else to acquire said 
tanya azarchs a banking analyst with new yorkbased standard amp 
poors corp i dont see anyone on the scene thats willing to do 
that 
although the breakup of the holding company could make it more 
accessible to investors some argue it would be better if the 
company remained intact 
these banks are intertwined having common management 
borrowers and computer systems sexton said breaking off 
chunks presents some tough administrative problems 
the bank holding company already is consolidating some of its 
banks which could make a breakup more difficult first 
republicbank already has cut the number of banks from 103 to 73 
and plans to consolidate until only 40 banks are left 
first republicbank reported a 1987 loss of 6568 million 392 
billion in problem assets and had deposit outflows of more than 2 
billion this year its assets total about 332 billion

when the new postage rates take effect april 
3 americans will be using special e stamps on an interim basis 
the stamps were printed bearing the letter e instead of the 
amount of postage because the new firstclass rate was not known 
in time for printing of the millions of stamps needed for a new 
rate to take effect 
the e stamps will represent 25 cents postage 
in addition some post offices should have supplies of the 
25cent stamp featuring the portrait of adventure writer jack 
london which was introduced last year 
and most offices have supplies of 1cent 2cent and 3cent 
stamps to combine with current 22cent stamps to reach the new 
quarter rate 
undenominated stamps have been used four times in the past 
although the basic design of the stamp has changed 
the a b c and d stamps all showed the head of an eagle each 
in a different color 
the e stamp carries a multicolored spacebased image of the 
planet with the word earth printed beneath 
the stamp also carries the notation domestic since it can be 
used only for mail within the country mail traveling to other 
nations requires stanps that show their denomination

the price of a stamp will rise to a quarter on 
april 3 the first hike in 38 months and one the postmaster general 
said today he hopes will hold for at least that long 
we hope we will go that long or longer the next time 
postmaster general anthony frank said on cbstvs this morning 
show 
frank said the biggest reaction to the higher rates has come 
from major business mailers who will face the largest increase and 
this could affect the amount of socalled junk mail sent out 
i think there could be a little more space in your mailbox 
over the next few months frank said 
most noticeable to the public of course is the new firstclass 
quarter rate but the overall hikes affect many other areas too 
including mailing bills books and magazines and other items 
the new rates for example would add about 115 to the annual 
cost of mailing a weekly newsmagazine to one home utilities 
credit card companies and department stores will have to spend 
about 36 cents more annually to bill one customer the cost of an 
average book club mailing will rise by about 50 cents 
the increases are needed to avoid deficits for the agency that 
could reach 5 billion in 1989 postal officials said tuesday in 
announcing the april 3 rate hike the last rate increase was in 
february 1985 and the postal service lost more than 220 million 
last year 
the new 25cent letter rate is part of a broad series of rate 
changes affecting all types of mail 
these are the first adjustments in general postage rates in 
more than three years they reflect the higher costs the postal 
service is experiencing said john n griesemer chairman of the 
agencys board of governors 
the postal service is required to break even over time by 
the 1970 law that made it an independent federal agency and ended 
the taxpayer subsidy for the mail 
frank said post offices across the country will expand window 
service during the next two weeks to help customers cope with the 
changes 
but while service is being expanded temporarily to help during 
the changeover recently imposed reductions in post office hours 
and services are not related to the rate increases and are likely 
to remain in effect those cutbacks result from congressional 
action in december while these rate hikes have been in the works 
for nearly a year 
facing the biggest increase will be the socalled junk mail 
thirdclass advertising material that the independent postal rate 
commission concluded wasnt paying its fair share 
advertising mail prices will increase 249 percent compared to 
hikes of 181 percent for newspapers and magazines and 147 percent 
for items sent by individuals 
the new 25cent first class price means that sending a oneounce 
letter will take about the same bite from the average budget as in 
1932 adjusted for inflation the 3cent postage rate introduced in 
1932 would amount to 255 cents today 
the price for each additional ounce of mail will rise from 17 
cents to 20 cents the cost to mail a post card will increase from 
14 cents to 15 cents 
for mail going outside the country the rate will be 45 cents per 
halfounce to most areas for mail to mexico the rate is the same 
as in the united states while sending a letter to canada will cost 
30 cents per ounce 
the agency did cut from 7 cents to 5 cents the minimum charge 
for a business using prepaid envelopes that allow consumers to 
reply without a stamp that officials said may encourage more 
businesses to offer the service 
the postal rate commission said it determined that thirdclass 
advertising mail was responsible for more postal service costs than 
it was paying and thus should have a larger increase 
the minimum rate for third class mail will jump from 125 cents 
to 167 cents and the per pound rate will rise from 38 cents to 48 
cents 
for nonprofit advertising mail the minimum rate will increase 
from 85 cents to 87 cents 
second class mail newspapers and magazines for the most part 
face overall increases of just over 18 percent 
newspapers sent within the county will rise to 98 cents per 
pound and 34 to 59 cents per piece the current rate is 91 cents 
per pound and 31 to 49 cents per item 
a new 875 rate for the highly competitive express overnight 
mail was set for packages of 8 ounces or less 
a special nondenominated e stamp has been prepared for use 
when the new rates take effect 
because the agency had no way of knowing what rate would be 
recommended it had the e stamps printed for use at whatever the 
rate turned out to be the same procedure was used the last four 
times rates were raised

the us economy grew at a brisk 48 percent annual rate in the 
final three months of 1987 while february consumer prices were 
modestly higher indicating that inflation was under control the 
government reported today 
the commerce department said the gross national product the 
broadest measure of economic health grew from october to december 
at the fastest clip in about two years 
it was the second upward revision in gnp growth a month ago the 
government put gnp growth at 45 percent up from a 42 percent 
original estimate made in january immediately after the quarter 
ended 
todays revisions showed more strength than previously believed 
in such key sectors as consumer spending business investment and 
us exports 
in a second report the department said us corporations 
aftertax profits rose 16 percent in the fourth quarter the 
poorest showing since profits fell 37 percent in the first quarter 
of 1987 profits were up 55 percent in the third quarter 
in its report on inflation the labor department said that last 
months consumer prices rose a modest 02 percent due to lower food 
and energy costs 
food prices fell 03 percent after rising 03 percent in 
january energy costs which had fallen 07 percent in the 
preceding month fell 06 percent last month 
so far this year consumer prices have been increasing at a rate 
of 32 percent that compares to the moderate 44 percent rate for 
all of 1987 and the scant 11 percent 1986 increase 
on tuesday the commerce department said that orders to us 
factories for durable goods items expected to last at least three 
years fell 18 percent in february to a seasonally adjusted 
1114 billion following an identical decline in january 
in other economic news on tuesday the dow jones average of 30 
industrial stocks fell 099 point to 206615 the dollar was mixed 
against other major currencies and bond prices were little changed 
in light trading 
february marked the first time since the spring of 1986 that 
durable goods orders declined for two consecutive months 
but some economists maintained that manufacturing companies 
still were enjoying good business because the weaker dollar has 
boosted export demand 
cynthia latta an economist with data resources inc said that 
while new orders fell in february the total backlog of unfilled 
orders rose 07 percent the 12th consecutive monthly increase 
this backlog suggests that factories can keep humming along 
for a while even though new orders dropped she said 
still analysts said the backtoback declines showed 
businesses were cutting back on orders in the early part of 1988 in 
an effort to get control of bulging inventories inventories 
swelled at the end of 1987 while consumer demand fell

lucky stores incs stock soared 1450 a 
share tuesday after the major california supermarket chain received 
a 174 billion tender offer from american stores co 
if american stores 45ashare bid is successful it would 
create the nations largest grocery store chain in heavy trading 
on the new york stock exchange luckys stock surged to close at 
46375 a share american stores stock fell 262 a share to 
5787 
officials at luckys headquarters in dublin calif would not 
discuss the offer except to say company bylaws contain a poison 
pill antitakeover provision which limits the voting power of 
any shareholder who acquires more than 10 percent of luckys stock 
company officials noted in a statement that the limited voting 
rights provision which expires dec 22 may not be waived by the 
companys board 
lucky the nations sixth largest grocery retailer has 480 
stores while american stores the third biggest has 1600 stores 
in a letter to lucky stores chairman john m lillie american 
stores chairman ls skaggs said he would combine americans alpha 
beta stores with luckys operation under the lucky name 
the letter released tuesday praised luckys management and 
marketing strategies and invited lucky executives to stay on if the 
deal is completed luckys headquarters also would remain at 
dublin skaggs said 
officials at salt lake citybased american stores would not 
provide further details of their unsolicited offer and had no 
comment beyond a brief press release said senior vice president 
michael miller 
recent rumors have suggested that american stores itself may be 
a takeover target according to an analyst here who said his 
company has extensive dealings with the company 
under that scenario the bid for lucky could be a defensive move 
to make an acquisition of american stores prohibitively expensive 
said the analyst who spoke on condition of anonymity 
if american stores doesnt get this acquisition it puts the 
spotlight on them they may be more open to takeover than before 
he said 
analysts agreed the luckyamerican stores combination makes 
sense 
susan c schmierer a retail analyst with prudentialbache 
securities inc noted that the two companies operate in the same 
general geographic areas and that both want to increase their 
presence in california 
i dont see any reason why it couldnt go through given the 
right kind of management finesse by american she said 
the bid for lucky comes 16 months after takeover strategist 
asher edelman formally dropped his hostile bid for the company in 
return for luckys agreement to pay 28 million of his legal costs 
lucky thwarted edelman partly by selling off nongrocery 
divisions and adopting antitakeover measures that make it more 
difficult for an unwanted suitor to acquire the company 
american stores most recent acquisition occurred in 1984 when 
it took over jewel companies inc a chicagobased grocery drug 
and convenience store chain for 11 billion 
the acquisition expanded american stores operations from just 
over 1000 retail outlets to 1700 stores in 40 states and boosted 
sales to about 15 billion a year 
the company is organized into three divisions the skaggs 
division operates supermarkets in the western united states 
american superstores runs stores in the midwest and the east and 
osco drug stores operates stores nationwide according to value 
line investment survey 
store names include acme jewel star buttrey skaggs skaggs 
alpha beta and osco drug stores 
lucky with annual sales of about 7 billion operates about 480 
supermarkets and food centers in the west midwest and southwest 
principally in california and arizona

many banks seem more willing to lend money to 
poor countries abroad than to take a chance on redeveloping poor 
neighborhoods in their own area community representatives are 
telling congress 
were saying look you lend billions of dollars across 
the border and you cant lend to our community that is on this side 
of the border said tony reyes mayor of san luis ariz a town 
of 2000 near mexico 
i dont think that is fair he told the senate banking 
committee which is reviewing compliance with the community 
reinvestment act of 1977 
the law requires banks to lend in their depositors 
neighborhoods and prohibits redlining the practice of denying 
loans to an entire neighborhood based on the race or economic class 
of its residents 
it gives regulators the authority to block banks with poor 
records from opening new branches or merging with other 
institutions 
redlining hasnt disappeared sen william proxmire the 
committee chairman said tuesday neighborhoods are still 
starving for credit too many bankers still think the grass is 
greener elsewhere 
he noted that an estimated 5 billion in loans have been made in 
poor neighborhoods as a result of the act but said that 5 
billion pledged to developing neighborhoods is peanuts compared to 
the 100 billion loaned to developing countries 
despite a rating system by regulators that gives the vast 
majority of banks high marks for their antiredlining efforts the 
actual performance of most is poor said gale cincotta executive 
director of the national training and information center a chicago 
community group 
hundreds of census tracts in lowincome america did not 
receive a penny in mortgage loans she said 
proxmire dwis said that 97 percent of all lenders pass 
community reinvestment act reviews with flying colors and only 
eight of 40000 applications from banks seeking to merge or expand 
have been denied in the past 10 years 
how is it that so many neighborhoods are continuing to fail 
while so many lending institutions are continuing to pass he 
asked this record raises questions about whether the 
examination process has succeeded 
allen j fishbein general counsel of the center for community 
change a washington organization that provides training for 
neighborhood groups said progress in enforcing the law during the 
late 70s has been virtually undone as a result of agency 
indifference over the past five or six years 
ms cincotta complained that bank examiners in effect rely on 
community groups to enforce the law for them by filing complaints 
she said that although examiners are well trained at judging the 
financial soundness of a bank many are poorly schooled in judging 
a banks fair housing or equal opportunity record 
jane uebelhoer legislative representative of acorn association 
of community organizations for reform now said congress should 
revamp the regulators rating system so that banks with poor 
records get poor marks 
the committee which is reviewing enforcement of the act with an 
eye toward possibly toughening it planned a second session today 
to hear from federal bank regulators 
the house banking committee has discussed attaching provisions 
strengthening the community revinvestment act to legislation 
primarily aimed at granting banks new investment powers 
the senate committee has already passed its version of that bill 
but could go along with the house provisions if senators are 
convinced by testimony this week that changes are needed

the supreme court ruled today that shortterm 
notes used to finance public housing projects are not exempt from 
federal estate taxes 
the 80 ruling was a victory for the reagan administration 
which said more than 260 million in federal tax revenue was at 
stake 
the dispute stems in part from a 1937 law congress enacted to 
stimulate local financing of housing projects the act allowed 
public housing agencies to issue taxfree obligations called 
project notes 
for some 47 years it was assumed the law exempted the notes 
from federal income tax but not from federal estate tax 
but a federal judge in illinois ruled in 1984 that the notes 
were exempt from estate taxes as well the decision touched off 
widepsread efforts to market project notes and prompted those who 
had paid estate taxes on the notes to seek refunds from the 
government 
within months of the illinois ruling congress enacted the 
deficit reduction act of 1984 that included a provision making the 
project notes subject to estate gift and inheritance taxes 
the law took effect on june 19 1984 
heirs to people who died before that date said the law cannot be 
applied retroactively and they sought refunds from the government 
for estate taxes they paid on project notes 
but today the supreme court said the project notes have been 
subject to the estate tax all along even if the 1937 law did not 
make that explicitly clear 
justice william j brennan in his opinion for the court said 
the 1937 act was designed to exempt the project notes only from 
the normal tax that is federal income tax and surtaxes that 
were in effect at the time 
exemptions from taxation are not to be implied they must be 
unambiguously proved brennan said on the rare occasions when 
congress exempted property from estate taxation it has generally 
adverted explicitly to that tax rather than generically to all 
taxation 
he said it would not make sense for congress to grant special 
exemptions to the project notes without stating it explicitly since 
the purpose of such an exemption would be to attract investors 
if congress really wanted to create an especially broad tax 
exemption for project notes one would expect it to do so 
notoriously enough to attract investors not surreptitiously enough 
to evade detection for half a century brennan said 
he added that todays ruling made it unnecessary for the 
justices to decide whether the 1984 budget reduction law chould be 
applied retroactively 
the ruling reverses lower court decisions granting estate 
exemptions to project notes

aftertax corporate profits shot up 84 
percent in 1987 a sharp rebound from the previous year when 
profits declined the government said today 
the commerce department said that aftertax profits rose to 
1374 billion last year an increase of 106 billion from 1986 
when profits had actually fallen by 1 percent 
analysts credited the turnaround in profits in part to the 
weaker dollar which has boosted sales of american products on 
overseas markets in addition they said that labor wage demands 
remained subdued during the year 
the increase in profits for 1987 was outstanding especially 
when you consider that corporate taxes were substantially hiked 
during the year because of the tax reform act said allen sinai 
chief economist of the boston co 
particularly for us manufacturing 1987 was a turnaround 
year sinai said exports rose and american companies benefited 
tremendously from previous costcutting measures 
sinai predicted further gains in corporate profits in 1988 but 
he said the rate of increase would slow somewhat 
some of that slowdown was evident in the fourth quarter with 
aftertax profits rising 16 percent following a 55 percent gain 
in the third quarter

northwest airlines said today it will ban 
smoking on all of its domestic flights except to and from hawaii 
making it the first major us airline to mandate a smokefree 
travel environment in the air 
the restrictions will begin on april 23 the same day a federal 
law is to go into effect banning smoking on all domestic flights of 
two hours or less 
northwest noted in a statement that its program goes 
significantly beyond the requirements of the new law 
in addition to flights within the contiguous 48 states the 
program dubbed northwest clears the air will apply to flights 
to and from alaska mexico canada jamaica and the cayman islands 
flights to hawaii and ovrseas will continue to offer smoking 
sections because those flights carry a greater proportion of 
foreign passengers who feel differently about the issue the 
airline said in a statement 
ab magary the airlines executive vice president for 
marketing said a majority of passengers on international flights 
are foreign and are not yet culturally ready to move in this 
direction 
he said the ban is a response to our customers and employees 
requests a northwest study showed that nine out of 10 passengers 
prefer to sit in the nosmoking section of a plane 
magary said however that the airline is not going 
macrobiotic the ban does not imply some broaderscale effort 
to rid the united states of cigarettes he said 
northwest said it will offer refunds to passengers who purchased 
tickets before today and who have been assigned seats in the 
smoking section if they decline to fly because of the new policy 
travel agents on tuesday complimented northwest on its plans 
were hearing from our customers that its time to go more 
toward banning said jay harrington regional president of 
uniglobe a national chain of travel agency franchises we think 
its inevitable it will be banned on all aircraft 
in the short run he said northwest might lose some customers 
who smoke heavily but generally passengers choose flights on the 
basis of convenience and price 
air canada which banned smoking on some flights between canada 
and the united states said it gained customers as a result of its 
nosmoking policy 
northwest would have had to eliminate smoking on many of its 
flights anyway because about 80 percent of all us flights last 
two hours or less 
by extending the ban to all flights northwest could be avoiding 
confusion expected to result from the new law for example it was 
not clear how the law would apply to flights that are scheduled to 
take under two hours but are delayed 
more important northwest could be saving itself some costs 
airlines must install and maintain filters that are difficult and 
costly to clean and they spend additional money on air 
conditioning to recirculate fresh air 
the new law part of a spending bill signed by president reagan 
in december is a compromise version of nosmoking bills that the 
house and senate passed earlier the federal ban will last for two 
years smoking cigars and pipes already is prohibited on airlines 
under the new law passengers who insist on lighting up will 
face civil fines of as much as 1000 and passengers who tamper 
with smoke alarms in airplane lavatories will be liable for as much 
as 2000 in penalties 
northwest airlines said it would launch an advertising campaign 
to promote the program on saturday 
attending northwests press conference were representatives of 
the us surgeon generals office the american cancer society the 
american heart association and the american lung association 
james swamley managing director of the american lung 
association credited northwest with jetting ahead of the 
industry 
separately singapore airlines unveiled plans to introduce the 
first nosmoking commercial flights in southeast asia next month 
four of the 14 daily shuttle flights between singapore and kuala 
lumpur the capital of neighboring malaysia will bar smoking 
starting april 4 said a news release from the 
governmentcontrolled carrier the trip takes about 45 minutes

the house showed bipartisan support today for 
a 11 trillion fiscal 1989 budget that averts deep cuts in 
domestic programs and glosses over a failure to comply fully with 
congress deficitreduction agreement with president reagan 
debate began on the plan approved last week by the house budget 
committee with a procedural vote that was adopted without a roll 
call unheardof during the recent years of pitched budget battles 
weve got a miracle said house speaker jim wright dtexas 
expecting easy passage later in the day 
this degree of bipartisanship in developing a budget 
resolution is truly unprecedented said rep delbert l latta of 
ohio senior republican on the budget committee 
the plan would leave a deficit of about 134 billion in the 
spending year beginning oct 1 and would stay within the limits of 
the grammrudman budgetbalancing law the deficit would be about 
5 billion higher than with reagans budget mostly because the 
president proposed to sell off more government assets 
the lawmakers electionyear plan would freeze or slightly trim 
most domestic agencies it would spend 15 billion on aids 
research a little more than reagan proposed but not boost the 
space program as much as the president asked it rejects his plans 
to cancel aid to mass transit and other popular domestic subsidies 
as in the presidents plan the governments total cash outlays 
on the military foreign aid and certain domestic programs would be 
held to levels set last fall when the president and congressional 
leaders held a budget summit 
however that agreement also contained limits for budget 
authority the legal obligations by agencies for spending that 
could stretch over more than one fiscal year the house plan would 
violate the agreement if it werent for some accounting wizardry 
to avoid breaking the limit on budget authority the house 
budget committee shifted about 4 billion in the domestic budget 
mostly ongoing agriculture credit expenses outside of the 
categories controlled by the summit pact 
the accounting change made room for the kind of budget lawmakers 
support one that would not terminate urban and rural development 
programs and other items the president sought to end 
in its report to the house the budget committee said the 
technical changes were the only way it could find to hit the budget 
marks for both outlays and budget authority 
it is not our intention that this budget authority 
adjustment not result in higher outlays in fy 1989 than the 1692 
billion domestic allowed under the summit cap the 
committee said 
rep william h gray iii dpa chairman of the committee said 
he believed it stayed within the budget pact the outlay is what 
youre really going to be judged by he said 
despite the committee language the budget technique could lead 
to higher spending allowances when the fiscal blueprint is 
translated later into actual spending bills the presidents office 
of management and budget send a letter to congress critical of the 
approach and promising to monitor spending closely as the budget is 
implemented 
house action on the budget today was the earliest in years as 
democratic leaders were keeping to their vow to put fiscal affairs 
on schedule this year 
members of the senate budget committee have begun private 
meetings on their version the two chambers must agree on identical 
budgets by april 15 to meet their deadline 
the budget resolution is a guideline for congress fiscal 
legislation and it does not require the presidents signature 
with the accounting changes the house budget would hit exactly 
the limits in the budget summit pact those are 2995 billion in 
budget authority and 2940 billion in outlays for the military 
1481 billion in budget authority and 1692 billion in outlays 
for annuallyappropriated domestic programs and 181 billion in 
budget authority and 161 billion in outlays on foreign aid 
the summit agreement also included 14 billion in new taxes for 
fiscal 1989 those levies were enacted last december and congress 
plans no further increases this year 
the grammrudman law mandates a deficit of 136 billion in 
fiscal 1989 as an interim step toward a balanced budget by fiscal 
1993 neither the house plan nor reagans met that mark without 
relying on selling government assets which arent counted under 
grammrudman 
however both plans would be within 10 billion of the goal 
keeping below the threshold at which the law would mandate 
automatic acrosstheboard spending cuts 
those estimates are based on the white house assumptions for 
economic growth and government performance next year estimates by 
the nonpartisan congressional budget office which are less 
optimistic show the deficit some 35 billion higher

richard and stephanie hack have not only picked 
out where their two small children will be attending college after 
the turn of the century theyve already paid their tuition in 
full 
the bethel park pa couple bought that peace of mind for about 
10000 through a tuitionfutures program that had been offered 
for about three years at duquesne university their alma mater 
other young families may wish they had it so easy as they watch 
tuition increases outpace inflation the cost of some private 
colleges for instance now comes close to the median price of a 
singlefamily home around 80000 
financial advisers and educators agree the only way to stay out 
of the poor house yet provide a collegebound child with a good 
education is to develop a strategic plan as early as possible 
people need to save for a university just as they buy a 
house said richard f rosser president of the national 
association of independent colleges and universities 
it was for that reason that duquesne a small roman catholic 
univeristy near pittsburgh developed its tuitionfutures plan in 
1985 a program mrs hack believes will benefit her children 
melissa 5 and brian 4 about a halfdozen other schools 
established similar programs but some of them as duquesne did 
last week have stopped taking new applicants due to unexpectedly 
high tuition increases and falling interest rates on bonds the 
schools main investment vehicle 
aside from the obvious drawbacks what if a grown child doesnt 
want to go to college or to the one already paid for the program 
seemed like a good deal at duquesne for instance the family of a 
1yearold eligible to go to college in 2005 would have paid a lump 
sum of around 8600 last fall to cover projected fouryear tuition 
of 102600 the older the child though the higher the cost 
most investment advisers say a family could almost do the same 
on their own by investing bit by bit in savings bonds or 
certificates of deposits although they wouldnt have the same tax 
benefits enjoyed by the schools 
since duquesnes trendsetting program numerous programs and 
proposals have emerged 
in washington several bills are pending to set up taxfree 
savings accounts resembling individual retirement accounts to 
finance education president reagan supports a taxexempt savings 
bond program 
six states michigan indiana florida maine tennessee and 
wyoming have passed laws establishing prepayment tuitition plans 
according to the education commission of the states the internal 
revenue service just ruled the michigan education trust had to pay 
federal taxes on earnings but individual investors wouldnt have 
additional tax liabilities 
california illinois missouri new jersey new york ohio 
oregon pennsylvania south carolina texas and west virgina have 
similar legislation pending it said and illinois and north 
carolina have passed special savings bond plans it said 
on the commercial side of things theres the college savings 
bank the princeton nj institutions main line of business is 
to sell certificates of deposit with interest rates changing 
annually to keep pace with rising college costs 
keeping track of whats available to students and families in 
the way of investment plans financial aid or scholarships is often 
half the battle as collegesponsored programs come and go new laws 
evolve from state to state or congress and the internal revenue 
service get involved 
theres just so much change going on said john b cox a 
spokesman for the national association of college and university 
business officers the nonprofit group based in washington dc 
publishes alternative approaches to tuition financing 
available to the general public for 15 many other guidebooks also 
are available in book stores and colleges 
cox suggests that parents start out by selecting a few 
prospective colleges then contacting the financial aid departments 
of each to see what programs the schools have or might be 
considering 
heres a thumbnail look at some of the many programs being 
offered according to nacubo and other sources 
prepayment plans students have the option at some colleges and 
universities of paying for all four years up front thus avoiding 
future tuition increases about 50 institutions offer this program 
including a number of ivy league schools like brown university 
cornell university and yale university 
delayed prepayment or installation plans a number of colleges 
and universities allow tuition payments to be made in equal amounts 
or installments during a semester or year some institutions 
require a down payment of as much as 50 percent 
tuition gift certificates sold by a handful of colleges 
including twoyear schools these certificates may be bought for a 
designated number of credit hours or other tuition unit some are 
transferable but most cannot be cashed in 
interstate tuition plans at least two regional consortiums 
on the west coast and in new england offer some students a chance 
to go to college out of state for slightly higher than the 
residential rate the program is only limited to participating 
states and institutions one of the groups western interstate 
commission for higher education also arranges for statesubsidized 
tuition across state borders 
loan programs besides commercial banks and thrifts a number 
of colleges and universities loan money directly to families or 
students although most are intended to pick up where federally 
guaranteed student loans leave off several states such as 
massachusetts connecticut maryland and new york also provide 
student loans 
others work study programs and scholarships are available to a 
broad range of students several research services will even help 
track down obscure scholarships for a fee

a federal judge approved texaco incs 
financial reorganization plan today clearing the way for the oil 
giant to emerge from the nations biggest corporate bankruptcy case 
us bankruptcy judge howard schwartzberg issued the ruling at 
midday after a dayandahalf hearing on the proposal for resolving 
texacos debts to its creditors 
the confirmation of the plan should allow texaco to emerge from 
bankruptcy court protection by midapril which would be a year 
after it filed to reorganize under chapter 11 of the federal 
bankruptcy code 
texaco had cleared one hurdle just before the hearing began 
tuesday when it announced that dissident shareholders had dropped 
their opposition to the plan 
it also was announced tuesday that 96 percent of the shares 
voted by texaco stockholders had supported the reorganization 
proposal 174 million shares out of the 181 million voted the 
margin was far in excess of the twothirds majority required by 
federal law 
schwartzberg had been widely expected to approve the plan 
despite lingering objections to certain provisions of the plan by 
some shareholders notably takeover strategist carl c icahn 
texacos biggest shareholder 
texaco was the biggest company ever to seek refuge in the 
bankruptcy courts 
texaco filed under chapter 11 contending it could not afford to 
post an 11 billion bond while appealing a 103 billion judgment 
held against it by houstonbased pennzoil co 
the judgment stemmed from a november 1985 ruling by a houston 
jury that texaco had interfered improperly with an agreement by 
pennzoil to acquire part of getty oil co before texaco bought 
getty itself 
texaco agreed in december to pay pennzoil 3 billion to settle 
that dispute the agreement formed the keystone of the bankruptcy 
reorganization plan that schwartzberg must confirm or reject after 
the present series of hearings 
some of the dissident shareholders had objected to provisions in 
the agreement that would free officers and advisers of texaco 
pennzoil co the former getty oil co the sarah getty trust and 
the j paul getty museum from all liability arising out of the 
court fight resulting from the texacopennzoil battle 
shortly before the hearing began harvey miller the bankruptcy 
lawyer representing texaco announced that attorneys for those 
shareholders had dropped their opposition to the reorganization 
plan 
in a document filed tuesday the dissidents said they ended 
their fight partly because of overwhelming evidence that a 
settlement with pennzoil is not possible without the releases 
pennzoil attorney kenneth klee said pennzoil had insisted the 
liability provisions be included in the settlement agreement 
pennzoil chairman j hugh liedtke testified his company wanted the 
releases mainly to help end the litigation settle its claim 
against texaco and win more cooperation from texacos management 
the dissident shareholders also noted texaco had agreed not to 
object if their attorneys applied for a maximum of 10 million in 
fees plus 150000 in expenses miller told schwartzberg the 
company would assume half of those expenses and that its insurance 
would pay the bill 
while some shareholders opposed to the liability releases 
others were unhappy with antitakeover provisions of texacos 
charter and bylaws that they argued entrenched management and 
lessened its accountability for its actions 
the leader of the latter group was icahn whose ownership of 
148 percent of texacos common stock has helped fuel takeover 
speculation in recent months but despite his opposition to those 
provisions icahn had indicated he would vote for the 
reorganization plan 
during the hearing texaco officials drew some pointed questions 
after disclosing they had just closed on an agreement to borrow 3 
billion from a syndicate of banks to help refinance their pending 
reorganization 
in repeated questioning of texaco treasurer david crickelair 
icahns attorney david friedman and dennis odea an attorney 
representing texacos shareholders committee implied texaco helped 
entrench its management by accepting a change in control 
proviso in the loan agreement 
under the provision twothirds of the banks could vote to call 
the threeyear loan if 30 percent of texacos stock wound up in one 
groups hands or if there was a change of more than half of the 
members of the board 
but crickelair said the provision had been demanded by the banks 
and was nonnegotiable

that cow munching in a normandy meadow may not be 
all that she seems her father might be bubba from rising sun md 
and her grandfather the famed american bull pawnee farm arlinda 
chief 
such international hybrids are the result of artificial 
insemination and embryo transfer two genetic breeding techniques 
now gaining favor on european farms 
glossy pinups of champion bulls were a feature of the recently 
ended annual agriculture show in paris catching the eye of french 
farmers eager to improve the quality of their herds 
paris special offer lowcost embryos read the sign on 
another stand 
the breeding methods offer common market farmers a way to 
improve the quality of their production without adding to europes 
burgeoning surplus of milk 
farmers who have slaughtered cows for meat to stay within milk 
quotas imposed by the european economic community are hoping to 
maintain production levels in the future with fewer animals 
one highquality cow is cheaper to feed than two which produce 
the same quantity of milk said a french technical adviser to 
world wide sires inc of hanford calif 
artificial insemination involves taking semen from a bull and 
injecting it into a cow the technique differs from embryo transfer 
in that no eggs are removed from a cow and fertilization takes 
place in the womb with embryo transfer an egg is fertilized in a 
test tube and later implanted in the womb 
exhibitors interviewed at the agriculture show said the united 
states and canada have the best genetic stock in dairy cattle and 
there is an active transatlantic market in frozen sperm and 
embryos 
world wide sires has 10 million holsteins at nine cooperatives 
in the us said ginny barker one of the companys regional 
marketing directors its a huge genetic pool 
the black and white holstein cow which was shipped from germany 
to the united states between 1850 and 1900 is the most popular 
milking cow worldwide 
in france alone it makes up 90 percent of the dairy herd 
said gerard andre director of a french cattle exporting company 
and nearly all french dairy cows have american holstein 
blood he said 
it might seem ironic that european herds are being upgraded with 
north american imports of a european breed 
the world wide sires representative explained that american 
breeders had aimed for specialized highyielding dairy cows 
but european farmers had stuck with dualpurpose beef and milk 
producers such as the normandy cow he said 
not everyone agrees that artificial insemination is the best 
technique for getting the right kind of animals the british 
company heine brothers is promoting embryos 
our market is in commercial embryos for the everyday farmer 
said richard price heines livestock manager 
at the moment farmers are using artificial insemination we 
say our embryos will take over he said 
when beef cattle are killed in the slaughterhouse the ovaries 
are taken from the carcasses and the eggs removed they are 
fertilized in vitro then implanted in sheeps womb to mature for 
six days before being taken out and frozen 
these embryos from beef strains such as the limousin are 
implanted in the wombs of holstein cows in a simple operation 
mike keeble marketing manager of heine said a farmer has the 
best of both worlds with this technique because in the same herd 
he will have some good beef animals and his superefficient 
holsteins for milking 
by introducing these embryos we can change a whole herd he 
said 
heine is looking outside europe for new markets and hopes its 
embryos will be used to build up cattle herds in countries such as 
ethiopia and saudi arabia 
many people in african and arab countries are unable to drink 
milk after they are 5 years old said keeble but their 
stomachs can take yogurt and they want to eat more meat 
so we can build up dualpurpose herds which provide milk for 
yogurt and beef reducing the need for goat or camel meat he 
said

after examining the literature of business 
including the expressions of folks who claim to be authorities on 
the subject an academic asks does business really know what it is 
talking about 
the horrifying thought occurred to professor eugene jennings as 
repeatedly he heard speakers define certain key words in one way 
and their listeners another 
in practice he observes dozens of important business words 
have multiple definitions or definitions so fuzzy they can mean 
anything to anyone 
tell me he asks what is meant by excellence 
the word as most people know has become worn with usage in 
businesss and now threatens to disappear from the lexicon without 
ever being understood but if ever there was a word of multiple 
meanings he suggests it is this one 
from his vantage point as a writer of books teacher at 
michigan state university and adviser of top business executives 
jennings has viewed an odd phenomenon people dont like to ask the 
meaning of these new words 
to do so many otherwise confident business folks believe is to 
reveal their incompetence or incredible stupidity as a 
consequence much of the business lexicon today is incoherent 
babble 
jennings observed this firsthand when he examined the use of 
key words by institutional and private purveyors of professional 
management courses and found them to mean whatever the instructors 
wanted them to mean 
the very meaning of manager is among the most vague 
jennings found it is seldom defined but invariably confused with 
administrator supervisor executive and leader as well as with 
role position title and function 
important words vital to communication are thrown about 
without any precise understanding of their meanings by socalled 
experts jennings exclaims 
strategy is confused with purpose mission process and 
function planning is confused with purpose role technique and 
process 
even business itself is interchanged with definitions that 
indicate a confusion with art science profession social system 
institution almost anything but economic activity 
cash flow is interchanged with net profit money in till and 
circulation of money and he remarks attempts to define this and 
other words sometimes add little to understanding but much to 
confusion 
what is it the movement of cash into through and out of an 
entity says one lexicon anther the amount of net cash 
generated by an investment or a business during a specific period 
of time 
many of what jennings calls highprofile words and phrases 
began to be bandied about in the early 1960s and though 
illdefined have remained to protect fuzzy speakers and impress or 
terrorize insecure audiences 
selfesteem winwin decisionmaking and more recently 
backtobasics and justintime the latter a procedure for 
inventory control 
oddly says jennings some words remain in use because of their 
mystery their power lies in remaining obtuse he says 
entrepreneur motivation communication mbo management by 
objective spc statistical process control style intelligence 
care to define them do it he says and then compare definitions

the confusion impels jennings to describe not define 
business as an activity conducted without a lexicon of basic 
language directed by individuals for whom a dictionary is an 
abstract work of art 
ask top executives as he has if they regularly use a 
dictionary and you are likely to search long for a positive answer 
yet he states nowhere could a good dictionary be used to better 
advantage than in the executive suite 
jennings confrontation with the babel of tongues became 
especially frustrating when he found that writers of management 
books and producers of management training programs were only 
adding to the confusion 
much of business jargon today is mere vocal sound he 
concluded it is the use of words with intensified resonance or 
nasal dramatics pleasing or invigorating to the senses 
he laments that good old fashioned meanings classical to our 
business traditions are being warped around words of convenience

1394 billion pounds from 1393 billion pounds in all of 1986 
net income totaled 751 million pounds down 135 percent from

in the stock market crash of 1987 few 
institutions suffered more damage both real and perceived than 
the national association of securities dealers overthecounter 
market 
through the long winter that followed the nasd and its 
president joseph hardiman have labored to repair the markets 
image and recover the momentum it had been building since the early 
1970s 
by all accounts that effort has produced some notable successes 
to date 
i feel that the nasd has done a real good job said binkley 
shorts portfolio manager of the overthecounter securities fund 
a mutual fund that concentrates in the market for unlisted stocks 
that are traded through a network of dealers overseen by the nasd 
it feels pretty comfortable right now investing in otc 
stocks shorts added 
but few observers argue that the mission of restoring investors 
confidence in the overthecounter market or in stocks in general 
is anywhere near complete 
weve taken some first steps some important steps hardiman 
said in an interview at his office here theres more to be 
done 
the crash hit at a time when the nasd after a decade of 
dramatic expansion and innovation was bidding to challenge the new 
york stock exchange for preeminence in the us stock market 
it claimed that its multipledealer system was superior to that 
of the big board and other exchanges where a single broker known 
as a specialist operating on the trade floor acts as a meeting 
point for buy and sell orders in a given stock 
but in the worst days of the crunch some beleaguered 
overthecounter dealers backed away from the nasds automated 
smallorder execution system known as soes 
investors and brokers ran into busy signal after busy signal as 
they tried to reach dealers who were either unable or unwilling to 
handle the volume of telephone calls and orders 
the market was put to a severe test and it suffered a 
hangover that lasted for at least a couple of weeks recalled 
shorts 
within a month the nasd came up with plans to strengthen soes 
and increase the responsibilities of dealers those measures have 
been approved and are scheduled to be put into effect by late may 
or early june hardiman said 
for one thing participation in soes formerly optional for 
dealers will now be mandatory for another any dealer who pulls 
out of the market for a stock without a special exemption will be 
barred from returning for 30 days 
if we have a recurrence of the kind of thing that happened 
last fall marketmakers must stay in observed ralph costanza 
head of the overthecounter trading department at the brokerage 
firm of smith barney harris upham amp co 
meanwhile as stocks in general have staged a rally since last 
december overthecounter issues have enjoyed a particularly 
vigorous rebound 
from jan 1 through midmarch the nasdaq the aq stands for 
automated quotations composite index of otc stocks rose 1547 
percent outpacing a 1043 percent rise in the nyses composite 
index of all its listed common stocks 
in the midst of the crash said shorts there was an 
opportunity for us to buy at ridiculously low prices 
looking back hardiman says we took a lot of criticism early 
because the problem was access to our markets but all markets had 
their problems 
looking ahead he says further efforts will be made to 
strengthen the system a committee chaired by irving pollack a 
former member of the securities and exchange commission is due to 
report in may on a study of the structure and quality of the otc 
market and hardiman expects it to make some significant 
recommendations 
the changes that are already being made he says have prepared 
the nasdaq system to function better if and when another financial 
storm strikes i think we can handle an event like that i dont 
say without difficulty but with far fewer problems 
he acknowledges that the crash was a setback to the nasds 
ambitions for its market but adds that it may well prove to have 
beneficial side effects 
we have experienced sensational growth particularly over the 
last 10 years he said october not by choice gave us an 
opportunity to pause and reflect 
were going through a period of digestion some pundits may 
say indigestion he added its great to grow but we also want 
to have a quality marketplace 
after the current process of reevaluation and remodeling 
hardiman said i believe were going to be poised for another 
significant period of growth

the government delivered two welcome pieces of 
economic news on wednesday consumer prices rose just 02 percent 
in february and the economy in late 1987 expanded at the liveliest 
pace in nearly two years 
falling energy and food prices in february helped restrain the 
rise in the labor departments consumer price index after a 03 
percent increase in january 
for the first two months of the year prices increased at an 
annual rate of 32 percent much better than last years moderate 
44 percent inflation 
in a separate report the commerce department said the us 
economy grew at a brisk 48 percent annual pace in the final three 
months of last year it was the second upward revision in the 
fourthquarter gnp estimated a month ago at 45 percent and in 
january at 42 percent 
the department said betterthanexpected performance in exports 
consumer spending and business investment led to the latest 
revision which pushed growth for the year to a rate of 4 percent 
compared with 22 percent growth in 1986 it was the biggest annual 
increase since a 51 percent rise in 1984 
the 48 percent fourthquarter growth followed a 43 percent 
growth in the julyseptember quarter and was the fastest quarterly 
growth rate since an increase of 54 percent in the first three 
months of 1986 
recent economic reports have shown an economy that rebounded 
quickly from last octobers stock market collapse analysts see 
little likelihood of an electionyear recession 
one of the best kept secrets in economic circles these days is 
that the reagan administration is going to end with a bang not a 
whimper as the economy makes a successful transition to an 
exportled economy president reagan said in a speech to the 
american business conference 
meanwhile his spokesman marlin fitzwater hailed wednesdays 
reports inflation remains under control the economy is doing 
well the reagan miracle holds 
food prices fell 03 percent in february erasing a 03 percent 
gain in january fruits and vegetables led the way with a 4 percent 
tumble lettuce prices which more than doubled at the end of 1987 
dropped 251 percent in february 
energy prices fell 06 percent with falling gasoline prices 
more than offsetting increases in household fuels 
atthepump gasoline prices fell 17 percent in february the 
third consecutive decline gasoline prices have fallen 59 percent 
in six months 
heating oil and other household fuels were up 06 percent 
natural gas and electricity prices rose 05 percent 
there is at this point no indication of any major widespread 
acceleration of inflation said lawrence chimerine chairman of 
the wefa group a philadelphiaarea economic forecasting service 
competition in retailing contributed to the favorable inflation 
performance chimerine said stores have been holding down price 
increases 
items other than food and energy were up a modest 02 percent in 
february 
still there remained pockets of inflation particularly in 
service industries medical care services were up 07 percent in 
february while other services rose 06 percent 
there are some chronic price problems in the economy said 
sandra shaber senior economist for the futures group a washington 
management consultanting firm these increases in health care are 
not going to go away 
but if we continue to get a break on food and energy prices 
that certainly is good news she added 
however allen sinai chief economist for the boston co said 
the big issue is whether these good results we are getting so far 
this year are transitory or permanent food and energy price 
declines are reversible almost any time 
in other february price movements 
new automobile prices rose 03 percent 
clothing prices fell 03 percent 
alcoholic beverage prices rose 09 percent 
last months seasonally adjusted 02 percent gain in the cpi was 
equivalent to a compounded annual inflation rate of 21 percent 
labor department analysts said 
the february increase left the overall index at 1160 meaning 
that a hypothetical selection of goods costing 100 during a 
198284 base period would have cost 11600 last month 
unlike other figures in the report the overall index is not 
adjusted for seasonal fluctuations 
the labor department recently changed its base period had the 
former computation been used the february consumer price index 
would have been 3474 compared with a 1967 base of 100 
that means the same selection of goods would have cost 1300 
more last month than in february 1987 when the cpi was 3344 
in two other economic reports 
the commerce department said aftertax corporate profits shot 
up 84 percent in 1987 to 1374 billion after declining the year 
before analysts credited the turnaround in profits to the weaker 
dollar which has boosted us sales overseas and to subdued labor 
wage demands 
the labor department said americans average weekly earnings 
after discounting for inflation edged up 02 percent in february 
it was the second monthly advance matching an identical 02 
percent january increase but it still left americans 
inflationadjusted earnings 07 percent below where they were a 
year ago

target of a takeover by a japanese bank 
bankamerica stock closed up 625 cents at 11125 a share in 
heavy new york stock exchange trading 
dan dorfman appearing on cnns moneyline program tuesday 
night said he had heard a rumor that a japanese bank may be 
interested in acquiring part of all of bankamerica 
bankamerica said in a statement from its headquarters in san 
francisco that there was no basis for the rumors 
dorfman said wednesday from his office at usa today where he 
works as a columnist that he emphasized the word rumor and 
mentioned the rumor to explain the heavy dealing in bankamerica 
stock on tuesday 
analysts quickly disputed the claim 
its unlikely said mark alpert an analyst with bear 
stearns amp co there have been plenty of opportunities in the past 
for japanese banks to take a position in bankamerica and nothing 
has occurred 
it doesnt mean it cant happen but its unlikely he said 
likewise rodrigo quintanilla of argus research corp said that 
while only west german and japanese institutions are in a financial 
position to take on the huge banking company i still dont 
consider it to be a takeover target

texaco inc on wednesday won final 
bankruptcy court approval for a plan that would settle its 
multibilliondollar dispute with pennzoil co and bring it out of 
chapter 11 protection early next month 
after a day and a half of closing arguments us bankruptcy 
court judge howard schwartzberg confirmed the reorganization plan 
which features an agreement by texaco to pay pennzoil co 3 
billion to drop a 103 billion judgement held by pennzoil against 
the nations thirdlargest oil company 
when the plan goes into effect on april 7 texaco will deliver 
the money to pennzoil and will be officially free from the legal 
constraints that have limited its operations since the company 
filed for protection from its creditors last april 12 
it was the largest corporate bankruptcy in us history 
texaco said it was driven to take that action to avoid having to 
pay a potentially ruinous 11 billion security bond while appealing 
the judgment held by pennzoil 
a houston jury awarded the judgment to houstonbased pennzoil in 
november 1985 after finding that texaco had improperly interfered 
with a pennzoil acquisition of part of getty oil company so texaco 
could buy getty itself 
schwartzbergs approval marked the last step required for texaco 
to emerge from bankruptcy protection under federal law 
texaco officials and pennzoil chairman j hugh liedtke expressed 
profound relief that the fouryear ordeal of litigation that had 
paralyzed both companies was finally over 
i must say it has not been a particularly pleasant experience 
but it had to be done said j hugh liedtke pennzoils 
chairman 
liedtke said he never doubted that the jurys verdict would be 
vindicated despite lingering criticism from some quarters 
quite frankly all the smoke aside people dont pay 3 
billion for something who dont have some liability he said 
told of that remark texaco chairman alfred c decrane who at 
tuesdays hearing had stoutly defended texacos view that it had 
done nothing wrong said what we did here today is to settle 
this matter 
noting that texacos only other choice was a highly risky 
allornothing attempt to win a us supreme court reversal he 
said the company settled to end that litigation 
in announcing his decision to confirm the plan schwartzberg 
noted that 96 percent of texacos shares were voted in favor of the 
package which was laboriously worked out among pennzoil texaco 
and committees representing texacos creditors and shareholders 
he also noted that the plan provides for full payment to 
texacos creditors with interest and had been supported by 
representatives of all the principal parties during the final 
confirmation hearings 
the only lingering bone of contention was the presence of 
provisions in the plan granting immunity to all parties involved in 
the original texacogettypennzoil matter 
on tuesday dissident shareholders reluctantly dropped 16 suits 
against texaco saying they would support the plan knowing that 
the company would be in far worse condition if it were not approved 
the dissidents contended along with texacos largest 
shareholder takeover artist carl c icahn that the releases gave 
away a chance for texaco to recoup some of its losses by suing the 
parties responsible for texacos ultimate defeat in houston 
icahn who owns 148 percent of texacos stock also protested 
that the measures served to entrench management and diminish its 
accountability to shareholders 
while he voted in favor of the plan he urged the court to 
strike the releases from the plan 
schwartzberg refused to do so agreeing with arguments by both 
pennzoil and texaco that the releases were on balance in the 
best interest of texaco 
noting that pennzoil not texaco had inserted the provisions 
schwartzberg said it appeared inevitable that endless litigation 
would continue without the releases which all parties wanted to 
avoid 
he also suggested it was questionable that texaco officials 
could be found guilty of fiduciary irresponsibility for their roles 
in the getty affair 
liedtke said the judges action would trigger plans already set 
up to borrow a very substantial part of the 3 billion from a 
consortium of banks which it will begin investing in shortterm 
notes 
when it receives the payment from texaco it will then repay the 
banks liedtke said 
asked if pennzoil would be interested in buying any texaco 
assets liedtke said it could not be done without their 
permission because of a mutual agreement forestalling such 
action for five years 
he said the company would be studying longerrange plans for the 
money adding that decisions could not be expected for at least 
several weeks 
with the case virtually closed liedtke said he planned to sit 
and think a little bit and that he hoped to retire from his 
chief executive post when the company holds its annual meeting next 
month

the european economic community threatened trade 
retaliation against the united states on tuesday unless it brings a 
tax on petroleum imports into line with an international agreement 
christophe bail an eec delegate told a council meeting of the 
general agreement on tariffs and trade that the 12nation economic 
bloc may seek trade restrictions that would offset the us tax he 
did not identify which us products might be targeted 
us delegate michael samuels dismissed the threat as premature 
said one source who added that the eec has provided no evidence 
the current tax has harmed its trade 
the reagan administration in its 1989 budget proposal to 
congress has sought a remedy with a uniform crude oil tax of 965 
cents per barrel samuels told delegates 
the 96nation gatt told the united states to change the tax last 
june on grounds that it violated international trade rules by 
discriminating against imports the ruling followed complaints by 
mexico canada and the eec 
under the 1986 levy us domestic crude oil is taxed at 82 
cents a barrel while imports are taxed at 117 cents the proceeds 
finance the superfund hazardous waste cleanup program 
gatt rules provide for retaliation if a member fails to act on a 
ruling

canadian subsidiaries of ford motor co and and general motors 
corp which had accused hyundai of dumping its hatchbacks and 
small sedans at belowcost prices to gain a foothold in the north 
american market 
revenue canada a department of the federal government 
initially agreed with ford and gm and imposed preliminary duties of 
26 percent on hyundai imports 
but the key to the case was not whether hyundai was selling cars 
in canada at prices below those on the south korean domestic 
market ford and gm also had to prove they suffered material 
injury and failed to do so according to the threemember 
canadian import tribunal 
the government panel found no evidence of damage and ordered the 
preliminary duties imposed last november refunded it was the first 
case involving autos ever handled by the trade tribunal officials 
said 
all proceedings against hyundai motor co with regard to 
dumping will be terminated tribunal secretary art trudeau said 
in ottawa where the decision was announced 
hyundai spokesman greg young said the refund amounted to 
millions and millions of dollars posted in bonds 
the feeling here today is like a cloud has been removed from 
over our head said young 
george peapples president and general manager of general motors 
of canada expressed disbelief at the finding 
it has been and it remains our contention that continued 
unrestrained dumping by hyundai will result in lost jobs and 
investment in the canadian automotive industry peapples said in 
a statement 
given the deputy minister of revenues findings of dumping 
margins in excess of 26 percent its difficult to comprehend that 
the tribunal did not find any injury whatsoever 
gm spokesman nick hall said he could not comment on whether a 
judicial appeal will be made until the tribunal explains the 
reasons for its verdict next month theres been a lot of time 
and effort spent on it already hall said 
ford of canada spokesman jim hartford said the ruling points to 
flaws in canadian trade law and dangers lurking in the 
comprehensive canadaus free trade agreement scheduled for 
ratification this year 
he said ford was unable to prove substantial injury from hyundai 
imports because canadian law looked solely at ford production and 
sales in canada where smallcar production has been phased out 
instead of examining fords integrated north american operations 
the tribunal was severely handicapped by the narrow scope of 
trade law coverage in canada hartford said were alarmed by 
the implications todays decision has for other industries which 
may become rationalized under the freetrade agreement 
the canadian auto industry responsible for 140000 direct jobs 
is integrally linked with us operations under a dutyfree 1965 
auto pact between the two countries treating the continent as a 
single market 
the canadian government made a crucial intervention on hyundais 
behalf in the antidumping hearing that ended march 10 the bureau 
of competition policy said hyundai had fostered competition in the 
smallcar market and kept car prices down 
hyundai came to canada in 1984 and within a year had a 21 
percent share of the subcompact market with sales of 79072 ponies 
and stellars the cheapest of its hatchbacks sold for 6000 
canadian or 4500 in american dollars 
hyundai then entered the us market where it grabbed a 26 
percent share last year with sales of 264000 excels 
when ford and gm accused hyundai of dumping and the government 
initially concurred hyundais sales plummeted and some dealers 
resigned the company expects to sell about 45000 cars in canada 
this year third behind honda and toyota in the smallcar market 
auto industry analysts said victory for ford and gm would have 
opened a pandoras box in which us carmakers might have launched 
similar attacks on japanese importers as well as hyundai 
operations south of the border 
i can only assume other importers will evaluate the case today 
very closely and apply it to their operations said young

the supreme court in a decision three 
justices called antiunion said wednesday the government may limit 
a familys eligibility for food stamps when a family member is on 
strike 
the court said a 1981 federal law imposing such limits does not 
violate any constitutional rights the 53 decision reversed a 
federal judges 1986 ruling that had struck down the law 
justice byron r white wrote for the court that the law 
represents a rational effort by congress to remain neutral in labor 
disputes but the courts three dissenters led by justice thurgood 
marshall said the law amounts to a penalty on strikers not 
neutrality 
the 1981 law amending the food stamp act generally bars a 
family from becoming eligible for food stamps at a time when one of 
its members is on strike families already receiving food stamps 
when a member goes on strike are not dropped from the program but 
are barred from receiving additional food stamps despite the loss 
of income 
the law was challenged by the united auto workers the united 
mine workers and some of their members they said the law violated 
strikers freedom of association and speech and denied equal 
protection to strikers families 
but white said exercising the right to strike inevitably 
risks economic hardship but we are not inclined to hold that the 
right to association requires the government to minimize that 
result by qualifying the strikers for food stamps 
he added union strike funds should be responsible for 
providing support and benefits to strikers during labormanagement 
disputes it was no part of the purposes of the food stamp act to 
establish a program that would serve as a weapon in labor 
disputes 
but marshall contended that the 1981 law amounted to such a 
weapon for managment 
no other purpose can adequately explain the especially harsh 
treatment reserved for strikers and their families by the 1981 
enactment marshall said 
uaw president owen bieber called the decision a blow to 
working families throughout america 
in a democracy which affords its citizens the legal right to 
form trade unions and engage in peaceful strikes it is 
hypocritical and inconsistent to punish the family members of those 
who choose to exercise that right bieber said 
he said his union would urge congress to do away with the 1981 
amendment 
the food stamp act generally excludes benefits for people and 
the households of people unwilling to work but marshall noted 
that people who can prove they quit their jobs for good cause 
may collect food stamps if otherwise eligible while strikers may 
not 
white was joined in upholding the law by chief justice william 
h rehnquist and justices john paul stevens sandra day oconnor 
and antonin scalia 
justices william j brennan and harry a blackmun joined 
marshalls dissenting opinion 
justice anthony m kennedy did not participate in the decision 
the nations food stamp program paid for by the federal 
government and administered by the states has supplemented the 
foodbuying power of millions of lowincome families since 1964 
participating households receive food stamp coupons that can be 
used for food purchases at retail stores eligibility for food 
stamps is based on income and several other factors 
households encompassing 21 million people received food stamps 
in 1984 and the federal government spent 10 billion on the food 
stamp program that year 
in another decision wednesday the court ruled in an illinois 
case that shortterm notes used to finance public housing projects 
are not exempt from federal estate taxes the 80 ruling is a 
victory for the reagan administration which said more than 260 
million in federal tax revenue was at stake

petroleum futures prices soared wednesday and brought precious 
metals along for the ride after opec finally committed to a date 
for next months muchanticipated meeting of its price committee 
the runup in oil prices also helped trim losses in stockindex 
futures which moved steadily lower early wednesday because of the 
release of a barrage of antiinflationary news from the federal 
government 
on other markets livestock and pork futures were mixed wheat 
futures were mostly higher and soybean and corn futures were lower 
the advances in oil came on a third day of frenzied activity at 
the new york mercantile exchange crude lost 9 cents in the spot 
month monday and 40 cents tuesday as traders awaited word from opec 
president rilwanu lukman on when the pricing committee would meet 
oil opened under pressure again wednesday but rose when lukman 
finally announced the regularly scheduled meeting would take place 
in april it surged 58 cents during one early afternoon stretch to 
the days high of 1696 a barrel after saudi arabia endorsed the 
opec gathering 
when anyone else says that the market takes it with a grain 
of salt said bob murphy analyst with ef hutton amp co new 
york but when the saudis do it especially since theyve been 
making noises recently about discounting their own product the 
impact was almost immediate 
you could almost feel the psychology changing he added 
west texas intermediate crude settled 38 cents to 49 cents 
higher with the may contract for delivery at 1686 a barrel 
heating oil was 132 cents to 154 cents higher with april at 
4773 cents a gallon and unleaded gasoline was 93 cent to 130 
cents higher with april at 4725 cents a gallon 
the precious metals opened higher wednesday but floundered 
after the government released a pair of new economic reports a 
modest 02 percent rise in consumer prices last month a revised 
48 percent economic growth rate in the last quarter of last year 
once inflation concerns stabilized everything stagnated 
said bette raptopolous analyst with purdential bache securities 
inc in new york but lukmans announcement touched off a rally 
the perception is higher oil prices means inflation and that 
confirmed other indicators people have been seeing 
gold settled 240 to 330 higher on the new york commodity 
exchange with march at 45110 a troy ounce silver climbed 145 
cents to 156 cents with march at 661 a troy ounce platinum 
advanced for the third straight day settling 310 to 340 
higher with march at 51350 a troy ounce 
stockindex futures settled 25 point lower on the chicago 
mercantile exchange where the contract for june delivery of the 
standard amp poors 500 index settled at 27040 the underlying spot 
index climbed 07 point closing at 26891 
we broke down to tuesdays lows early in the day but the fact 
that we didnt break them might have been one signal of strength 
said john mitchell a broker with elders futures inc chicago 
then the oil news touched off a rally in interestrate 
futures and we moved up alongside he added 
wheat futures prices climbed on the chicago board of trade on 
news the soviet union would take delivery of 500000 metric tons of 
wheat under the governments export bonus program as well as an 
offer extended to poland under the same program 
but the bullish news was tempered when campd commodities the 
major player in the grains pits the two previous days sold off its 
wheat supplies 
there is a feeling their big buys in recent days to cover 
short positions is over said one analyst 
campds selloff in the bean pit added pressure to a market that 
was already losing steam on expectations of decreased exports with 
rival producer brazil in midharvest traders feared some of the 
us bean business will be taken away 
wheat settled wheat cent lower to 1 cent higher with the 
contract for may delivery at 307 a bushel corn was unchanged to 
cent to 1 cents lower with may at 206 a bushel oats were 
cent to 2 cents lower with may at 167 a bushel and soybeans 
were 3 cents to 5 cents lower with may at 639 a bushel 
the underlying cash prices were the driving forces in livestock 
and pork futures trading at the chicago mercantile exchange 
live cattle opened 32 cent lower to 10 cent higher with april 
at 7435 cents a pound feeder cattle were 18 cent to 10 cent 
higher with march at 8245 cents a pound live hogs were 67 cent

stocks gained wednesday in the busiest trading 
of the week but brokers said much of the action stemmed from 
speculation about corporate mergers and that the broader market 
remained lethargic

every stock on the board had a story attached to it

nevertheless traders said disinterest in stocks pervaded the 
market a pattern that has persisted in the aftermath of the 
october crash the apathy has been compounded recently by confusion 
over the direction of the economy 
as in previous sessions investors focused on the bond market 
for clues about inflation and the direction of interest rates the 
key to where they should put their money 
despite a government report showing that inflation remains 
relatively tame bonds fell wednesday and interest rates rose 
partly because of rebounding oil prices and other evidence of 
economic strength the net effect was to keep many investors out of

nikko securities co international in new york you need money to 
take stocks up and the moneys not there 
whatever money there was went largely into stocks targeted in 
rumored and factual acquisitions

speculation the company might receive an unsolicited offer other 
speculative stocks included gillette up 3 to 42 and lucky 
stores up 2 to 48 
resorts international fell 3 to 28 after the company rejected a 
sweetened takeover offer from entertainer merv griffin who has 
been battling for control of the casino company with developer 
donald trump 
computer stocks fell partly reflecting a belief that the 
industry as a whole will not do as well as earlier predicted lotus 
development fell 3 to 25 in heavy volume after the company 
announced delays in the introduction of new software and analysts 
downgraded their earnings projections

northwest airlines new smoking ban hits the 
airtravel market at a time when antipuffing campaigns are gaining 
momentum but it may revive a debate that snuffed out a pioneer of 
smokefree flying 
muse air corp of dallas tried and failed to establish itself as 
the nations only nosmoking airline in 1985 
the effort which offered passengers discounted tickets if they 
turned in their cigarettes at the gate was scrapped when the 
airline was purchased later that year by southwest airlines co for 
65 million 
while the regional carrier had begun to draw its identity from 
its nosmoking policy its research showed the practice was chasing 
away as many as 35 percent of potential passengers 
surveys revealed that fliers find price convenience and 
service more important than nonsmoking in choosing an airline 
muse spokeswoman shari cohen said at the time 
she said muse may have been a bit ahead of its time by banning 
smoking and that the pioneer role may have hurt 
even now in the wake of the federal governments move to ban 
smoking on all air flights lasting less than two hours some 
militant smokers are holding fast 
the great american smokers club of dallas is scheduled to make 
its grand entrance on april 22 a day before the governments ban 
goes into effect the group founded by two businessmen aims to 
evade the ban by charging a membership fee 
for 25 a year or 40 for a family smokers can join the club 
and pay the same fares southwest charges to fly from dallas love 
field to austin houston new orleans oklahoma city san antonio 
and tulsa 
the club is leasing several planes from las vegasbased royal 
west airlines said club president glenn herndon who estimated the 
startup cost at 2 million 
we want to offer cigarette smokers a choice to continue their 
right to smoke he said to fly on a plane nowadays smokers 
are treated like secondclass citizens and must sit on the back 
rows when the smoking ban begins we want to offer smokers an 
alternative and hopefully make some money 
herndon said the clubs target is to serve 63 cities from five 
hubs with 60 planes within two years 
by the way nonsmokers will be allowed on board but they will 
have to be tolerant the club says

american men place a premium on marriage and 
families and say the fathers role in raising children is as 
important as that played by the mother a survey said wednesday 
while modern courtship and romance may seem confusing to many 
american men family remains their anchor in life the survey 
commissioned by gentlemens quarterly magazine said 
the survey said 73 percent of those responding to a 
questionnaire indicated they felt strongly that their family is the 
most important facet of their lives 
it said 54 percent felt strongly that a mans most satisfying 
accomplishment is to be a father while 84 percent felt strongly 
that a fathers role is as important as the mothers in raising 
children 
the survey said that 60 percent rated their marriage as more 
important than their job friends or other family ties and that 
only 10 percent agreed strongly with the assertion that marriage 
makes you lose your personal identity 
this is hardly a confirmation that the 80s man is afraid of 
commitment as is so often thought the survey said 
the survey was conducted by the independent research firm 
significance inc of ridgewood nj which said it received 1062 
responses to questionnaires that were mailed in midnovember to 
about 2600 men aged 18 years and older the men were asked to rank 
their reactions to various assertions on a scale of 0 to 10 
the firm said that the replies generally indicated that 
marketers should pay more attention to attitudes rather than age 
income or occupation in fashioning marketing strategies 
the researchers said 52 percent of those surveyed can be 
categorized as changeadapters those who generally share a 
positive selfimage and thrive in an atmosphere of change 
the remaining 48 percent the firm said can be called 
changeopposers those who in varying degrees are experiencing 
some degree of alienation from society and are having trouble 
coping 
marketers trying to reach these groups may do well to 
understand their frame of mind and view it that way rather than 
their time of life said jack kliger publisher of gq 
among some other findings of the survey 
while only 25 percent of those surveyed said they strongly 
support the womens movement 79 percent expressed strong support 
for the statement its only fair that women should get equal pay 
for comparable work 
fifteen percent said they strongly agreed with the statement 
its just unrealistic to expect a married man never to have an 
extramartial affair 
twentysix percent said they felt strongly that their career 
was the proudest accomplishment of their lives and 40 percent said 
they strongly felt it is an important expression of who they are 
but only 15 percent agreed strongly that their career means as 
much to me as my family or friends do 
onethird of those surveyed said they spend 30 minutes or less 
a day on grooming another third spends between 30 minutes and 45 
minutes and the remaining third spends more than 45 minutes a day 
on grooming 
fortyeight percent said they strongly felt women go for the 
goodlooking men first before considering brains or personality 
fortysix percent take womens suggestions on appearance seriously 
but only 25 percent say they strongly like getting such advice

on the new york stock exchange groliers stock rose 12 cents a 
share to close at 2650 a price that was well above the 
21ashare bid from hachette 
the rejection of a 21 bid when the stock was at 26 was no 
great shock said jane gilday managing director of mckinley

interest in making a proposal to acquire the company robert b 
clarke chairman and chief executive said in a statement clarke 
did not name the companies 
grolier said that if it is unable to negotiate an acquisition of 
the company on satisfactory terms it will look at other 
alternatives such as a leveraged buyout or a financial 
restructuring

other bids gilday said and hachette could raise its bid

york said the way the stock market has reacted throughout this 
whole two weeks it appears the market feels grolier will be worth

kansas city southern industries inc 
said wednesday that a proposed buyout effort by a new york 
developer may be designed to stimulate trading in the companys 
stock and to draw attention to the developers previouslydisclosed 
plan to win two board seats 
the railroad data processing and financial services company 
noted that howard kaskel the new york developer had simply 
proposed talks toward a possible negotiated merger in his letter to 
the company this week 
it said the letter did not contain an offer to shareholders and 
does not state that financing for any transaction has been obtained 
in the letter kaskel proposed buying the 89 percent of the 
companys 111 million shares that his group doesnt already 
control for 60 a share in cash such a transaction would be worth 
about 590 million 
the letter appears to be an effort to stimulate trading in the 
kansas city southern industries stock and perhaps to publicize 
kaskels previously announced plan to nominate two persons for 
election to the kansas city southern industries board of 
directors the companys statement said 
a call was placed after business hours to kaskels lawyer for 
comment but the lawyer could not be reached 
wall street has indicated skepticism about whether an offer will 
be forthcoming in trading on the new york stock exchange kansas 
city southern fell 2 a share to 5450 on wednesday 
if mr kaskel as a large shareholder wishes to nominate an 
individual we would certainly be pleased to consider such a 
person kansas city southern president landon h rowland was 
quoted as saying in his companys statement 
the statement said the onagain offagain efforts of the 
kaskel group to thwart kansas city southern industries proposed 
acquisition of the southern pacific are viewed by management as 
inconsistent with the best interests of the company and its 
stockholders 
rowland said earlier in the week that the kcsi board would 
consider the kaskel proposal at a special meeting but declined to 
say when the meeting would be held

continuing basis have been realestate oriented and particularly 
our adult community developments said philip j dion the 
corporations chairman this our greatest past and present
