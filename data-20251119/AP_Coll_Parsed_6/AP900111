an associated press obituary of denver architect 
and developer temple hoyne buell who died last friday at age 94 
did not give full background on the 25 million donation he made to 
colorado womens college during the 1960s 
buell was persuaded by his second wife virginia bennett 
crocker to donate a 25 million trust to colorado womens college 
which then was renamed temple buell college 
but the schools other donors apparently unaware that buells 
contribution was to be posthumous began diverting their 
contributions elsewhere this prompted the schools trustees to 
break off the arrangement with buell and change the schools name 
back to colorado womens college 
the east denver college later was dissolved because of financial 
problems and the campus now is owned by the university of denver

on the road hardly means roughing it as 
truckers haul their own chandeliers fax machines and microwave 
ovens along with products going to market across country 
you can just about put anything you want in there said 
steve bombela of united truck and body in des moines which makes 
cabs and does customizing for semitrucks 
the longer cabs contain a sleeping unit behind the front seat 
that can be furnished with just about anything a trucker can dream 
up 
steve blunt 37 president of steve blunt trucking inc of des 
moines owns the bird a 70foot long customized kenworth 
aerodyne he spent 70000 getting the truck just the way he wanted 
it 
it is painted with two 17foot airbrushed blue firebirds from 
the hood to the tip of the trailer the sleeper has a bath with 
shower foldaway tables a central vacuuming system and a kitchen 
with sink twoburner stove microwave and customized cabinets 
there are refrigerators in both the cab and the sleeper 
the sleeping compartment for two has a 15inch remote control 
color television a vcr and a cellular telephone 
a stereo system with 28 speakers provides cruising music 
youve got to have some tunes said blunt whose drivers 
transport boxed beef to new york city and boston 
he likes the shower best 
more husband and wife teams are buying the big cabs since 
deregulation eased restrictions on truck length according to 
kenworth midiowa in des moines about 10 percent of the companys 
business is in the big kenworth aerodyne 
the cab and sleeper costs 90000 to 100000 without extras 
and is about the fanciest cab sold it also is the largest 
measuring 110 inches by 96 inches it comes with a button and tuck 
padded interior and upper and lower bunks and a fullsized 42inch 
bed 
bombela said his deluxe cabs and sleepers cost about 25000 
for that price bombelas company installs a shower a microwave 
refrigerator color television flush toilet sink oak cabinets 
water holding tanks and generator for a little extra money they 
will install water beds 
we put in showers flush toilets computers fax machines 
even chandeliers 
but some truckers dont like the big cabs despite the added 
comfort he said the large units with extras can add a thousand 
pounds a concern for truckers faced with weight limitations and 
the trucks are more difficult to drive because the wheel base is 
stretched to accommodate the sleepers he said 
paul swesey 27 of panora spent 40000 to customize his truck 
because he likes the show 
swesey is a household goods mover and spends more than 
threequarters of the year on the road sometimes not getting home 
for months at a time 
i go into a neighborhood and all the people want to see it 
theyve never seen a truck like this one before he said 
it has a fax machine phone and modem computer with dual disk 
drives printer microwave sink with hot and cold water portable 
toilet built in alarm clock television and vcr with wireless 
remote the central vacuuming system is really slick he said 
he also has a 5kilowatt generator so even when its 20 below 
you can stay nice and warm without idling the engine he said

behind rows of ornate houses in this 
village southeast of bucharest stands a snowbound collection of 
former stables that dictator nicolae ceausescu turned into a frigid 
warehouse for the insane 
a staff member and others say security police used to round up 
dissidents and undesirables and detain them at this mental 
hospital for weeks during political events such as the visit of 
soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev in 1987 
the dissidents alcoholics and homeless people the 
undesirables of ceausescus golden era for romania are gone 
after ceausescus ouster in popular revolution and execution dec 
25 
but 140 people suffering from mental illness still huddle 
against the cold inside the drafty building 
the conditions are terrible said stefana dancu one of two 
pyschiatric nurses this is a dirty isolated and unhealthy 
place 
in the womens section 90 women share 70 beds she said while 
all 50 male patients have their own bed they must share a single 
bathroom 
the wards are rows of tightly packed hospitalwhite beds set on 
bare unvarnished wooden floors in dim narrow drafty and barely 
heated rooms 
many of the patients spend their days on their beds fully 
dressed and wrapped in coarse heavy olivedrab wool blankets 
the patients can have a bath once a week if there is any hot 
water said ms dancu 
in the morning they have tea and bread or biscuits in the 
evening there is cabbage and potatoes or beans and horrible black 
coffee 
there is never any meat said ms dancu there are fresh 
vegetables only in the summer the only fruit is small apples that 
we have only sometimes 
until 15 years ago this was a stable she said adding that 
she does not know why it was transformed into a hospital for the 
insane 
a decision on its future has been put off until after a 
reorganization at the main psychiatric hospital in bucharest 18 
miles away she said 
healthy dissidents and undesirables brought to the hospital 
by the militia suffered alongside the mentally ill ms dancu said 
they were admitted during communist party congresses and major 
political events with many drugged despite not being ill she 
said when the event ended the doctor would say the treatment was 
over ms dancu added 
dr marin stancu the only psychiatrist assigned to the asylum 
said the militia brought 153 patients there in 1987 62 in 1988 and 
45 in 1989 but he insisted all of those people suffered from some 
mental illness 
there were no healthy people here he insisted 
another pyschiatrist and a police official speaking on 
condition of anonymity said they were told dissidents were brought 
to the asylum in cula but they said the could not show any proof 
reporters were not allowed to look at hospital records to try to 
trace former patients 
stancu said the militia would bring people to the hospital with 
a card that said they were being admitted for diagnosis or for 
disturbing the public order 
ceausescu didnt like to see these people on the streets 
said stancu 
they were unemployed people and gypsies and infirmed people 
he added while continuing to insist that they were also mentally 
ill 
most of those people were brought here because they wanted to 
leave the country said ms dancu who said she was assigned to 
work in the asylum more than three years ago after applying for 
permission to emigrate to canada 
stancu and the nurse said the patients brought in by the militia 
were designated m313 a code they said referred to the decree that 
allowed the militia to a bring people to a mental hospital 
when ms dancu was asked if she thought stancu should be a 
doctor she said no 
for this job you have to feel she said 
stancu remained silent when he was asked if he ever complained 
that the militia could just bring patients to the asylum when 
asked why he didnt refuse to accept such patients he replied 
i did my job as a doctor and i treated them like people i 
couldnt refuse because they were sick people

the music of german composer richard wagner a 
selfdeclared antisemite whose operas blared over loudspeakers in 
nazi death camps is taboo in israel 
but gottfried wagner maintains that his greatgrandfathers 
music was exploited by the nazis and he is touring the jewish 
state to rectify what he calls the distorted image of the 19th 
century composer 
wagners message was exactly the opposite of what the nazis 
stood for said the 42yearold musicologist 
he added however that he empathized with jews who responded to 
the music with anguish and anger 
i understand completely if israelis reject wagner he said 
in an interview many jews went to their deaths in the camps 
while having to listen to his music 
his campaign including media interviews and a university 
lecture series has renewed debate on whether to rescind the 
unofficial boycott which has kept wagners operas off israels 
airwaves 
in the past all efforts to break the boycott have been met with 
stormy protest although many israelis say they listen to wagner at 
home 
when after a 1981 israel philharmonic orchestra concert 
conductor zubin mehta announced as an encore the prelude to the 
wagner opera tristan and isolde the audience cied shame 
an usher rushed to the stage pulled up his shirt to show 
naziinflicted scars and shouted play wagner on my body 
avi shoshani the orchestras general secretary said wednesday 
he regretted that wagners music was still offlimits 
its a big loss our orchestra would have played it 
magnificently its a whole important segment in the history of 
music we are not touching shoshani said 
but menahem fogel a spokesman for the yad vashem holocaust 
memorial in jerusalem said wagner should not be played as long 
holocaust survivors are alive one has to consider the 
sensitivities of the people who lived through that period he 
said 
shai burstyn head of the musicology department at tel aviv 
university said richard wagner held antisemitic views although 
they should be seen in the context of the times 
im separating between the man and his music said burstyn 
whose department sponsored the lecture series there was hardly a 
19th century composer who was not an antisemite 
in an 1850 pamphlet titled the jew in music richard wagner 
railed against what he considered the undue influence of jews in 
germanys music circles 
the pamphlet is shameful but you cant draw a straight line 
from this to auschwitz gottfried wagner said he said his 
greatgrandfather was an ambitious man who lashed out because he 
felt the music establishment was withholding recognition of his 
achievements 
despite the prejudice expressed in the pamphlet the central 
message of his work especially of the operatic cycle the ring of 
the nibelung is one of hope wagner said 
he felt that men have to choose between love and destruction 
he hoped that future generations would learn from the mistakes of 
the past and opt for love not destruction wagner said 
this message was perverted when hitler came to power 50 years 
after the composers death wagner said 
hitler befriended winifred wagner gottfrieds grandmother and a 
driving force at the bayreuth festival of wagnerian music during 
the third reich the nazi dictator and the wagner clan subsequently 
turned the composers operatic protagonists antiheroes who always 
met tragic ends into blond aryan monsters he said 
wagner said he distanced himself from the family early on he 
conducted research on german jewish culture and wrote a doctoral 
dissertation on german jewish composer kurt weill 
wagner who lives in cerro maggiore italy and also works as a 
stage and tv director said he came to israel to begin a dialogue 
about his greatgrandfather 
however he said a matteroffact discussion about the composer 
might only be possible in another 20 years 
in the meantime he said he was not pushing too hard for an end 
of the wagner ban this is up to the israelis especially the 
victims of the holocaust

a possible split in the kremlins military 
alliance will be on the agenda tuesday when top military officers 
from the united states soviet union and 33 other nations hold a 
firstofakind meeting in vienna 
us delegates headed by gen colin powell chairman of the 
joint chiefs of staff will press their soviet counterparts to 
explain what one american official called discrepancies between 
soviet military doctrine and deployment and production levels 
soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev has proclaimed a doctrine of 
reasonable sufficiency based on a more defensive posture 
declaring unilateral troop cuts and a willingness to conclude a 
multinational agreement to reduce conventional armies in europe 
this year 
but gorbachevs words and deeds have been outstripped by the 
political revolution sweeping eastern europe and the demands of 
some of the new noncommunist governments us analysts say more 
changes are inevitable in the warsaw pact alliance 
no one could have foreseen the dramatic events which have 
swept over eastern europe during the past 12 months said a 
statement issued by john j maresca chairman of the us 
delegation to the conference entitled confidence and security 
building measures in europe 
many of the political and security relationships which have 
become so familiar over the last four decades are being challenged 
in new ways every day and it has become increasingly difficult to 
anticipate events maresca said 
a senior us official briefing reporters said the eastern 
european countries are expressing very different views warsaw 
pact discipline isnt what it used to be 
given the changes in eastern europe this conference has 
taken on great significance but we cant guarantee any 
dramatic results from the seminar said the official who spoke 
on condition that he not be further identified 
powell and his soviet counterpart chief of staff mikhail a 
moiseyev will stay in vienna for the first few days of the 
threeweek seminar officials said 
the session will mark the first time that top military officers 
of the north atlantic treaty organization and the warsaw pact plus 
the neutral and nonaligned states of europe will sit down to 
discuss their intentions plans and arsenals us officials said 
we view the seminar itself as a confidencebuilding measure 
said the senior official 
us delegates also have some pointed questions about soviet 
troop deployments and production he said 
until very recently soviet production of tanks remained the 
same even higher than it was before gorbachev declared 
unilateral troop reductions and a new military doctrine the 
official said 
tank production has since declined however and the official 
said other questionable areas included supply of fuel oils and 
munition stocks stationed on the frontier 
pressed for specifics the official would say only in some 
cases they havent changed lets leave it at that 
the military seminar starts a month before secretary of state 
james a baker iii travels to ottawa canada for a discussion 
among the 16 nato and seven warsaw pact nations on president bushs 
open skies proposal for sanctioned spy plane missions across 
other nations 
the senior us official said there was no direct tie between 
the military seminar and the open skies meeting although the 
official said the two subjects mesh

when the authors of the constitution finished 
work in philadelphia in 1787 a mrs powel called out to benjamin 
franklin well doctor what have we got a republic or a 
monarchy 
a republic if you can keep it franklin replied 
now the people of eastern europe having overthrown their 
despots in the revolutions of 1989 can also ask what have we 
got 
for the first time in nearly half a century theyve got the 
opportunity to establish selfgovernment and its economic 
counterpart capitalism 
but can they keep it do they know how these institutions work 
after decades of oneparty government and staterun economies is 
the drive toward selfgovernment and a freemarket system 
instinctive or must it be learned 
both are based on harnessed selfinterest or some might say 
on greed sounds natural 
but even if people grasp the rudiments some experts think that 
building the structures to allow democracy and capitalism to 
function is going to take a struggle take years and carry risks 
including the risk that in overthrowing communism the people could 
yet embrace fascism with its fatherfigure appeal 
people want liberty naturally but the working out of 
institutions is a very complicated process says richard pipes 
professor of russian history at harvard and a former adviser on 
eastern europe in ronald reagans white house 
the russians in 1917 were wild for liberty and democracy but 
it collapsed in a matter of months because they didnt have the 
traditions the institutions he says 
in some countries of eastern europe some traditions of 
democracy survive in czechoslovakia and to a lesser extent poland 
and hungary and maybe east germany there wouldnt be much in 
romania or bulgaria 
on the other hand says pipes it is only normal for people to 
want to run their own lives to test that theory think of the 
opposite he says who would opt for slavery 
robert conquest a specialist on the soviet union at the hoover 
institution on war revolution and peace at stanford university 
suspects east europes economic rebirth will be more troublesome 
than its political renewal 
in politics he says they can go back to their old 
constitutions but on the economic front theyre stuck with 
these apparatuses of uselessness in a system that guaranteed a 
job to everyone no one worked hard 
postwar germany had no trouble adapting to democracy konrad 
adenauer first chancellor of west germany knew how it worked 
conquest notes he had been mayor of cologne before hitler 
government professor harvey mansfield jr of harvard worries 
that fascism could beckon if democracy founders in east europe 
democracy he says concerns itself with petty questions 
survival and comfort and not something higher while in the prewar 
years fascism gave the promise of something higher the 
regeneration of the human race by getting rid of weaklings there 
was an idealism in fascism that one shouldnt underestimate 
conquest doubts fascisms likely appeal in east europe he 
says i think the attraction of democratic liberty is very very 
great they have a higher opinion of the west than the west does 
economist murray weidenbaum who served on a mission to survey 
polands economy for president bush thinks that while all people 
have the entrepreneurial profitseeking instinct that doesnt 
mean capitalism will catch hold easily 
they have to learn business infrastructure like cost 
accounting contract law preparation of financial statements 
that isnt instinctive 
nobel prize economist paul a samuelson of mit agrees 
the market structure is a very channeled form of greed he 
says if people insist on putting sand in sugar or if people 
blandly borrow 1000 one hour and declare bankruptcy the next 
that makes a market system that works very badly 
adds weidenbaum the poles see the benefits of capitalism but 
dont see the costs thats one of the concerns i have i dont 
know if they realize that capitalism is not a profit system but a 
profitorloss system in the best of times thousands of companies 
go broke 
similarly mansfield worries that east europeans could botch the 
construction of democratic structures france he notes had to try 
out four republics before coming around to its present fifth 
republic which seems to be working 
even in 1787 when benjamin franklin answered mrs powels 
question the constitution represented a second attempt the 
articles of confederation and perpetual union of 1781 had been a 
flop 
and notes pipes the people who founded this republic were 
english in their culture which had overthrown despotism and 
experienced revolution we were the beneficiaries of that 
on the other hand he says east europeans are so fed up with 
depotism of any kind right or left that youre going to se a 
tremendous desire for democracy and capitalism

about half of americans say job stress affects 
their health personal relationships or their ability to do their 
job according to a gallup poll released today 
the poll also found less than half or 41 percent of the 
nations workers are on a career or job path they had planned the 
rest have their jobs due to chance were influenced by family or 
friends or took the only job they could find 
the survey of 1350 people was conducted for the national 
occupational information coordinating committee a panel congress 
created to make better use of job information the poll which 
asked a variety of jobrelated questions had a margin of error of 
plus or minus 4 percentage points 
other findings showed nearly onethird of the work force expects 
to change jobs within the next three years and that 65 percent said 
that given a chance to start over they would try to get more 
information about career options 
of employed adults who responded 25 percent said job stress or 
pressure had interfered with their offthejob relationships 20 
percent said it had affected their physical health and 20 percent 
said it had affected their ability to do their job 
but responding to the same question 48 percent reported little 
or no job stress over the past year the totals exceeded 100 
percent because of multiple responses 
sharon dannan research director at the clevelandbased 9 to 5 
national association of working women said more americans are 
probably suffering from jobrelated stress than admit it 
theres lots of people who probably dont realize thats what 
it is that their job is full of interruptions or that they have 
multiple bosses telling them its priority work and that its 
driving them nuts she said 
the poll showed that 41 percent of the employed respondents 
consciously chose their career path 18 percent got started through 
chance circumstances 12 percent took the only job available and 
the rest were either influenced by friends or relatives 
juliette lester executive director of the committee said the 
results showing fewer than half of americans are on planned job 
paths demonstrates the need for government and job counselors to 
improve the way they educate the public about careers 
the poll also showed 40 percent said higher pay would give them 
an incentive to accomplish more at work 31 percent cited more 
recognition other incentives included additional training chance 
for advancement and more control over their job

president bushs secret diplomacy with china 
is still a secret to many americans according to a survey of 
public interest in the news released today 
the times mirror news interest index for january showed only 6 
percent of those polled said they followed very closely news of 
a december visit to china by two top administration officials 
another 18 percent said they followed the story fairly closely 
leading the public interests in december was the us invasion 
of panama which the survey said was followed closely by 60 percent 
of readers that made it the fourth most closely followed news 
event since times mirror began the measurements in 1986 
news of the bloody revolution in romania was followed very 
attentively only by 28 percent of those responding 
even among the groups usually most interested in foreign 
affairs interest in the china story was relatively slack with 35 
percent of those over 50 years old and 33 percent of college 
graduates saying they paid close attention 
that contrasts sharply with the interest shown in developments 
in china earlier in the year the midsummer times mirror survey 
found 47 percent of those polled showed sharp interest in 
developments in china including the violent crackdown on massive 
prodemocracy demonstrations 
bush sent national security adviser brent scowcroft and deputy 
secretary of state lawrence eagleburger to china in december to lay 
the groundwork for normalizing relations again in the wake of the 
beijing regimes june move against demonstrators 
the mission was announced after scowcroft and eagleburger 
arrived in the chinese capital later it was disclosed scowcroft 
had traveled to beijing barely a month after the tiananmen square 
crackdown the missions brought sharp criticism from some in both 
parties who said the presidents conciliatory approach didnt match 
harshness of chinas brutal crackdown 
among those under 30 only 3 percent said they followed the 
controversy very closely among nonwhites the proportion was 9 
percent 
the panama story has been exceeded in public interest as 
measured by the survey only by the 1986 explosion of the space 
shuttle challenger last octobers san francisco earthquake and the 
rescue in 1987 of jessica mcclure from a texas well 
the earthquake was followed closely by nearly threequarters of 
those surveyed in early november making it the most closely 
watched news story of the year according to the poll 
earlier in 1989 hurricane hugos devastation of caribbean 
islands and the carolinas was followed closely by 60 percent of 
those surveyed the top interest the survey found in a washington 
story last year was the summers controversy over flag burning 
which was followed closely by 51 percent 
the supreme courts ruling giving states greater power to 
regulate abortion was followed closely by 47 percent 
asked what most interested them most in the panama story most 
of those interviewed said it was the effort to take gen manuel 
antonio noriega into custody 
the survey results indicated the ongoing political changes in 
east germany czechoslovakia and hungary drew close attention from 
29 percent of those polled 1 percentage point more than the events 
in romania 
fiftysix percent said they believed the invasion of panama was 
the most important thing to happen last month political change in 
east bloc countries in general was cited by 18 percent and the 
revolution in romania specifically by 5 percent 
asked to recall people in the news 76 percent came up with the 
name of noriega he was followed by bush with 58 percent soviet 
leader mikhail gorbachev was named by 16 percent and the late 
romanian dictator nicolae ceausescu by 12 percent 
the latest survey results are based on telephone interviews 
conducted jan 47 by the gallup organization under the direction 
of princeton survey research associates among 1207 adults 18 or 
older 
the times mirror center for the people and the press which 
sponsors the survey said it is subject to sampling and other 
random errors of 3 percentage points

a supreme court ruling that let public 
officials escape fines for defying a federal judges order to end 
racial discrimination is regrettable but may have limited impact 
civil rights leaders say 
i think the decision is more significant as a political symbol 
than legally said steven shapiro a lawyer with the american 
civil liberties union 
it will be perceived as a further step away from the courts 
commitment to civil rights 
the high court split 54 wednesday in overturning fines against 
four yonkers ny councilmen who blocked a housing desegregation 
plan 
we do not regard this as a particularly injurious decision as 
the supreme court also let stand the ability of a lower court to 
fine a city that chooses to defy its orders said benjamin hooks 
executive director of the naacp 
ralph neas head of the leadership conference on civil rights 
said the ruling is regrettable but does not appear to be a 
measurable cutback in civil rights law 
shapiro noted that the high court handed civil rights forces a 
series of defeats in 1989 when it limited affirmative action made 
it tougher to prove job discrimination and restricted remedies for 
onthejob racial harassment 
those decisions touched off angry protests by civil rights 
leaders 
the yonkers councilmen one of them now mayor celebrated the 
decision with champagne 
chief justice william h rehnquist writing for the court said 
the judge who imposed the fines exceeded his authority the judge 
should have waited to see whether potentially bankrupting penalties 
against the city would force adoption of the desegregation plan 
before even considering fining the councilmen rehnquist said 
justice william j brennan in a dissenting opinion lamented 
that the ruling may encourage defiant public officials in other 
bias cases he said the majority was blind to the scourge of 
racism in yonkers 
in other action wednesday the court 
ruled 54 in an illinois case that statements a criminal 
defendant makes after an unlawful arrest may not be used by 
prosecutors to contradict a defense witness trial testimony 
unanimously limited the ability of multinational corporations 
to challenge state taxes in federal court 
in the yonkers case rehnquist noted the court previously left 
intact fines against the city 
there can be no question about the liability of the city of 
yonkers for racial discrimination he said 
brennan wrote 
i worry that the courts message will have the unintended 
effect of emboldening recalcitrant officials continually to test 
the ultimate reach of the remedial authority of the federal 
courts 
the ruling will not be the last word this year from the court on 
the powers of federal judges to combat segregation in a case from 
kansas city mo that is expected to be decided by july the court 
is studying a judges order to increase property taxes to help pay 
for desegregating that citys schools 
the yonkers case attracted national attention in the summer of 
1988 as the defiant councilmen were threatened with jail as well as 
fines and the city faced possible bankruptcy for refusing to obey 
us district judge leonard sands desegregation orders 
faced with massive layoffs of city workers the city council 
reversed itself and on sept 10 1988 voted to comply with sands 
order to build 1000 lowcost omes to desegregate middleclass 
areas of the city just north of new york city 
but yonkers still had to pay 819000 in contempt fines fines 
of 3500 against each of the four councilmen will be returned to 
them 
the yonkers case stems from a justice department lawsuit begun 
by the carter administration in its waning days in 1980 
the bush administration has said sand acted properly in fining 
the councilmen as well as the city 
the four councilmen were edward fagan nicholas v longo peter 
chema and henry spallone 
one thing is certain we used the american court system and 
the american court system made the determination that a federal 
judge overstepped his power spallone now mayor said after the 
ruling i dont think its the end i think its the beginning

agriculture department analysts say many 
farmers who depend on selling grain crops for cash could be in 
serious financial trouble this year despite a general improvement 
in the nations agricultural sector 
right now the farms that were most concerned about in terms 
of their ability to prosper are the traditional cash grain 
farmers wheat and corn producers in particular said gregory 
hanson of the departments economic research service 
corn producers perhaps more than others are in jeopardy from 
possible low market prices later this year hanson said wednesday 
in a telephone interview 
within the usda agency analysts are projecting corn prices 
down about 50 cents a bushel between the second quarter of 1990 and 
the fourth quarter when the harvests come into the market he 
said that is assuming that crops will have good weather and that 
peracre yields will continue their upward trend 
if that should happen while the farm debate in congress is 
in high gear that could have an impact in itself hanson said 
the usda says its recent fiveday average shows corn prices at 
224 per bushel the analysts project prices could drop to about 
174 per bushel by fall 
new farm legislation is in the works to replace the 1985 farm 
law which reduced federal price support and target price benefits 
on major commodities hanson was asked to elaborate on a comment in 
the january issue of agricultural outlook magazine 
the report said if the 1990 farm bill continues to lower 
target prices in the spirit of the 1985 farm bill government 
payments could continue falling and impose financial strains on 
vulnerable operators in the years to come 
according to usdas forecasts net cash income will likely 
exceed 50 billion for the fourth consecutive year in 1990 up 2 
percent to 4 percent from 1989 that is simply money left over from 
gross cash income after paying cash expenses 
however another method shows that net farm income which take 
into account changes in inventory values depreciation and other 
items during a calendar year may drop 2 percent to 5 percent from 
48 billion in 1989 
as an example of the impact of lowering target prices hanson 
said that under the 1985 farm law the target price for corn was 
reduced each year by about 10 cents per bushel 
the purpose of the target price system is to provide income 
protection for farmers if market prices average below the target 
direct payments are made to help make up the difference 
costs of direct subsidies rose to 167 billion in 1987 before 
dropping to 145 billion in 1988 and about 11 billion in 1989 
according to usda projections the payments may be in the range of 
8 billion to 11 billion in 1990 
hanson said the 1988 drought by driving prices up 
substantially to some extent obscured the impact of the 
downgrading of target prices and other changes allowed by the 1985 
law 
but now were saying that net farm income is likely to fall 2 
to 5 percent in 1990 had government payments stayed level or had 
those declines in target prices not occurred net farm income 
would be up im sure in 1990 he said its definitely having 
an impact theres no question about it 
the administration is seeking greater flexibility in 1990 farm 
legislation to give farmers greater planting choices negotiations 
under the uruguay round of the general agreement on tariffs and 
trade also are aimed at freer global trade policies and more export 
access for us farm products 
even so as president bush told the american farm bureau 
federation earlier this week in florida the administration 
promises to maintain a safety net to protect farmers from 
conditions beyond their control 
hanson said the farm bill debate has many complicated 
dimensions some argue that since farm income is so high and the 
financial crisis of the early 1980s is over there is no need for 
federal programs to protect farmers 
on the other hand people say direct payments have already 
fallen from 17 billion in 1987 to maybe as low as 9 billion in 
1990 and that farmers have already taken their hit he said 
another side is represented by the office of management and 
budget where white house budget cutters are seeking ways to reduce 
the governments spending deficit putting the squeeze on farm 
programs is one of the ways 
so you not only have nonfarm legislators wondering whether 
this transfer subsidy program make any sense but you have omb 
trying to wield their knives hanson said 
meanwhile agriculture secretary clayton yeutter and his 
predecessors for many years have been talking long and hard about 
the benefits of freer trade and the importance of the uruguay round 
of gatt talks that will conclude at the end of this year 
that is having an effect hanson said you can sense it 
on the other hand one of the things learned in the 1980s and 
brought home by the drought is that farm production and farm 
prices remain highly unstable they vary greatly from year to 
year 
thus he added its just comforting if youre a producer to 
know that the government is there to help redress some of those 
down cycles

arizonas largest thrift and eight other 
savings associations are being offered for sale today by the 
government agency created to manage president bushs savings and 
loan bailout 
the institutions under the control of the resolution trust 
corp are in seven states and hold assets totaling 135 billion 
the biggest is western savings and loan association of phoenix 
a victim of the collapse in arizona real estate prices 
western was seized by regulators june 15 on sept 30 it had 
583 billion in assets and 443 million in 426137 deposit 
accounts at the time of its takeover western was the 38th largest 
sampl in the nation 
the nine sampls being sold are advertised in todays wall street 
journal rtc spokesman stephen j katsanos said wednesday 
the other institutions and their total assets as of sept 30 are 
horizon federal savings and loan association southampton pa 
222 billion 
gill savings association hondo texas 125 billion 
american federal savings and loan association colorado 
springs colo 880 million 
bexar savings association san antonio texas 820 million 
blue valley federal savings and loan association kansas city 
mo 788 million 
anchor federal savings and loan association kansas city kan 
748 million 
royal palm federal savings and loan association west palm 
beach fla 535 million 
otero savings colorado springs colo 482 million 
also about 40 other thrifts will be put on the auction block 
next week each with assets of less than 500 million katsanos 
said 
since its creation in august the rtc has sold 37 bankrupt sampls 
with 10 billion in assets leaving 285 with 105 billion in assets 
still in its charge it expects to take over another 200 in coming 
months 
earlier the agency invited bids on 18 sampls with assets 
totaling 13 billion and expects to complete the sales within 
several weeks katsanos said 
the rtc hopes to close the sales of the nine to be offered today 
and the 40 to be offered next week early in the apriljune quarter 
if all goes as planned that would bring the count of institutions 
handled to about 104 
the sale announcement came as pressure mounts on the agency to 
speed up the pace of rescues rep bruce vento dminn who heads 
a house task force overseeing the bailout has criticized the 
administration for failing to move faster 
katsanos said the sale of sampls being offered today and next week 
have been planned for several months 
we have been moving these as expeditiously as can be done 
he said 
he warned that when the latest batch of sales is finished the 
rtc will face a cash crunch unless the bush administration and 
congress agree on a plan to raise 50 billion to 100 billion in 
additional financing 
under the original 50 billion bailout plan the rtc has 
received 24 billion and will get another 4 billion to 5 billion 
from a debt sale scheduled jan 23 
however the administration says the agency needs an additional 
50 billion to 100 billion in working capital that later would be 
repaid by selling assets from the bankrupt sampls

federal banking agencies are ordering the 
nations largest banks to more than double reserves set aside for 
anticipated losses on loans to economically troubled argentina 
the order expected to depress industry earnings in the fourth 
quarter requires banks to hold reserves of at least 35 percent of 
the loan amount up from 15 percent said a federal deposit 
insurance corp official who spoke wednesday on condition of 
anonymity 
it is unclear how the decision will affect individual banks 
some likely already have loss reserves large enough to cover 35 
percent of their loans to argentina but others such as citicorp 
and bankamerica corp of san francisco have proportionately 
smaller loss reserves for third world debt than competitors 
jim mitchell a spokesman for bankamerica corp said the bank 
was aware of the new reserve requirement but declined to say what 
the effect would be on his institution 
a discussion of our ldc less developed country reserve 
coverage and related issues will be a routine part of our 
fourthquarter earnings announcement which we expect to make 
next week he said 
bankamerica corps stock was unchanged wednesday at 2750 on 
the new york stock exchange 
prices fell for the shares of several other large banks 
chase manhattan closed at 3150 down 37 cents chemical bank 
3012 down 12 cents citicorp 27 down 25 cents and 
manufacturers hanover trust 3225 down 1 
in the third quarter the nations 12800 commercial banks 
collectively recorded a 744 million loss the first in two years 
the industry was pushed into the red by 53 billion in third world 
debt losses at five large banks 
the decision on argentina loans likely will produce another 
disappointing report for the fourth quarter it stems from a 
recommendation from the interagency country review committee which 
coordinates third world lending matters among banking agencies 
including the fdic the federal reserve board and the comptroller 
of the currency 
the committee customarily does not announce its decisions 
argentina which owed 62 billion to us banks at the end of 
september is latin americas fourthlargest debtor to us 
financial institutions the three largest debtors are brazil 
which owes them 191 billion mexico 157 billion and 
venezuela 69 billion 
mexico has scrupulously kept up its payments but both brazil 
and argentina are in arrears 
argentinas economy has deteriorated sharply recently beset by 
hyperinflation its currency the austral has lost 99 percent of 
its value over the past year 
on monday prices of the leading stocks on the buenos aires 
stock exchange plunged 53 percent after the exchange was closed for 
more than a week

latin american countries are cutting into 
their debt to us banks even as the nations debt to the rest of 
the world increases according to a government report 
the debt of latin american countries to us banks declined by 
some 24 billion in the three months ending in september 1989 
falling to 483 billion the federal reserve reported wednesday 
though latin american debt to the world has been rising 
steadily banks in the united states have been accepting repayments 
and new lending has not kept up with the payments 
in september 1984 five years before the period of the new 
report latin nations owed us banks just less than 74 billion 
the report noted 
but since then the total owed to us banks by brazil the 
third worlds biggest debtor has fallen from about 246 billion 
to 191 billion mexico owed some 259 billion five years ago by 
last september mexicos debt was down to 157 billion 
mexico has kept scrupulously up with its interest payments 
despite falling wages and living standards 
the debt has also been reduced by what are called 
debtequity swaps debts to us banks are due in dollars 
sometimes debtor governments will allow the banks to take payment 
in their own currency and use the money to buy local industry 
chile has used this device extensively other debtor governments 
are less enthusiastic both because they dislike seeing foreigners 
own more of their countries assets and because such deals add to 
the local currency in circulation boosting inflation runaway 
prices are a problem in brazil and argentina 
there have also been reductions in the amount owed to american 
banks by troubled debtors outside latin america 
the federal reserve said nigeria cut its american bank debt from 
about 15 billion to 486 million over five years the 
philippines total was down from 51 billion to 32 billion 
so far there has been no reduction as a result of the strategy 
announced last march by treasury secretary nicholas f brady an 
agreement announced in october on costa rica is expected to reduce 
its 45 billion debt by 1 billion 
a bigger deal for mexico has not been completed 
according to the world bank latin american debt has risen 
worldwide including debts to the world bank from 377 billion 
in 1984 to 434 billion last year

the pentagon will consider women who fought in 
panama for several decorations honoring valor but not for the 
combat infantryman badge 
none of several hundred women who served in the panama operation 
serve in infantry units a requirement to be considered for the 
combat infantryman badge army spokesman maj joe padilla said 
wednesday 
they will be eligible for decorations and awards for valor 
the bronze star silver star distinguished service cross and the 
medal of honor padilla said 
but the major said a person has to see action and has to be a 
member of an infantry unit to be eligible for the combat 
infantryman badge 
about 9000 of the 26000 troops involved in the invasion were 
in the infantry padilla said but not all will receive the combat 
infantryman badge 
under army policy women are excluded from military specialties 
such as the infantry that are deemed combatrelated 
the issue has drawn attention in light of the actions of capt 
linda bray who commanded the 988th military police company when it 
seized the panamanian defense forces canine unit during the dec 20 
invasion 
in that encounter as well as others female soldiers came under 
and returned fire 
padilla said it is up to the armys chain of command to make 
decisions awarding medals and each case is reviewed individually

the bush administration says it will propose 
shifting more of the cost of the nations transportation system to 
state and local governments individual users and the private 
sector 
transportation secretary samuel k skinner said in a speech 
wednesday that his departments blueprint for improving the 
countrys highways bridges rail lines airports and harbors 
proposes to move the action closer to the people 
he said portions of the new strategy will be reflected in the 
administrations 1991 budget proposal and in a number of actions 
the department of transportation will be taking over the next few 
weeks and months 
david prosperi a spokesman for skinner said details of the 
proposals will be released with the administrations budget request 
and president bushs state of the union address later this month 
but skinner was clear about the administrations intentions 
first of all we envision a stronger healthier partnership 
among federal state and local governments skinner said at an 
annual meeting of the transportation research board which acts as 
an independent adviser to the government 
but having a less intrusive federal government would also mean 
shifting the financial burden skinner said 
at the same time a healthier partnership goes handinhand 
with reduced dependence on federal money he said we believe 
federal recipients of federal transportation aid should pay a 
larger share of project costs 
in addition he said were going to be looking for new and 
creative ways to apply the timetested user fee principle 
we intend to recover from users the maximum practical share of 
costs they impose this includes recovering federal costs from user 
groups that are now getting a free ride we also want to make it 
easier for other levels of government to levy user fees for 
transportation improvements 
a third strategy he said would stimulate more private 
investment in transportation such as toll roads the fivepoint 
strategy also calls for regulatory changes such as having railroad 
workers covered by workers compensation and promoting new 
technology and research and development 
the reagan administration had advocated such fees but it was 
repeatedly rebuffed by congress in efforts to impose user fees on 
recreational boaters and others who benefit from coast guard 
services 
administration officials have said they do not view the user 
fees as taxes so they would not violate the presidents pledge of 
no new taxes last month administration sources floated the idea 
of imposing fees on recreational vehicles and equipment to pay for 
conservation 
republican lawmakers have proposed letting local airports impose 
a departure fee or head tax to help pay for air 
transportation improvements airline passengers already pay an 8 
percent federal ticket tax 
on another subject skinner defended the departments ambitious 
air traffic modernization plan against calls by a private pilots 
organization for a congressional investigation 
the aircraft owners and pilots association said wednesday the 
national airspace system plan is over budget and behind schedule 
and using outdated technology 
skinner said he is satisfied with the program and blames any 
problems on the unprecedented growth in air traffic 
that system will not only allow us to enhance our capacity to 
handle it skinner said it will develop the technology and 
expertise that american companies will sell all over the world

geraldine ferraro the first woman to win a 
slot on a major partys presidential ticket says shes considering 
a political comeback 
ferraro walter mondales running mate on the 1984 democratic 
ticket is weighing a challenge to new york republican sen alfonse 
damato 
the former threeterm congresswoman says she isnt worried that 
a political campaign would resurrect hurtful stories about her or 
her family 
i dont think theres very much that the people of this state 
or this nation dont know about me or about my family ferraro 
said wednesday in a telephone interview from new york 
ferraro was hounded by questions about her familys finances 
during the 1984 campaign she later complained that her political 
fame hurt her family and led to harsher court treatment of her 
husband and son 
her husband john zaccaro pleaded guilty in 1985 to a 
misdemeanor charge in a real estate deal her son john zaccaro 
jr later was convicted of selling a quartergram of cocaine while 
at middlebury college in vermont 
i would love to back in washington i would love to be part of 
the decisionmaking process with reference to whats going on in 
this country said ferraro 54 who lives in the new york city 
borough of queens 
a race against rep thomas manton who holds ferraros former 
seat is out of the question she said 
i endorsed him and he is a democrat who represents my district 
very very well 
damatos second term ends in 1992 recent polls show his 
popularity is slipping primarily because of reports that he used 
his influence to steer money from the department of housing and 
urban development to friends nd political supporters 
the senate ethics committee has hired an outside counsel to 
decide whether it should launch a fullscale investigation of 
damato 
ferraro flirted with the idea of taking on damato in 1986 but 
pulled back citing personal reasons 
wednesday ferraro said she ruled out that senate race because 
she feared the power of attorney general edwin meese iii the 
justice department was investigating complaints that she had failed 
to fully disclose her husbands finances while she was in congress 
that investigation continued well past the campaign nursed by 
people within the justice department and i found out later that ed 
meese had personal interest in it and was tying it to my political 
decisions she said 
i did not doubt for one minute that he would use it 
politically against me 
the 22month investigation ended with the department deciding 
there was no basis for a criminal or civil action

the united states angry at a un agriculture 
organization that supported the palestine liberation organization 
is sharply cutting its contribution to the body and may pull out 
altogether 
the state department announced wednesday it would pay the 18 
million necessary to retain our vote in the food and agriculture 
organization said spokeswoman margaret tutwiler the united states 
was supposed to pay 614 million or 25 percent of the agencys 
budget in 1989 
we will reassess our participation in the un food and 
agriculture organization during 1990 tutwiler said 
the faos resolution last november adopted by 96 members with 
14 abstentions and only the united states and israel opposing 
called for the organization to provide palestinians in the 
israelioccupied territories with assistance in close cooperation 
with the plo 
it also criticized israels confiscation of palestinian land 
and the expropriation of palestinian water resources 
the united states argued the resolution was political and 
inconsistent with the organizations goal of providing agricultural 
assistance to developing nations 
in rome an fao official said the us decision to cut funds was 
unfair and unjustified the official who asked not to be 
named said the resolution doesnt say the fao must work through 
the plo and claimed the united states misunderstood the reasoning 
behind the adopted language 
the united states issued several appeals and requests to the fao 
last fall to modify the resolution which was presented by arab 
states but us officials complain their calls were largely 
ignored 
the united states was also angered by the budget adopted at the 
meeting which projected a 3 percent growth for 1990 and 1991 said 
a state department official the united states had sought a budget 
freeze pending reforms the official said 
the governing council also denied us representative dan 
amstutz his right to chair the fao council under a rotation system 
compounding us anger the us official said 
the united states has clashed repeatedly with the united nations 
and its affiliated agencies over their budgets and their support 
for the plo 
the united states is the member most in arrears to the un last 
october it delivered a 65 million check to the organization 
reducing its debt to 635 million 
the debt began to accrue in 1985 when president reagan withheld 
some dues from the un to protest what he said was the bodys 
antiamerican bias its overblown budget and inefficient 
administration 
the united nations did enact some reforms but congress last 
fall turned down the administrations request for an additional 46 
million to pay some of the back dues

an institute of medicine panel is sorting 
through conflicting opinions on the safety of the vaccine that 
prevents whooping cough amid claims the government is wrongly 
downplaying the risks 
the panel heard testimony wednesday from medical and legal 
experts as part of a congressionallyrequired review of possible 
problems with the vaccine 
experts with the american academy of pediatrics told the review 
committee no scientific evidence proves the vaccine can cause brain 
damage or death and if it does cause such effects they are rare 
less than 1 in 300000 
but others said more than 1000 reported cases of severe 
reaction to the vaccine should warrant caution and highlight the 
need for a safer vaccine which they say is now available in other 
countries 
the institute of medicine panel of 12 medical and public health 
experts was formed at the request of the department of health and 
human services to review information on possible problems from 
vaccines against pertussis or whooping cough and rubella better 
known as german measles 
jeffrey h schwartz a washington lawyer who says his daughters 
death from a seizure in 1984 was diagnosed as caused by the 
pertussis vaccine charged the government is engaged in a 
conspiracy of silence and denial by withholding information about 
the danger of the vaccine 
government public health officials in their zeal to promote 
mass immunizations to wipe out contagious diseases are 
deliberately understating the severe side effects the pertussis 
vaccine can cause said schwartz 
schwartz spoke on behalf of dissatisfied parents together a 
nationwide group of parents whose children have been injured or 
killed by vaccines his group was instrumental in pushing through 
the national childhood vaccine injury act of 1986 which required 
the vaccine review and established a federal compensation program 
for families 
the whooping cough vaccine is usually given with the vaccines 
for diphtheria and tetanus which together are referred to as the 
dpt vaccine to children in a series of four shots beginning at 
around 2 months it is required by state laws for admission to 
school 
we have not advocated that parents not get the vaccine 
schwartz said but we are pushing for a safer vaccine and more 
caution in giving the vaccine to children who have a family history 
of seizures or have had a severe reaction to an earlier dpt shot 
dr stanley plotkin an official of the american academy of 
pediatrics and a professor at the university of pennsylvania said 
there is no scientific data that shows the pertussis vaccine causes 
severe neurological damage or death however the vaccine can bring 
to light or exacerbate preexisting conditions he said 
he disputed contentions that a pertussis vaccine being used in 
japan is safer and as effective as the one used in the united 
states applications to approve this vaccine are pending at the 
food and drug administration 
plotkin also downplayed reports that arthritis may be associated 
with the rubella vaccine when given to adult women he said that in 
about 25 percent of the cases women have aches and pains but 
that the symptoms usually last only for a few days 
we have no reason to believe its anything more than that 
he said

second time accusing the talk show host of racist and obscene 
slurs 
willis edwards who recently resigned as president of the 
beverly hillshollywood chapter also named rolling stone magazine 
as a defendant in tuesdays lawsuit 
edwards said he was libeled and slandered when hall described 
him in a rolling stone interview as a pimp and a phony 
a spokeswoman for hall did not return a telephone message 
seeking comment 
john jordan a spokesman for rolling stone said magazine 
officials had no knowledge of the lawsuit and would not comment 
in january 1989 edwards sued hall for 10 million for libel 
after hall allegedly told a radio interviewer that edwards had 
tried to extort 40000 from hall to block publicity that hall 
failed to hire black writers directors or producers for his show 
edwards announced his resignation last month on the night of

president bush is seeking to personally soothe 
what an official called colombias political sensitivities that 
erupted in anger over reports the united states was planning an 
antidrug blockade off colombia 
bush on wednesday telephoned president virgilio barco to disavow 
intention of a blockade and to express regret over the recent 
misunderstanding caused by press reports about us plans for 
antidrug efforts off south america the white house said 
although officials earlier said plans were being set for what 
one pentagon source called a virtual sea and air blockade of 
colombia to interdict drugs bush denied that was the intention 
the president assured president barco that the us never 
intended to conduct any activities within colombian territorial 
waters that no us actions would be taken without the full 
cooperation and consent of the colombian government that no 
blockade was ever contemplated and that he had not authorized 
naval maneuvers as incorrectly described in the press according 
to a statement by white house spokesman roman popadiuk 
last week white house press secretary marlin fitzwater 
confirmed the united states would undertake steppedup interdiction 
efforts but would not specifically comment on a blockade 
the intensified controversy arose over the weekend when 
colombian press reports said two navy ships the guidedmissile 
cruiser uss virginia and the aircraft carrier uss john f kennedy 
were steaming toward colombia to begin the blockade 
administration officials insisted those ships which had sailed 
from norfolk va thursday were merely undertaking routine 
maneuvers in the atlantic 
they said bush had not yet agreed to any increased interdiction 
plan and discussions were still pending with colombia 
one source said however the kennedy was selected to lead the 
seaborne antidrug effort off colombia if and when a decision is 
made to undertake the effort 
another official said on wednesday that the reports created a 
furor because no definite decision had actually been made before 
the news reports and the colombians believed they had not been 
informed 
there are certain political sensitivities you want to hear 
about it directly and not hear about it in the newspapers said 
the official speaking on condition of anonymity 
the source said consultations with the colombians over 
increasing navy involvement in drug interdiction were now on a 
back burner although other cooperative antidrug efforts were 
still being discussed 
that includes the feb 15 drug summit in colombia to be attended 
by bush barco and the presidents of peru and bolivia a 
preliminary meeting to draft communiques and agreements for the 
participants to sign is currently going on in santa cruz bolivia 
the matter was particularly sensitive for bush coming after he 
was criticized by latin american nations for the dec 20 invasion 
of panama 
officials said reports of further military action off colombia 
even though part of the antidrug effort revived concerns about the 
us historical heavyhandedness toward its southern neighbors 
bush in his telephone call explained that the us had 
intended a cooperative effort with colombia that could compliment 
president barcos courageous and determined effort to break up the 
narcotics cartels and bring traffickers to justice the white 
house said 
the two presidents agreed it was most unfortunate that 
inaccurate and confusing reports of tentative us proposals for 
cooperation with the colombian government had created such a false 
impression popadiuk said in his statement 
barco according to the statement told bush he regretted the 
erroneous press stories and said he always knew that president 
bush would never approve actions which impinged on colombian 
sovereignty

astronomers at the us naval observatory 
are narrowing their solar system search for a 10th planet a 
mysterious phantom giant that has long captured the speculation 
and interest of stargazers 
speculation about the existence of another planet evolved 
because something perhaps a massive object orbiting the sun on the 
outer edge of the solar system is giving a gravitational nudge 
that disrupts the predicted orbits of uranus and neptune said 
astronomer rs harrington 
we are still incapable of predicting the location of uranus 
harrington said wednesday its clear something is wrong in the 
outer solar system 
astronomers have theorized since the beginning of the century 
that some additional planets existed beyond the orbits of neptune 
the theory sprang from observations that uranus failed to orbit the 
sun with the majestic and mathematical symmetry experts expected 
that led to a search that resulted in the 1930 discovery of 
pluto the ninth known planet in the solar system further 
searching revealed in 1978 that a moon was orbiting pluto 
but harrington said calculations later showed the combined mass 
of pluto and its moon are about 1000 times too small to account 
for the detected but unexplained irregularity of the neptune and 
uranus orbits 
something is there and weve got to look harrington said 
some astronomers have attributed the abnormal orbit of uranus 
and neptune to errors in calculation 
however harrington said a model of the solar system created by 
the jet propulsion laboratory which guided the voyager spacecraft 
near both uranus and neptune still is not consistent with recent 
observations on the position of uranus he said the jpl data seemed 
to be in agreement for a time but new observations show uranus is 
deviating from the expected path 
our current evidence is that the data is still off he said 
we still do not understand the outer solar system 
a search for planet x is under way in washington the main 
office of the naval observatory and at the black birch astrometric 
observatory near blenheim new zealand 
harrington said the search has been narrowed using a computer a 
number of theoretical 10planet solar systems were simulated in a 
naval observatory computer to determine where planet x had to be to 
produce the effects seen on the orbits of uranus and neptune 
that relatively small area of the heavens will be searched in 
april and may by an astrographic telescope at black birch the 
telescope will take pictures of the target area on successive 
nights and the photos will be sent to washington for study 
harrington said he would use a machine called the blink 
comparator to look for the phantom planet a blink comparator 
flashes back and forth between two photo plates causing an 
apparent motion to the observer if any point of light in the twin 
photos has changed position from one night to the next 
planet x harrington said is thought to be three to five times 
larger than earth and moving in an orbit about three times farther 
from the sun than neptune or pluto that would make the phantom 
planet about as visible as pluto a planet seen only by 
sophisticated telescopes 
a planet in such a distant orbit would take about 1000 years to 
circle the sun 
even with the new techniques harrington said he was far from 
certain that planet x will be found 
i have no better than a 5050 confidence level that this thing 
is there he said 
harrington discussed the planet x search on the opening day of 
the 175th national meeting of the american astronomical society

governors of three states that have little 
pollution are complaining that states with dirty air are trying to 
take advantage of subsidies for cleaning up their power plants 
while enjoying low electric rates 
they can do like we have clean up and still be 
economically viable minnesota gov rudy perpich cochairman of 
the alliance for acid rain control said wednesday 
the group released a study saying that threefourths of the 25 
utilities targeted for the largest reductions in the first phase of 
a cleanup proposed by president bush had electric rates below the 
national average in 1987 
sixty percent of the 25 utilities had rates at least 10 percent 
below the average and one companys rates were 75 percent below the 
average the group said twenty percent had rates above the 
average the highest by a margin of 12 percent 
the 25 utilities are located in 11 midwestern and southern 
states the study used a composite of industrial commercial and 
residential rates for comparisons 
the alliance describes itself as a nationwide organization of 
governors academics environmentalists and business executives 
the governors tend to come from lowpolluting states 
bush proposed cutting sulfur dioxide emissions a major cause of 
acid rain by 10 million tons nationwide by the year 2000 this 
would represent a reduction of about 43 percent from the estimated 
total of more than 23 million tons a year 
his plan which is expected to go to the senate floor later this 
month would force states with the highest emissions to pay the 
largest share of the cleanup costs highpollution states worried 
about a potential loss of jobs want to spread the costs around 
which would result in cleaner states paying more 
were paying for california and texas to bail out the sampls 
but they dont want to pay for their share of the sulfur dioxide 
emissions in the country said rep philip sharp dind in 
response to the study 
sharp whose home state is a major sulfur dioxide polluter is 
chairman of the energy and power subcommittee of the house energy 
and commerce committee the subcommittee is considering a house 
version of the presidents plan 
sulfur dioxide and other emissions turn into acids high in the 
atmosphere and can fall as acid rain fog or snow up to several 
hundreds of miles downwind environmentalists blame this acidity 
for the destruction of aquatic life in lakes and streams and some 
say it is responsible for the death of red spruce forests at high 
altitudes in the east 
costsharing plans being advanced in congress would raise 
electric rates 2 a month nationwide according to the alliance 
perpich and the governors of wisconsin and wyoming said power 
plants in their states had taken extensive steps to reduce sulfur 
dioxide emissions 
the nations 10 dirtiest power plants produce more than half the 
nations sulfurdioxide emissions but they have invested only 29 
billion in airpollution controls less than a fifth of the 164 
billion spent nationwide according to the alliances study

the jarvik artificial heart which once 
stirred hope for critically ill heart patients is being recalled 
because of serious deficiencies with the way the device is 
manufactured 
the food and drug administration withdrew approval for all uses 
of the artificial heart in humans because of problems in quality 
control monitoring of research sites training of workers and 
reports of adverse reactions in patients an agency spokesman said 
wednesday 
the agency felt the deficiencies were great enough that risks 
to patients were outweighing benefits said fda spokesman jeff 
nesbit 
symbion inc of tempe ariz had received fda approval allowing 
its artificial heart to be used experimentally both as a permanent 
artificial heart and as a temporary bridge for people awaiting a 
human heart transplant 
approvals for both uses of the artificial heart were revoked as 
was the companys approval for an acute ventricular assist device 
the companys designation for its artificial heart formerly 
known as the jarvik7 is the symbion j7 the developer dr robert 
jarvik is no longer associated with symbion 
while symbion sold the only approved permanent artificial heart 
other companies have approvals for devices that are used as 
temporary bridges 
the jarvik7 made of plastics fibers and metal was first used 
seven year ago amid much excitement when it was implanted in a 
dying heart patient named barney clark 
fda conducted two inspections of symbions facilities last year 
and found some serious deficiencies nesbit said some 
aspects of manufacturing quality were found to be poor enough to 
endanger patients he said and that the company had failed to 
report unexpected adverse events to the fda as required 
he said the agency also found research sites were not being 
monitored properly and that servicing of equipment and training of 
personnel was inadequate 
symbion had received approval to implant its permanent heart in 
as many as seven people as part of a continuing experiment 
nesbit said the company could discuss the problems with the fda 
and correct them but he declined to say how likely it was that the 
fda would reconsider its decision 
the letter was sent to the company on monday 
symbion issued a statement saying it had received the fda notice 
and would release further information at the appropriate time 
last week a 57yearold missouri woman who held the record for 
living the longest on an artificial heart before receiving a human 
heart transplant died of a heart attack carolyn stadler of st 
charles had lived 440 days with the artificial heart before 
receiving a human heart her second last fall 
there have been only a handful of artificial hearts used in 
humans and recipients have been plagued by clotting and strokes 
interest in the artificial heart remains high because experts 
believe 20000 to 75000 americans could use a transplant but 
there are not enough donors in 1988 there were 1630 transplants 
in the united states

drink for drink women get drunker than men now 
scientists believe they know why men have more stomach for booze 
a study published today found that men typically make higher 
amounts of a substance that breaks down alcohol in the stomach 
before it reaches the bloodstream as a result men feel fewer 
effects of alcohol even when men and women the same size drink the 
same amount 
i am convinced that there are sex differences in handling 
alcohol commented dr judith gavaler of the university of 
pittsburgh this is a very important study for all of us doing 
research in alcohol this will change the way we approach this 
subject 
researchers said the study also underscores concerns about 
drinking during pregnancy provides an explanation on the effects 
of drinking on an empty stomach and could be used to help set safe 
drinking levels for men and women 
the implication of this is that when it comes to social 
drinking women should be more careful than men for a given amount 
of alcohol when driving or operating equipment said dr charles 
s lieber a coauthor of the study 
lieber director of the alcohol research and treatment center at 
the bronx veterans affairs medical center said the findings also 
help explain why women alcoholics are especially prone to liver 
disease 
the study conducted on 20 men and 23 women was directed by dr 
mario frezza of the university school of medicine in trieste 
italy and published in the new england journal of medicine 
it found that women absorb about onethird more alcohol into 
their blood than men do the researchers believe this is largely 
explained by the fact that nonalcoholic women produce about 30 
percent less of the protective substance than nonalcoholic men do 
heavy drinking seems to hinder the bodys ability to make the 
substance an enzyme called alcohol dehydrogenase while alcoholic 
men produce less than social drinkers the difference was most 
dramatic in alcoholic women they make virtually none 
in alcoholic women there is for all practical purposes no 
gastric protection anymore said lieber therefore when an 
alcoholic woman drinks alcohol she has the same blood level as 
when she is given that amount of alcohol intravenously this may 
explain what is already known that womenare much more susceptible 
than men to alcoholic liver disease 
in an accompanying editorial drs steven schenker and k 
vincent speeg of the university of texas at san antonio called the 
results exciting they said the theory may explain at least in 
part the higher risk in women of harmful effects of alcohol 
another researcher dr david van theil of the university of 
pittsburgh agreed i think its an important observation that 
suggests that alcohol metabolism in the stomach is different 
between men and women and as a result there are differences in 
potential toxicity for men and women 
the study also gives an explanation for another bit of popular 
drinking wisdom why people feel fewer effects of alcohol if they 
drink on a full stomach 
if they drink when their bellies are empty the alcohol passes 
quickly through the stomach into the small intestine where it is 
absorbed into the bloodstream however when the stomach is full 
alcohol stays in the stomach longer so the enzyme has more time to 
work on it 
dr domenic ciraulo of new england medical center said the 
findings also underscore concerns about drinking durring pregnancy 
the findings suggest that the amount of alcohol reaching the fetus 
may be higher than previously thought 
even at low levels alcohol may not be safe at all he said

hungary poland and czechoslovakia are 
discussing a proposal to link in a freemarket arrangement 
economies long stifled by communist controls and lack of access to 
western markets and capital 
the plan to create an independent trade bloc of the three 
countries that are peacefully casting off oneparty communist rule 
is still tentative and there are formidable barriers 
first they must redefine their membership in the sovietled 
trading organization comecon which is now grappling with a 
complete overhaul 
comecon could by 1991 be trading in hard currency and at world 
market prices abandoning trade relationships that ignored free 
market mechanisms and were based on the nonconvertible soviet 
ruble 
planning officials from hungary poland and czechoslovakia used 
this weeks comecon summit in sofia for first consultations 
wednesday on their plan for closer integration 
they kept mum about results but officials from all three 
countries aware of the looming potential of a confederated east 
and west germany have openly advocated closer cooperation among 
comecon countries of a similar size and economic development 
hungarian deputy premier peter medgyessy envisions integration 
of the hungarian polish and czechoslovak economies beginning with 
a free trade agreement followed by joint trade policy decisions 
free flow of capital and labor harmonized financial systems and a 
convertible accounting unit 
hungary was once a lonely longdistance runner in its 
criticisms of comecon but we have become more numerous he told 
a news conference tuesday 
we think in the same way he said of the three countries 
czechoslovakia and hungary boast two of the more successful 
economies in eastern europe and poland has become a pioneer in 
freemarket reforms 
polands tadeusz mazowiecki eastern europes only noncommunist 
premier spoke of trying new solutions in his sofia speech to 
the council of mutual economic assistance as comecon is formally 
known 
a smaller group of countries could form an economic 
laboratory to test the freemarket reforms and economic 
integration he suggested 
both are sorely needed by the blocs stagnant centrallyplanned 
economies badly ailing 41 years after comecon was created by josef 
stalin as a means for exploiting soviet client states and keeping 
them in the fold 
czechoslovakia poland and hungary backed each other solidly in 
sofia according to delegates to the closeddoor meetings 
while delegates from other countries agreed only that the bloc 
wasnt working and needed an overhaul the three put forward 
concrete proposals 
czechoslovakia said before the sofia summit that comecon faced 
extinction if it didnt adopt reforms and promptly presented a 
draft of new rules to members for approval 
countering a soviet proposal that comecons own executive 
committee should discuss changes poland recommended an adhoc 
commission of two members from each delegation 
the suggestion was accepted but its unclear whether the 
commission will make decisions within two to three months and 
swiftly present them to another summit comecon agreed only that 
its next summit will take place in budapest but rejected pragues 
push for a promise it would convene before june 
close cooperation between budapest prague and warsaw the 
latter have already worked out a new exchange agreement for their 
own trade could leave lessdeveloped comecon members and even 
the soviet union far behind in the economic race 
members of east germanys delegation in sofia said comecon 
reforms should not be detrimental to any members for years east 
berlin has profited from special trade and credit lines to west 
germany advantages not enjoyed by any other comecon member 
but romania bulgaria and noneuropean comecon members cuba 
mongolia and vietnam could miss the reform train because theyre 
unable or unwilling to make radical advances 
romania couldnt possibly have any reservations concerning the 
desire of two or three countries to organize such a circle said 
lilian poida a comecon delegate from romania whose people ousted 
and executed dictator nicolae ceausescu just last month 
we are no longer dependent on ideology or constrained by 
economic models and welcome any move to stimulate trade she said 
but she couldnt say how romania would react if such a system 
were implemented in the near future as romanias impoverished 
economy will not be able to liberalize soon and could get left 
behind 
emerging from communist central planning and dependence on the 
soviet union will not be easy for the three pioneers either they 
are well aware that four decades of squashed initiative 
discouraged productivity skewed production and drained hard 
currency reserves are a powerful brake on progress 
reasonable cooperation can only start with stable economies 
said vladimir dlouhy czechoslovak deputy prime minister 
we will have to think carefully before entering into close 
cooperation with a country that has tripledigit inflation he 
said referring to poland 
also poland and hungary together owe at least 50 billion to 
foreign creditors czechoslovakias foreign debt by contrast is 
much more modest at around 7 billion 
medgyessy suggested that one way around the problem could be 
help from the world bank or international monetary fund 
but its not clear whether czechoslovakia would risk its 
potentially good credit rating with these institutions where it 
is applying for membership for the sake of cooperation with 
poland and hungary

constanta palulescu patted her blue 
shopping bag and said with a delighted smile i have bought meat 
from holland 
ms palulescu and other romanians are discovering nearly three 
weeks after the revolution that toppled dictator nicolae ceausescu 
that daily life has been changed by simple things like good 
imported meat oranges and bananas heat in their homes and 
newspapers that actually contain news 
that does not mean bucharest has become a consumers paradise 
people have to stand in line to buy many items including bread 
meat cigarettes and newspapers 
in the citys dristor sector a neighborhood of endless rows of 
10story concrete apartment buildings a clerk in an appliance 
store wore a scarf over her ears and a fur hat to ward off the 
chill inside the store 
but elena lazerecu a worker in the romanian mint said the 
government was turning up the heat in homes which often were 
iceboxes under ceausescu and his harsh economic policies 
we have a bit of heating a bit of hot water and happiness 
said mrs lazerecu a 34yearold mother of twoshe also noted that 
although there were still lines at stores they were shorter and 
shoppers did not have to present ration cards for sugar and cooking 
oil 
you just have to wait a half hour or threequarters of an hour 
in line its a lot less she said 
her husband dimitri a 39yearold mechanic said he expected a 
big change in his life from the provisional governments promise to 
shorten the work week from six to five days 
i will have time to be with my family to take a walk he 
said 
laura apostolou a curlyhaired 16yearold said she thought 
the most important change since ceausescus regime was overthrown 
dec 22 was in what romanians had learned about their country 
in the press television radio everything is more open 
she said 
holding a newspaper in her hand miss apostolou noted that 
before the revolt few people read the governmentrun papers now 
many wait in line to buy them 
under ceausescu we had lines for meat now we have lines for 
newspapers she said 
miss apostolou who hopes to become an economist said she also 
expected changes in her high school classes 
we used to study a lot of marxism she said in history 
we had to study whatever congresses he held 
miss apostolou and many romanians say he or him to 
refer to ceausescu who was executed christmas day along with his 
wife elena for grave crimes including genocide 
for many the taste of freedom has only raised expectations for 
more openness 
in dristor on icy sidewalks below the bulky concrete apartment 
buildings people talk about their hopes to be able to travel 
abroad freely to have foreign magazines and newspapers 
under ceausescu it was illegal to bring a radio into romania 
typewriters had to be registered so authorities could track any 
dissident writings peoples passports were kept by the police who

the effects of brain damage caused by childhood 
lead exposure linger into adulthood and may be an important reason 
why teenagers have trouble in school researchers report today 
the 11year study which followed a group of massachusetts 
students through their school years found that those who had been 
exposed to lead early in life have trouble reading and finishing 
high school 
while other studies have shown that lead causes mental 
impairment in childhood the latest work demonstrates that 
youngsters fail to outgrow these problems 
we think this study the longest followup on record shows 
that the effects of lead are permanent and are reflected in 
reallife success said dr herbert l needleman of the 
university of pittsburgh 
for young adults their main task is getting an education 
this study shows that they have a seven times higher rate of not 
graduating from high school and a six times higher rate of reading 
disability after early childhood lead exposure 
exposure to lead which now comes mainly from old paint and 
water pipes also was linked with low grades poor coordination and 
high absenteeism among other problems during the teenage years 
what it means to me needleman said is that a pretty 
sizable percentage of school failure in young adults is related to 
early lead exposure 
needlemans study published in the new england journal of 
medicine began with measurements of the lead content of baby teeth 
shed by 132 first and secondgraders in chelsea and somerville 
they were tested in the first and fifth grades and when they 
reached age 19 
childhood exposure to lead has fallen sharply since the early 
1970s when the subjects were babies the improvement has resulted 
largely from the introduction of unleaded gasoline and from removal 
of leadbased paint in houses 
i think in part these data serve as confirmation of the 
wisdom of some of the public health measures taken in the past few 
years to reduce community exposure to lead said coauthor dr 
david bellinger of childrens hospital in boston they serve as 
an indication that we should continue in those efforts 
in the study doctors compared the behavior and school records 
of those with high or low levels of exposure those with high 
exposure were estimated to have had average blood levels of 34 
micrograms per deciliter at the time levels above 30 micrograms 
per deciliter were considered hazardous 
scientists now believe that lead levels are elevated when they 
exceed 10 to 15 micrograms the agency for toxic substances and 
disease registry estimates that 3 million to 4 million american 
children have at least this much lead in their bodies 
lead harms the brain by interferring with the normal growth and 
development of the central nervous system 
despite their school problems the youngsters with highest lead 
exposure were not considered retarded and appeared normal

could be reached in talks slated for monday between soviet leader 
mikhail s gorbachev and former foreign minister shintaro abe

securities co 
the bank of japan has actively sold dollars in the two days to 
support the yen 
market rumors that the federal reserve bank of new york sold the 
dollar for yen wednesday and news of t the resignation of the 
executive vice president and chief financial officer of campeau 
corp and its retailing units federated department stores and 
allied also deepened the markets waitandsee mood kanai said

an apparently impatient secretary of state 
james a baker iii is telling arabs and israelis that other areas 
of the world are clamoring for his attention while they bicker 
about opening mideast peace talks 
the statement issued through spokeswoman margaret d tutwiler 
appeared to be a veiled warning to the two sides to come to terms 
on holding talks here or risk losing us help in mediating their 
dispute 
baker hopes to bring the israeli and egyptian foreign ministers 
to washington soon to discuss holding an election among palestinian 
arabs on the west bank and in gaza 
but sparring over whether the palestine liberation organization 
should have a role has delayed the setting of a date 
there are many other areas in the world clamoring for his 
attention areas where the circumstances are producing change 
tutwiler said we hope to see the same kind of impulse that will 
produce change in the middle east and were prepared to do all we 
can to promote it 
earlier baker talked on the telephone with israeli foreign 
minister moshe arens on monday he spoke with egyptian foreign 
minister esmat abdel meguid

the brief item in the nov 30 city police 
log read forcible rape no weapon governors mansion four boys 
at mansion raped her 
six weeks later what happened at the home of gov george 
mickelson remains a mystery but the investigation has become a 
major topic of discussion throughout this sparsely populated farm 
state 
police and court officials citing a state law that keeps names 
and charges against juveniles secret have refused to discuss their 
investigation into the alleged drinking party among a small group 
of teenagers at the mansion on the night of nov 28 
mickelson has limited his comment to saying the probe is a 
private matter 
the special prosecutor in the case says delinquency petitions 
have been filed against three juveniles but he wont say who they 
are or what laws they allegedly violated 
an 18yearold david ebach has been charged as an adult with 
underage drinking but has yet to appear for a hearing ebach 
starting quarterback on pierres high school football team is a 
friend of the governors 17yearold son david 
despite the secrecy rumors and hints about the investigation 
dominate conversation in the capital city of 12000 people and 
across the state of 700000 many pierre residents know who was at 
the mansion 
a source close to the investigation said a small group of high 
school students including the young mickelson were drinking at 
the mansion while the governor was in washington dc attending a 
us department of agriculture conference and his wife linda was 
in texas on vacation 
david mickelson is the only other permanent resident of the 
gray twostory house across a pond from the capitol 
a school official has confirmed that the alleged rape victim is 
a high school student in fort pierre a small town across the 
missouri river 
mickelson a republican has refused to disclose his sons 
whereabouts on the night of the reported rape or to discuss davids 
possible involvement 
on dec 13 two days after the first news report about the 
allegation mickelson and his wife issued a brief statement 
our family is going through one of the most agonizing times we 
have ever experienced we have always held closely to the principle 
that it is not how you fall that counts the most but how you get 
up and carry on 
the story has been on front pages across the state ever since 
but what details have emerged are sketchy a hearing for the 
juveniles will begin jan 22 with arguments on a defense motion to 
keep the proceedings secret several news organizations oppose the 
motion 
republican politicians have understandably refrained from 
speaking about the case but minority democrats also have been 
restrained 
the issue wont alter work in the legislative session that began 
this week said senate minority leader roger mckellips he said of 
the governor i respect the way hes handled it 
the county prosecutor and local judges bowed out of the case 
which was turned over to special prosecutor craig kennedy a 
democrat from a county 220 miles away 
circuit judge marshall young of rapid city who was named by the 
state supreme court to hear the juvenile cases is a former 
president of the national council of juvenile and family court 
judges and is considered an expert on juvenile law 
sentencing for juveniles in the state can range from probation 
to confinement in the state reform school until age 21 in the case 
of the most serious crimes the prosecutor could ask to have the 
juvenile tried as an adult 
mickelson who took office in 1987 and is expected to run for 
reelection this year is a lawyer and former speaker of the state 
house whose father george t mickelson served as governor from 
19461950 the current governor was 5 years old when his family 
first lived in the mansion

the new government is resisting us 
pressure to change banking secrecy laws to prevent drug traffickers 
from laundering their illgotten profits 
on wednesday the two countries signed an accord on fighting 
drug trafficking which us officials say ousted dictator manuel 
antonio noriega allowed to flourish while he ruled 
but panamanian officials balked at altering banking laws that 
have made their country an international banking center 
they want us to simply open our books and we cannot let them 
do that eduardo lasso valdez president of the bankers 
association told the associated press 
noriega overthrown in last months us invasion is imprisoned 
in miami awaiting trial on drug charges that include laundering 
drug money the new government is led by men elected in may 
balloting that noriega nullified 
the drugfighting agreement covers us assistance to help 
panama structure its agencies to fight drug trafficking exchange 
information investigate and prosecute laundering drug profits and 
destroy drug crops processing sites and laboratories 
the agreement was signed by ramon lima vice minister of 
government and justice and melvin levitsky us assistant 
secretary of state for international narcotics matters 
levitsky said he would recommend that president bush certify 
panama as a nation committed to fighting the drug trade a step 
that would enable panama to get special consideration in trade and 
assistance 
but the two countries remain at odds over the issue of drug 
money laundering 
panamanian bankers insist drug money laundering has never been a 
problem the international banking center with more than 101 
banks is patterned after that of switzerland providing coded 
accounts and protecting confidentiality 
anything we do to affect confidentiality of the system would 
destroy the banking center lasso said we think we have enough 
safeguards now to prevent money laundering 
levitsky disagreed money laundering was an important aspect 
of drug trafficking through panama under noriega he said 
panamanian banks limit to 50000 the amount of cash that an 
individual may deposit at one time and bankers say claims of money 
laundering here were exaggerated 
one banks license was revoked five years ago another bank 
agreed to pay a 5 million fine following us charges it took part 
in money laundering by accepting large transfers from a us bank 
in other developments wednesday the head of immigration under 
noriega left the vatican embassy wednesday and gave up to us 
troops 
belgica de castillo left of her own accord along with her 
husband carlos castillo said the rev joseph spiteri 
panamas new government has said eight former immigration 
officials including mrs castillo were being charged with 
corruption for selling visas and passports 
the castillos sought refuge shortly after the us invasion on 
dec 20 noriega himself was in the embassy for 10 days until his 
jan 3 surrender 
foreign minister julio linares said panamanians linked to 
noriega have taken refuge in the embassies of bolivia ecuador 
peru cuba and the vatican all but the bolivian mission are 
surrounded by us troops 
two of the 12 panamanians in the peruvian embassy were suspects 
in the killing of maj moises giroldi who led an unsuccessful coup 
attempt against noriega on oct 3 said attorney general rogelio 
cruz 
he did not identify them but said panama would tell peru they do 
not qualify for asylum since they are not being persecuted 
politically 
noriegas family is in the cuban embassy linares said panama 
was considering their request for safe conduct to the dominican 
republic but must first decide whether they can be charged with any 
offenses 
the head of noriegas personal security force capt eliezer 
gaytan was still inside the vatican embassy

vice president dan quayle has cautioned 
japans top trade official against a goitalone policy of 
regularizing trade and loans with china 
beijings easing of martial law is a positive development but 
normalcy has not yet been restored after last summers bloody 
crackdown on democracy demonstrations quayle told hikaru matsunaga 
on wednesday according to japanese embassy spokesman noriyuki 
shikata 
the japanese minister of international trade and industry 
planned today to describe to administration economic officials 
japans new program of import incentives to ease its huge trade 
surplus and become an import superpower a goal voiced to 
president bush here last year by visiting prime minister toshiki 
kaifu 
quayle was said to have told matsunaga more action is needed by 
china to ease repression and this requires that the united states 
japan and outside countries coordinate their china policies 
quayle said that the more countries cooperate on china the 
more positive action can be expected from the chinese shikata 
said 
this cooperation should include a common policy on resuming 
multimillion dollar world bank credits to china cut off after the 
midyear upheaval there quayle was quoted by both us and japanese 
officials as saying 
bush continues to stand for free trade as opposed to managed 
trade and import quotas with japan urged by some in congress 
matsunaga was told during an hourlong meeting with michael boskin 
chairman of the presidents council of economic advisers 
protectionist sentiment can be expected however when the us 
trade deficit eases with europe but not with japan shikata said 
boskin told matsunaga 
while the bush administration appreciates the tax incentives and 
tariff cuts of the import superpower program us officials 
continue to feel japan needs major structural changes in its system 
of business and distribution favoring established domestic 
producers boskin was quoted as saying 
for its part he added the united states is trying to make some 
of the changes urged by japan at the two countries ongoing 
structural talks these include boosting the low us savings rate 
reducing the budget deficit and improving the educational system 
shikata quoted him as saying 
matsunaga told quayle and boskin the structural talks would 
resume after japans parliamentary elections in february the 
minister said he is optimistic kaifus liberal democratic party 
would retain its lower house majority said an administration 
official who insisted on anonymity 
the minister planned to leave friday for tokyo after meetings 
thursday with secretary of state james baker iii commerce 
secretary robert mosbacher us trade representative carla hills

design flaws left a school cafeteria wall 
too weak to withstand a windstorm that toppled it onto dozens of 
children two months ago killing nine a state report concluded 
the report said the states school districts must take a closer 
look at their building designs and at how they warn schools about 
approaching bad weather 
we are determined to learn whatever we can from this awful 
experience state education commissioner thomas sobol said 
following wednesdays release of the report by the states disaster 
preparedness commission on the nov 16 collapse at east coldenham 
elementary school in newburgh 
sobol said he will push for a new state law requiring periodic 
inspections of schools and will toughen the education departments 
reviews of new school construction 
the storm struck the school with 100 mph winds blowing down a 
55footlong by 25foothigh wall consisting of a masonry structure 
surrounded by a series of metalframed windows 
nine children who were eating lunch were killed in the hail of 
brick concrete and glass fifteen students were injured 
this wall unfortunately was not adequately designed said 
richard tomasetti an engineer hired by the state to investigate 
tomasetti said the masonry was not supported by lateral or 
vertical bracing and was not tested for strength when the school 
was built in 1959 a state building code requiring such bracing did 
not apply to schools it now does 
the states office of professional discipline is investigating 
the schools architect john clark of hyde park sobol said 
clark was not in his office wednesday afternoon and was 
unavailable for comment he repeatedly has refused to respond to 
reporters questions since the disaster 
a lawyer for six of the dead children and 13 of the injured 
youngsters has filed a notice of claim that he intends to sue clark 
and the valley central school district he said the report helps 
the families cases 
this is not an act of god lawyer howard finkelstein said 
god did not build the wall there are human failings that took 
place for which someone is going to be responsible 
david worby attorney for the valley central school district 
said criticism of the district was unjustified he said state 
officials approved the construction and never let the district know 
it was unsafe 
we the school are teachers we are not builders or 
architects or engineers or state inspectors we are in that school 
teaching if there was a problem and a danger and we were supposed 
to be warned we were not he said 
the national weather service termed the storm a tornado weather 
experts hired by the state concluded that it was a strong 
downburst of wind the commission chairman dr david axelrod 
said the damaging effect of the winds was the same regardless of 
the type of storm 
he said weather warnings had been conveyed to local school 
districts through both the state police and state education 
officials but none reached the school 
axelrod also said there is some question what effect the 
warnings would have had he said school officials might have sent 
more students to the cafeteria under the mistaken impression it was 
safe

khmer rouge guerrillas claimed today 
that they launched new attacks and seized villages near cambodias 
secondlargest town after shelling it last week 
khmer rouge army radio said that after smashing strategic 
government positions near battambang on friday and saturday the 
guerrillas continued attacks along the sangke river in the east 
battambang town battlefield 
it claimed the guerrillas liberated 38 villages killed or 
wounded government soldiers and freed 65 commune and village 
officials 
another broadcast said that on sunday and tuesday guerrillas 
attacked a sixmile stretch from varin to sre noy in siem reap 
province which borders battambang province 
the reports could not be verified and previous such claims have 
proved exaggerated 
the khmer rouge is the largest of three guerrilla groups 
fighting the vietnaminstalled government its recent advances have 
spread fears of a return to power of the group that massacred 
cambodians during its 3year rule of terror and famine before 
vietnam invaded in late 1978 
a phnom penh newspaper editor who has close contacts with the 
government said wednesday that fighting in the battambang area was 
limited to villages six to nine miles away 
the city was quiet wednesday said khieu kanharith reached by 
telephone 
the government radio has said troops repelled up to 200 
guerrillas who attacked through four suburbs of the town at 
midnight friday to try to blow up a bridge 
also khieu confirmed that several plastic explosives went off 
in the streets of phnom penh on friday and saturday the eve of 
national day but said there were no injuries or damage 
he denied khmer rouge claims that grenades were used and that 
the blasts had forced president heng samrin to flee to vietnam 
which says it pulled its last troops out of cambodia in september 
the guerrillas also had claimed the explosions killed or wounded 
some vietnamese and others near an office of the communist party 
in new delhi an indian foreign ministry spokesman said 
wednesday the indian mission in phnom penh did not mention the 
reported flight of the leaders and certainly would have if it was 
true 
indonesias foreign minister ali alatas a main organizer of 
past cambodian peace talks met wednesday in bangkok with leaders 
of the three guerrilla groups to try to revive the peace process 
but gave no indication of progress 
under most detailed review is australias proposal for an 
interim un authority in cambodia 
the governments spk news agency said that at talks in cambodia 
this week premier hun sen and australian envoy michael costello 
agreed to the central idea that the united nations should be 
involved in the interim administration of cambodia in the period 
leading up to free and fair elections but that the guerrillas 
had to give up the cambodian seat they hold at the united nations 
they recognized that such involvement could take many forms and 
that detailed negotiations would be required said the report dated 
monday and seen in bangkok today 
prince norodom sihanouk who heads the guerrilla coalition has 
said he would agree to the resistance vacating the un seat if the 
resistance and hun sen governments were simultaneously dismantled 
and replaced by the un authority

the portrayal of mexican law enforcement in 
the nbc miniseries drug wars was unfair and statements 
following the broadcast that drug corruption is entrenched in 
mexico are inaccurate the government says 
president carlos salinas de gortari considers the fight 
against drugs a national priority mexicos foreign ministry said 
in a statement wednesday 
the television miniseries a dramatization of the 1985 slaying 
in mexico of us drug enforcement administration agent enrique 
camarena was broadcast sunday through tuesday nights 
lloyd siegel executive producer for special broadcasts at nbc 
news said the mexican embassy in washington had declined to have a 
representative interviewed for one of the 15minute news segments 
that followed the program each night 
nonetheless siegel said mexicos efforts to combat drug 
trafficking especially in the last year were praised in other 
interviews and the networks reporting was accurate 
gustavo gonzalez legal adviser to the mexican embassy said 
mexican officials declined to be interviewed partly because they 
were apprehensive that any statements they made could be used by 
attorneys representing the men charged with camarenas murder 
the camarena case caused a major increase in tensions between 
the united states and mexico because of accusations that mexican 
law enforcement officials were in league with the killers helped 
cover up the crime and permitted suspects to escape 
the salinas administration which took office on dec 1 1988 
has tried to reduce tensions by making a strong effort to fight 
drug trafficking and focusing the usmexico relationship on 
economic matters 
president bush and other us officials have praised the 
approach 
the foreign ministry noted that camarenas killers were 
sentenced to long prison terms last month in guadalajara where 
camarena was the local dea agent 
the mastermind rafael caro quintero was given a 40year 
sentence for the killing and a 34year sentence for other 
drugrelated crimes there is no parole in mexico for drugrelated 
crimes 
the government of mexico has reiterated its conviction that 
narcotics trafficking is an international crime that must be fought 
on a multilateral level said the foreign ministry 
underscoring the point the attorney generals office announced 
wednesday that 13 men had been arrested for attempting to smuggle 
1650 pounds of cocaine to houston the men were presented to the 
press with the seized cocaine two ar15 and two ak47 assault 
rifles 
the attorney generals office said the group had planned to fly 
the cocaine into the united states from a clandestine airstrip in 
northern mexico caro quintero pioneered the colombiamexicous 
smuggling route known as the trampoline 
the salinas administration has played down the possible effect 
of the longanticipated miniseries on usmexico relations saying 
the american audience would recognize it as a dramatization and 
fictionalization of events 
it is part of the ratings wars not the drug wars said 
agustin barrios gomez mexicos consul general in new york 
but in washington ambassador gustavo petricioli protested some 
statements made during the news segments 
the statement said an assertion was made on the program that 
mexico is just like panama and that drug corruption is deep and 
pervasive 
likewise we categorically deny statements lacking of any 
evidence that top mexican officials are involved in drug 
trafficking and that corruption goes to the highest level of the 
mexican government the statement said 
like other nbc programs drug wars appeared in english on 
mexico city cable systems

washington were beginning to recede on the plains west of the 
cascade mountains late wednesday bad weather also was blamed for 
two deaths in oregon since a series of storms smashed ashore last

as they braced for the rivers to crest at harbors edge today and 
friday

burlington northern and amtrak trains 
motorists were able to take a 60mile detour around the i5 
closure but heavy trucks had to make a 100mile detour through 
eastern washington 
the worst flooding was in centralia a community of about 
11000 where the chehalis river crested 84 feet above flood stage 
by noon wednesday and was not expected to fall below flood stage 
until noon friday the national weather service said

sandbags fire chief chuck newbury said wednesday morning its 
just threatening property at the moment we dont foresee any 
lifethreatening problems

to deal with flood damage in lewis county which surrounds 
centralia 
the state emergency services department said damage in king 
county around seattle could run 4 million damage estimates for 
other affected counties were not immediately available 
the flooding followed four days of winds and heavy rain rains 
eased or stopped wednesday and the weather service predicted only 
scattered showers for the next few days

as floodwaters receded residents began cleaning up millions of 
dollars in damage

some roads 
in nehalem a coastal town of 240 people about 75 miles west of 
portland the water level dropped from 2 feet to less than 1 foot 
as the tide began receding wednesday afternoon

two japanese men who fought for their 
country in world war ii and then took up arms with malaysian 
communist guerrillas for more than 40 years were on their way home 
today 
shigeyuki hashimoto 71 and kiyoaki tanaka 77 flew to bangkok 
today from the southern thai town of hat yai near the malaysian 
jungle border they left after the communist insurgency was 
disbanded in december 
japanese reporters who accompanied the men quoted them as saying 
they joined the communist party of malaysia to help the country 
gain independence from britain 
independence came in 1957 but the insurgency continued the two 
japanese did not want to surrender before the party was disbanded 
because they feared that would hurt its morale the reporters said 
they said they never forgot about japan and had wished to go 
back since the beginning said hiroshi inomata first secretary 
at the japanese embassy 
but the time was not ripe for them to do that they didnt 
want to surrender now that the peace agreement has been made they 
are free to go 
tanaka said there are many good things and many bad thing 
about the years they spent in the jungle inomata said they 
had many good friends who were quite cooperative and trusted each 
other they said they will miss their friends and they promised to 
write letters 
they said they are happy to be going home but i think they 
might have some uneasiness as well he said 
the japanese reporters said the two who joined the communists 
in 1945 after serving in japans imperial army knew of the 
enormous changes in japan since world war ii from their shortwave 
radio 
the japanese left the former communist headquarters in the 
jungle on wednesday and went to a military camp in hat yai there 
hashimoto was met by two younger brothers and tanaka by a daughter 
and his nephew 
they also had a party with their former comrades before leaving 
hat yai the reporters said 
hashimoto arrived at bangkok airport in a wheelchair clutching 
a walking stick and appearing very fragile tanaka also had a 
walking stick 
japanese embassy officials helped hashimoto out of the 
wheelchair and into a limousine for the ride to a hospital for a 
checkup along with tanaka 
they were to leave for japan on saturday 
hashimoto from kanagawa prefecture adjoining tokyo is to stay 
at a hospital in tokyo because of his high blood pressure while 
tanaka will return to his hometown in kumamoto prefecture in 
southern japan an embassy official said he said tanakas wife was 
still alive 
the embassy official hirofumi takemoto said the two men had 
worked for a private japanese company in malaysia before they 
joined the japanese army during world war ii 
the communist insurgency one of the worlds longest 
officially ended with the signing dec 2 of a peace accord between 
the insurgents and thai and malaysian officials 
british commonwealth forces fought bloody battles with the 
insurgents during what was known as the 19481960 emergency 
fighting continued after that on a lesser scale and the two 
japanese told reporters they engaged in combat in the 1960s 
thaimalaysian military strikes and a thai amnesty badly hurt 
the movement and its leader chin peng said only 1200 guerrillas 
had been operating along the 375mile thaimalaysian frontier in 
recent years

the us supreme courts decision 
overturning fines against four city councilmen who defied a federal 
judges housing desegregation order was hailed by the mayor as a 
triumph for democracy 
but naacp officials said wednesdays 54 ruling by the nations 
highest court had no effect on the desegregation order itself and 
that portraying it as such would be a cruel hoax 
three of the councilmen gathered at city hall to celebrate the 
decision with pink champagne 
its one helluva way to kick off the new year said 
councilman peter chema one of the four whose defiance of us 
district leonard sands order in august 1988 put this city of 
195000 just north of new york city on the brink of bankruptcy 
its a triumph for democracy said mayor henry spallone a 
former councilman who became mayor last november by defeating the 
incumbent who supported sands order 
naacp attorney michael sussman however said portraying the 
high courts ruling as a way to avoid building 1000 units of 
courtordered low and moderateincome housing would represent a 
cruel hoax and false hope 
the national association for the advancement of colored people 
is one of the plaintiffs in the decadelong desegregation case 
the supreme courts decision as disappointing as it may be 
has absolutely no effect on the original yonkers remedy order 
issued by judge sand naacp executive director benjamin hooks 
said in a statement from the organizations baltimore headquarters 
that remains unaffected and represents the culmination of nine 
years spent in court by the naacp facing the recalcitrant city of 
yonkers 
construction on the first 200 units of lowincome housing was to 
begin within the next two months 
attorneys for the councilmen said it was unknown what action 
they would take in light of the decision sussman was confident 
construction would begin and said the rest of the plan was being 
reworked 
the supreme court said sand exceeded his authority in imposing 
the fines chief justice william h rehnquist said sand acted too 
hastily in holding the councilmen in contempt 
rehnquist said the judge should have waited to see whether 
sands contempt ruling against the city succeeded in forcing 
compliance with the judges desegregation order 
in the summer of 1988 sand threatened the councilmen with jail 
and fines and the city with bankruptcy if the council refused to 
obey his orders to build the housing 
council voted 43 against the plan and sand imposed the fines 
with fines nearing 1 million and facing massive layoffs of city 
workers city council reversed itself and voted to comply with 
sands order 
the city paid 189000 in fines and the councilmen paid 3500 
each 
sand ordered the desegregation plan after finding that yonkers 
had for 40 years deliberately concentrated virtually all subsidized 
housing in the southwest section of the city to keep blacks away 
from whites 
in 1980 blacks represented 105 percent of yonkers 195000 
residents 
spallone ran for reelection last year on his record of opposing 
the housing and won decisively as did chema and councilman edward 
fagan 
the fourth defiant councilman nicholas longo lost a close 
election to a prohousing candidate thomas dickerson 
the councilmen said wednesday the ruling vindicated their right 
to vote their conscience and spallone pointed to their successful 
use of the court system 
the decision adds a whole new impetus to continue the fight 
against the housing fagan said who later acknowledged the 
ruling might have little effect 
but its an emotional boost he said we have to review 
other legal maneuvers 
im looking forward to getting my money back he added 
officials said attorneys would review whether a january 1988 
consent decree in which the council agreed to build the housing was 
still binding the vote was taken after sand threatened to fine and 
jail the councilmen

john dale johnny sylvester who became 
the most famous little sick boy in america after babe ruth promised 
to smack a world series homer for him and hit three has died 63 
years later he was 74 
sylvester died monday at a mineola hospital no cause of death 
was given 
in 1926 sylvester was suffering from a serious infection of the 
forehead caused by a kick from a horse when he told his father i 
wish i could see babe ruth wallop a homer before i die 
the family sent telegrams to the new york yankees while they 
were playing in st louis back came an airmail package containing 
two baseballs one autographed by the st louis cardinals the 
other signed by several yankees including ruth who wrote ill 
knock a homer for you on wednesday 
ruth hit three that day in a followup note the day of game 6 
ruth said he would try to knock you another homer maybe two 
today but went homerless he hit one in game 7 but it was not 
enough to prevent the yankees from losing the series in fact ruth 
was caught stealing for the final out 
ruth visited the essex fells nj boy at his bedside after the 
series a meeting at which sylvester remarked im sorry the 
yanks lost 
no miraculous recovery occurred but the visit certainly did no 
harm it took sylvester three years before he fully recovered 
sylvester returned the gesture in 1948 visiting ruth four months 
before the slugger died of cancer 
the 1926 episode later was part of the movie the babe ruth 
story but the screen version stretched the truth by having ruth 
make his home run promise at sylvesters hospital bedside the boy 
apparently was never hospitalized 
earlier in the 1942 movie the pride of the yankees 
hollywood had stretched the tale even further with a promise of two 
home runs by lou gehrig 
sylvester served in the navy in world war ii and was later 
president of amscomatic inc a manufacturer of packing machinery 
he is survived by his son john jr a sister ruth elliott of 
barrington ri and a brother horace c sylvester jr of 
osterville mass

the us attorney said he will investigate any 
allegations of civil rights violations stemming from the probe into 
the shooting of charles stuart and his pregnant wife carol 
im not at this point suggesting that they exist only that if 
there are allegations or complaints well be willing to review 
them us attorney wayne budd said wednesday 
stuart who was white told police in october that a black man 
jumped in their car after he and his wife left a childbirth class 
robbed them and shot them last week stuart was implicated by his 
brother and apparently committed suicide the next day 
budd met for nearly two hours wednesday with four black and one 
hispanic legislators 
one of them rep shirley owenshicks said residents of the 
predominantly black mission hill section where the shootings were 
reported complained of being illegally searched intimidated and 
having their doors kicked in and having their apartments 
trashed by police 
we are urging any individual in the black community who feels 
their civil rights were violated directly or indirectly to be 
in touch with the us attorney said rep byron rushing 
budd said that to bring federal criminal charges of civil rights 
violations the alleged victims must have suffered physical 
excesses or harm from touching by police 
he said allegations of police harassment not involving touching 
would come under the jurisdiction of the state attorney generals 
office or could be pursued in civil suits

weeks pregnant when the abortion was performed dec 18 at a clinic 
in fact she was in her 26th week the girls lawyer don caulkins 
said wednesday

suffered abdominal cramps and went to a hospital where doctors 
examined her and detected a fetal heartbeat caulkins said 
ms gillespie was taken to vanderbilt university medical center 
where she delivered the 1pound baby in the hallway caulkins said 
the 3weekold girl deangela nicole alexander was in critical 
condition hospital officials said wednesday night

approximately 60 percent said dr frank boehm vanderbilts 
director of obstetrics who delivered the girl

neighbors and strangers jammed a memorial 
service for a family of five who authorities say were shot and 
buried under a barn by a religious cult possibly as a sacrifice 
as about 250 people filled the small brick church wednesday 
night to pay respects to the avery family authorities in southern 
california said they arrested the last two members of the cult 
ending a nationwide manhunt for 13 people accused in the slayings 
law officers stopped a pickup truck about 60 miles northeast of 
san diego and arrested daniel david kraft and kathryn johnson said 
agent james stathes of the us bureau of alcohol tobacco and 
firearms in california 
in kirtland five pink candles burned at the reorganized church 
of jesus christ of latter day saints for 49yearold dennis avery 
his wife cheryl 42 and their three daughters trina 15 
rebecca 13 and karen 7 
four ministers of different denominations addressed the mourners 
the tragedy that has hit us has caused our ordered world to 
collapse for the time being and we will never be the same again 
said the rev bruce morrison a united church of christ pastor 
when unexpected tragedy disrupts our lives in the way in which 
this one has we find ourselves plunged into mystery 
barbara eckart a member of the reorganized church in kirtland 
30 miles east of cleveland said she didnt know the averys because 
they seldom attended services but felt the need to pray for them 
i came to support the congregation and because of the fact 
that it was an unfair thing that happened to them she said i 
feel that they didnt have anybody here 
authorities say the averys moved to kirtland from missouri at 
the urging of a former lay minister of the reorganized church 
jeffrey lundgren and later joined his cult when he broke from the 
church 
the averys were killed apparently in an april 18 ritual 
sacrifice designed to cleanse the cult and allow it to 
relocate authorities said 
the rev dale luffman president of the northeast ohio chapter 
of the reorganized church has said the slayings may have been 
prompted by disputes over money or sex or in an effort to keep the 
averys from leaving the cult 
until april lundgren rented the 15acre farm where the bodies 
were found and where some of his followers had lived investigators 
said it appears the averys who lived nearby and were not as 
fervent as his other followers were shot before the cult headed to 
west virginia and eventually to a farm near holden mo 
the bodies were unearthed last week after police got an 
anonymous tip all five had duct tape across their eyes and some 
had their hands and feet bound with the tape authorities said 
officials in lake county are seeking the extradition of 
lundgren his wife and son and 10 others from california lundgren 
and the others have refused to waive the proceeding which could 
take 90 days officials said 
the cleveland plain dealer reported today that mrs averys 
mother received a short note from her daughter apparently dashed 
off just hours before the five were shot mentioning a planned move 
to wyoming 
the two arrested wednesday kraft 25 of nauvoo ill and 
johnson 36 of holden mo had eluded authorities since the 
arrests of lundgren 39 his wife alice 38 and son damon 19 
at a motel sunday in national city near san diego eight others 
also have been detained 
other cult members implicated lundgren as the triggerman in the 
deaths a federal agent said in documents filed wednesday in el 
cajon municipal court 
also a newspaper reported that lundgren was drawing welfare 
checks in san diego county for almost a month before his capture 
he applied for welfare last month and received 940 in checks at a 
chula vista motel in december and earlier this month the los 
angeles times said 
ohio prosecutor steven latourette said lundgren and his son face 
five counts of aggravated murder if convicted they could face the 
death penalty 
the others face a variety of charges including murder and 
conspiracy to commit murder 
authorities found an assortment of firearms and knives 
thousands of rounds of ammunition a 50caliber rifle gas masks 
and other equipment at two san diegoarea hotels and at a storage 
unit in nearby chula vista 
the reorganized church of jesus christ of latter day saints is 
based in independence mo it has roots and some beliefs in common 
with the salt lake citybased mormon church but is separate

fully paid months after the birth of a child after which they can 
receive 960 a day for three months 
the budget bill presented on wednesday also proposes to 
increase family allowances by 145 to 1083 annually per child 
finance minister kjellolof feldt said however that the 
government could reconsider the plan if unions continue pressing 
for higher wages which rose by about 9 percent last year 
in 1987 75 percent of the paid parental leave was used by 
fathers so this year the budget bill sets aside nearly 500000 
for a campaign to inform fathers about their rights to use the 
social insurance and stay home 
swedens high taxes make it difficult for a family to survive on 
one wage and critics have said the system gives parents no choice 
but to leave small children to often understaffed nurseries 
in another move feldt proposed to check soaring absenteeism by 
stricter control over people who call in sick to work 
the budget presented to parliament on wednesday entailed few 
other changes to swedens generous social welfare system

the head of cbs records responding to 
complaints of antisemitism by a rap group carried by cbs called 
on his employees to make sure that the companys recordings do not 
promote bigotry 
in a memorandum dated wednesday walter yetnikoff did not name 
public enemy the group whose newest record welcome to the 
terrordome has been assailed by jewish groups as antisemitic 
cbs distributes public enemys recordings 
yetnikoff said some recent recordings have stirred strong 
reactions outside and within the industry suggesting that these 
songs validate and promote bigotry and intolerance 
traditionally music has often served as an important sounding 
board for the expression of social criticism and rage and also 
provides an outlet for artists to vent their feelings it goes 
without saying that artists have the right of freedom of 
expression yetnikoff said 
still when the issue is bigotry there is a fine line of 
acceptable standards which no piece of music should cross he 
said the music industry should challenge people to recognize the 
evils of racism bigotry antisemitism and intolerance in any and 
all forms 
in its record public enemy implies that jews crucified jesus 
and claims that it has been crucified for the comments of professor 
griff a nonperforming group member who claimed in a newspaper 
interview that jews were responsible for most of the wickedness in 
the world 
the groups leader chuck d denied that lyrics were 
antisemitic or that the lyrics involved jews at all 
but rabbi abraham cooper associate dean of the simon wiesenthal 
center in los angeles who met with yetnikoff welcomed the memo as 
an important first step for the music industry as a whole 
we hope that this will mark the beginning of a long overdue 
process in which not only cbs records but all major record 
producers will begin to live up to their responsibility of 
combating rather than validating bigotry in america he said 
cooper also has attacked statements by axl rose of guns n roses 
as homophobic and racist cooper said he intended to write a letter 
to david geffen at geffen records guns n roses record company 
challenging him to follow yetnikoffs lead

mayor patrick pasculli says new yorkers who 
claim the empire state is the birthplace of baseball are way off 
base 
pasculli announced wednesday the formation of american baseball 
heritage inc a nonprofit organization formed to pitch this 
milesquare city as baseballs home and lobby nationally for 
baseball day to be celebrated annually june 19 hoboken will 
create a museum to chronicle the contributions of alexander j 
cartwright 
pasculli said the first game of baseball was played on hobokens 
elysian fields during the afternoon of june 19 1846 he credits 
cartwright a surveyor amateur athlete and inventor with 
refining the game 
once and for all were going to destroy the fabrication that 
abner doubleday invented the game and that cooperstown ny was 
its birthplace paculli told a news conference 
new york gov mario cuomo however disagrees 
cuomo signed a bill in april that will allow new yorkers to 
order license plates donning the picture of a ball and the words 
birthplace of baseball 
stephen speiser president of the hoboken group thinks cuomos 
out in left field 
the game really evolved from the british games of cricket and 
rounders speiser said cartwright refined it wrote down the 
rules and umpired the first game he said 
league historians at the hall of fame in cooperstown agree that 
cartwright played an important role early in the game but they say 
new york has a better claim than new jersey by at least a year of 
fielding the first match

california move over florida 
which boasts more vehicles than people has earned the dubious 
title of the car capital of the world 
the state has 128 million residents and 151 million 
vehicles according to the latest statistics from floridas 
department of highway safety and motor vehicles 
california has only 85 vehicles for every 10 people florida 
also leads the nation in new car sales 
some floridians have one car for pleasure and another for work 
tourists want rental cars families buy junkers for teens people 
who winter in florida keep a spare in the state even those who 
might not be able to afford a car need something to get around in 
because of inadequate public transportation 
the biggest thing these numbers say is what a lousy public 
transportation system we have in florida said john degrove of 
the joint center for urban universities 
jd power amp associates a californiabased research firm found 
that floridians buy 8734 new cars for every 1000 people each

a vaccine to protect against lyme disease could 
be available in five years said the inventor of a vaccine that has 
protected laboratory animals against infection 
russell johnson a microbiologist at the university of minnesota 
in minneapolis said negotiations with makers of human vaccines 
should conclude within a month allowing research to apply the 
animal vaccine to humans 
the vaccine was patented by the university of minnesota and its 
use has been licensed to molecular genetics of minneapolis johnson 
said the company is now negotiating with vaccine makers he said 
the vaccine developed in 1986 protects hamsters from infection 
with lyme disease which is spread by ticks said russell johnson 
a microbiologist at the university of minnesota in minneapolis 
a vaccine to protect dogs and other animals against lyme disease 
could be ready for use in a year said johnson development of a 
human vaccine takes longer because of the higher standards such a 
vaccine must meet he said 
johnson said he and his colleagues showed in 1986 that injecting 
dead lyme disease bacteria into hamsters would protect them against 
infection 
last month researchers at the university of wisconsin used a 
slightly different technique to protect hamsters against lyme 
disease they first produced antibodies against lyme disease 
bacteria by injecting the bacteria into a group of hamsters said 
ronald schell director of the research 
they then extracted the antibodies and used them to protect 
another group of hamsters which had been irradiated so that they 
would lose their normal immune systems and would therefore show the 
symptoms of lyme disease 
when hamsters were given the antibodies before being infected 
they developed no sign of disease said ronald schell director of 
the research the finding was announced by the university in 
december and a report appears in the january issue of infection and 
immunity 
schell criticized the federal government for not providing more 
financial support for research on lyme disease 
the state of research for lyme disease is being hampered 
because of the lack of federal support he said we want to get 
rid of the disease and it seems now it might be easier than we 
thought 
lyme disease which is spread by ticks found on deer mice and 
other mammals usually begins with a characteristic bullseye 
rash a red ring around a clear center it causes arthritislike 
inflammation of the joints and can cause damage to the nervous 
system it can usually be treated with antibiotics 
between 1980 and 1988 some 14000 cases were reported in the 
united states according to the us centers for disease control 
the actual numbers may be several times that doctors say 
more than onethird of the cases or about 5000 occurred in 
1988 most cases have been confined to the northeast wisconsin and 
minnesota

earthquakes continued to rumble under 
redoubt volcano and oil producers shut down their platforms amid 
fears the tremors could send floodwaters cascading over an oil 
terminal on the cook inlet 
redoubt has been erupting since middecember sending corrosive 
ash as high as eight miles into the sky and melting glacier ice 
producing muddy torrents of water that have overflowed the banks of 
the drift river 
the drift river storage terminal with 38 million gallons of oil 
stored in its tanks sits on the banks of the inlet in the shadow 
of the volcano 115 miles southwest of anchorage the terminal has 
been closed since tuesday and officials planned to remove most of 
its oil 
redoubts last eruption was monday but seismologists said the 
volcano remains active and that more flooding was possible in 
future eruptions 
the quake activity indicates the volcano is relatively quiet 
for now and it does not appear to be building toward stronger 
eruptive activity geologist steve brantley of the alaska volcano 
observatory said wednesday still a major eruption like mondays 
is possible he said 
ten of the 15 platforms that pull oil from the cook inlet send 
their crude to the drift river terminal for storage with the 
terminal closed eight of the 10 platforms have been forced to shut 
down said bill lamoreaux a regional supervisor with the state 
department of environmental conservation 
the other two platforms are operating at very low volume 
lamoreaux said 
there have been fears the flooding could breach storage tanks 
causing a spill of the dimensions of the march 24 wreck of the 
tanker exxon valdez which released 11 million gallons of north 
slope crude into prince william sound 
harold mouser manager of cook inlet pipe line co which 
operates the terminal said the tanker sansinena was standing by to 
remove the terminals oil as soon as the procedure is ready 
we do not have our equipment operational yet for loading the 
tanker people there are working on it and have been working 
through the night mouser said wednesday 
cook inlet pipeline co and the state agreed tuesday to shut 
down the terminal and remove about 80 percent of the oil 
the terminal probably will not resume operations until the 
company and the state can agree how to operate it safely under the 
continuing threat of redoubt lamoreaux said 
they recognize they had a heck of an inventory of crude oil 
he said the facility sits right on the shoreline of cook inlet 
the tank farm is on the back side but theres nothing to stop it 
if the contents were lost 
ill be feeling a lot better when the total volume is 
reduced 
the production halt could cost the state of alaska some money 
said chuck logsden a petroleum economist with the department of 
revenue the affected fields contributed much of the 233 million 
in royalties alaska collected last year from cook inlet production 
he said

in leather and chains shes cher for the 1990s the 
outspoken oracle of style said of miss jackson who gained 
notoriety when she posed nude for playboy magazine if i had her

blackwell also had unkind words about the sartorial splendor of 
roseanne barr demi moore kim basinger princess anne emily 
lloyd daryl hannah paula abdul and in a tie for 10th madonna 
and sandra bernhard 
the finalists were a parade of terrors that make the joker in

for a baglady 
blackwell reserved special dishonorable mention for singer grace 
jones whom he termed darth vaders sampm fantasy in a martian 
birdcage

a form of blood cancer that strikes children 
appears to be sometimes linked with genetic damage that hinders the 
bodys ability to make interferon according to a study published 
today 
the researchers speculate that genes that oversee the bodys 
production of interferon a diseasefighting substance may play a 
role in warding off the development of cancer 
the researchers speculate that the interferon genes may act as 
regulators that stop the bodys cells from becoming cancerous 
the researchers based at the university of chicago found an 
association between loss of the genes and development of acute 
lymphoblastic leukemia the most common form of childhood leukemia 
they tested 62 patients with this kind of leukemia and found 
that 29 percent of them were missing the interferon genes 
their work directed by dr manuel o diaz was published in the 
new england journal of medicine it adds to the growing list of 
cancers that have been associated with the presence or absence of 
particular genes 
some genes known oncogenes are though to trigger cancer 
cancer can also occur when other genes known as antioncogenes 
are missing 
interferon plays a variety of roles in regulating the bodys 
immune defenses and controlling cell growth 
the production of two forms of interferon known as alpha and 
beta1 are controlled by two genes that are close together on 
chromosome 9 in the bodys library of genes 
in the latest work the researchers found that this section of 
the chromosome was frequently missing in those with acute 
lymphoblastic leukemia however they left open the possibility 
that some other gene in this region besides those that make 
interferon could also be the tumorsuppressing gene 
acute lymphoblastic leukemia accounts for about onequarter of 
all childhood cancers it strikes one in every 30000 children

although nearly four months have passed 
since hurricane hugo smashed into the coast it might as well be 
the morning after for thousands of the rural poor community 
leaders say 
jt mclawhorn jr the president of the columbia urban league 
said the organization recently canvassed 17 of the 24 counties 
declared disaster areas by the federal government 
during the effort financed by a state grant they found 
thousands of people bit is 
still like the day after hugo mclawhorn reporters wednesday 
he urged the federal emergency management agency to extend its 
deadline for applying for disaster aid beyond saturday and called 
on state leaders to develop a comprehensive plan to help victims 
mclawhorn said the state has gone to great lengths to tell the 
world the recovery is under way but that doesnt apply to 
thousands and thousands of poor people 
he said the real test for the recovery is not whether the state 
restores tourism or its beaches but in how well the people of the 
state recover 
if they are worse off after hugo then we have failed he 
said 
hurricane hugo smashed into south carolina on sept 21 its 135 
mph winds caused an estimated 59 billion damage and killed 29 
people in south carolina 
one outreach worker said that in williamsburg county poor 
families are living in homes with gaping holes in the roofs 
jim liles said three families living in stormdamaged homes were 
left homeless when the remainder of the structures burned down 
because of kerosene heaters or faulty electric systems 
some of the rural poor have not applied for fema aid because 
they are iliterate or are suspicious of the government bureaucracy 
said glenice pearson of the urban league 
some she said are living in dilapidated rental structures that 
landlords have shown little inclination to repair she said there 
is no need to keep the fema disaster centers open but people 
should be permitted to continue to apply for aid through state and 
local agencies 
femas deadline already has been extended twice and officials 
say it is unlikely to do so again 
mclawhorn said many hurricane victims think responsibility for 
the recovery rests with fema he said the agency has done a good 
job but the buck for the hugo recovery doesnt stop with fema 
we cant blame fema we individually and collectively are 
going to be held responsible for this recovery he added

communist authorities today gave people unlimited 
access to tiananmen square for the first time since they crushed 
the prodemocracy movement but hundreds of soldiers marched 
through it in a show of force 
the familiar appearance of troops on the huge plaza which 
studentled protesters virtually took over last spring reminded 
beijing residents of the lethal force authorities used to clear it 
in june 
although the government lifted martial law on the city 
wednesday a spokesman said today there will be a small 
increase in troops stationed in the capital and its suburbs 
yuan mu told a news conference the troops were needed to 
safeguard public security and peaceful work of the people he did 
not say how many troops were involved an estimated 150000 moved 
into the city last summer 
more than seven months of martial law in the city ended at 
midnight wednesday in announcing the change premier li peng said 
the decision to order troops to smash the prodemocracy movement 
had been timely necessary and correct 
the lifting of martial law was welcomed in the united states 
britain japan and other western nations that have said normal ties 
cannot be restored until beijing eases what the countries consider 
repressive policies 
however the end of martial law will have little effect on life 
in the city police replaced military guards on beijing streets in 
october and antidemonstration laws remain in effect students also 
remain under heavy surveillance 
chinese citizens had not had free access to tiananmen square 
since june 34 when soldiers killed hundreds of civilians on their 
way to clearing the 100acre plaza of prodemocracy protesters 
the square was closed after the massacre and gradually reopened 
until today soldiers and police had screened all visitors and the 
square was closed at night 
shortly before noon up to 1000 troops camped in the history 
museum on the east side of the square marched across the plaza 
chanting and singing military songs they disappeared into a walled 
compound on the other side of the great hall of the people west of 
tiananmen 
i thought martial law was over said one of the several 
thousand people strolling around tiananmen 
people also watched workmen remove barricades to widen access to 
the square and lined up to have their pictures taken by 
professional photographers back in business for the first time in 
months 
steps to the revolutionary martyrs monument in the center of 
the square students headquarters during their threeweek 
occupation of tiananmen were not open to the public as before two 
armed police stood guard at the monument 
its good that things are back to normal said a women from 
inner mongolia touring the square with her child 
but one middleaged man from nanjing said we dont have happy 
feelings about the lifting of martial law he said people now 
cannot speak out we have to keep things in our hearts 
we havent forgotten the students said a beijing teacher 
premier li in a 10minute speech delivered on national 
television wednesday evening said that by calling in the army last 
spring the government had saved china from the abyss of misery

because china is now stable politically economically and 
socially but he added the party had not softened its 
opposition to attempts to subvert the socialist system 
the peoples daily said today in a frontpage editorial we 
must never drop our guard in the face of continued threats from 
international reactionary elements 
the masses must be educated in patriotism collectivism and 
socialism and we should give timely and forceful blows to the 
reactionary forces destructive activities it said 
the government refers to the studentled protests as a 
counterrevolutionary rebellion aimed at overthrowing the 
communist party and the socialist system 
premier li imposed martial law in beijing for the first time in 
40 years of communist rule after hundreds of thousands of people 
took to the streets in may to demand democratic reforms and an end 
to official corruption 
the decision was met by widespread resistance with tens of 
thousands of beijing residents setting up barricades to block troop 
convoys from entering the city 
then troops shot their way into the city and crushed the 
demonstrations 
the government has since launched a nationwide campaign to crush 
dissent it has arrested thousands and required millions of 
students and workers to undergo the most intense political 
indoctrination since the ultraleftist 196676 cultural revolution 
beijing streets and college campuses remained quiet after lis 
speech wednesday night several students said the lifting of 
martial law made no difference and noted that tight campus 
security would remain

ms jacksons daughter 17yearold tina mancini shot herself 
to death in march 1986 in their coral springs home 
last month a state appeals court upheld ms jacksons 1987 
convictions on charges of mental child abuse forgery and procuring 
a sexual performance by a child 
ms jackson altered her daughters identification and ordered 
her to perform at nude bars then collected most of the earnings 
according to testimony at her trial believed to be the first in 
which a person was charged with mental child abuse in connection 
with a suicide 
after serving the jail term ms jackson will be under house 
arrest for two years followed by three years of probation

deposed dictator manuel noriega was 
friendly to airmen who flew him to jail in miami even autographing 
their flight chart says the commander of air force units that 
spearheaded the invasion of panama 
the defense department lifted a blackout wednesday on 
information about special forces that participated in operation 
just cause and col george gray iii commander of the 1st special 
operations wing headquartered at this florida panhandle base spoke 
at lenght with reporters at a news conference 
gray said his ac130 spectre gunships took only 10 minutes to 
demolish noriegas headquarters twentyfive special operations 
planes and helicopters participated in the invasion gray said 
including the mc130 combat talon that flew noriega out of panama 
he was very friendly towards the crew gray said noriega 
wrote happy voyage in spanish on the flight chart and then 
signed it m noriega 
more than 500 personnel and all of the aircraft except two 
gunships already stationed in panama were deployed from hurlburt 
and adjacent eglin air force base gray said about 200 of his 
troops remain in panama but their primary mission was completed 
dec 20 the first day of the invasion 
we essentially spearheaded the operation gray said we 
were to be there first to knock out mr noriegas command and 
control and to eliminate any threats to our aircraft involved in 
airdropping the army rangers at two airfields 
the us planes knocked out antiaircraft artillery at the three 
targets he said 
grays airmen suffered no combat casualties and the only damage 
was a single smallarms round that struck one of the aircraft 
he declined to say how many gunships were used in the assault on 
the headquarters of the panama defense forces known as the 
comandancia but 11 ac130s were involved in the overall operation 
he said the gunships had only 10 minutes to accomplish their 
mission at the comandancia blasting it with 105 mm howitzers and 
rapidfire 40 mm cannons before ground forces arrived 
there were reports of extensive damage and some casualties in 
the surrounding neighborhood also attacked by artillery from the 
ground 
the rules of engagement for us were very very clear absolute 
minimum civilian casualties absolute minimum collateral damage 
gray said and the only way to do that is by employing a surgical 
firepower platform such as the ac130 all rounds were on target 
within the comandancia 
gray said the firepower demonstrated by the gunships armed 
versions of the c130 transport probably intimidated other 
panamanian troops into surrendering 
after they saw the destruction of the comandancia i think 
they very quickly realized they didnt want to take us on gray 
said we gave them the opportunity to surrender we would pay 
them a visit and they chose to surrender 
the gunships probably saved many american lives gray said but 
some lives may have been lost because one of the planes had to 
return to hurlburt with problems in its fire control equipment 
overall gray said of his units performance it was done 
absolutely to perfection if i had to do everything again i 
probably wouldnt have changed anything

some of the nations most formidable courtroom 
warriors are being lured to the legal battle of manuel noriega 
drawn by the klieg lights focused on what could be one of the great 
trials of the era 
they include defense attorneys who have worked some famous cases 
of the last decade with clients such as new york subway gunman 
bernhard goetz reputed mafia chieftain john gotti and an army 
officer allegedly linked to the assassination of el salvadors 
archbishop 
manuel noriega may or may not have a trial but he should be 
assured the best the american justice system allows said new 
york attorney barry slotnick who said he would decide this week 
whether to join the case 
the changes in the defense team appear to hinge on slotnick 50 
whose clients have included goetz and gotti 
slotnick said he was contacted by noriega representatives and 
asked to defend the deposed panamanian dictator who faces 145 
years in prison and fines up to 11 million if convicted 
a february 1988 indictment charges noriega with taking 46 
million in bribes from colombian cocaine dealers to turn his nation 
into a way station for smugglers 
as cocounsel slotnick is seeking prominent miami defense 
attorney neal sonnett who withdrew from the noriega case earlier 
this month citing differences with other defense lawyers 
sonnetts clients have included hernan botero a colombian 
extradited to florida and convicted for laundering 56 million in 
drug money lebaneseborn arms dealer sarkis soghanalian and 
alvaro saravia at one time sought for extradition to el salvador 
where he was accused of complicity in the 1980 assassination of 
roman catholic archbishop oscar romero the salvadoran government 
later dropped its request 
sonnett 47 said wednesday he would give high consideration 
to returning to the case with slotnick 
this case will present some of the most challenging issues 
raised in an american court of law its any attorneys dream to be 
part of it said sonnett president of the national association 
of criminal defense lawyers 
sonnett and slotnick say they have no desire to oust noriegas 
present defense team led by frank rubino and steven kollin but 
sonnett who objected to statements about the case by the other 
defense attorneys said clear lines of authority would be drawn if 
he rejoined 
while defense attorneys will not discuss how they will be 
compensated slotnick said he will not represent noriega for free 
this case will require extensive resources and it will be 
conducted in the great tradition of the american free enterprise 
system we will get paid he said 
kollin and rubino did not return telephone calls to their 
offices by the associated press on wednesday 
houston lawyer richard racehorse haynes also has been 
contacted by an unidentified noriega representative and is 
considering joining the noriega case 
haynes assistant judy fogarty said there is no deadline for a 
decision by haynes 62 who gained national attention for winning 
two murder acquittals for texas tycoon t cullen davis in the 
1970s davis was accused of shooting his estranged wife and killing 
her lover and 12yearold daughter 
as for the prosecution a bush administration official told the 
ap that justice department officials may give us attorney dexter 
lehtinen the choice of running his office or taking the lead 
prosecution role in noriegas trial 
a spokeswoman at lehtinens office diane cossin refused to 
comment on the report saying the team has not been announced 
noriega 51 has been held in a basement apartment in the miami 
federal courthouse since arriving in the united states last 
thursday he awaits a jan 26 bond hearing

opposition parties today debated the 
first noconfidence motion against the president accusing his 
yearold government of failing to restore peace and condoning 
violence by paramilitary groups 
president ranasinghe premadasas united national party was 
expected to have no trouble defeating the motion in a vote expected 
to take place friday night 
the motion was presented by the sri lanka freedom party which 
is headed by former prime minister sirimavo bandaranaike 
premadasas party has 124 of parliaments 225 seats mrs 
bandaranaikes party and three other parties supporting the 
noconfidence motion have a total of 84 seats 
most of the remaining seats are held by legislators who have 
said they will not support the noconfidence motion 
at least 6500 people have been killed in sri lankas ethnic and 
political wars since premadasa took office jan 2 1989 according 
to tallies kept by the military 
the noconfidence motion said premadasas government had failed 
to restore peace order and normalcy it accused the government of 
permitting and encouraging illegal paramilitary groups to kidnap 
torture and murder civilians 
the motion also charged that the government had mismanaged the 
economy ignored corruption and discriminated against political 
opponents 
the united national party has been in power since 1977 when it 
defeated mrs bandaranaikes freedom party 
in 1983 a revolt by tamil separatists in northeastern sri lanka 
plunged the onceidyllic island nation into a vicious spiral of 
massacre murder and mayhem 
by 1987 efforts to make peace with the tamil minority had 
spawned a backlash by ultranationalist sinhalese against their 
fellow sinhalese who control the government 
more than 11000 people have died in the 7yearold tamil war 
while at least 6000 more have been killed in the past 2 years in 
the internal sinhalese battle 
sinhalese account for 75 percent of the countrys 16 million 
people tamils comprise 18 percent and say the sinhalese 
discriminate against them in jobs education and use of the sinhala 
language

soviet border guards have begun tearing down the 
barbed wire barricades along the tightly controlled romanian 
border a kgb official said 
the official tass news agency quoted georgy lavranchuk head of 
the kgb in the soviet republic of moldavia that borders romania as 
saying wednesday that about 30 miles of barbed wire had been 
removed 
soviet and romanian officials also are moving to eliminate the 
border passes that previously were required tass said 
from now on there is no need for special passes if residents 
of border villages enter the frontier zone for rest and 
recreation tass said 
crossing regulations have been simplified at seven border 
points it said without identifying them 
the moves came after soviet foreign minister eduard a 
shevardnadze visited bucharest on jan 6 and said that the two 
sides would work quickly to dismantle border restrictions 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev warmly greeted the 
revolution in december that threw out hardline romanian dictator 
nicolae ceausescu 
romanians and ethnic moldavians speak nearly the same language 
and are members of the same ethnic group but the border between 
them has been among the most closely guarded in the east bloc 
soviets discouraged close border contacts after the 1968 warsaw 
pact invasion of czechoslovakia in which romania refused to take 
part 
in the past several years as gorbachev has reformed the soviet 
union ceausescu restricted border contacts to keep romanians from 
seeing how poorly they lived compared to others 
shevardnadze said he had agreed with romanias new leaders to 
establish more liberal border crossing rules such as the soviet 
union has with hungary and poland 
in the past relatives have been allowed to make visits across 
the romaniasoviet border only on special family occasions such as 
weddings and funerals a few cultural figures and scholars also 
have been allowed to make visits 
the tass report did not explain the new regulations but it is 
likely that they will require a minimum of paperwork to allow 
people to cross the border

we are having discussions with several parties said michael 
cross managing director of dallhold investment ltd a privately 
held company owned by bond we have received a great many 
approaches but nothing is conclusive at this stage 
ainslie also said sothebys will no longer extend loans to art 
buyers using the artworks they purchase as collateral

collectors for driving up art prices 
the loan arrangement was disclosed by cross in october by that 
time sothebys reportedly had moved the painting to a secret 
location the disclosure of the loan and the fact that bond didnt 
have irises in his possession shocked the art community the

a senior politburo member has promised an 
investigation into the 1978 slaying of a prominent emigre writer 
who died after he was jabbed by a poisontipped umbrella in london 
politburo member alexander lilov made the pledge after meeting 
wednesday with annabel markov the widow of writer georgi markov 
mrs markov said her husbands slaying was one of the darkest 
crimes of the cold war and that she wants communist authorities 
to take responsibility 
lilov is among the reformers who have assumed control since the 
nov 10 ouster of hardline communist leader todor zhivkov 
zhivkov who once received markov in his villas and hunting 
lodges was in power when markov was murdered nine years after the 
author defected while on a trip to italy in 1969 there has long 
been speculation that the orders to kill markov came from sofia 
asked if lilov said bulgarias former hardline leaders were 
linked to her husbands death mrs markov replied 
there was not a specific admission but he said this had been 
a terrible time for bulgaria and things had happened that 
shouldnt have happened 
the british native said she is not seeking any kind of 
retribution i just want them to admit responsibility for what 
theyve done 
mrs markov said she felt confident the government would 
investigate 
many hardline communists remain in power but bulgarias new 
leaders have promised democratic reforms and are trying to cast off 
the countrys stalinist image a special parliamentary commission 
already has said it has enough evidence to proceed with an 
investigation of zhivkov on suspicion of diverting state funds into 
swiss bank accounts 
bulgarias ambassador in london said tuesday that his country 
would finally investigate the death of markov one of bulgarias 
foremost authors before his murder in london on sept 29 1978 
british investigators concluded that markov who worked for the 
british broadcasting corps bulgarian service was killed by 
poison injected through an umbrella tip as he waited for a bus on 
londons westminster bridge before he fell into a coma markov 
told friends he had been jabbed from behind 
the author had made public comments highly critical of zhivkovs 
rule before his death vladimir kostov an outspoken emigre in 
paris survived what he says was a similar attempt to kill him with 
a poison pellet 
lilov also pledged that bulgaria for the first time will publish 
markovs posthumously collected memoirs the truth that killed 
mrs markov said 
the book already published in the united states and britain is 
a collection of essays that testify to the psychological and moral 
damage inflicted by stalinism in bulgaria 
his memoirs are like a document of what 35 years of 
totalitarian rule did to the country mrs markov said

nicolae ceausescu threatened army 
commanders at their final meeting with execution for ignoring 
orders to kill protesters and a newspaper report today said that 
he offered more than 5 million to be freed when he was later 
captured by revolutionists 
according to the minutes of the dec 17 meeting the dictator 
berated his top men for shooting blanks at the crowds in the 
western city of timisoara 
theyve got to kill the hooligans not to beat them the 
hardline communist leader said angrily 
ceausescus wife elena told the meeting the protesters should 
be hurled into the basement jails of the securitate the secret 
police and never again see the light of day 
a transcript of stenographers notes from the meeting what 
turned out to be the communist party politburos last gathering 
was published wednesday in the daily newspaper romania libera 
ceausescu was overthrown on dec 22 when army troops and 
citizens rebelled against him and he was executed along with his 
wife on christmas day 
the official rompres news agency today quoted silviu brucan a 
senior member of the new government as saying about 10000 people 
died in revolutionary clashes in timisoara bucharest sibiu 
brasov and other cities 
western diplomats in bucharest citing witnesses and other 
accounts also said earlier that about 10000 had been killed 
according to the minutes defense minister vasile milea 
interior minister tudor postelnicu and chief of the securitate 
secret police iulian vlad first tried to reason with ceausescu 
then pledged to carry out his orders 
milea originally reported to have committed suicide several 
days after the meeting later was found to have been slain by 
ceausescu henchmen postelnicu and vlad are under arrest and 
awaiting trial along with hundreds of other ceausescu underlings 
crowds in timisoara had broken into the local party headquarters 
on dec 16 and troops armed only with truncheons and blank 
ammunition had been unable or unwilling to stop them 
troops issued live ammunition later fired at the unarmed 
protesters causing the outrage and revulsion of a nation that 
endured 24 years of ceausescus repression and harsh economic 
policy 
according to the minutes ceausescu at times seemed to lose 
control of his emotions as he criticized the army commanders for 
not following his orders to fire on the crowds 
i didnt think you would shoot with blanks that is like a 
rain shower ceausescu said those who entered the party 
building should not leave the building alive 
the notes showed that milea postelnicu and vlad became 
submissive when he accused them of treason and threatened to have 
them shot 
i have told you that all have to be armed ceausescu shouted 
at postelnicu who has given this order when i understand that 
securitate troops are going somewhere it is clear to me that they 
are going armed you send them to fight with fists what kind of 
interior units are you 
the 71yearold dictators fury appeared to peak when told by 
milea that he had decided not to supply army units facing the 
timisoara demonstrators with ammunition 
why didnt you give them ammunition if you dont give them 
ammunition you might as well keep them at home what kind of 
defense minister are you what kind of interior minister are you 
postelnicu they received orders to fight and not to go on 
maneuvers 
a few hooligans want to destroy socialism and you make it 
childs play for them ceausescu shouted you do not quiet an 
enemy by talking with him like a priest but by burning him 
mrs ceausescu spoke little but expressed her contempt of the 
defiant timisoara protesters 
you should shoot them so they fall and put them in 
securitate basements she said not even one should see the 
light of day again 
as the revolution flickered fitfully in timisoara she and her 
husband alternately berated and threatened milea postelnicu and 
vlad to try to get their support 
they are cowards mrs ceausescu said 
they are more than cowards ceausescu said as supreme 
commander i consider that you have committed treason against the 
countrys supreme interests and against the peoples interest and 
against the interests of socialism 
do you know what im going to do with you he said send 
you to the firing squad 
the historic record of the meeting vividly underlined the 
control exercised by the ceausescus over the party whose apparatus 
constructed a personality cult reminiscent of josef stalin 
few other of the 25 other leading functionaries present spoke as 
the ceausescus vented their anger when they did it was submissive 
after his later flight from the capital ceausescu promised one 
of the two uniformed policemen who captured him and his wife 5 
million to release them the daily adevarul said 
it quoted col gen jean moldoveanu the deputy interior 
minister as saying at a certain time ceausescu promised the 
noncommissioned officer 5 million i repeat 5 million to 
let them escape 
seeing that the policeman remained unmoved the tyrant raised 
the price promising him more than 5 million moldoveanu 
reportedly said without specifying the sum

an animal collector who wants to enter 
goliath african frogs in calaveras countys frog jump says 
californias import restrictions wont stop him from bringing in 
his 10 mighty leapers 
state officials said wednesday that andy j koffmans 3foot 
frogs would be unwelcome a ruling likely to come as a relief to 
entrants in the contest inspired by the mark twain story the 
celebrated jumping frog of calaveras county 
the goliath african frogs which weigh up to 12 pounds can 
clear 30 feet in a single bound while the record leap in past frog 
jumping jubilees is 21 feet 5 inches in three hops 
under the fish and game code those species are considered 
undesirable and prohibited from import said lenny clavecilla a 
spokesman for the california fish and game department 
clavecilla said koffman will need permits to bring the frogs 
into the state and we wouldnt be inclined to issue them for 
that purpose the frogs could loose in the wild and harm native 
wildlife he said 
but koffman called the restrictions bureaucratic nonsense 
and he said he was determined to enter his frogs in the 62yearold 
jubilee in may in angels camp a community in the sierra nevada 
foothills 150 miles east of san francisco 
ive been a licensed importer in this country probably longer 
than theyve been bureaucrats he said 
jubilee officials who are scheduled to consider the issue 
friday have expressed fears that the sharptoothed frogs could 
leap off the stage and into someones lap 
moreover they believe the african frogs would be unfair 
competition for the domestic variety the record jump was set by a 
normalsize frog named rosie the ribiter in 1986 
interim fair manager diane baumann said the states position may 
make local action moot 
it definitely takes us off the hook but it sort of ruins the 
whole issue she said lets face it were getting a lot of 
publicity out of this

prime minister vp singh today announced 
major concessions intended to end sikh separatism in punjab state 
but told tens of thousands of sikhs and hindus he has no magic 
wand to bring peace to the region 
singh said sikh deserters from the indian army will be given 
employment in other government organizations and that the 
detentions of jailed sikhs will be reviewed these have been key 
demands in the sikh movement 
hundreds of sikh soldiers mutinied when the army attacked the 
golden temple sikhisms holiest shrine in 1984 there were 
hundreds of deserters 
the number of sikh detainees is not known but it is easily in 
the hundreds and possibly thousands 
singh spoke at a public rally in the punjab city of ludhiana 
that the government organized as part of its movement to restore 
peace in the state 
when blood flows in punjab it is the countrys heart that 
bleeds singh said i have not come here with a magic wand the 
solution is not in the corridors of new delhi but in the 
wheatfields of punjab 
a resolution adopted at the end of the threehour rally said 
violence and the use of coercive methods must be put to an end 
and security of life and property and respect for human rights for 
all must be exercised 
the rebellion in the agriculturally rich state on indias border 
with pakistan began in 1982 when sikh militants accused the 
majority hindu community of discrimination 
the rally will mobilize people of punjab to quash secessionist

communist premier hans modrow today indicated 
that opposition groups could join his governing coalition which 
has been shaken by threats of a walkout by three traditionally 
allied parties 
but modrow defended an unpopular plan to set up a successor to 
the hated secret police network before multiparty elections on may 
6 
the allied parties threatened to leave the coalition and other 
prodemocracy opposition groups threatened to break off talks on 
the governments future after hearing that a new secret police 
organization would be formed 
in the interests of our countrys citizens there cannot be a 
security vacuum modrow told parliament as a partial concession 
modrow offered to have parliament supervise the planned new 
internal security agency and the dissolution of its predecessor 
popularly known as stasi 
he also said the government would suspend a plan to give state 
support such as pensions to former secret police a proposal that 
had provoked warning strikes from factory workers in recent days 
earlier today parliament ousted the head of the state security 
police lt gen wolfgang schwanitz and appointed a new chief 
prosecutor it also voted out several oldguard communists and 
other members of the 500seat legislature including guenther 
schabowski a former politburo member 
in his nearly 90minute address modrow told the opposition to 
make suggestions about how it would be prepared to participate 
directly and responsibly in the work of the government modrow 
did not say when or in exactly what form such participation could 
take place 
in bonn the west german government welcomed modrows speech for 
beginnings that could lead further but government spokesman 
dieter vogel said much depends on how much government access modrow 
actually gives the reform groups 
modrow also called on the opposition to offer its ideas on new 
legislation including a draft election law that proposal which 
would formally authorize the may 6 vote has drawn fire from the 
reform groups and west germany for containing a ban on all campaign 
aid from abroad 
opponents charge this would greatly help the communists who 
still control state media and essentials such as paper supplies and 
copying machines 
opposition groups planned to form a human chain around the 
parliament building tonight to protest what they perceive as the 
coalition governments reluctance to make democratic reforms 
modrow rejected that charge and said the oppostion should not issue 
ultimatums 
the opposition social democrats today demanded modrow allow 
opposition leaders to join in talks with west german chancellor 
helmut kohl 
modrow rejected the oppositions questioning of his authority to 
rule i cannot recall becoming premier through a coup he said 
modrow reportedly was considering calling for a national 
referendum on his government before the election but he did not 
mention that in his speech to parliament in reviewing his first 
eight weeks in office modrow said the aim is not to maintain the 
old structure of the hated secret police which the government 
has promised to dismantle 
many east germans appeared to be worried about the continued 
political turmoil in their nation and the communist in turn are 
worrying about their chances in the may elections 
the political infighting is the most serious setback since 
modrows caretakr government was seated in midnovember 
compounding the problems of a sagging economy a continuing exodus 
to the west and labor strikes 
east germany has seen major changes since the oct 18 ouster of 
hardline leader erich honecker but communist control of the 
country remains strong and many promises made by the new leaders 
still have not become law 
leading the list is the proposed law that will actually 
authorize the may 6 elections the first free voting in the 
countrys 40year history 
the christian democrats and the liberal democrats two of the 
current coalition partners said wednesday that they would quit 
modrows cabinet if the new law fails to meet their demands 
together the christian democrats and liberal democrats have 
seven seats in the 28member cabinet the national democrats 
another noncommunist party with two seats have also threatened to 
desert modrow 
party leaders on wednesday also cited the reestablishment of 
the secret police as a reason to pull out

century italian artist federico baroccio at the national gallery 
officials said he was ordered today to stand trial on charges of 
causing criminal damage 
the statefunded gallery home of some of the greatest art 
treasures in britain said in a statement that the painting the 
madonna and child with st joseph and the infant baptist was 
cut in nine places in wednesdays attack 
guards wrestled the knife from the assailant identified as 
martin came 27 no hometown was provided 
the national gallery said its conservation and restoration 
department will take maybe more than a year to repair the 
painting which measures 44 inches by 36 inches and is said to be 
worth at least 16 million 
at the moment we believe that complete restoration will be 
possible said a gallery spokeswoman who refused to be identified 
came appeared at bow street magistrates court today on charges 
of causing criminal damage and was ordered to stand trial feb 1 
pending medical reports from a western england hospital where he 
has undergone unspecified treatment 
baroccio or barocci as he is sometimes known worked at the 
same time as michelangelo baroccio spent most of his time in the 
italian city of urbino but the two men met in rome in the 1550s and 
michelangelo encouraged the younger artist with his work 
the damaged painting had been on display since it was bequeathed 
to the gallery in 1831 
gallery experts refused to estimate its value but a lesser 
known work by the same artist sold for 209160 at christies 
auctioneers last year 
britains domestic news agency press association said the 
painting has been valued at 1648 million 
but art critic brian sewell said the painting could fetch as 
much as 25 million baroccio was monumentally influential in his 
time and none of his work that is really authentic has come on 
the market for donkeys years he said 
in 1987 a man with a shotgun blasted one of the gallerys 
greatest treasures leonardo da vincis drawing the virgin and 
child with st anne and st john the baptist as it hung on show 
the da vinci drawing underwent an intricate 15month restoration 
and is now back on show the gunman robert cambridge age 38 at 
the time was ordered to be held indefinitely at broadmoor hospital

president bush today praised the lifting of 
martial law in china as a very sound step and said he will be 
watching developments there closely 
bushs praise of the chinese move this week contrasted with 
criticism from members of congress who said they doubted beijing is 
about to improve its record on human rights 
i view the lifting of martial law as a very sound step for 
those who are interested in the human rights and reform that was on 
the move that wed all like to see go forward theres no way you 
can look at that but say its very positive bush said 
he reiterated that he is not interested in isolating china 
adding of course we welcome the lifting of martial law as a good 
sign 
a day earlier us officials had reacted cautiously to the 
chinese move saying they would reserve judgment until the 
announcement by premier li peng was implemented more upbeat vice 
president dan quayle called the announcement a positive step 
forward for human rights 
the white house and state department reflected a cautious us 
policy stance by issuing identical statements saying we must 
assess the full scope of this action after observing its 
implementation 
the bush administration dropped its opposition to world bank 
loans to china for aid for earthquakes and other unspecified 
calamities but officials said the step was not related to the 
lifting of sanctions and that the united states would continue to 
oppose loans to china for projects 
bush today did not indicate whether he is considering further 
softening of sanctions he imposed on beijing after chinas violent 
crackdown on thousands of prodemocracy demonstrators last spring 
we will continue to watch this situation very closely he 
said 
on capitol hill rep william s broomfield of michigan the 
ranking republican on the house foreign affairs committee said 
chinas announcement was more blue smoke and mirrors and would 
not fool anybody in congress into believing that the chinese 
leadership was moderating its oppressive rule 
rep nancy pelosi dcalif who sponsored legislation to permit 
chinese students to remain in the united states after their visas 
expire called the lifting of martial law an empty gesture 
i am confident the congress of the united state will see 
through this feeble attempt by chinese leaders to mislead western 
governments she said in a statement beijing can lift martial 
law because it does not need martial law to crush dissent 
pelosi said she would push for a congressional override of 
president bushs veto of the bill to protect chinese students even 
though he has promised to shield them through an executive order 
senate democratic whip alan cranston of california called the 
announcement a small very small step in the right direction 
insufficient justification to halt sanctions against china 
house democratic leader richard a gephardt of missouri renewed 
criticism of bush for sending two senior officials to beijing for 
talks soon after chinese troops massacred hundreds of students and 
other prodemocracy protesters in tiananmen square in june 
we shouldnt have been over there at the very time that 
eastern europe was breaking loose and people were taking courageous 
stands against despotic regimes to say to the chinese all is 
forgiven for what you did gephardt said 
while it may make sense to communicate with the chinese 
government i dont think you want to be clinking champagne glasses 
with them as you say all is forgiven because i dont think all 
should be forgiven that quickly or that easily 
continuing us opposition to loans for projects could derail a 
700 million world bank program for china the sanction was imposed 
by bush after the crackdown in beijing 
as for permitting humanitarian help state department 
spokeswoman margaret d tutwiler said that decision was distinct 
from the announcement that martial law would be lifted after seven 
months 
it is a coincidence that they dropped on the same day she 
said they are not linked 
she described the us action as a partial easing of bushs 
sanction on loans but roman popadiuk the deputy white house 
spokesman said the sanctions remain in place period 
the bush administration has been under fire in congress and 
elsewhere for what critics consider to be kidglove treatment of 
chinese leaders the criticism intensified last month when it was 
disclosed that national security adviser brent scowcroft and deputy 
secretary of state lawrence eagleburger made two trips to beijing 
bush at a news conference last week again defended his policy 
he said he did not think isolating the chinese was the best way to 
promote human rights in the country

the bush administration will oppose any effort 
to change social security taxes even a politically appealing one 
to lower them president bushs spokesman said today 
democrats seem to want to fool around with the social security 
system we dont white house press secretary marlin fitzwater 
told reporters 
he was asked about a proposal by sen daniel patrick moynihan 
dny to roll back this years social security tax installment 
and further cut the rate on jan 1 1991 
the social security payroll tax rate including medicare went 
to 765 percent of income on jan 1 from 751 percent under a 
formula endorsed in 1983 by a reform commission headed by economist 
alan greenspan who now is chairman of the federal reserve board 
moynihan was a member of the commission 
mr moynihans got a lot of ideas and well let the democrats 
have them fitzwater said we dont anticipate any changes in 
social security 
moynihan has said he will introduce his proposal for lower 
social security taxes when congress reconvenes on jan 23 he has 
called his proposal a 55 billion tax cut for working people 
claiming that bulging social security trust funds warrant such a 
tax reduction 
contributions to the trust funds are counted as revenue in the 
federal budget which has the effect of making the overall federal 
deficit appear smaller than it otherwise would be 
administration opposition to a social security tax cut comes 
despite bushs frequently repeated no new taxes pledge 
the social security system is sound let the democrats fool 
with it not us fitzwater said 
however white house chief of staff john sununu said on cbs 
face the nation last sunday that the administration does plan 
to propose a change to social security financing that would require 
surpluses generated by the trust funds to be used to help retire 
the national debt after 1993 
currently the trust funds are invested in treasury securities 
fitzwater said today that the proposal disclosed by sununu deals 
mostly with budget accounting and not with the structure of the 
system 
social security taxes jumped almost 320 this year for americans 
earning 51300 or more and by smaller amounts for those earning 
less employers match their workers contributions

church leaders thursday urged 
legislators not to extend zimbabwes 24yearold state of emergency 
the catholic commission for justice and peace said in an open 
letter that the states emergency powers scheduled for renewal by 
the house of assembly on jan 16 were used to harass and 
intimidate people 
it cited the fiveweek detention last year of a labor leader for 
criticizing government actions including the arrests of student 
protesters and the indefinite closure of zimbabwes only university 
sweeping emergency powers which have been renewed by parliament 
every six months since independence in 1980 allow for detention 
without trial 
the church leaders said they believed the state of emergency was 
no longer necessary and often led to inefficient and unreliable 
methods of investigation by security authorities 
in july the government said it needed wideranging emergency 
powers to deal with threats from neighboring south africa and 
border incursions by rebels from mozambique 
the church leaders said it has not been shown that the 
emergency powers improve police performance when it comes to 
dealing with spies and saboteurs 
existing security procedures and legislation were sufficient to 
safeguard the nations interests the commission said 
zimbabwe has been under a state of emergency since 1965 when it 
was introduced by the government of former rhodesian prime minister 
ian smith to crack down on black nationalists

a federal appeals court today blocked 
special judicial elections that a lower court had ordered in nine 
of texas largest counties as a way of remedying discrimination 
against black and hispanic voters 
a federal judge jan 2 had ordered the elections to take place 
in may under a system less likely to dilute minority voting power 
but the 5th us circuit court of appeals today said the 
legislature deserves a chance to come up with a new system first 
only if it becomes apparent that the state is unwilling to act 
with measured and appropriate speed in this regard should the 
courts intervene the appeals court said 
gov bill clements has already called the legislature into 
session on feb 27 to consider judicial selection along with 
school finance reforms 
i applaud the decision of the 5th circuit not to allow the 
wholesale disruption of our judiciary he said our legislature 
will now have the opportunity to resolve this crucial issue in a 
manner that is representative of the wishes of the people of our 
state and that enhances the participation of all texans 
us district judge lucius bunton had ruled that the nine 
counties method of electing state judges from each county as a 
whole violated the federal voting rights act by diluting minority 
voting power he ordered special elections held in those counties 
with judges chosen from smaller existing political districts 
the ruling affected 115 state district court judgeships in 
bexar dallas tarrant harris travis midland ector lubbock and 
jefferson counties in all texas has 375 state district judgeships 
the counties were named in a lawsuit filed in 1988 by the league 
of united latin american citizens and other minority groups and 
individuals 
in its opinion today the appeals court said buntons ruling 
would mean sweeping changes in texas 113yearold judicial system 
and that job is more properly one for lawmakers the court said 
the court went on to say that the legislature hasnt had a 
reasonable period within which to address the problem presented

the states highest court thursday threw out 
a decision revoking the license of the new york city bar where 
preppie murderer robert chambers met jennifer levin before 
killing her in central park 
the chairman of the state liquor authority should have have 
excused himself from a hearing involving alleged underaged drinking 
at dorrians red hand after he made public statements about the 
bars guilt a sharplydivided state court of appeals said 
the court by a 43 vote sent the case back to the liquor 
authority and said chairman thomas duffy should not be among those 
deciding the matter 
dorrians had appealed a decision that it served underaged 
drinkers in november 1986 three months after levin was strangled 
the bar forfeited 1000 bond and lost its liquor license for 10 
days 
dorrians lawyer said the bar didnt receive a fair hearing 
because duffy had already prejudged the case and because the bar 
was being made a scapegoat for the highly publicized slaying 
in march 1988 chambers pleaded guilty to manslaughter in 
levins death he is serving five to 15 years in prison

columbias astronauts mopped up 
water from a leaky dehumidifier today as they closed in on the 
floating science laboratory they plan to pluck from space on friday 
with the shuttles robot arm 
commander dan brandenstein and pilot jim wetherbee executed 
three enginefiring maneuvers today putting columbia on a 
nearcollision course with the satellite they have been chasing 
since they were launched tuesday onto a path 1725 miles behind 
their quarry 
once the astronauts move in on the 11ton target they will fly 
in formation 35 feet away while mission specialist bonnie dunbar 
reaches out with columbias 50foot mechanical arm to snare the 
30foot satellite which is as large as a small school bus 
if all goes well she will make the catch at 948 am friday 
the shuttle this morning was reported to be within 300 miles of 
the satellite known as the long duration exposure facility 
brandenstein and mission specialist david low interrupted their 
flight plans for more than two hours today to cope with the leak of 
about two gallons of water shown on television as a slow bubbling 
of water beads 
they shut off the faulty dehumidifier shifted to a backup and 
then went to work on the water with towels and a handheld vacuum 
using a flashlight to dry cables and other surfaces loose water 
which forms beads and globules in weightlessness can interfere 
with electronics 
looking at all the equipment that had to be moved to get at the 
water brandenstein remarked its kind of a mess right now ill 
get the plumber of the year award but not the housekeeper of the 
year award 
scientists are eager to examine the satellite to learn how 
various systems and materials withstood the long stay in orbit 
information that will help in designing the space station and other 
space vehicles 
atmospheric drag has been pulling the satellite closer to earth 
if columbia does not retrieve it trackers estimate the satellite 
will burn up in a plunge into earths atmosphere about march 9 its 
experiments lost forever 
the shuttle which is in a slightly lower orbit takes less time 
to circle the globe and was catching up with the satellite at a 
rate today of about 38 miles for each 91minute orbit of the earth 
controllers meanwhile reported the 85 million navy 
communications satellite launched by the astronauts wednesday was 
functioning well an onboard motor late wednesday boosted it on 
another leg toward its permament working outpost 22300 miles above 
the pacific ocean 
as the gap between the shuttle and the wayward laboratory 
closed hunter and hunted were traveling nearly 200 miles high at 
more than 17400 mph 
were glad youre doing so well the whole worlds 
impressed mission control told the astronauts as it wakened them 
today with its version of banana boat song 
the control center version substituted the name of astronaut low 
for the words dayo and it included such phrases as come 
all you astronauts sleeping in the cabin daylight comes and its 
time to get up 
mission control explained the words were written by members of 
the team that trained low for a space walk in case of an emergency 
on this flight to pass the time during these training sessions he 
often hummed the song 
low replying in a calypso beat said good morning houston 
man we be up 
while the commander and pilot tended to flying columbia the 
three mission specialists dunbar low and marsha ivins busied 
themselves with experiments they melted crystals photographed the 
earth and took medical measurements of one another in tests to 
determine how well the human body adapts to space weightlessness 
columbias 10day mission the secondlongest in the 33 shuttle 
flights is a stepping stone toward longer shuttle missions and to 
monthslong rips aboard space station freedom starting in the 
mid1990s 
after dunbar grabs ldef she will hold it on the end of the 
robot arm for nearly four hours while ivins makes a detailed 
photographic survey of all 57 experiments mounted on the exterior 
the laboratory has been exposed to space for six years and there 
is concern some of the experiments might deteriorate when 
reintroduced to earths gravity after being eroded by atomic 
oxygen and bombarded by interplanetary debris

washington ap now free to set their own course the people of 
east europe are seeking selfrule and free enterprise but experts 
say fulfilling those yearnings wont necessarily come easily 
even if the desire to run ones own life and to make money 
is instinctive they say history shows that eastern europeans may 
have trouble setting up shop under the flags of democracy and 
capitalism 
people want liberty naturally but the working out of 
institutions is a very complicated process said richard pipes of 
harvard university an east european specialist who served with 
president reagans national security council 
the russians in 1917 were wild for liberty and democracy but 
it collapsed in a matter of months because they didnt have the 
traditions the institutions he said in an interview 
the same is true in trying to set up a capitalist system said 
economist murray weidenbaum of washington university in st louis 
a former reagan adviser who recently surveyed polands economy on a 
mission for president bush 
people have the entrepreneurial profitseeking instinct you 
dont have to teach it to them he said but when youre 
talking about the free enterprise system they have to learn 
business infrastructure like cost accounting contract law 
preparation of financial statements that isnt instinctive 
paul a samuelson nobel prizewinning economist from mit said 
he is not too sure that the people of poland east germany 
czechoslovakia bulgaria and romania having ousted their 
moscowinstalled communist governments are aware of the pitfalls 
of the free enterprise system if that is what they opt to install 
it is not a system of profits it is a system of profits and 
losses he said bankruptcy is an important part of the 
capitalist system if you dont want inequalities unemployment 
bankruptcies then you want the good side of capitalism without the 
other side 
weidenbaum agreed the poles see the benefits of capitalism 
but dont see the costs he said i dont know if they realize 
that capitalism is not a profit system but a profitorloss system 
in the best of times thousands of companies go broke 
poland has already felt the pain of moving away from a state 
economy on jan 1 taking the plunge poles saw bus fares and 
gasoline double and the price of electricity and heating gas 
increase fourfold 
robert conquest a specialist on the soviet union at the hoover 
institution on war revolution and peace at stanford university 
said he suspects east europes economic rebirth will be more 
troublesome than its political renewal 
in politics he said they can go back to their old 
constitutions but on the economic front theyre stuck with 
these apparatuses of uselessness 
in a system that guaranteed a job to everyone he said no one 
worked hard 
economist paul craig roberts who served in the reagan 
administration said he fears that poland especially is so social 
democratic in its outlook that it may impose restrictions that 
make it difficult for individuals to suceed economically such as 
high progressive tax rates and high death taxes 
capitalism is instinctive he said it just grew up as a 
natural spontaneous development while communism and socialism 
began as ideologies that then seized political power and imposed 
themselves 
harvard government professor harvey mansfield jr author of a 
new study of power taming the prince said he worried that 
fascism could beckon if democracy founders in east europe that was 
the pattern of 1933 when adolf hitler took advanatage of 
discontent with unemployment and inflation in newly democratic 
germany to seize power 
but conquest doubted that fascism holds much appeal or poses 
much of a threat in east europe 
i think the attraction of democratic liberty is very very 
great he said they have a higher opinion of the west than the 
west does 
yet it took two tries to establish a workable democratic system 
in this country even though the colonialists had experience in 
parliamentary rule in england pipes said the first american 
constitution the articles of confederacy and perpetual union 
was recognized as a failure within nine years and replaced by the 
constitution within 12 
on the other hand he said east europeans are so fed up with 
despotism of any kind right or left that youre going to se a 
tremendous desire for democracy and capitalism

chinas army will maintain a strong presence to 
safeguard public security in the beijing area following the 
lifting of martial law the governments top spokesman said 
thursday 
up to 1000 troops marched across tiananmen square on thursday 
morning hours after seven months of martial law officially ended 
in the capital 
i thought martial law was over said one of the several 
thousand people on the 100acre square as he watched the military 
procession 
the government spokesman yuan mu told a news conference there 
was a small increase in troop levels in beijing and its 
suburbs but he gave no indication of how many soldiers would be 
stationed around the capital 
yuan said the military presence was necessary to safeguard 
public security and the peaceful work of the people 
he said martial was ended because the task of martial law has 
been victoriously completed the situation in beijing and 
throughout the country is stable and the social order has returned 
to normal 
president bush on thursday praised the lifting of martial law as 
a very sound step and a good sign 
there was no suggestion from the chinese government that it was 
responding to strong pressure from the west to lift martial law as 
a signal that it is easing its policy of harsh suppression of 
political dissent 
premier li peng on wednesday night announced the end to martial 
law imposed in may after prodemocracy crowds of up to 1 million 
people took over the streets of beijing 
li stressed that decision to bring troops into beijing in the 
june military crackdown had been timely necessary and correct 
police replaced military sentries in the city at the end of 
october and the lifting of martial law had no visible effect on 
the city except that tiananmen square previously entered only by 
chinese with proper documents again became open to all citizens 
about 150000 troops entered beijing to quell the prodemocracy 
unrest of last spring and many are believed to remain 
unobtrusively behind the walled compounds of the city 
chinese sources said the military went on full alert in late 
december when the overthrow of the prochina nicolae ceausescu 
regime in romania raised fears of political unrest in beijing 
on thursday the troops many shouting in cadence or singing 
military songs marched across tiananmen square and entered a 
compound next to the great hall of the people in an obvious show of 
military force 
although tough antiprotest laws and surveillance of university 
campuses remain in place many expressed relief that martial law 
was over this is the way it should be said a high school 
student about the opening of the square to the public again 
but others also speaking on condition of anonymity said the 
end of martial law will have little meaning as long as political 
repression continues 
the government draws a circle and you have to stand inside 
said a beijing teacher its like the russian gulag only a 
different size he said adding that we havent forgotten the 
students who stood up to the military 
hundreds and perhaps thousands of people were killed when 
troops stormed the city on june 34 to drive student demonstrators 
from the square since then thousands of political activists have 
been arrested and many languish in jail without formal charges 
asked about students under detention yuan said only that 
judicial departments were still carrying out investigations 
gao xin one of four intellectuals who began a hunger strike for 
democracy just before military assault has been freed after six 
months in jail but gao who looked much thinner said thursday he 
could not talk about the experience 
the government spokesman said china would take a prudent 
attitude toward providing the names of those killed in the 
crackdown because many relatives of the victims were not quite 
willing to have the names announced in the papers 
yuan said the situation in the tibetan capital of lhasa also 
under martial law since the outbreak of proindependence riots in 
march was different from that of beijing and he had no information 
on when martial law would end there 
chinas official newspapers said the nation cannot relax its 
vigilance against antisocialist enemies 
lifting martial law doesnt mean all is well said the 
communist partys peoples daily it said the few people who 
adhere to bourgeois liberalization refuse to admit their defeat 
the liberation army daily said the army the pillar of the 
peoples democratic dictatorship in china will not slacken its 
vigilance ideologically

officials thursday rejected an 
amnesty international report charging the government has detained 
and tortured hundreds of political opponents and they denied the 
kingdom holds political prisoners 
a highranking government official said the report did not take 
into account that saudi arabia follows islamic law 
in a document released thursday in london the human rights 
group said more than 700 people were detained in saudi arabia 
without trial between 1983 and 1989 most of them shiite moslems 
the torture methods it listed included beating on the soles of 
feet sleep deprivation and being suspended by the wrists from a 
ceiling or high window 
the report is baseless the official said the laws in the 
kingdom of saudi arabia are derived from islamic sharia 
the official refused to be identified as do most senior 
officials when speaking to the press 
amnesty international conceded the kingdom is run by islamic law 
but said it was enacted by royal decree or ministerial regulations 
with no regular penal code 
under sharia courts are made up of moslem theologians and 
murderers are beheaded while thieves have their hands cut and 
adulterers are stoned lawyers are not assigned automatically but 
the prisoner can request legal counsel or an attorney can volunteer 
to defend 
there are lawyers versed in islamic sharia but it is not a 
practice to automatically assign one to defendants 
the official saudi press agency quoted a government spokesman as 
saying there were no political prisoners in the kingdom but there 
were cases being considered by the rules of islamic sharia through 
judges highly versed in sharia 
islamic sharia he said does not differentiate between sects 
or races or creeds and does not extract confessions by force 
pressure or terror or any style that contravenes the dignity of man 
as established by islamic sharia and applied by the kingdom 
he added amnesty international should differentiate between 
laws by which the kingdom abides in line with the rules and 
principles of islamic sharia and the systems in other countries in 
light of laws laid down by human beings who err more often than 
not 
beheadings are common in saudi arabia on fridays the moslem 
sabbath 
a prominent case of beheadings last year was that of 16 moslem 
shiites mainly kuwaitis who were convicted in bombings during the 
pilgrimage to the saudi cities of mecca and medina the blasts 
killed one person

prime minister vp singh offered key 
concessions to sikh separatists thursday but he said he had no 
sure way to end the violence 
singh appeared at a rally of about 100000 people in the punjab 
city of ludhiana as part of his 6weekold governments campaign to 
restore peace in the state 
singh said sikh deserters from the indian army would be given 
government jobs the deserters rehabilitation has been a key 
demand of the sikh community 
the prime minister also said the cases of jailed sikhs would be 
reviewed hundreds and perhaps thousands are in jail 
hundreds of sikh soldiers mutinied in 1984 when the government 
ordered indian army troops to attack the golden temple the sikh 
faiths holiest shrine and expel armed sikhs more than 2000 
people mostly sikhs were killed in the raid 
later that year sikh bodyguards killed prime minister indira 
gandhi in revenge the violence has continued with at least 1820 
people killed in the punjab state last year mostly in hitandrun 
attacks by the militants 
when blood flows in punjab it is the countrys heart that 
bleeds said singh a hindu 
he added however i have not come here with a magic wand the 
solution is not in the corridors of new delhi but in the 
wheatfields of punjab 
a resolution adopted at the end of the rally said violence 
and the use of coercive methods must be put to an end and 
security of life and property and respect for human rights for all 
must be exercised 
many listeners in the crowd seemed skeptical about prospects for 
an end to the violence 
vp singhs latest rally is just a ritual the government 
itself knows nothing will be solved can anything be solved by such 
rallies asked bhinder singh a sikh resident of ludhiana 
about 20 leaders of various political parties attended the 
meeting in the industrial town of about 800000 people known for 
its clothing factories 
an influential sikh party of punjab the akali dal and former 
prime minister rajiv gandhis congress party the largest 
opposition group stayed away 
foreign minister inder kumar gujral a hindu who has been a key 
figure in the governments efforts to win over sikhs said the 
rallys aim was to mobilize support from the people of punjab to 
quash secessionist efforts 
the rebellion was launched in 1982 with militants claiming sikhs 
suffer discrimination by hindus sikhs form only 2 percent of 
indias 880 million people but have in a slight majority in punjab 
hindus make up 82 percent of the national population 
thursdays rally was the second multiparty meeting on punjab 
called by singh since he took office dec 2 replacing gandhi 
singh who led the centrist national front alliance was named 
prime minister with support from communists and rightwing hindu

president mikhail s gorbachev today 
tried to persuade lithuanians to halt their drive for independence 
but tens of thousands of people rallied to show they are not 
willing to wait for freedom 
gorbachev did not attend the evening rally but earlier he told 
several hundred lithuanians they can have a say in their future 
yet warned that pitting the lithuanian leadership against the 
kremlin could lead to tragedy 
the comments were aimed at cooling proindependence passions as 
gorbachev embarked on a crucial mission to persuade lithuanian 
communists to reverse a decision to split from the federal 
communist party 
we have been tied together for these 50 years whether we like 
it or not gorbachev said walking through a crowd of several 
hundred after laying a wreath at a monument to lenin and all the 
more so we have not lived in a federation we have lived in a 
unitary state with its own realities 
one person called out to gorbachev people must decide their 
own fate 
nothing will be decided without you gorbachev responded as 
he slowly made his way back to his limousine we will decide 
everything together 
but he added remember if someone succeeds in pitting us 
against each other in a clash there will be a tragedy we should 
not allow this 
gorbachev did not say what such a tragedy might be but one of 
his closest political allies fellow politburo member alexander n 
yakovlev was quoted monday in an interview with interfax a news 
service of radio moscow as saying the lithuanian partys move 
might cause a domino effect encouraging communists in the 
countrys other 14 republics to break off from moscow 
soviet officials have given a virtual guarantee they will not 
use force to keep lithuania and its 37 million residents in the 
soviet union 
josef stalin absorbed lithuania along with the two other baltic 
states latvia and estonia in 1940 under a secret agreement with 
nazi germany 
weve come here to express our unity in light of the east 
european changes to announce that we will decide the problems of 
lithuania ourselves vytautas landsbergis leader of the 
grassroots political organization sajudis told the crowd of at 
least 200000 in cathedral square this evening 
we demand freedom and independence said the chief of 
sajudis a political movement pressing for lithuanian independence 
harry subacius a sajudis spokesman said in a telephone 
interview to moscow that the evening rally began with 15 minutes of 
silence many people held candles red green and gold lithuanian 
flags and the redandwhite banner of neighboring latvia subacius 
said 
after 1 hour and 15 minutes bells in the roman catholic 
cathedral and elsewhere began ringing through the city of 544000 
landsbergis referred to gorbachev as head of a great neighbor 
state emphasizing the view that lithuania is an independent land 
as the rally was going on gorbachev was meeting elsewhere with 
communist party members according to an unofficial schedule 
as never before in his nearly five years in power gorbachev put 
his personal prestige on the line in coming to lithuania exposing 
himself to a population that openly disagrees with him at times 
he adopted a pleading tone as he spoke to the people earlier in the 
day 
the soviet leader said the rights of all minorities in the 
soviet union whether they be lithuanians or small nonlithuanian 
ethnic groups in the republic must be respected or it could 
endanger the unity of the countrys more than 100 ethnic groups 
if even the slightest suppression occurs or misunderstanding 
somewhere in estonia or moldavia it spills over into the rest of 
the country he said 
several thousand people gathered around the square as gorbachev 
placed the wreath and several hundred of them broke through police 
cordons to surround gorbachev afterward 
the crowd was calm and curious gorbachev who has bitterly 
criticized the decision of the 200000member lithuanian communist 
party to split from the national party was straightforward and 
friendly 
the people who gathered apparently were passersby attracted by 
the heavy security around the lenin memorial it was not announced 
in advance that gorbachev would visit the memorial 
the sajudis group said they planned the evening rally to show 
gorbachev they cannot be dissuaded 
invited by a member of the crowd to attend gorbachev replied 
for me the meeting already is going on 
he then drove away to an equipment factory for a meeting with 
workers 
during his threeday visit to lithuania gorbachev plans to meet 
with collective farmers members of ethnic minorities 
intellectuals and communists 
although gorbachev has granted lithuanians and their neighbors 
in estonia and latvia a large measure of economic and political 
power he has consistently criticized lithuanian communist leaders 
for pressing for complete independence 
last month he convened an emergency session of the national 
party central committee to discuss the issue 
landsbergis said his countrymen are not trying to hurt 
gorbachevs political and economic reforms but are showing other 
republics how certain problems can be solved in a peaceful 
diplomatic manner 
its not destabilization its destalinization he told a 
news conference wednesday referring to the rigid centrally 
controlled political and economic systems that stalin devised 
in the past two years sajudisbacked candidates have defeated 
hardline communists in local and national elections and helped the 
republic win a measure of economic independence from moscow 
gorbachev for his part is treating the communist party split 
as a critical setback in his reform program the soviet leader sent 
a crew of toplevel national party officials headed by kremlin 
ideology chief vadim a medvedev to lobby lithuanian party members 
in preparation for his visit 
gorbachev last visited one of the baltic republics in february 
1987 when he traveled to riga the capital of latvia lithuanian

defense secretary dick cheney faced with 
budgetcutting pressures said today that his package of pentagon 
management reforms will save 39 billion and trim 42000 
weaponsbuying jobs over the next five years 
offering a sixmonth update on his proposals to trim the defense 
departments massive purchasing bureaucracy cheney said in a 
statement that he was aiming for major changes in the way the 
pentagon is run and in the way its purchasing system works 
weapons purchases have accounted for more than 60 billion of 
the departments 305 billion budget and involves some 580000 
civilian and uniformed personnel 
president bush asked cheney to undertake the effort over the 
summer as part of a major review spurred by the weaponsprocurement 
scandals that rocked the defense establishment 
the changes in the nature of the threat around the world and 
the realities of the budget mean that our defense budgets are 
going to be leaner in the years ahead cheneys statement said 
so every dollar that we can cut out of the cost of running the 
pentagon is a dollar we dont have to cut from force structure 
readiness or the quality of life for our men and women in uniform 
real changes are being made that we believe will improve 
pentagon management and help make it possible for us to buy what we 
need at lower cost in less time and with greater assurance of 
quality cheney told reporters 
he had few details to offer however saying he was constrained 
because disclosing precise plans must await the release of bushs 
fiscal 1991 budget later this month 
asked about the possibility of additional base closings cheney 
said extensive closures were planned to aid his overall 
costcutting effort when asked to define extensive he 
quipped more than two 
although reports had circulated recently that cheneys reforms 
would include doing away with the duplicative purchasing systems 
entrenched in the separate military services the pentagon 
announcement said the savings would be achieved primarily through 
streamlining each services purchasing system 
reducing the use of consultants and outside advisers 
creating a fulltime acquisition corps in each service that 
would report to a streamlined chain of command to top civilian 
department officials 
eliminating unnecessary paperwork 
the management improvements will generate 23 billion in 
savings for fy fiscal year 91 and an estimated 39 billion 
through fy 95 the statement said 
the improvements make it possible to trim the logistics and 
management workforce of 580000 civilians and military personnel 
and by as many as 8000 civilians and 8000 military personnel in 
fy91 and by 18000 civilian and 24000 military personnel by the 
end of fy 95 
when cheney first undertook the study some members of congress 
complained that the effort wasnt deep enough to radically reform 
the system 
meanwhile defense department sources said cheney has ordered 
other reviews of strategic policies and major aircraft programs to 
help plan longrange spending as the department faces nearcertain 
budget cuts sources said wednesday 
cheney seeking advice on the pentagons longterm strategy and 
budgets directed paul wolfowitz the undersecretary of defense for 
policy to reassess the overall defense strategy he asked john 
betti the undersecretary of defense for acquisition to review the 
pentagons most expensive aircraft projects the sources said 
in part its because of whats happening in eastern europe 
said one pentagon official who spoke on condition he not be 
identified by name 
it really puts on paper what people were asked to do months 
ago said a military source who also spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
the first official said although such studies are usually done 
continuously at the pentagon but the events in eastern europe and 
the prospect of declines in the militarys projected budget 
increases added impetus to cheneys request 
much of the militarys planning and budgets is focused on 
fighting a ussoviet war primarily in europe with nato and 
warsaw pact troops and airlifting us troops overseas for 
protracted battles 
president bushs 1991 budget to be delivered to congress later 
this month is expected to include some weapons cutbacks and call 
for a 2 percent real drop in pentagon spending 
but because of the complex pentagon budgetbuilding process it 
is not expected to reflect a major adjustment in the us military 
response to the sweeping changes in the soviet union and europe 
the source said 
so the studies expected to be sent to cheney by march will be 
used as officials begin deliberations for the fiscal 1992 budget 
cycle and for longrange planning the official added 
the military source said cheneys memorandum dated 
middecember says the review should begin from basic 
principles 
the source said the memo does not specifically mention which 
aircraft are to be studied but that it is clear the secretary is 
interested reviewing requirements for the top four billiondollar 
programs the b2 stealth bomber the c17 transport plane and the 
air force and navy advanced fighter jets still under development

an aide to gov kay orr says he mistakenly 
reported she wants to require an antidrug pledge from students at 
nebraskas public colleges and suspend students for any 
drugrelated offense 
gary rex director of the policy research office took the blame 
wednesday for what he and administration spokesman doug parrott 
said was a misunderstanding of what mrs orr wanted in the measure 
the proposal sharply criticized by some lawmakers newspapers 
and others first was described earlier this week as requiring that 
students at public colleges lose any state aid and be suspended for 
any firstoffense involving drugs it also required a preadmission 
pledge to stay drug free 
in the wake of the criticism the administration said that the 
written materials that explained the plan were wrong and that rex 
a lawyer who holds three supervisory roles in the administration 
misunderstood mrs orr 
rex said wednesday the governor wants a bill that would suspend 
a student and revoke financial aid only after a second drugrelated 
offense a first offense would simply require the student to take a 
rehabilitation course he said 
and it wasnt supposed to be a pledge or some sort of loyalty 
oath or promise to stay drugfree rex said it would simply be 
a written acknowledgment that a student would face certain 
penalties and requirements if they had a drug offense the 
governor was aghast at the talk of loyalty oaths that was going 
around 
some legislators charged that rex is too smart to have 
misunderstood the governor and that the republican governor had 
backed down under criticism 
sen ernie chambers an independent said rex was obviously 
taking the heat for the governor 
all this shows is that she will do any sort of thing and 
sacrifice anyone to avoid the political embarrassment she so richly 
deserves he said 
administration spokesmen previously acknowledged that under 
mrs orrs proposal a student convicted of a drug infraction could 
be suspended from school while someone convicted of violent crimes 
wouldnt face such a penalty

a federal judge who ordered a reduction of 
air pollution caused by such items as deodorants and hair spray 
says some of the products may have to be banned 
us district judge thelton henderson on wednesday ordered a 
reduction of four tons a day of air pollution from household 
products in the san francisco bay area by 1993 the pollution level 
was an estimated 453 tons a day in 1987 
henderson noted that a plan approved in 1982 by the us 
environmental protection agency had required such a reduction by 
1987 
rejecting proposals by local and state smog agencies to delay 
compliance until 1997 or 1999 henderson said the bay area air 
quality management district has been guilty of an appalling 
failure to take any significant action 
wednesdays ruling applies to emissions from consumer 
solvents such as air fresheners deodorants disinfectants 
aerosol paints household cleaners and hair spray 
henderson left many of the details up to state and local 
agencies but he said banning local sale of certain products would 
work especially deodorants air fresheners and household 
pesticides that have nonaerosol equivalents 
henderson said he would issue timetables shortly for reducing 
emissions from farm pesticides and lawn mowers leafblowers and 
power tools 
larry chaset a lawyer for the bay area air quality management 
district said hendersons schedule sounds impractical on the 
face of it although we think we could probably get a good 
chunk of the reductions by 1994 
he said the agency hasnt decided whether to appeal the order 
the agencies have known since 1982 that they were supposed to 
adopt a consumer solvent rule said william curtiss lawyer for 
the sierra club legal defense fund they have done nothing but 
think about it 
the court i think is sending a pretty strong message that 
more of the same is not going to be regarded as adequate 
compliance he said

president bush today told portuguese prime 
minister anibal cavaco silva that the united states appreciates his 
countrys efforts to help end the fighting in angola and get peace 
talks resumed 
when peace and stability come to that region as certainly we 
hope they will portugal will have an important role in the 
reconstruction process bush told cavaco silva in a farewell 
statement after talks in the oval office and a luncheon 
the prime minister said he briefed bush on his talks with the 
leaders of the angolan and mozambique governments cavaco silva 
said he had expressed the hope that if all interested parties 
show a positive attitude it will be possible to put an end to the 
conflict that exacts such a heavy toll on the peoples in those two 
african countries 
bush called portugal a close and enduring ally and said 
their talks had been productive the prime minister said he wanted 
a broader and deeper relationship with the united states 
the impasse in talks between the sovietbacked government 
supported by portugal and the unita rebels armed by the united 
states had been expected to be a significant part of discussions 
between bush and cavaco silva 
a senior portuguese diplomat flew to angola last week for 
discussions with the president of the former portuguese colony 
eduardo jose dos santos in advance of cavaco silvas washington 
trip 
the portuguese leader who arrived in washington on wednesday 
is bringing bush lots of information about the situation there 
and angolas views said an aide to the prime minister 
a truce between the angolan government and unita broke down last 
summer and efforts since then to hold peace talks have failed 
despite intense us lobbying on tuesday the state department 
chastised the soviet union for supporting a angolan government 
offensive against unita that began dec 23 
we welcome an active portuguese involvement in bringing the 
two sides together said a senior administration official who 
briefed reporters about cavaco silvas visit he spoke on condition 
of anonymity 
despite differences over us support for unita the union for 
the total independence of angola led by jonas savimbi the 
official stressed both countries are now eager to seek peace in the 
african nation 
cavaco silvas aide who also spoke on condition of anonymity 
said the prime minister also hoped to reassure bush that the 
economic integration of the 12nation european economic community 
by 1992 will not exclude american products and services 
cavaco silvas visit is meant to highlight the rapid growth of 
us investment in portugal which doubled to more than 1 billion 
from 1988 to 1989 the american official said an agreement on 
investment is to be signed thursday 
also on the agenda was a preliminary discussion on renewing the 
us rights for use of portugals lajes air force base in the 
azores islands the eightyear agreement expires next year and the 
official predicted prospects for renewal are pretty good 
lajes is a strategic refueling depot for us military aircraft 
and is also used to track soviet submarine activity in the atlantic 
bush and cavaco silva were also to focus on the role of the 
north atlantic treaty organization in light of the changes in 
eastern europe and soviet disarmament proposals portugal is an 
active member of the 16nation atlantic alliance 
cavaco silva was to meet with defense secretary dick cheney 
later in the day on the agenda was a us program to modernize the 
portuguese armed forces 
the us official said some of the modernization will be funded 
by the annual military aid appropriated by congress for portugal 
the assistance for this year is 100 million and will probably 
decline slightly next year in light of budget constraints the 
official said

the man chosen to enforce chicagos ethics laws 
resigned today one day after officials learned he had been 
implicated in alleged campaign fundraising violations in 
louisiana the city board of ethics said 
gary m oneill who started work as executive director of the 
board of ethics on dec 12 has a cloud over his head and 
therefore he cant act as ethics director said albert hofeld 
chairman of the board 
oneill was expected to release a statement later in the day 
oneill who helped louisianas commissioner of insurance doug 
green finance his successful 1987 campaign was a defendant in a 
lawsuit by the louisiana board of ethics for elected officials the 
lawsuit accused green of attempting to conceal the source of 22 
million in contributions to his 1987 campaign 
the lawsuit was thrown out of court last year when the louisiana 
ethics boards enforcement provisions were declared 
unconstitutional by a state judge a rehearing of the issue is 
pending before the louisiana supreme court 
word of those allegations came as a surprise wednesday to 
chicago officials the board had hired oneill a lawyer last 
month after a threemonth search that involved 200 applicants 
i am unaware of these allegations but most assuredly they 
will be looked into hofeld said wednesday 
we viewed him as the best candidate and we were impressed with 
his credentials and with his abilities and we will examine 
whatever charges are brought to our attention 
the agency enforces the citys ethics and campaign disclosure 
ordinances

grand jury that is investigating possible criminal wrongdoing 
surrounding the collapse of an insurance agency that was regulated 
by greens office 
louisiana investigators said the subpoena was never delivered 
because oneill could not be found the statetimes of baton rouge

havent been running my leaving was happenstance it was not

federal scientists are not sure despite two 
months of investigation why more than 1000 people have gotten 
sick after taking the health food supplement ltryptophan 
the protein component widely taken as a nutritional supplement 
was linked in november to a rare painful blood disorder known as 
eosinophiliamyalgia syndrome which suddenly started mushrooming 
in new mexico 
within weeks of those reports cases were spotted in 49 states 
all but alaska as of tuesday 1046 had been reported to the 
centers for disease control one fatality has been confirmed and 
at least six more deaths are believed linked to ltryptophan 
the disorder is marked by an abnormally high number of white 
blood cells called eosinophils and causes severe muscle pain or 
myalgia 
scientists at the cdc and the food and drug administration 
quickly began trying to determine if the illnesses were being 
caused by ltryptophan itself or by some contaminant that got into 
batches of the product 
theyre still trying 
we together with the fda have done all the obvious things 
said dr ed kilbourne chief of the health studies branch of the 
cdcs environmental hazards division that includes evaluating 
the relationship of specific samples to cases and looking at the 
relevant lab analysis for major contaminants 
and they dont show anything obvious 
the fda also acted to get the product sold in several 
preparations under numerous brand names off the shelves of health 
food stores and drug stores 
people have taken ltryptophan for years but the problem 
apparently started just last year cases dont point to any 
particular manufacturer brand or lot number 
the epidemiology suggests its a contaminant kilbourne 
said a relatively large number of cases seemed to mushroom this 
past summer and that suggests that something happened 
so far investigators havent found any signs of contamination 
but negative lab results or not theres got to be something 
there kilbourne said 
this is not a simple contamination investigation case like 
trying to find poison in a capsule where it isnt supposed to be 
because researchers dont know what they are looking for yet 
kilbourne said 
this is just a thorny scientific problem he said 
researchers with the atlantabased cdc are retracing their steps 
to see if they missed something small maybe the odd 
chromatographic peak that didnt seem significant before 
kilbourne said were reevaluating all those things 
were just looking for anything identified as a potential 
contaminant said chris lecos an fda spokesman in washington 
the answer lies somewhere in the laboratory i suspect 
the fda issued a recall request for ltryptophan nov 17 and 
expanded it nov 21 to block importation of the product 
for the most part it appears to us that most of the 
manufacturers and distributors and retail stores have complied with 
the recall request lecos said 
we do know that some retail operations and a few manufacturers 
are not heeding the recall request he said adding that the fda 
is contemplating seizure actions against seven companies although 
no action has been taken yet

met in a bid to resolve a violent 10weekold walkout 
both police and union officials confirmed the arrests in 
pretoria of members of the south african railways and harbor 
workers union neither side had figures on exactly how many men 
were taken into custody 
about 25000 rail workers all black have been striking the

agriculture secretary clayton yeutters 
remarks about iowas drought were meant as a joke but his iowa 
counterpart isnt amused 
secretary yeutter unfortunately has chosen to make iowa the 
butt of his jokes iowa agriculture secretary dale cochran said 
thursday the 60 percent of iowans who earn their living directly 
or indirectly from agriculture arent laughing 
yeutter made the remarks wednesday at a republican fundraiser 
in topeka kan attended by senate minority leader robert dole 
rkan 
iowans define drought a little differently than we do in 
kansas and nebraska said yeutter who grew up in nebraska it 
really has to be dry to have a drought here in iowa as bob put 
it its a question of whether it rained yesterday or not if it 
didnt rain yesterday theyre having a drought 
yeutter visited iowa on may 30 to tour areas suffering from the 
states lingering drought southern iowa where yeutter visited 
received its only measurable rainfall of the month the night before 
he arrived cochran said 
each time as we came into land water was standing 
everywhere yeutter said of the trip they were having a little 
hard time persuading me that they had a huge drought problem 
but they kept saying well but its the subsoil moisture you 
know it may well be wet on top but its really dry down below 
they got a huge digger and they dug down about eight feet and they 
never did find any dry dirt 
cochran said 1989 was the seventhdriest year in iowa in 117 
years of record keeping in the state he said 1988 and 1989 have 
gone down as the driest twoyear period ever in iowa

a federal judge today blocked sections of 
pennsylvanias new abortion law from taking effect tuesday the law 
contains the toughest abortion restrictions in the nation 
us district judge daniel h huyett iii issued an injunction 
against requirements that women notify their husbands and wait 24 
hours before an abortion 
the judge left intact sections banning abortions after the 24th 
week of pregnancy and abortions to select the sex of the child 
said robert gentzel spokesman for state attorney general ernie 
preate jr 
the american civil liberties union the womens law project and 
planned parenthood said the order was a victory in their first 
round against the new law 
for the moment in pennsylvania abortion remains safe and 
legal but we have to fight to keep it this way kathryn kolbert 
an aclu attorney said in a statement 
in passing the law last fall pennsylvania became the first 
state to take advantage of a us supreme court ruling in july 
allowing states to put more curbs on abortion 
huyett in blocking some of the new sections actually amended 
an injunction first issued in 1988 against an earlier version of 
pennsylvanias abortion law planned parenthood and some abortion 
clinics had challenged the earlier law in court and amended their 
lawsuit after passage of the new tougher law 
the injunction remains in effect while the lawsuit is decided 
gov robert p casey today said he believes the entire law will 
pass constitutional muster 
antiabortion leaders have said the law could present the us 
supreme court with an avenue to reconsider the roe vs wade 
decision which established abortion as a constitutional right in 
1973 
the author of the law rep stephen freind said it placed 
prochoice groups in a dilemma if the law went unchallenged the 
provisions would go into effect if they challenged it the case 
might lead the high court to further erode abortion protections he 
said 
were in a noloss situation theyre are in a nowin 
situation said freind a republican from suburban philadelphia 
and the legislatures leading abortion foe

how many chickens would a chicken plucker 
pluck if a chicken plucker had a place to sell them in bismarck 
at least 500 more a week says an owner of the states only 
poultry plant 
mike schmidt of samps poultry says bismarck ordinances are keeping 
his chickens out of supermarkets and limiting the work of his 
plucking machine which can pluck about 60 pounds of chickens in 30 
seconds 
bismarck is the only city in north dakota we cannot run our 
chickens in schmidt said 
he plans to ask the city commission on tuesday to change its 
meat inspection laws but city officials are resisting saying the 
laws protect consumers 
city sanitation coordinator mel fischer said bismarcks 
ordinance requires all meat to be inspected and stamped with a 
retail code schmidts poultry processing plant is federally 
inspected but it lacks an onsite inspector and facilities for 
such an inspector 
the inspector would be an employee of the federal department of 
agriculture but schmidt would have to provide an office and 
restroom and pay overtime wages for inspections 
we have plans for doing it in the future but right now money 
is tight schmidt said 
ironically schmidt started his business in mott in western 
north dakota nearly three years ago with his brother and 
brotherinlaw after their wives saw a television news report about 
the unclean processing of chickens they were shocked at the high 
incidence of salmonella bacteria contamination and the sloppy 
manner in which chickens were cleaned and cooled 
samps works to avoid those problems schmidt said 
one bismarck grocer is interested in selling 500 chickens a 
week he said the company sells to 30 stores in the state

thousands of ugandans have fled a 
northern border town fearing the spread of fighting from sudans 
civil war officials said thursday 
loic flachet a kampala representative of the french relief 
group doctors without borders said 11 french volunteers were among 
those who took flight from the town of moyo 
brig moses ali ugandas minister for culture who represents 
the moyo district in parliament confirmed the exodus but was 
unable to say how many of the estimated 40000 residents of moyo 
took part the town is about 280 miles from kampala and six miles 
from the sudan border 
the guide newspaper reported in kampala that the civilians began 
fleeing in the middle of last week when they heard gunfire near the 
town the number increased after two military aircraft flew over 
moyo on saturday 
flachet said the relief team safely fled dec 5 to adjumani 27 
miles to the south and would remain there until the situation in 
moyo returned to normal they had been treating ugandans for 
sleeping sickness a disease transmitted by tsetse flies 
the guide newspaper said residents were afraid of a repeat of a 
bombing in moyo by sudanese aircraft three months ago that killed 
six civilians 
a spokesman at army headquarters in kampala said neither the 
southern sudan rebels nor sudan government troops had entered 
ugandan territory 
the situation is normal as far as the international border is 
concerned the officer said speaking on condition of anonymity 
fighting between sudanese troops and the rebel sudan peoples 
liberation army has flared in recent months after a de facto 
ceasefire to permit a unsponsored emergency foodlift to 
southern sudan 
on monday the rebels claimed its fighters had captured a 
garrison town of kajokaji 18 miles north of moyo 
the rebels often seek sanctuary in northern uganda raising 
tension on the border 
on dec 29 a sudanese army armored vehicle and six truckloads 
of soldiers crossed six miles inside uganda in the moyo area 
ugandan president yoweri museveni and a sixmember sudanese 
delegation agreed tuesday that the countries should each establish 
units to monitor security violations along the common border 
the sudanese rebels took up arms in 1983 against the 
moslemdominated khartoum government to press for increased 
autonomy for the predominantly animist and christian south

more than twothirds of americans surveyed 
said they favor a consitutional limitation on the number of years a 
person can serve in congress according to a gallup survey released 
thursday 
the poll conducted for the national federation of independent 
business found 70 percent of respondents favored in general a 
limitation on house and senate members while 28 percent opposed 
and 2 percent had no opinion 
asked if they would support establishing a 12year limit on 
service in the house and senate 58 percent said yes and 40 percent 
opposed 
the national federation of independent businesses an 
association of small business owners also had the gallup 
organization inc put the questions to members of congresss it 
reported surveying 158 of the 435 house members and finding 73 
percent opposed and 23 percent favored a 12year limitation 
it surveyed 21 of 100 senators and found 52 percent favored a 
limitation and 48 percent opposed but the gallup organization 
said it surveyed too few for the results to be considered a 
reliable reflection of senate opinion 
the poll found 62 percent of total respondents favored 
establishing a mandatory retirement age for members of congress 
while 37 percent opposed nine out of 10 house and senate members 
surveyed opposed an age limit 
george gallup who presented the results at a news conference 
said the findings were consistent with 50 years of surveying of 
attitudes about congress by his organization 
the survey of 750 people was conducted nationally by telephone 
in december and january and had a stated margin of error of plus or 
minus 4 to 5 percentage points according to the business group 
there was no margin listed for the survey of members of congress

some 126 counties that got aid for the 
homeless last year through a program created by congress have been 
dropped for 1990 they include 20 with doubledigit unemployment 
and one with a poverty rate of 427 percent 
advocates for the homeless as well as local officials in the 30 
states hit by the cutback are protesting but program 
administrators say they are merely fulfilling a mandate to target 
the aid to the nations worstoff areas 
congress didnt cut funds for the 1249 million emergency food 
and shelter national board program the 126 jurisdictions lost out 
when they fell below eligibility levels for local poverty 
unemployment or the size of the overall labor force some may still 
get limited grants from a separate fund set aside for underfunded 
areas 
twentyeight new counties became eligible this year 
the rejected counties are as large as oklahomas tulsa county 
including the city of tulsa and as small as madison parish la 
madison has unemployment and poverty rates of 16 percent and 
427 percent respectively but the parish which got 22000 in 
1989 lost its eligibility because it had fewer than the required 
total of 1000 people unemployed according to the programs 
figures 
told the list said there were 883 jobless people in madison 
parish administrative assistant geneva jones said i know its 
more than that but whatever the exact figure she said the loss 
of money would hurt the elderly in her area 
most of them are on fixed incomes and by the time they pay 
their utilities they dont have enough for adequate food she 
said in a telephone interview 
the united way was no happier in the urban county of tulsa 
where officials complained to federal administrators in a nov 30 
letter while on the face of it this denial would seem to be a 
positive reflection of an improving local economy nothing could be 
further from the truth 
program staff director wylie b cooper said in an interview 
communities change in whats happening last year texas was 
incredibly hard hit and this year it is beginning to recover that 
happens all over the country because the money is designated for 
the most critical need areas 
but jim cieslar of tulsas united way said there have been new 
oil company layoffs in his area 
the national programs cooper said that the system was designed 
to supplement and extend efforts on behalf of the homeless and 
that the government cannot guarantee funding to individual counties 
beyond one year 
the flip side of predictability is being unable to respond to 
change cooper said 
but rep paul kanjorski dpa said you dont suddenly 
become a nonneedy area there ought to be a way to come down 
slowly 
grant money may be used to buy and distribute food run homeless 
shelters assist with mortgages or help the poor pay energy bills 
counties dont apply for grants rather they are told if the 
formula qualifies them for money and then must come up with a 
spending plan 
this year 882 counties automatically qualified for aid compared 
with 980 in 1989 said program aide sharon bailey 
the national alliance to end homelessness a private research 
and assistance group estimates as many as 2 million people are 
homeless for at least a portion of the year and says the number 
seems to be growing 
to learn at this time just as winter weather is beginning to 
grip our area that we will not have the resources to meet the 
needs presented to us by these very vulnerable individuals and 
families is disappointing to say the least theresa zogby 
supervisor of catholic social services of hazleton pa said in a 
letter last month to kanjorski 
her county luzerne received about 230000 last year but 
nothing this year despite a poverty rate above the 11 percent in 
the guidelines luzerne was declared ineligible because the labor 
force in wilkesbarre its largest city did not exceed 25000 
cooper said the rule would be reversed if the national board 
determines at its jan 19 meeting that it is unfairly preventing 
needy counties from obtaining funding 
madison luzerne and the other counties and parishes may still 
get aid from setaside funds although probably not as much as last 
year those funds representing 15 percent of total program 
expenditures are administered by state boards trying to cushion 
the blow for communities whose eligibility has expired cooper said 
the setaside money is considered an important backstop 
ohio had the most dropped counties with 15 there were 13 in 
illinois 11 in texas and nine in north carolina 
the dropped counties or parishes with doubledigit unemployment 
rates the program said were edgar fayette union wayne and 
white in illinois grayson johnson and letcher lincoln and 
montgomery in kentucky madison plaquemines and union in 
louisiana washington in missouri cibola and san miguel in new 
mexico adams and pike in ohio and lincoln and upshur in west 
virginia 
the food and shelter program is governed by a national board 
composed of representatives of the united way of america catholic 
charities usa the american red cross and other charitable 
organizations 
the program has generated praise from communities for bypassing 
state bureaucracies and providing money directly to agencies that 
serve the homeless

ice from a leaky lavatory caused a rear jet engine 
to shear off a northwest airlines airliner over northern florida 
last week federal investigators have determined 
blue fluid from the forward lavatory leaked outside froze 
because of the low temperature at 35000 feet broke off and 
slammed into the compressor blades of the right rear engine on the 
threeengine boeing 727 national transportation safety board 
investigator andrew alston said wednesday 
the ice broke eight blades in the engines lowpressure 
compressor and the damage multiplied through other blades until 
vibration made the three bolts holding the engine to the planes 
tail section break off as they are designed to do to prevent 
damage to the fuselage altson said 
airline and government officials had speculated that was the 
cause

crew at tampa international airport on jan 4 about 90 minutes 
after it had taken off from miami bound for minneapolis 
the 3500pound pratt amp whitney engine was found the next day on 
a cattle ranch in rural madison county near the floridageorgia

president bush on wednesday welcomed the 
lifting of martial law in china as a very positive move 
despite congressional criticism that it was a meaningless gesture 
by beijing 
bush took the opposite view of those saying the chinese showed 
no indication they were improving their stance on human rights and 
reforms 
i view the lifting of martial law as a very sound step the 
president told reporters during an oval office photo session for 
those who are interested in the human rights and reform that was on 
the move that wed all like to see go forward theres no way you 
can look at that but say its very positive 
of course we welcome the lifting of martial law as a good 
sign he said 
critics took a different view of chinas announcement it would 
lift the martial law put into place last spring during a brutal 
crackdown on thousands of prodemocracy demonstrators 
on capitol hill some have derided the lifting of martial law as 
smokeandmirrors and an empty gesture noting that china still 
retains tough antiprotest laws and surveillance of university 
campuses as well as a strong presence by its army in the streets of 
beijing 
in addition china did not include the tibetan capital of lhasa 
in its lifting of martial law beijing said the situation was 
different in lhasa where buddhist monks have suffered repression 
for demonstrating for religious freedoms and independence tibet 
has been under martial law since the outbreak of proindependence 
riots in march 
bush on thursday did not indicate whether he considered the move 
enough of a step to spur further lifting of the sanctions he 
imposed in june when the chinese government mowed down 
demonstrators with tanks killing hundreds perhaps thousands in 
the streets 
we will continue to watch this situation very closely he 
said 
on wednesday the administration announced that it would review 
on a casebycase basis world bank loans to china for humanitarian 
causes but would continue to oppose loans to china for projects 
that marked a shift from the initial position on sanctions 
which made no mention of evaluating humanitarian loans the state 
department has said the partial easing of the sanctions was 
unrelated to chinas lifting of martial law 
among 780 million worth of pending world bank loans to china is 
a 25 million loan for earthquake relief bank spokesman peter 
riddleberger said thursday the bank board had no discussions 
scheduled on the loan 
bush has come under fire for what critics say was his failure to 
come down hard on china the country where he served as us 
representative in the mid1970s 
although he announced in june he was banning highlevel contacts 
with beijing as part of the sanctions bush secretly dispatched 
national security adviser brent scowcroft and deputy secretary of 
state lawrence eagleburger to beijing twice in subsequent months to 
explore the possibilities of renewing relations

until jan 1 the only member of the family of 
charles stuart who knew of his plot to kill his pregnant wife was 
the youngest brother who linked him to the crime an attorney said 
thursday 
they knew nothing they did nothing they saw nothing they 
touched nothing attorney richard clayman said of other family 
members at a news conference attended by stuarts siblings michael 
mark shelley and neysa only matthew stuart who turned his 
brother in did not attend 
the appearance that has evolved in my judgment is that there 
was some kind of conspiracy that is not true and these people 
want you and the dimaiti family and eveyrone else to know that is 
so said clayman who represents michael stuart but spoke on 
behalf of the family 
clayman said his client would tell a grand jury anything they 
want to know i am comfortable that there is no violation of law 
that his hands are legally clean 
he also said the stuart family wanted people to know they 
loved carol stuart and that their family and her parents eveylyn 
and giusto dimaiti had suffered greatly 
he said that on looking back michael stuart had a disjointed 
vague conversation with charles stuart but that it had no 
significance at the time 
in retrospect after examining all the data there an argument 
can be made that it had some significance he said 
since the case began unraveling last week the street outside 
the stuart family home in revere has been the daily assembly point 
for neighbors and about a dozen reporters and photographers 
stuart told police after the oct 23 shooting that he and his 
wife carol were attacked by a mugger as they left a birthing 
class at a city hospital but in a stunning turnaround last week 
his brother matthew implicated him in the death saying he met 
charles stuart at the crime scene and retrieved mrs stuarts 
handbag which contained personal items and the gun 
matthew stuart who has said he did not realize a shooting had 
occurred when he took the items told his lawyer he had shared his 
suspicions about his brother with family and friends 
a transcript of a telephone conversation between michael and a 
sister shelley yandoli recorded on firehouse communications 
equipment revealed that the parents and another sister neysa 
porter did not know of stuarts plot until the family assembled 
jan 2 to discuss it with the parents 
meanwhile divers searched the pines river again thursday for 
clues in the plot which may have evolved from little more than 
stuarts feeling that his wife and baby would hinder his dreams of 
being a bigtime restaurateur 
police divers recovered the handbag shortly after stuart 
committed suicide jan 4 by jumping from the tobin bridge into 
boston harbor and tuesday they found a snubnosed 38caliber 
revolver believed used in the crime 
prosecutors have refused to say whether anyone might be charged 
in the crime saying the investigation is continuing a grand jury 
is to convene friday on the case 
authorities have investigated whether stuart might have plotted 
the murder so he could collect money from insurance policies on his 
wife stuart received 82000 from one policy due his wife from her 
job as a tax attorney he had taken out at least one other policy 
on her for 100000 that was being processed when he committed 
suicide

the 15month freeze on promotions in the 
dallas fire department should be continued at least until a 
discrimination lawsuit against the department goes to trial an 
attorney for black firefighters told a federal appeals court 
thursday 
right now the system isnt even fair among blacks black 
firefighters who are getting through may not be the ones who would 
if the system was fair attorney roger albright told a 
threejudge panel of the 5th us circuit court of appeals 
craig hopkins argued for the city of dallas that the 220member 
black fire fighters association of dallas has not proved that its 
members would suffer irreparable harm without a freeze on 
promotions in addition he said the case shouldnt even be before 
the 5th circuit yet because the black firefighters havent 
exhausted their civil service appeals 
the judges did not indicate when they would rule 
the departments freeze on promotions began in october 1988 a 
month after the black firefighters sued the department alleging 
racial discrimination the city has since enacted a new affirmative 
action plan for the department but the black firefighters say it 
doesnt go far enough 
during the promotion freeze the city has filled the need for 
supervisors by temporarily promoting lowerlevel workers 
us district judge robert w porter rejected the black groups 
request for an order continuing the freeze on promotions pending 
the trial but both sides agreed to continue the freeze while the 
black group appealed to the 5th circuit albright said 
porter is in ill health attorneys told the judges and they 
dont know when the discrimination case may go to trial 
hal gillespie attorney for the predominantly white dallas 
firefighters group who joined the city in arguing that the freeze 
should be discontinued said people who already qualified for 
promotion are losing out because the promotion lists have expired 
when the lawsuit was filed albright said after the hearing 
blacks made up 35 percent of the citys population but 17 percent 
of the 1700 people in the fire department 
out of 367 drivers the first level up from fire and rescue 
workers 17 percent were black five of 121 lieutenants or rougly 
4 percent were black as were six of 182 captains or 3 percent 
and one of 22 battalion chiefs or 4 percent 
blacks contend that a major reason for the disparity is that 
promotion exams ask for knowledge beyond what is useful for each 
level the exam for driver for instance includes questions about 
building codes and construction said albright 
our point of view is that the exams test for things that a 
firefighter ought to know at any level hopkins said after the 
hearing 
during the hearing senior judge john r brown asked hopkins if 
dallas hadnt contradicted its legal stand by adopting an 
affirmative action plan calling for blacks to get 25 percent of all 
fire department promotions 
the plan approved by the city council expands the pool of 
eligible minorities for promotion by putting less emphasis on 
seniority and test scores and more on affirmative action the 
council also agreed to spend more than 400000 to reevaluate 
hiring and promotion tests 
this is not the first affirmative action plan its a 
modification and continuation of previous efforts hopkins 
responded it is not an admission of wrongdoing but that there 
can always be improvements

after a twoyear dispute over 
pesky ducks the city has committed itself to helping residents who 
want to drive them from an exclusive beach community 
city commissioners voted 41 monday to let residents in the 
woodlands area capture ducks on their property call the city and 
have the ducks picked up and released unharmed in a rural area 
when asked wednesday about what the program would cost 
taxpayers city manager max royle said twenty bucks a duck 
commissioner paul von ins had introduced a petition with 39 
signatures asking the commission to come up with a way to enforce a 
decision made in june to drive the muscovy ducks out of the 
neighborhood 
mayor pete dobson cast the dissenting vote saying produck 
forces had not been given the opportunity to respond to the 
petition 
the dispute began in january 1988 when the commission voted to 
reduce the duck population from 150 to 20 after some residents 
complained that the ugly mottled birds defecated on their lawns 
mated in public and acted aggressively toward other animals others 
felt the ducks predated homeowners in the area and had every right 
to stay 
gradually the population was reduced to six or seven as a 
special duck committee approved the snatching of duck eggs to keep 
them from hatching and even arranged for the removal of some of 
the adults von ins said however that the population could 
rebound

jurors who heard a long court battle between 
houston power amp lighting and the city of austin have been invited 
on an expensepaid trip to see the nuclear power plant that was the 
focus of last summers trial 
the jury had ruled that the utility didnt have to pay the city 
damages 
some austin officials questioned the plans propriety 
the utility confirmed that about a month ago it had invited the 
dallas jurors and retired appellate court judge clarence guittard 
who presided over the fourmonth trial to visit the south texas 
nuclear project plant at hlampp expense the houston chronicle 
reported thursday 
this is a bunch of people who spent an inordinate amount of 
time studying the plant and never got a chance to see it said 
hlampp spokesman graham painter 
the jurors decided in july that although hlampp denied information 
to one of its partners in the stnp the city of austin austin 
deserved no damage payments austin had sought 419 million and is 
appealing the jurys decision the trial was held in dallas after a 
judge decided a fair trial could not be held in austin 
painter said the company decided that jurors should stay 
overnight in houston because of the time it takes to get from 
dallas to the plant site at bay city 90 miles southwest of houston 
he said hlampp has reserved 19 rooms in the westin oaks at the 
galleria where single rooms run 150 a night during the week and 
half that on weekends 
were awfully proud of our plant and wed like to show it 
off painter said besides he said they are the only people 
in texas who are certain never to serve on an stp jury again so 
theres no reason they shouldnt go on a plant tour 
juror kathy lamarr agreed i want to see what it was we were 
talking about all that time 
but some austin officials are outraged 
its highly unprofessional and very questionable until the 
people of texas realize that this sort of shenanigans cost the 
people hundreds of millions of dollars it wont stop said 
austin city councilman george humphrey 
when you have a jury that rules the defendant is guilty and 
awards no damages and a short time later theyre offered free air 
fare free lodging free meals and firstclass treatment it cant 
help but cast a doubt humphrey said 
ive never heard of this happening in civil litigation i 
think its fundamentally unethical but so what else is new said 
councilman smoot carlmitchell 
austin claimed in the trial that hlampp withheld information from 
its partners that would have lead the city to move to cancel 
construction of the plant before its cost ballooned from 900 
million to almost 6 billion not counting interest costs on 
construction that lasted 17 years 
during the trial specialists in engineering accounting and law 
were called on and jurors were shown a milliondollar scale model 
of the nuclear power plant

communist premier hans modrow on thursday 
defended his plan for a new internal security force and tried to 
quell growing dissent by indicating the opposition could have a 
part in his government 
thousands of people formed a human chain around parliament after 
modrows speech to legislators and a noncommunist partner in the 
coalition government repeated threats to quit the cabinet 
an independent trade union movement threatened to call a 
nationwide strike jan 25 if modrow fails to prove the state secret 
police force has been dissolved 
in a nearly 90minute speech before the national parliament 
modrow defended his authority and appealed for national unity to 
fight the economic and political problems threatening his shaky 
government which came to power after the fall prodemocracy 
movement 
i cannot recall becoming premier through a coup he said 
modrow did not rule out the resignation of his transitional 
government for compelling reasons but said he expected it to 
last until nationwide elections planned may 6 
during the meeting parliament dismissed state security chief 
lt gen wolfgang schwanitz whose agency the government promised 
last month to dissolve 
the hated secret police popularly known as stasi used 
repressive measures to help ensure 40 years of communist control 
government officials say about 26000 of the 85000 state 
security employees have been taken off the payroll opposition 
groups want guarantees the force will be disarmed and assurances 
former agents will not have a part in a new agency 
the aim is not to maintain the old structure of state 
security modrow said 
but he told parliament there cannot be a security vacuum 
and cited violence by neonazi groups as well as terrorism drugs 
and ecological crime 
modrow urged the opposition to make suggestions about how it 
would be prepared to participate directly and responsibly in the 
work of the government with competent personalities 
however modrow did not say when or in what form such 
participation could take place 
he offered to have parliament supervise the new security agency 
and dissolution of its predecessor 
within hours the liberal democrats a noncommunist partner in 
the government repeated their threat to leave 
there can be no compromise with us on the secret police 
issue said party spokesman werner fahlenkamp 
two other noncommunist parties in government have threatened to 
quit over the issue 
several thousand opposition supporters chanting and holding 
candles formed a human chain around the parliament building 
demonstrators lowered several east german flags from their poles 
and ripped out the communist symbol from the centers 
representatives of the initiative for labor union reform 
which claims 70000 members called for modrows resignation and 
the freezing of communist party assets 
they threatened to call a nationwide warning strike jan 25 to 
demonstrate their strength if they are not convinced the security 
agency has been dissolved 
earlier east berlin construction workers staged such a strike 
which lasted one hour and marched through the city center the adn 
news agency said 2000 workers at a farm equipment factory in 
erfurt also staged a strike thursday 
modrow responding to the warning strikes announced the 
government would suspend a plan for state aid to internal security 
employees who lost their jobs 
for the first time opposition members sat as observers in 
thursdays parliament session modrows speech was broadcast live 
on east german and west german tv 
news reports had said modrow was considering calling for a 
national referendum to gauge the public support for his government 
before may but he made no mention of this 
several old guard communists in the 500seat parliament lost 
their seats to younger deputies thursday those ousted included 
guenther schabowski a former politburo member and close associate

the plo on thursday accused fighters of a 
proiranian militia of killing a palestinian guerrilla and wounding 
three others deployed to quell battles between shiite moslem 
militias in south lebanon 
the fundamentalist hezbollah or party of god issued a 
statement in beirut denying the plo charge and said its fighters 
did not fire a single shot on palestinian positions 
but a sunni moslem cleric sheik maher hammoud who maintains 
close ties with hezbollah said fundamentalist fighters fired at 
the palestinians on the strategic hamade hill which overlooks the 
forward lines of hezbollah and its rival militia the syrianbacked 
amal 
the militias have been fighting intermittently since may 1987 
for dominance of lebanons 12 million shiites the latest battles 
have been waged on the fringes of plo strongholds in south 
lebanons iqlim altuffah or apple province 
about 700 members of yasser arafats fatah movement were 
deployed last week to try to disengage the warring factions and no 
major clashes have occurred since monday between the militias 
the plo claimed hezbollah gunners opened fire on a plo 
disengagement force wednesday killing one guerrilla and wounding 
three 
the commander of the fatah force identified only as col abu 
fadi said the guerrillas will be forced to return fire to defend 
ourselves if hezbollah fires on them again 
a police spokesman who cannot be named under standing 
regulations said hezbollah believes the plo intervention has 
helped amal and stopped hezbollah from taking the entire region 
police could not confirm the palestinian casualties they said 
the bodies of two slain hezbollah fighters were found early 
thursday in iqlim altuffah 
the police spokesman said the two men were apparently 
slaughtered by amal militiamen after being taken captive 
police said one hezbollah gunman was also killed and two amal 
militiamen were wounded in a brief shootout in the village of arki 
six miles southwest from the main area of fighting 
the casualties excluding the palestinians upped the overall 
toll to 97 dead and 277 wounded since the current round of clashes 
broke out dec 23 
fatahs political chief in the southern city of sidon zeid 
wehbe refused a hezbollah appeal for the withdrawal of arafats 
men from iqlim altuffah 
we are not an occupying force to be asked to withdraw wehbe 
said in a statement published in several beirut newspapers 
we are a disengagement force when fighting is over and its 
consequences are solved we will return to our previous bases he 
was quoted as saying by the independent annahar daily 
irans deputy foreign minister mohammad ali besharati who is 
in beirut trying to enforce a ceasefire has warned of the dangers 
of the palestinians expansion in iqlim altuffah and called on 
them to withdraw promptly to their nearby refugee camps 
but sources from both shiite factions spoke of a deadlock 
in public statements amal chieftain nabih berri insists on an 
unconditional withdrawal of hezbollah from all territories it 
conquered during the latest round of fighting 
hezbollah has offered a gradual withdrawal coinciding with 
negotiations on finding a way for both militias to exist in the 
region 
there was sporadic sniper fire interspersed with blasts from 
rocketpropelled grenades thursday but no casualties were reported

orange production is expected to drop 24 
percent this season to fewer than 158 million boxes the 
agriculture department said thursday 
the new estimate based on jan 1 conditions and reflecting the 
severe freeze damage in florida and texas over the holiday season 
was 19 percent below the dec 1 estimate 
overall citrus production including oranges and grapefruit is 
expected to decline 25 percent from the 198889 season to 963 
million tons the report said the january estimate is down 18 
percent from december 
this significant reduction is due mostly to the severe 
freezing temperatures in the florida and texas citrus belts the 
report said fruit droppage is increasing in all areas of 
florida texas fresh market citrus harvest has ended

when johnny sylvesters father wanted a second 
opinion about his sick boy he consulted babe ruth the baseball 
legends treatment was unorthodox a 1926 world series home run 
john dale sylvester 74 died monday but ruths purported 
promise and delivery of a home run lives on memorialized in 
newspapers biographies and on film though wildly distorted 
so many things about babe ruth have become like greek 
mythology baseball historian don honig said after hearing of 
sylvesters death 
sylvester died at a hospital on new yorks long island no cause 
of death was given 
according to news reports from the time sylvester was kicked in 
the head by a horse suffering a lifethreatening injury which left 
the 11yearold boy bedridden in essex fells nj 
johnny reportedly told his father manhattan bank vice president 
horace sylvester gee i wish i could see babe ruth wallop a 
homer before i die 
the elder sylvester contacted ruths team the new york yankees 
in st louis via telegram recounting his sons request 
autographed balls from the yankees and the st louis cardinals were 
sent to the lad ruth wrote on one ball ill hit a home run for 
you in wednesdays game 
the sultan of swat then hit three homers in the yankees 105 
fourth game victory over the cardinals johnnys doctors reported 
the boy had bounced back remarkably from his illness and a legend 
was born sylvester quickly became americas most famous invalid 
that and the called home run those two specific incidents 
are probably the best known ruth stories said robert creamer 
author of the biography babe 
the incident is sort of characteristic of ruth he had a great 
sort of ingenious quality about him said creamer hed do 
things like this sometimes with great publicity sometimes with no 
publicity 
when william bendix portrayed the bambino on film the story 
had ruth bedside with a dying boy when the home run was promised 
it was far from accurate but as creamer noted that was a pretty 
bad movie 
one week later ruth visited the lad johnny well aware that 
ruth had been caught stealing for the final out in the yankees 
series loss told the babe im sorry the yanks lost 
sylvester went on to attend princeton university serve in world 
war ii and become president of packing machinery business his 
son john jr said his dad remained a yankees fan until the end 
slyvester is also survived by a sister and a brother 
the whole johnny sylvester story apparently had little effect on 
the babe according to creamers biography ruth was sitting around 
with a couple of baseball writers during spring training in 1927 
when sylvesters uncle approached the babe and thanked him 
profusely 
how is johnny ruth asked the uncle assured the babe that 
johnny was doing ok and walked away 
ruth who was notoriously bad with names and referred to most 
everyone as kid turned to the reporters and asked now who 
the hell is johnny sylvester

the bush administration renewed its push 
thursday to require the sale of hundreds of thousands of 
alternativefuel automobiles by the late 1990s in urban areas 
having the worst air pollution problems 
william rosenberg associate administrator of the environmental 
protection agency told a senate hearing that clean air legislation 
must break the monopoly that exists for conventional gasoline 
and give motorists an opportunity to use less polluting fuels 
the phasein of up to 1 million vehicles powered by fuels other 
than gasoline had been proposed by president bush last summer as 
part of his clean air package but the provision was cut from 
legislation under consideration in the house and never included in 
a senate version 
administration officials and environmentalists hope to reinstate 
the alternative fuel provision into clean air legislation that is 
moving toward floor consideration in both the house and senate 
the automakers have opposed any federal requirement for 
alternative fuel vehicles arguing that they fear consumers will 
not want them and were successful in getting the provisons knocked 
out of a house clean air bill earlier this year 
if congress were to require such cars it also should require 
incentives to stimulate consumer demand for them and ease stringent 
tailpipe emission controls required in the proposed legislation 
beginning after the year 2003 said donald buist of the ford motor 
co 
but leading democrats in the senate have said they are not 
prepared to trade a clean fuel car program for the more stringent 
pollution control standards that would apply to all new vehicles 
across the country under legislation advancing in the senate 
rosenberg said the use of alternative fuel cars is a vital and 
integral part of any effort to clean up the worst urban smog that 
plagues nine specific urban areas 
among the fuels to be considered is methanol ethanol natural 
gas and propane he said 
in urban areas with the worst pollution the only other way to 
meet federal air quality at the turn of the century will be to 
dramaticaly restrict automobile use an option he said is not 
considered appropriate 
sen john chafee of rhode island the committees ranking 
republican said he plans to offer an amendment to the senate air 
pollution control bill that would require automakers to begin 
making 150000 alternative fuel vehicles available in california 
within four years and phase similar cars in eight other urban areas 
beginning in 1997 
under the chafee proposal nearly a third of the cars sold in the 
nine cities would be powered by fuel or a blend other than gasoline 
by 1999 
just cleaning up the tailpipe emissions on cars hasnt been 
enough to assure healthy air quality said chafee who compared 
the problem to a treadmill on which tighter pollution controls on 
individual gasoline powered cars are often offset by the increased 
number of cars on the road 
according to the epa the cities where air quality is so poor 
that alternative fuel cars would be required are los angeles where 
local officials already are developing similar requirements 
houston new york milwaukee baltimore philadelphia hartford 
san diego and chicago

president bush and portugals prime minister 
anibal cavaco silva discussed prospects thursday for ending the 
fighting in angola but didnt agree on absolutely every point 
an administration official said 
assistant secretary of state raymond seitz refused repeatedly to 
say where the president and prime minister differed on developments 
in the former portuguese colony located along the southwest coast 
of africa 
they basically traded analyses seitz said didnt agree 
on absolutely every point but did agree that the goal of national 
reconciliation in angola is what the purpose of the process is 
and both sides agreed that every effort ought to be made to bring 
about that reconciliation 
cavaco silva on an official working visit talked with bush for 
2 hours in the oval office and during a luncheon 
a key issue was the impasse in talks in angola between the 
sovietbacked government supported by portugal and the unita rebels 
armed by the united states 
a truce between the government and the rebels broke down last 
summer and the angolan government unleashed a new offensive 
against unita on dec 23 
there was a lot of discussion as to why the ceasefire broke 
down seitz reported after the talks there are some different 
interpretations as to how we have arrived at this particular 
point 
publicly bush and cavaco silva glossed over any differences 
bush called the prime minister a good friend and said that 
usportuguese relations are stronger than ever 
in his only comments on angola bush said portugal had historic 
ties to the southern african region 
he said we value the perspective and support that portugal 
has given to efforts by zaires president mobutu sese seko to 
mediate an end to the conflict 
when peace and stability come to that region as certainly we 
hope they will portugal will have an important role in the 
reconstruction process bush said 
cavaco silva said he briefed bush on consultations with the 
angolan and mozambique governments and expressed the hope that if 
all interested parties show a positive attitude it will be 
possible to put an end to the conflict that exacts such a heavy 
toll on the peoples of those two african countries 
on another subject cavaco silva assured bush that that portugal 
is in favor of a continued commitment and presence of the united 
states in europe which is a key factor for europes own security 
bush called portugal an inspiration and an example to eastern 
europe countries as they emerge from the darkness of political and 
economic authoritarianism the portuguese experience has 
demonstrated that peaceful democratic change and progress are 
possible 
us investment in portugal has doubled to more than 1 billion 
from 1988 to 1989

more than 10000 people rallied thursday 
in athens to protest albanias treatment of ethnic greeks and a 
newspaper reported that the hardline communist leadership of 
albania imposed a state of emergency on a northern city 
the report of unrest in shkoder albanias second largest city 
could not be confirmed an albanian diplomat in vienna called the 
report by the yugoslav daily politika an absurdity that is part 
of an angry smear campaign against his country the last 
bastion of stalinism in eastern europe 
blackrobed bishops and albanian emigres led the athens rally 
which coinciding with the anniversary of the founding of the 
communist state in albania in 1946 
i am warning the tirana albanian regime that the policy it 
has followed up to now will lead to international isolation and 
certain collapse said archbishop serapheim primate of the 
orthodox church in greece 
in all of eastern europe the systems of atheism and 
suppression of the people are falling serapheim said only the 
albanian regime remains uncompromising and continues with its 
vicious policies 
in belgrade the staterun politika daily said the state of 
emergency was imposed to quell popular unrest in shkoder 
the yugoslav report said a group of young people tried to 
organize demonstrations passing leaflets late last year in 
shkoder 60 miles northwest of albanias capital of tirana five 
people were sentenced to death and executed it claimed 
the belgrade newspaper did not give the source of its 
information say when the state of emergency was introduced or give 
any other details on the reported order albania is closed to most 
foreigners and it was impossible to verify the claims in the 
newspaper report 
albania has resisted the democratic reforms sweeping the rest of 
the region it has sharply restricted travel and its secret police 
monitor contacts with foreigners 
relations have been strained between greece and its northern 
neighbor since 1916 when the province of northern epirus was 
incorporated in albania 
the church claims the greek minority in albania makes up about 
400000 of the countrys 3 million people they say the ethnic 
greeks are not allowed to move freely to practice religion and to 
study greek in school 
albania contends the greek minority does not exceed 60000 
the greek church claimed in december that four ethnic greek 
albanians were tortured and killed last year after failing to 
escape to greece 
the greek foreign ministry has questioned the validity of an 
albanian videotape purporting to show three of the four brothers 
celebrating the new year after the greek charge daffaires in 
tirana was prohibited from visiting the brothers 
foreign minister antonis samaras drew a protest from tirana last 
month when he said greeks should be free to celebrate christmas in 
albania 
an albanian newspaper zeri i popullit on wednesday accused 
emigres of trying to foment unrest in the isolated balkan nation 
saying they wanted to restore the preworld war ii monarchy

the sale of vincent van goghs irises for a 
record 539 million two years ago was considered a loud vote of 
confidence in an art market still under the cloud of wall streets 
black monday 
but two years later the worlds most expensive painting is 
sitting in a vault and the irises deal is looking wilted 
it turns out that sothebys lent australian tycoon alan bond 27 
million to buy the 1889 painting that as collateral bond posted 
the picture he was going to buy that bond has not paid off the 
loan that sothebys not bond now has the painting that bond 
reportedly 5 billion in debt apparently wants to sell the 
painting or at least his share of it 
and sothebys said thursday it was abandoning the loan policy 
that produced the whole fiasco and critics complained inflated 
art prices in general 
in an interview michael ainslie head of sothebys said buyers 
will no longer be allowed to use art objects they intend to 
purchase to secure loans from the auction house 
since a painting is worth what someone is willing to pay for it 
and since what someone is willing to pay often depends on how much 
that someone can borrow auctioneers loans have the potential to 
stoke the art market 
an auction house could use such loans to increase bidding and 
hike prices and the value of its own 10 percent commission if 
the borrowerbidder defaults notes time magazine art critic robert 
hughes the auctioneer takes back the picture writes off the loan 
and resells the work at its new possibly inflated price 
since auction houses usually charge several points over the 
prime lending rate some critics have described them as a lender of 
last resort christies sothebys rival does not lend money to 
buyers 
ainslie said sothebys made such loans rarely and carefully and 
that their discontinuation would have no impact on art prices 
it was merely a financial service to our clients he said 
but our foremost concern is our credibility so were making this 
change largely to correct the misperception that something was 
wrong 
angelo aponte the citys commissioner of consumer affairs 
agreed i dont think its going to reduce prices but sothebys 
had to do it to protect its own credibility thats the biggest 
thing an auction house has going for it 
ainslie said sothebys had extended such loans only six times on 
objects that sold for more than 1 million 
but one was irises whose sale according to art dealer 
richard l feigen had a real impact on the art market 
assume that bond could not have bid without sothebys 
financing he said where would the bidding have stopped 
if it stopped short of 40 million would anyone have paid 479 
million for yo picasso last may would walter annenberg have 
paid 407 million for the same artists au lapin agile in 
november 
ainslies response bond probably would have bought the painting 
without the sothebys loan at the time of the sale he was no 
credit risk 
ainslies assessment was supported by thomas hoving former 
director of the metropolitan museum of art and editor of 
connoisseur magazine who blamed critics and art dealers for the 
controversy 
dealers he said dislike auction houses for luring away their 
business critics he said were trying to make something of 
nothing sothebys just said lets cut our losses who needs 
this he said its a peripheral issue 
and what of irises the painting sothebys took it back 
after bond was forced to extend his loan but ainslie wouldnt say 
where it is because of security considerations it is widely 
thought to be in a vault in switzerland 
and what is irises now worth about what bond bid for it in 
1987 said ainslie 30 million to 40 million according to 
skeptical dealers 
we are having discussions with several parties said michael 
cross a bond associate we have received a great many 
approaches but nothing is conclusive at this stage

defense secretary dick cheney said thursday he 
intends to bring home within weeks the thousands of us troops 
sent to panama to oust former gen manuel antonio noriega and will 
announce withdrawal plans in the next few days 
we are going to be moving fairly rapidly to bring the troops 
home over the course of the next several weeks cheney said 
adding that a residual force would remain 
i think well go back to the level that was there prior to 
the invasion he told reporters during a pentagon briefing 
before the dec 20 invasion about 13000 us troops were 
stationed in panama and cheney emphasized that he expects to keep 
that number in the country 
about 7000 troops were airlifted to panama on the first day of 
the operation with the total number swelling to around 25000 
pentagon officials have said 
in recent weeks that number has varied as some troops have 
begun to withdraw and other specialized units were rotated into the 
country 
the secretary he and the top military leadership were 
wrestling with ideas in order to produce the exact time 
frame for withdrawing the additional forces and that he was 
hopeful such details could be released within the next day or 
two 
on friday 2000 paratroopers who took part in operation just 
cause are scheduled to make a mass parachute drop on their return 
to fort bragg nc homebase of the 82nd airborne division 
on another issue cheney said that he approved the use of the 
f117 stealth jet fighter in the panamanian operation but that he 
objected to initial proposals for extensive use of the supersecret 
aircraft 
when the planning was done there was more extensive use 
proposed for the f117 i questioned specifically why we wanted to 
use that particular system and why on those particular targets 
they went back to the drawing boards and came back with a 
scaledback plan in terms of the number of targets affected 
cheney said 
although officials have refused to disclose the exact number of 
planes used on the mission they have said that two planes bombed 
the rio hato airfield near some infantry barracks in order to 
disorient those troops and make the us paratroopers arrival 
easier 
we wanted pinpoint accuracy we were trying to save lives 
stun and disorient the forces at rio hato so our own rangers could 
go in we used the 117 and it worked they dropped with pinpoint 
accuracy cheney said 
the secretary asked about his plans for base closures said 
that he expected them to be extensive but when asked to define 
the term he quipped more than two 
congress has agreed to the closures of 86 bases and the 
secretary was asked whether additional closures were contemplated 
there will be additional base closures but the exact 
process in which we will undertake that im not prepared to say 
cheney said 
the secretarys spokesman pete williams said later cheney 
has not signed off on the final list of bases and that he 
expected some base closings to be included in the fiscal 1991 
budget due to be sent to congress later this month

farmers planted nearly 57 million acres of 
winter wheat last fall for harvest in 1990 a 3 percent increase 
from 1989 and the most in five years the agriculture department 
said thursday 
the increase however was much less than the 6 percent to 8 
percent that some analysts had been predicting and raised prospects 
of continued tight us supplies and strong prices 
this would be the largest wheat area since the 1985 crop 
when plantings totaled 578 million acres said the departments 
agricultural statistics board 
a major concern is that despite the increase in plantings last 
fall crop conditions have been far from ideal so far this winter 
lack of moisture stressed winter wheat in the central and 
southern great plains during december the report said in 
midtolate december cold weather stressed winter wheat in the 
southern great plains delta and southeast 
winter wheat is planted in the fall and harvested the following 
year it accounts for about threefourths of the total us wheat 
output 
last years winter wheat production declined because of 
lingering drought in some major production areas but total wheat 
output increased because of a boost in springplanted areas 
meanwhile us wheat stockpiles have continued to shrink thus 
keeping market prices at high levels 
to help replenish dwindling reserves the department is 
requiring farmers to idle only 5 percent of their wheat base acres 
this year compared with a 10 percent setaside in 1989 and 275 
percent previously 
in another option intended to boost production wheat farmers 
are permitted to plant up to 10 percent more acreage than otherwise 
would be permitted under the 1990 program 
as originally announced last may 31 farmers were to plant no 
more than 95 percent of their wheat land but the option announced 
on sept 13 lets them plant up to 105 percent or 10 percent more 
than otherwise would be permitted under the basic program 
economist john schnittker a washingtonbased consultant said 
that larger plantings would have provided a better cushion for 
possible yield losses later in the season 
for example he said if plantings had been boosted 6 percent to 
8 percent as many had expected that would have helped offset any 
major impact from reduced yields caused by poor growing conditions 
but with only a 3 percent increase in 1990 plantings that 
cushion is thinner and leaves very little margin for reduced 
yields schnittker said in a telephone interview were at 
greater risk than expected 
the report showed that wheat farmers in kansas traditionally 
the biggest producer kept plantings at last years level 124 
million acres increases were reported in missouri and montana 
oklahoma south dakota and washington 
but nebraska farmers reduced winter wheat plantings by 2 
percent and texas producers cut theirs by 3 percent 
in a supplyanddemand analysis officials said the us total 
wheat stockpile on june 1 the beginning of the 199091 wheat 
marketing year could be reduced to 468 million bushels from 702 
million last june 1 and 126 billion bushels two years ago 
however the new june 1 forecast was up 25 million bushels from 
indications in december no projections were included for 199091 
export demand has been fed by us price subsidies for a number 
of countries including the soviet union and china even so total 
wheat exports in 198990 are expected to drop to around 1275 
billion bushels down from 1419 billion last season 
domestic requirements are slightly more than 1 billion bushels 
for 198990 the report said 
the analysis said average market prices may average in the range 
of 380 to 390 per bushel over the 12month marketing year five 
to 10 cents less than the december projection wheat prices 
averaged 372 in 198889 and 257 in 198788 
another report showed the dec 1 inventory of all us wheat at 
142 billion bushels down 17 percent from a year earlier farm 
holdings at 582 million bushels were down 6 percent from dec 1 
1988 while offfarm stocks at 836 million were down 24 percent 
the dec 1 corn stockpile was estimated at 708 billion bushels 
virtually the same as a year earlier farm inventories were 
reported at 47 billion bushels up 10 percent while offfarm 
holdings dropped 15 percent to 238 billion bushels 
soybean stocks were reported at 161 billion bushels up 18 
percent from a year earlier farm inventories at 793 million 
bushels were up 22 percent and offfarm stocks rose 14 percent to 
817 million 
a review of 1989 crop production relatively minor adjustments in 
usdas previously announced harvest figures 
the 1989 wheat crop was reported at 204 billion bushels up 12 
percent from 1988 corn 753 billion bushels up 53 percent 
sorghum 618 million bushels up 7 percent oats 371 million 
bushels up 72 percent barley 403 million bushels up 39 percent

supermarkets around the nation thursday shut 
down mist machines designed to keep fruits and vegetables looking 
fresh after one such device was linked to a legionnaires disease 
outbreak that killed two people 
we made the decision that if anything can happen because of 
this type of machine we wouldnt take the chance wed discontinue 
using them said mickey clerc spokesman for the jacksonville 
flabased winndixie grocery chain 
late last year about 70 people in bogalusa a town in southeast 
louisiana developed symptoms of legionnaires disease thirty 
cases were confirmed in the laboratory and two of the victims died 
researchers announced tuesday that they had traced the 
legionella bacteria to the onequart water reservoir of the mist 
machine at a winndixie supermarket said dr louise mcfarland 
state epidemiologist 
that doesnt mean grocers and hospitals should shut down their 
misting machines all were asking them to do is to contact the 
manufacturer or us and make sure they are using the machine 
properly said gwen bachstewart a spokeswomen for the louisiana 
department of health and hospitals 
misting vegetables is not the problem she said 
you cant get legionnaires disease from eating vegetables 
that have been misted you have to breath the legionella bacteria 
in to contract the disease in bogalusa the bacteria was airborne 
in a very fine mist that could be inhaled said bachstewart 
hospitals use a variety of humidifiers and respiratory therapy 
machines which produce a fine spray said dr thomas farley a 
state epidemiologist he said precautionary letters were sent to 
the hospitals 
at least four national supermarket chains winndixie safeway 
aampp and kroger switched off their vegetablefreshening mist 
machines however 
we have never recommended the removal of the machines 
farley said the mist machine in this outbreak was a type that 
has a reservoir in it that is a place where water was sitting 
continuously the bacteria was found in the reservoir we feel that 
was where it was multiplying 
the other factor was the very fine mist this system produces 
which allowed it to be breathed by people in the area farley 
said 
there were probably other factors present that we dont know 
about but we feel that those two things were part of it most of 
the misters used in stores dont have reservoirs and produce 
heavier water drops that cant be breathed he said 
winndixie which operates 1228 stores in 13 states began 
removing the misting machines from the 97 stores that had them in 
november when state health officials went to check the devices as 
a possible source clerc said 
we had the same type of service in all our stores were not 
experts in the area and we saw no reason to take a chance with the 
health of our employees or customers clerc said 
clerc said winndixie in future would spray produce by hand and 
will not reinstall the machines 
most stores like safeway which has 1200 stores mostly in the 
western united states and canada were turning off the systems and 
cleaning them said john j hayman jr president of kes irrigation 
systems inc of marietta ga 
hayman supplies misters to about 7000 us and canadian 
supermarkets he said his company is the largest of its kind has 
been in business five years employs 25 people and does 4 million 
worth of business annually 
theyre telling us that they are shutting them down until the 
public is educated to the difference in a fogger like the one in 
the louisiana store and a misting system a misting system which 
is what i manufacture does not use a reservoir it draws its water 
directly from the city water system and produces a spray not a 
fog hayman said 
cincinnatibased kroger the nations secondlargest chain with 
more than 1200 stores in 20 mostly midwestern and southern states 
said it has stopped using the sprayers in its produce departments 
it said most of its stores use automatic spray or mist systems 
but its stores in the cincinnati and dayton ohio areas use hoses 
montvale njbased aampp with 1250 stores in 26 states and 
canada originally said it would continue using its misters because 
they didnt have water reservoirs like the one in bogalusa 
aampp spokesman michael roarke said thursday that the company had 
decided temporarily to shut down its misters used in about 200 
outlets because of customer concern 
in hospitals concern about legionnaires disease prompted 
precautions in the use of misting systems years ago officials said 
weve always been aware of the potential for increased 
bacteria growth said frederick a kron an epidemiologist at 
baptist southern hospital we use only sterile water in any 
system that produces mist 
legionnaires disease was first identified in 1976 after an 
outbreak at an american legion convention in philadelphia killed 34 
people it is caused by bacteria that often thrive in cool 
standing water found in such places as water towers or air 
conditioning ducts the germ usually enters the lungs through water 
droplets

a justice department team overseeing the safety of 
classified documents for the trial of manuel noriega has warned 
attorneys they may have to pass a security check and cautioned them 
about disclosing classified documents 
pressure to maintain secrecy in the case prompted a closeddoor 
meeting thursday of he judge an angry defense attorney and the 
security team 
the indictment issued in february 1988 accused noriega of 
protecting cocaine shipments heading north and coca processing 
chemicals and drug money headed south 
classified documents figure in the case because the deposed 
panamanian dictator assisted the cia from the 1970s until 1985 
it is pretty odd that theyre both prosecutors and security 
team from the department of justice and yet these people security 
team claim that theyre neutral said steven kreisberg who 
represents codefendant william saldarriaga an accused colombian 
cocaine trafficker when they all work in the same department i 
question that 
a february 1988 indictment charges noriega with taking 46 
million in bribes from colombian cocaine dealers to turn his nation 
into a way station for smugglers 
michael okane attorney for codefendant daniel miranda who is 
accused of flying drug money from florida to panama said us 
attorney dexter lehtinen was misapplying security guidelines and 
contended he was threatened in the name of security 
lehtinen spokeswoman diane cossin responded defense counsel 
should abide by ethical standards and not try this case in the news 
media or comment on any discussions with the us attorneys 
office 
okane asked the government in a motion monday to examine 
intelligence information collected at a us military 
telecommunications listening post dubbed the tunnel in panama 
city 
he attached a map copied from the panama city telephone book to 
specify its location and that raised security concerns 
after the filing okane said he was contacted by a member of 
the security team and then by a prosecutor in lehtinens office 
who tells me they are very upset in washington with what ive 
been filing and if i dont get on board it will be bad for my 
client and bad for me personally 
okane met thursday with us district judge william hoeveler 
and justice department officials to discuss security issues and 
the judge laughed when okane explained the source of the map 
another security provision is that no classified information 
be discussed even over the telephone because of the danger of 
interception of these transmissions by the russians or whoever 
said kreisberg 
in cases with more than one defendant attorneys normally share 
copies of pleadings but that procedure may be restricted in this 
case he said 
i would hate to think theres things going on with other 
defendants that i dont know about kreisberg said 
noriegas arrival in miami on jan 4 to face the drug indictment 
has fueled speculation that codefendants may pursue plea bargains 
to avoid sitting through a barrage of allegations aimed largely at 
noriega 
theres always discussion you know but what the government 
has offered in my view is nothing said kreisberg whose client 
faces two counts in the 12count indictment they offered if 
you plead guilty to one count theyll dismiss the other counts 
im not really interested because my clients not guilty 
samuel burstyn who represents former noriega intelligence chief 
luis del cid said the thought of going to trial in a joint 
trial with mr noriega with the prospects of that being a real 
dogandpony show are not very appealing to us so to a certain 
extent we are motivated to forego a lengthy and difficult trial 
del cid faces up to 10 years in prison and a 500000 fine if 
convicted of racketeering and drug trafficking charges burstyn 
called discussions of a possible plea very preliminary 
burstyn and kreisberg are seeking separate trials for their 
clients but no timetable for a decision has been set

a federal appeals court thursday blocked a 
plan for nonpartisan special elections of state district judges 
despite a finding that the regularly scheduled elections 
discriminate against minority voters 
the 5th us circuit court of appeals said the legislature 
deserves more time to consider changes in the current countywide 
atlarge election system 
last year us district judge lucius bunton of midland ruled 
that the atlarge system diluted the strength of black and hispanic 
voters and violated the us voting rights act 
the lawsuit was filed in 1988 by the league of united latin 
american citizens and other minority groupsjose garcia de lara 
lulacs national president said he didnt believe the legislature 
or the governor could solve the problem in a special session 
weve been waiting a hundred years for this and were at the 
point where we want the changes done immediately de lara said 
but added we are very optimistic this is not a point of despair 
or devastation but we feel we have taken a couple of steps 
backward on the issue 
following the appeals court decision state officials said they 
will prepare for regular atlarge elections of 115 state district 
judges in nine counties 
this decision gives the people and their elected 
representatives an opportunity for a full and thorough debate on 
how judges should be selected said chief justice tom phillips of 
the texas supreme court 
i hope the legislature will move quickly in the next special 
session to give the people an opportunity to implement a system 
which is fair to all texans phillips added 
gov bill clements has called the legislature into a special 
session feb 27 to consider judicial selection and public school 
finance 
the appeals court stopped special nonpartisan elections in may 
that had been ordered by bunton for nine of the states largest 
counties bexar dallas tarrant harris travis midland ector 
lubbock and jefferson 
a few hours after the 5th circuit court ruled thursday bunton 
issued an apparently contradictory order rescheduling the 
nonpartisan special elections for november 
bunton said he believed the appeals court did not have 
jurisdiction in the case until he himself had ruled on a previous 
motion by the state 
however state officials said they believed the appeals court 
decision outweighed buntons latest order and the state would 
proceed with the regular march 13 primary elections 
since the 5th circuit court has ruled i would think that 
would be the prevailing order at this time said steve hall 
spokesman for attorney general jim mattox 
the elections are going to take place the primaries as 
originally scheduled the district judges in those nine counties 
will be running in the primaries as they normally would have 
said secretary of state george bayoud 
praising the appeals court judges clements said i applaud 
the decision of the 5th circuit not to allow the wholesale 
disruption of our judiciary 
in a twopage opinion the appeals court said that overhauling 
the texas judicial system is a job for the legislature 
that holding by bunton if sustained on appeal will require 
an organic and wholesale review and reconstitution of the texas 
judicial election system a task which should be addressed and 
carried out by the states elected representatives rather than by 
the federal courts the ruling said 
only if it becomes apparent that the state is unwilling to act 
with measured and appropriate speed in this regard should the 
courts intervene 
the appeals judges went on to say that the legislature thus 
far hasnt been given a reasonable period within which to 
address the problem presented

the worm program that paralyzed a 
nationwide computer network in november 1988 was designed so its 
victims wouldnt know how they were being attacked a computer 
expert testified thursday 
robert t morris rogue program used several methods to worm its 
way into the internet network said keith bostic a program analyst 
at the university of california at berkeley 
it was designed to break into as many computer systems as 
quickly as possible and escape detection as it was doing so 
bostic said on the second day of testimony in morris computer 
tampering trial in us district court 
morris 25 of arnold md is charged under the 1986 computer 
fraud and abuse act with hacking into a federal computer 
network if convicted he faces as many as five years in prison and 
a 250000 fine 
prosecutors allege he devised and unleashed a program that 
replicated wildly immobilizing an estimated 6000 computers linked 
to internet including those at nasa and several air force 
installations and universities 
defense attorney thomas guidoboni has said that morris created 
the worm as a computer security experiment but that he made a 
programming mistake that let the worm go berserk 
guidoboni said during opening statements that once morris 
learned of the problems his program was causing he tried to stop 
it and when that failed he tried to alert network users 
but bostic testified that no one in berkeleys computer science 
research group received any warning about the worm from morris 
four top computer programmers worked 16 hours to crack the 
worms defenses he said 
according to bostic the worm entered the schools computer 
system by using two defects in the software used by the system and 
by solving passwords either through a list built into the worm or 
by checking possible guesses against the computers own internal 
dictionary 
the worm also took advantage of the computers trust for one 
another on the same system a process by which a second computer 
will allow access to the system after seeing that an account 
already has been authorized by another computer on that system 
bostic said 
the rogue program hid itself in four ways he told jurors 
it traveled via binary code rather than a more easily read 
source code and those parts of the program that could be read by a 
literate user were encrypted to further mask what the worm was 
doing bostic said 
morris program also was set up so that it provided phony 
identification names when berkeleys scientists were trying to 
trace it the worm created more deception by periodically changing 
the program identification number attached to it by the berkeley 
computer system he testified 
bostic said the quick and powerful attack by the worm left 
no computer on the university system untouched 
it would break into as many machines as it could even 
machines it could not run on it was completely indiscriminate 
bostic said

atucha 1 latin americas first 
nuclear reactor was resumed operations this week after 17 months 
of repairs the president of the national atomic energy commission 
said thursday 
this is a great triumph for us manuel mondino said in a 
telephone interview we worked very hard on this the task was 
unprecedented 
in august 1988 a fuel rod in the 340megawatt reactor ruptured 
shutting down the plant in zarate 60 miles northwest of this 
capital 
mondino said scientists at first didnt know how to fix atucha 
because they had to remove one damaged tube and check 252 others in 
a reactor that was not designed to be opened 
technicians explored the tubes with miniature tv cameras and 
used robotic arms to remove the damaged tube along with bits of 
metal before the reactor which began producing electricity in 
1974 could become operational 
the reactor uses natural uranium which argentina has in 
abundance and heavy water most reactors use enriched uranium and 
boiling water also its 5yard fuel rods are longer than those 
used elsewhere 
mondino appointed by president carlos menem last july said he 
is convinced that what damaged the channel wont happen again 
nevertheless he said the reactor will operate at 50 percent 
capacity for several months 
the plant is part of a national energy grid that includes 
hydroelectric dams coal and oilfired power plants and the 
embalse nuclear plant

to set up a new internal security force drew a stiff rebuke 
thursday from the state department 
noncommunist political groups struggling to organize for the 
promised free elections may 6 are understandably concerned that 
such a force could be used for political intimidation the 
department said in a statement 
in the past the hated secret police popularly known as 
stasi used repressive measures to help ensure 40 years of 
communist control 
east german government officials say about 26000 of the 85000 
state security employees have been taken off the payroll but 
opposition groups want guarantees the force will be disarmed and 
assurances former agents will not have a part in a new agency 
in a speech to the national parliamen prime minister hans 
modrow who has us support said the aim is not to maintain the 
old structure of state security but he said there cannot be 
a security vacuum 
modrow cited violence by neonazi groups as well as terrorism 
drugs and ecological crime 
still the state department was sharply critical of the 
development 
it said the east german communist party was struggling to prove 
its credibility with the east german people 
reestablishing a police force such as the one which existed 
in the past could only put that credbility into further doubt 
the statement said 
secretary of state james a baker iii went to potsdam last month 
to meet with modrow and separately with a group of lutheran 
ministers several of whom had opposed the old regime 
he signaled his support for modrow who is considered by the 
state department a reliable force for moderation in east germany 
at the same time though us officials are concerned about 
indications a mood of retribution is prevalent among east germans 
who felt the sting of the ousted regime 
political divisions and shortages of food and fuel also 
contribute to unease within the bush administration about modrows 
chances of maintaining control until the promised elections in may 
an independent trade union movement threatened on thursday to 
call a nationwide strike jan 25 over the security force issue

accused serial killer arthur j shawcross was 
charged thursday with a ninth murder in a string of slayings of 
prostitutes and other young women in and around rochester 
a wayne county grand jury charged shawcross with murder in the 
death of 29yearold elizabeth a gibson of rochester 
the body of gibson described by authorities as a prostitute 
was found nov 27 in a wooded area in wayne county just east of 
rochester where most of the killings took place

the county in which rochester is located a monroe grand jury is to 
consider evidence in two other slayings next week 
shawcross was bought in manacles to the lyons courthouse from 
rochester for the arraignment in the wayne county case he answered 
yes sir in a low voice when judge carmen parenti asked if he 
needed a lawyer appointed for him 
public defender ronald valentine did not enter a plea for 
shawcross but parenti entered a plea of innocent on his behalf 
parenti granted a prosecution request to deny bail to shawcross 
and returned him to custody in rochester where he is being held 
without bail on the monroe county charges 
i do feel there is a high risk that the defendant would flee 
this jurisdiction parenti said 
if convicted of the seconddegree murder charge shawcross faces 
a minimum sentence of 15 years to life in prison 
the 44yearold parolee was arrested jan 4 after state police 
spotted him lingering near the frozen body of one of his alleged 
victims shawcross reportedly confessed to killing 11 women and

a soviet proposal to mediate stalled 
peace talks between iran and iraq made headway thursday when 
officials of the two nations expressed support for moscows offer 
a senior iranian foreign ministry official said iran will look 
positively at the soviet proposal irans official islamic republic 
news agency reported 
deputy foreign minister mahmoud vaezi returned to tehran late 
wednesday after talks in moscow with soviet foreign minister eduard 
shevardnadze the news agency said 
in moscow a soviet official said wednesday that tehran had 
agreed to restart the talks with soviet mediation the chief of the 
united nations had been leading the talks 
the iraqi foreign ministry in baghdad also issued a statement 
thursday welcoming the soviet role 
the soviet union proposed such a meeting last year and iraq 
informed moscow it approved the meeting last august said the 
statement carried by the iraqi news agency monitored in nicosia 
we welcome such a meeting if it will be comprehensive in order 
to achieve it aims it said 
in washington the state department stressed that the soviet 
proposal was meant to supplement the efforts of the un 
secretary general not to supplant them 
spokeswoman margaret tutwiler also urged both iran and iraq to 
immediately exchange the 100000 prisoners they are holding from 
the war years 
thursdays statements came a day after kamal kharrazi the 
iranian ambassador to the united nations rejected a new iraqi 
proposal to revive the talks the iranian said negotiations could 
continue only on the basis of an earlier peace plan tehran radio 
reported 
kharrazi said baghdads proposal is nothing new and does not 
change anything it is another stage of iraqi obstructionism in 
the peace process 
he added that if iraq does not have any ill intentions in 
introducing this proposal it should accept the un resolution and 
take positive steps in its implementation 
the eightyear iraniraq war halted on aug 20 1988 after 
tehran accepted un resolution 598 the document calls for troop 
withdrawal to prewar borders exchange of prisoners and 
negotiations towards a lasting peace 
but the negotiations which started five days after the 
ceasefire have stalled 
president saddam hussein of iraq last month proposed new direct 
talks to revive the talks exchange of prisoners opening of air 
links and exchange of visits by iranians and iraqis 
tehran which opposes direct talks called the proposal a 
deception and said it fell short by failing to call for a troop 
withdrawal 
soviet foreign ministry spokesman gennady gerasimov said 
wednesday that iran had agreed to restart the talks but that 
moscow rather than the un secretarygeneral would mediate 
in moscow gerasimov said foreign minister ali akbar velayati of 
iran sent a message to moscow saying tehran was willing to resume 
the talks with soviet mediation 
the iranian news agency said thursday that velayatis message 
stressed that iran would consider any soviet proposal containing 
a systematic and clearly defined formula for the implementation of 
un resolution 598 
gerasimov said baghdad already had agreed to talks with soviet 
mediation

the mail bomber responsible for the 
deaths of a federal judge and civil rights attorney may have been 
an elderly white man who is religious or has legal experience 
according to a reported fbi profile 
nancy conn a victims rights advocate in alabama quoted 
unidentified fbi agents as saying they believe the bombing suspect 
is old because he used 3cent stamps that are no longer sold as 
postage on packages the birmingham postherald reported thursday 
according to the report the bomber also used an oldfashioned 
method to wrap the mailbomb packages brown butchers paper and 
bakers string 
the agent said they believed he must have had those stamps for 
a long time said mrs conn who works in the alabama attorney 
generals office of victims assistance 
us postal service officials said thrsday a 3cent stamp issued 
in 1986 is still being sold and was widely used in 1988 as a 
supplemental stamp when firstclass letters went from 22 cents to 
25 cents 
but an older 3cent stamp reportedly used by the bomber was the 
going rate for firstclass letters during two periods 19171919 
and 19321958 before those 3cent issues ceased being sold said 
postal service spokesman art shealy of washington dc 
the birmingham postherald said fbi sources confirmed a profile 
of the bomber however fbi spokesman tom moore refused thursday to 
confirm that the profile was that described by mrs conn 
moore refused to confirm mrs conns account of her interview 
with the fbi we didnt say what kind of stamps were on the 
packages moore said 
the fbi interviewed mrs conn because they believe the bomber 
could be a victim of a crime committed by a black or is close to 
someone who is a victim 
this person is angry at the justice system and we deal with a 
lot of victims who are angry mrs conn said some are radical 
racists ive heard people make very bad slanderous remarks 
the bomber used the word shall several times in his letter 
and other stilted terminology leading investigators to believe he 
is religious or has knowledge of legal terms mrs conn said 
shall is used frequently in scripture and legal books 
mrs conn gave the fbi the name of a crime victim who has called 
her office and complained about what he says is a justice system 
that discriminates against whites that man is white and the person 
who committed the crime against him is black she said 
it was not known if the fbi has interviewed the man 
miriam shehane who started the group vocal victims of crime 
and leniency with mrs conn was also interviewed by the fbi she 
could not be reached for comment 
us district judge robert vance who served on the 11th us 
circuit court of appeals was killed dec 16 when a mail bomb 
exploded at his home in mountain brook a birmingham suburb 
two days later civil rights attorney robert robinson a black 
alderman in savannah ga was killed after a similiar package blew 
up in his face 
other mail bombs were safely removed from the 11th circuit 
courthouse in atlanta and the jacksonville fla office of the 
national association for the advancement of colored people 
fbi agents from washington dc have joined investigators from 
birmingham atlanta and jacksonville on the case we are making 
steady progress said moore 
in a letter to an atlanta television station a group called 
americans for a competent federal judicial system claimed 
responsibility for the bombings the letter said the group was 
seeking vengeance for court decisions in favor of school 
desegregation and the 1988 rape and murder of julie love a native 
of mountain brook who was white two black men in atlanta were 
charged in the crime

a woman implicated in the deaths of her two 
baby daughters three years apart is a coldblooded murderer who 
concocted a fairy tale about how both infants were abducted a 
prosecutor said thursday 
but the defense attorney for paula marie sims 30 of alton in 
southern illinois called his client an innocent victim of a 
terrible tragedy 
mrs sims is charged with two counts of firstdegree murder in 
the death of 6weekold daughter heather lee whose body was found 
in a trash barrel in may if convicted she faces the death penalty 
she also faces trial later in jersey county on charges of 
obstruction of justice and concealment of a homicide in the death 
of another daughter loralei marie in june 1986 no one has been 
charged with slaying loralei 
in his opening statement assistant madison county states 
attorney donald weber said the infants deaths were not 
coincidental 
he scoffed at statements made by mrs sims and her husband 
robert to police that in both cases a masked gunman had entered 
their home and kidnapped their child 
sims 37 was at work on both occasions and has not been charged 
in either death he has custody of the couples young son randy 
mrs sims told police a fairy tale about a roving 
rumplestiltskin who showed up on her door step and snatched her 
baby weber said 
the truth is that paula and robert sims just dont like little 
girls he added their impossible and preposterous story can 
lead to only one conclusion the babys caretaker their mother 
is a ruthless and coldblooded murderer 
defense attorney donald groshong countered that there is 
absolutely no evidence to link mrs sims to heather lees murder 
and that the real killer is still at large he said his client was 
not smart enough to plan the crime and leave no evidence 
paula sims did not kill those children groshong told the 
jury its a terrible tragedy what happened to those two 
children paula sims is a victim too 
the evidence will show that paula sims is a good mother he 
said 
after opening statements jeff reed of florissant mo 
testified that he discussed children with mrs sims when they 
worked together at a grocery store in 1983 
she said god no i dont want to have children especially 
not a little girl they are too much trouble reed said i 
thought it was kind of strange 
another witness julie fry of jerseyville said she shared a 
hospital room with mrs sims in 1986 when loralei was born 
she woke me up because she was crying mrs fry testified 
she was on the phone and she said im sorry we had a little 
girl i thought she was talking to her husband she said she 
wanted a boy that they wanted a boy 
mrs sims faces two counts of firstdegree murder to allow 
prosecutors to propose different theories in heathers death as 
well as two counts of obstructing justice by lying to police and 
one count of concealing the homicide

the space shuttle columbia gained 
on its quarry thursday in its orbital pursuit of an 11ton 
satellite that the astronauts hope to capture and save from burning 
up in the atmosphere 
commander dan brandenstein and pilot jim wetherbee fired the 
shuttles orbital engines three times thursday to put the shuttle 
on a nearcollision course with the satellite they have been 
catching up with since liftoff tuesday 
as the astronauts ended their workday thursday afternoon 
columbia was 218 miles from its target and closing at a speed of 
about 24 miles per 91minute orbit 
tomorrows a big day so get a good nights sleep tonight 
said jim voss the shuttle communicator at mission control 
we had an excellent day and were looking forward to 
tomorrow replied mission specialist bonnie dunbar 
when the shuttle was launched it entered orbit 1725 miles 
behind its quarry but it has flown in a lower orbit than ldef so 
it could circle the earth faster and catch up with the satellite 
eight more maneuvers were planned for early friday before 
brandenstein would assume manual control of the shuttle for the 
final approach to the long duration exposure facility which is the 
size of a small school bus 
the orbiter continues to perform very well orbiter and 
crew flight director bill reeves said during a press briefing 
late thursday afternoon everything is go for the rendezvous 
tomorrow 
flight director al pennington said thursday that when the 
shuttle is about 400 feet away from ldef the crew will get a 
good look at the sides of it at that point in time he 
brandestein will have a good visual image of what hes going in 
for 
once within range of the target the plan was for the shuttle to 
fly in formation 35 feet from ldef while dunbar uses the orbiters 
50foot robot arm to reach out and grab the satellite expected at 
948 am est friday 
after snaring the satellite she will turn the arm slowly for 
four hours so ldef can be photographed before it is tucked into the 
shuttles cargo bay for the trip home mission specialist marsha 
ivins was in charge of the photography 
the satellite has been in orbit for nearly six years but it is 
being slowed by atmospheric drag and tugged down by earths 
gravity if the astronauts dont retrieve it it is expected to 
plunge to earth on march 9 and burn up in the atmosphere 
scientists hope ldef is returned intact so they can see what has 
happened to its experiments after the long exposure to space 
early thursday brandenstein and mission specialist david low 
interrupted their flight plans for about three hours to mop up 
about two gallons of water that leaked from a faulty dehumidifier 
the spill was shown on television as a slow bubbling of water beads 
floating in the air 
when brandenstein looked at all the equipment that had to be 
moved to get at the water he remarked its kind of a mess right 
now ill get the plumber of the year award but not the 
housekeeper of the year award 
mission control awakened the five astronauts thursday with its 
own version of the banana boat song 
the name of astronaut low was substituted for the words 
dayo and it included such phrases as come all you 
astronauts sleeping in the cabin daylight comes and its time to 
get up 
mission control said the words were written by members of the 
team that trained low for a space walk in case of an emergency on 
this flight to pass the time during these training sessions he 
often hummed the melody 
good morning houston man we be up low replied in a 
calypso beat 
in addition controllers reported thursday that the 85 million 
navy communications satellite launched by the astronauts wednesday 
was functioning well 
columbias 10day mission is the secondlongest in the 33 
shuttle flights is a stepping stone toward longer shuttle missions 
and to monthslong trips aboard space station freedom starting in 
the mid1990s

prime minister yitzhak shamir seeking to ease 
friction over stalled peace efforts on thursday urged us 
secretary of state james a baker iii to keep trying to arrange 
israelipalestinian talks 
but the israeli daily haaretz reported shamir and foreign 
minister moshe arens were studying alternatives to the 
ussupported plan for israelipalestinian talks in egypt 
haaretz said the two leaders were looking into resuming efforts 
toward a direct dialogue with palestinians from the occupied west 
bank and gaza strip without help from egypt egypt openly consults 
with the palestine liberation organization which israel considers 
a terrorist organization 
egypt offered to help arrange preliminary israelipalestinian 
talks in cairo after israels earlier efforts at a direct dialogue 
failed 
israel has hesitated to accept the usbacked plan unless it 
has firm assurances from baker about the composition of the 
palestinian delegation and the agenda 
shamirs top aide yossi benaharon told israel television that 
israel would seek further clarifications after receiving a draft 
letter of assurances from baker 
there is still a difference between what we see as a proper 
response and what the americans gave us tv quoted benaharon as 
saying 
the delay has led to warnings this week from baker and other 
officials that the united states may abandon its middle east 
efforts 
shamir told visiting us congressmen that israel hoped baker 
would persevere 
facing us is a difficult and complicated process and in order 
to advance it we need a lot of patience shamir said according 
to his office 
the prime minister also said we rely on the efforts of the 
united states for success in the israeli peace initiative 
israels plan calls for elections in the occupied lands to 
select palestinians for negotiations on limited autonomy with 
israel 
the foreign ministry said arens spoke with baker by telephone 
wednesday and that they discussed ways of advancing the peace 
process 
defense minister yitzhak rabin left thursday for the united 
states where he is to meet next week with baker 
also thursday finance minister shimon peres head of the 
centerleft labor party criticized shamir for delays in accepting 
the usbacked initiative 
we can start peace talks peres told a forum of 
manufacturers we in my opinion are unnecessarily delaying a 
decision 
in a separate speech peres warned his party will leave israels 
coalition government if it will be decided to go against the 
peace process or if there will be no peace process 
the labor party favors striking a compromise with baker over two 
issues that have held up israeli acceptance of his plan 
but shamir head of the rightwing likud bloc wants us 
assurances that palestinians who live outside the occupied 
territories will be excluded likud holds that involving outsiders 
is tantamount to negotiating with the plo 
shamir also wants the americans to limit the discussion in cairo 
to israels election plan 
in the occupied territories israeli soldiers shot and wounded 
14 palestinians during stonethrowing clashes thursday arab 
hospital officials reported the army confirmed one wounded 
in hebron masked palestinian activists stabbed and injured 
jamila ramadan a 32yearold principal of a girls school arab 
reporters and israel radio said she was suspected of assisting 
israeli authorities and committing moral offenses 
palestinians have killed at least 168 of their arab brethren as 
suspected collaborators with israel during the 25monthold 
uprising against israeli rule since the uprising began 646 
palestinians have died of israeli gunfire in the uprising and 43 
israelis have been slain

charles stuart tried to draw two brothers into his 
plot to kill his pregnant wife but other family members did not 
know of stuarts involvement until days before he committed 
suicide an attorney said thursday 
family attorney richard clayman revealed that michael stuart had 
been approached by charles weeks before the oct 23 crime but 
did not realize the significance of the overture and refused to get 
involved in any crazy thing 
three days after the shooting another brother matthew who 
disposed of a pistol suspected to be the murder weapon and other 
evidence told michael of charles role in the crime the brothers 
did not share their knowledge with the rest of the family until 
shortly before charles stuarts jan 4 suicide 
charles stuart told police after the shooting that he and his 
wife carol 30 were attacked by a mugger as they left a birthing 
class at a city hospital stuart was seriously wounded but 
recovered their son born premature by caesarean section died 17 
days later 
charles stuart 30 became a suspect in the case jan 3 when 
matthew implicated him in his wifes killing he jumped off a 
bridge into boston harbor before police could arrest him 
clayman held a news conference thursday and was joined by 
michael and a third brother mark stuart and their two sisters 
shelley yandoli and neysa porter matthew stuart did not attend 
none of the siblings made any comment during the session 
the appearance that has evolved in my judgment is that some 
type of conspiratorial scenario existed by and between all of these 
family members sitting around talking about keeping something 
hidden that is not true said clayman who represents michael 
stuart but spoke on behalf of the family 
clayman was asked if charles stuart ever asked michael for 
assistance in killing his wife 
there may have been an early disjointed vague conversation 
by and between charles stuart and my client michael stuart weeks 
before oct 23 which at that time had no significance to 
mike clayman said 
in retrospect after examining all the data there an argument 
can be made that it had some significance he said 
clayman who declined to elaborate on the discussion said 
michael stuarts response was a definitive i dont know exactly 
what youre talking about but im not getting involved in any 
crazy thing youre talking about 
of the other family members he said they knew nothing they 
did nothing they saw nothing they touched nothing 
clayman said matthew had told michael of charles involvement 
within three days of the crime 
he said his client would tell the grand jury anything it wants 
to know i am comfortable that there is no violation of law 
that his hands are legally clean 
a grand jury is to convene friday and hear testimony on the case 
asked about the moral dilemma michael stuart faced clayman told 
reporters they had all the relevant facts to come to a moral 
judgment yourself 
matthews attorney john perenyi was in conference and not 
available for comment his office said thursday afternoon 
clayman also said the stuart family wanted people to know they 
loved carol stuart and that their family and her parents eveylyn 
and giusto dimaiti had suffered greatly 
the agony they have experienced over the last week has 
been horrible he said 
according to matthew stuarts attorney matthew met charles at 
the crime scene and retrieved mrs stuarts handbag which 
contained personal items and a gun matthew stuart who has said he 
did not realize any shooting had occurred when he took the items 
told his lawyer he had shared his suspicions about his brother with 
family and friends 
matthew stuart said he threw the handbag and gun into the the 
pines river in suburban revere police divers recovered the handbag 
and a snubnosed 38caliber revolver believed used in the killing 
divers searched the pines river again thursday for further clues 
the search continues for a gold watch and a ruby ring among 
items that stuart reportedly said were stolen when he and his wife 
were shot 
prosecutors have refused to say whether anyone might be charged 
in the crime saying the investigation is continuing 
as investigators search for a motive they have dismissed 
reports that drug use was involved and interest in stuarts 
connection with a 22yearold woman who worked at a boston fur 
store with him has diminished 
in a statement released by her attorney thursday the woman 
said i was never romantically involved with charles stuart 
she said she knew him as a friend and felt nothing but 
sympathy for mr stuart after his wifes death she said stuart 
had asked her to call and visit him in the hospital 
i told him that i felt it was inappropriate for me to visit 
because this was a time for family but i agreed to telephone 
him she said 
one emerging theory is that stuart wanted to leave the fur 
store where he was a manager and open his own restaurant but he 
felt his wife and a baby would be a hindrance mrs stuart an 
attorney reportedly knew of the restaurant plans and literature 
on starting a restaurant was found in the couples reading home 
authorities have investigated whether stuart might have plotted 
the killing to collect on insurance policies on his wife he 
received 82000 from one policy due his wife from her job as a tax 
attorney he had taken out at least one other policy on her for 
100000 that was being processed when he committed suicide

three lawyers from a personalinjury firm were 
indicted thursday on federal racketeering charges for allegedly 
fabricating evidence and paying for false testimony 
the 23count indictment charges that lawyers and several other 
employees of the morris j eisen law firm engaged in a pattern of 
mail fraud bribery of witnesses and court workers and 
falsification of evidence since 1981 
in one instance a man who testified as an eyewitness in two 
separate caraccident cases in 1984 saw neither of them and was in 
prison on forgery charges when one of the accidents happened said 
andrew j maloney us attorney for the eastern district of new 
york 
i havent seen the extent of this kind of shenanigans by 
lawyers in my career said maloney 
the eisen firm until recently was one of the largest 
personalinjury firms in the nation in 1986 the firm grossed some 
20 million in contingency fees and employed more than 40 lawyers 
maloney said 
the indictment names morris j eisen 58 joseph p napoli 48 
and harold m fishman 50 four private investigators and the 
firms former office manager were also charged 
if convicted the defendants could face up to 20 years in prison 
and fines of as much as double the proceeds of each criminal 
activity on each count maloney said 
james la rossa the attorney for eisen called the indictment a 
vendetta and said it was false and unfair 
eisen is a thorn in the side of the insurance companies out to 
protect their profits and a medical bureaucracy seeking to avoid 
the awesome responsibility for ruined and broken lives la rossa 
said let there be no mistake about what this indictment is a 
clear and brazen effort to cripple the advocates of the men women 
and children who have been crippled and maimed 
the ivestigation involved 19 personalinjury lawsuits seven 
against the city the awards in those lawsuits amount to as much as 
9 million and the firms contingency fees were about onethird of 
that amount authorities said

the bush administration found itself arguing 
against a politically appealing tax cut thursday as it denounced a 
proposed rollback of social security payroll taxes as a democratic 
ploy to fiddle around with the nations retirement system 
presidential press secretary marlin fitzwater said the 
administration opposes a plan by sen daniel patrick moynihan 
dny to repeal this years social security tax hike and to 
further cut the rate next jan 1 
mr moynihans got a lot of ideas and well let the democrats 
have those ideas fitzwater said 
bushs nonewtaxes philosophy does not apply to the social 
security tax increases which were scheduled to take place anyway 
administration officials said 
moynihans plan which is fast gaining support from business and 
conservative groups would cancel the jan 1 increase that raised 
the social security tax rate to 765 percent from 751 percent the 
tax covers both retirement and medicare programs 
moynihans proposal would then lower the rate even further to 
655 percent on jan 1 1991 
we dont anticipate any changes in social security democrats 
seem to want to fiddle around with the social security system we 
do not fitzwater said 
moynihan aide ed lopez who said bush seems to be putting 
himself at dds with many conservatives asked so the president 
doesnt like our tax cut 
we expected it would have bipartisan support but its a bit 
surprising the extent to which the right wing has climbed all over 
it lopez said 
he said moynihan who has called the legislation a 55 billion 
tax cut for working people planned to introduce the rollback 
measure on jan 23 the day congress returns from its winter recess 
kay obeirne deputy director of the conservative heritage 
foundation said the administration is finding itself in a 
position of opposing a tax break that americans deserve 
that will be a problem for them she said suggesting 
widespread support for the proposed tax cut might force the 
administration into a position of having to argue that americans 
arent overtaxed 
the heritage foundation which usually finds itself on opposite 
sides from moynihan put out an analysis of the legislation on 
thursday entitled three cheers for moynihans 55 billion tax 
cut 
it hasnt happened too often in the past but here he is 
championing a proposal weve been advocating for years said ms 
obeirne we welcome his leadership 
the increases in social security taxes were enacted in 1983 
under a formula for shoring up the system produced by a blueribbon 
commission headed by alan greenspan to overhaul the social security 
financing 
greenspan was a private economist at the time he is now 
chairman of the federal reserve moynihan who is chairman of the 
senate finance subcommittee on social security was a member of the 
greenspan commission 
the social security system is sound let the democrats fool 
with it not us fitzwater said he said the administration 
favored keeping the commitment to america he said was made by 
the greenspan commission 
were not changing social security he added 
however white house staff chief john sununu said on face the 
nation last sunday that the administration did plan to propose a 
change to social security financing that would require surpluses 
generated by the social security trust funds to be used to help 
retire the national debt after 1993 
currently the trust funds are invested in treasury securities 
the surplus in the trust funds is currently about 65 billion 
and since these funds are figured in the federal budget they tend 
to mask the real extent of the federal budget deficit 
however fitzwater said that these changes dealt mostly with 
bookkeeping methods i dont know about the budget stuff i just 
know we arent changing social security 
social security taxes jumped almost 320 this year for americans 
earning 51300 or more in part because the wage limit on which 
the tax is levied was raised from 48000 at 48000 and below 
the increase is 014 percent of wages 67 for someone earning 
48000 42 for someone earning 30000 28 for someone earning 
20000 and so forth 
don levins director of federal budget policy for the us 
chamber of commerce said the moynihan proposal which would cut 
the tax rate paid by both employees and employers was a positive 
first step toward strengthening the social security system 
how can you go against such a good idea its a populist idea 
and it will do a lot of good for economic growth levins said 
he said that while the chamber had some concerns about paying 
for such a tax cut the administration and republicans in 
general would be missing a golden opportunity by not backing 
such a payroll tax rollback 
bush addresses a chamber of commerce audience on friday in 
cincinnati but aides said it was unlikely he would have much to 
say about social security financing

police said the twinengine cessna 206 disappeared wednesday 
after taking off at 510 pm from copiapo for the fourhour flight

agricultural official sergio lazcano an excecutive of the chilean 
fruit exporters association and the pilot police lt german

philadelphia prompting a temporary suspension of the sale of all 
chilean fruits in the united states no victims were reported 
weather conditions in the area thursday were described as 
excellent all day long by a police officer helping to 
coordinate the search operation he identified himself only as lt

director of the agencys international affairs staff in the fdas 
office of health affairs in rockville md and pouzar as director 
of investigations in the fdas nashville district office

capital phnom penh the organization said in a statement based on 
reports from its medical teams inside cambodia 
a surgeon anesthetist and logistics expert have been helping 
treat the wounded at an emergency hospital at kompong thom in 
central cambodia since dec 15 the agency said 
their work has been slowed by primitive medical conditions and 
shortages of water drugs medical equipment and personnel the

rockets and mines the agency said 
medecins sans frontieres or doctors without borders hopes to 
dispatch fresh teams especially to kompong cham in the east the 
statement said 
rebels opposed to the vietnamesesupported regime of president 
hun sen have stepped up their guerrilla campaign against the 
government since vietnam said it had withdrawn its troops last fall 
the rebels include the 40000strong khmer rouge who killed 
hundreds of thousands of cambodians during the pol pot reign of 
terror from april 1975 to december 1978 when a vietnamese invasion 
drove them from power 
two smaller rebels groups loyal to former ruler prince norodom 
sihanouk and son sann a former prime minister are allied with the 
khmer rouge to topple hun sen whom they view as a vietnamese

yugoslavias ruling communist party 
is preparing to give up its monopoly on power and allow the first 
multiparty elections in 45 years in april a leading communist said 
thursday 
stefan korosec secretary of the policysetting central 
committee told a news conference that the communist party will 
take part in the legislative elections in yugoslavias six 
republics just as another party would with its new program 
elections in the republics which delegate deputies to the 
national legislature are scheduled for april 
the new program which korosec said departs from the model of 
authoritarian communism still has to be adopted at an 
extraordinary communist party congress scheduled to start jan 20 
in belgrade he said 
the document appears to be yugoslavias reply to the wave of 
democratic reforms currently sweeping eastern europe 
yugoslavia had a multiparty system before world war ii but the 
westernstyle democracy was abolished when the communists came to 
power in 1945 
korosec also presented to reporters a final draft of a 
declaration to be approved by the congress in which the party 
pledges to relinquish its monopoly on power it also calls for 
free direct and secret multiparty elections 
the draft declaration also says that yugoslav communists 
advocate full participation of yugoslavia in european 
integration processes including its membership in the european 
community the council of europe the european free trade 
association efta and other similar organizations and 
institutions 
korosec said leaders in all of yugoslavias divergent communist 
republics support the declaration in principle however he 
also indicated the document could spark fierce debate between 
hardliners and more liberal communists 
yugoslav communists were the first to break with the monolithic 
sovietled communist bloc in 1948 but yugoslavia faced with its 
worst economic and political crisis ever has been slower in 
adopting the westernstyle reforms that have gripped other east 
european countries 
the declaration represents the real divorce of the party from 
the state and the constitution of the party as a nonmonopolistic 
organization korosec said 
he did not elaborate on what if any legal guarantees would be 
taken that the party was giving up its leading role in hungary 
czechoslovakia and east germany articles in the constitution 
guaranteeing the leading role of the party have been scrapped in 
bulgaria similar steps have been promised 
yugoslavia is currently reworking the constitution and if the 
document is adopted in its current form at next weeks congress it 
is likely that the constitutional reference to the partys leading 
role will be scrapped 
korosec said he thinks the communists cannot lose next aprils 
elections but if they do they might form a coalition with other 
leftist parties such as the socialist alliance which is now a 
communistled mass organization but plans to constitute itself as 
an independent party 
even though yugoslavia has not formally adopted a law allowing 
independent political groups and parties to form numerous 
political parties have sprung up all over the country over the past 
few months 
some of the parties have clear nationalist programs that has 
sparked fears this could lead to open clashes between the republics 
that could seriously threaten the unity of this balkan country

the 1986 federal immigration amnesty law led 
to widespread discrimination against hundreds of thousands of 
usborn and foreignlooking persons seeking work a state report 
concluded 
the state fair employment and housing commission report released 
thursday also accuses the us immigration and naturalization 
service of enforcing the law poorly the los angeles times reported 
i predicted that would happen said rep edward roybal 
dlos angeles who voted against the law but no one at the 
time seemed to pay attention 
the sevenmember commission said the law which orders that 
those hiring undocumented workers be prosecuted led many employers 
to turn away job applicants even though many had proof of us 
residency the report said 
it also recommended the ins suspend enforcement of employer 
sanctions which include fines up to 10000 for those who 
knowingly hire undocumented aliens 
the nonbinding recommendations are the first by a public agency 
in the western united states on the controversial 1986 immigration 
reform and control act under which more than 3 million immigrants 
applied for amnesty more than half of those immigrants live in 
california 
a new york state agency issued a similar report in late 1988 
the report comes as the general accounting office congress 
investigative arm is preparing a final report on the laws effects 
if the gao agrees discrimination has occurred the act requires 
congress to consider changes 
the state commission oversees enforcement of california laws 
prohibiting housing and employment discrimination 
ins officials defended their performance pointing out the 
agency spent millions of dollars and thousands of hours to educate 
employers how the new laws affected 
the ins has done an excellent job of implementing this law 
agency spokesman virginia kice said i dont think anyone can 
classify employer sanctions or irca as a failure 
the commissions findings were based on testimony delivered at 
public hearings last year in oakland fresno and los angeles

the military junta on thursday dissolved 
the feared secret police of president augusto pinochet which has 
been accused of widespread human rights abuses 
adm jose merino president of the junta said it passed a law 
under which agents of the clandestine police force will be sent 
back to the armed forces branches from which they were assigned 
the junta is made up of the commanders of the navy air force 
and national police and a reprsentative of the army appointed by 
gen pinochet president and army commander it acts as legislature 
for his 16yearold administration 
the text of thursdays law dissolving the secret police 
formally called national information central was not made public 
merino said secret police files will remain in the hands of 
the same people who have them now 
rights groups have asked that the files be given to the supreme 
court saying the documents may be essential if the truth is to be 
discovered in cases of serious rights violations in recent years 
secret police directors all have been army generals most of the 
forces officers came from the armed forces a recent report by an 
opposition magazine reckoned the number of agents at 8000 military 
men and 4000 civilians the goverment gives no figure 
the agency was created in 1977 to replace another secret police 
force the national intelligence directorate after that force was 
linked to the assassination of prominent dissidents abroad among 
the deaths was that of former foreign minister orlando letelier in 
washington in 1976 
the 74yearold pinochet who seized power in a violent coup in 
1973 will hand over the presidency on march 11 to an elected 
civilian successor patricio aylwin but pinochet says he will 
remain as commander of the 60000member army as permitted by the 
1980 constitution crafted by his military regime

redoubt volcano rumbled through another 
eruption thursday ejecting a plume that rose more than five miles 
into the sky the alaska volcano observatory said 
there was no confirmation of ash in the plume but it probably 
contained some observatory geologist steve brantley said 
wind reports indicated any ash carried from the volcano area 
would miss anchorage brantley said and no ash was expected to 
reach the kenai peninsula hit by gritty fallout after redoubt 
rocked through an eruption monday 
mondays blowup was the volcanos biggest since it emerged from 
a quartercentury of slumber in middecember 
redoubt 115 miles southwest of anchorage was cloaked in clouds 
thursday 
brantley said scientists had virtually no warning of the 
eruption which occurred at about 2 pm adt 
since the volcano became active some of the larger explosive 
events have been preceded by a systematic increase in the number of 
earthquakes the lack of warning is tied to destruction of 
redoubts lava dome on jan 2 he said 
we dont have the capability of predicting when these events 
will occur or how large they will be brantley said 
he said scientists are equipped to gauge the strength of 
eruptions and transmit information to the federal aviation 
administration and other agencies 
the faa alerted pilots that volcanic ash was possible in the 
redoubt area thursday ash can shut down jet engines as it did 
last month when a boeing 747 operated by klm royal dutch airlines 
flew through fallout from redoubt the plane lost power to all four 
engines and landed in anchorage after they were restarted 
brantley said the volcano also went through a small explosion 
thursday morning after these two events the volcano seems to be 
relatively quiet he said

revolution 
foreign journalists here can count on complete support and

deliberately distort the reality of cuba cant stay in the

mikhail s gorbachev told 
independenceseeking lithuanians thursday that a faceoff with 
moscow could lead to tragedy but he also said a law is being 
prepared that would permit the republic to secede from the soviet 
union 
it was not clear from the soviet presidents comments how free 
lithuania would be under the framework he envisions 
about 300000 lithuanians jammed central vilnius late thursday 
in a candlelight demonstration for freedom at the conclusion of the 
first day of gorbachevs threeday visit 
we have been tied together for these 50 years whether we like 
it or not gorbachev told a crowd after placing a wreath at a 
monument to vladimir lenin 
but he also told a meeting of lithuanian intellectuals that i 
am for selfdetermination all the way to secession according to 
lithuanian tv correspondent eduardas potesinskas 
lithuanians say they want to restore the independence they had 
between the world wars soviet dictator josef stalin absorbed 
lithuania along with the two other baltic states latvia and 
estonia in 1940 under a secret agreement with nazi germany 
lithuania the southernmost of the baltics is about 600 miles 
west of moscow 
gorbachev reiterated his opposition to the independence drive 
which he has said could cause a breakup of the soviet union but 
said he would not stand in the way of the lithuanian peoples will 
he said he had ordered that a law be written and published 
establishing a mechanism for secession from the soviet union a 
right guaranteed by the countrys 1977 constitution but not 
recognized to date 
he did not spell out how the machinery for secession worked 
in an interview with britains independent television news 
soviet foreign ministry spokesman gennady i gerasimov confirmed 
moscow was preparing the law 
you must think about the interests of the other party too so 
there must be mechanism for divorce so to say the spokesman 
said from vilnius lithuanias capital 
the itn reporter asked if the draft law meant a law of total 
independence 
we have an article in the constitution according to this 
article every republic has the right to secession to go away the 
right is there he said 
although he has granted lithuanians and their neighbors in 
latvia and estonia a large measure of economic and political power 
gorbachev has consistently and sharply criticized lithuanian 
communist party leaders for pressing for complete independence 
he convened an emergency session of the national partys central 
committee last month to discuss the issue 
by going to vilnius gorbachev put his personal prestige on the 
line as never before in nearly five years in power appearing in a 
republic that openly disagrees with him and is unlikely to be moved 
by his appeals 
gorbachev is in lithuania to try to reverse the lithuanian 
partys break with the national party decided in december 
gorbachev waded into a crowd of several hundred people after the 
visit to the lenin monument and he talked for nearly an hour 
one man called out people must decide their own fate 
nothing will be decided without you gorbachev replied we 
will decide everything together 
however he added the following warning remember if someone 
succeeds in pitting us against each other in a clash there will be 
a tragedy we should not allow this 
gorbachev was not explicit about what such a tragedy might be 
but one of his closest allies fellow politburo member alexander n 
yakovlev was quoted monday as saying the lithuanian partys move 
might cause a domino effect encouraging communists in the 
other 14 republics to break from moscow 
soviet officials have given a virtual guarantee they will not 
use force to keep lithuania and its 37 million residents in the 
soviet union gerasimov told the bbc last week the kremlin has 
only one tool for preventing a breakup 
it is dialogue dialogue and dialogue said gerasimov the 
only way is political means we have no other choice 
gorbachev also spoke of possible national repercussions when he 
told the vilnius crowd the rights of all minorities in the soviet 
union must be respected or the nation of more than 100 ethnic 
groups may unravel 
if even the slightest suppression occurs or misunderstanding 
somewhere in estonia or moldavia it spills over into the rest of 
the country he said 
as gorbachev met with communist party members in another part of 
vilnius an estimated 300000 proindependence demonstrators 
rallied in the shadow of a cathedral once closed by atheist soviet 
authorities 
the strains of violins and patriotic hymns filled the air along 
with the smell of burning candles carried by demonstrators the 
crowd hushed briefly in commemoration for the tens of thousands of 
lithuanians who suffered in the soviet takeover then again broke 
out in song 
weve come here to express our unity in light of the east 
european changes to announce that we will decide the problems of 
lithuania ourselves vytautas landsbergis head of the 
grassroots political movement sajudis told the crowd 
landsbergis who is also a member of the soviet congress of 
peoples deputies spoke of the soviet union like a foreign country 
what was stolen must be returned he told the rally the 
time has come for intergovernmental negotiations between lithuania 
and the soviet union 
the square was a mass of color at the twilight rally with the 
red yellow and green of hundreds of flags of a free lithuania 
joined by flags symbolizing independent estonia latvia georgia 
armenia moldavia and the ukraine 
it was a reminder that moscow faces calls for independence not 
just from lithuania but the other nonrussian republics as well 
there were signs of local defiance toward centralized soviet 
rule elsewhere thursday in armenia the legislature amended the 
republics constitution to give itself an effective veto over 
national laws it sees as conflicting with armenias interests said 
yerevan activist rafael popoyan 
in latvia lawmakers followed the lead of their lithuanian 
colleagues and amended the constitution to create a multiparty 
system the evening tv news program vremya reported the 
amendments end the communist partys constitutional guarantee on 
political power and allow latvians to form rival parties that do 
not advocate overthrowing the existing state system or other 
anticonstitutional goals according to vremya 
gorbachev is also pressing for creation of a soviet 
federation whose constituent republics would have more rights 
he blames many of the countrys ills on the strongly centralized 
moscowbased bureaucracy

think they fled into the jungle when their ammunition ran out army 
helicopters failed to find them 
in lima the capital police said earlier thursday that from 
witness descriptions they identified one of the guerrillas 
involved in the assassination of former defense minister enrique 
lopez as gregorio olivos a former university student with 
purported links to the shining path 
lopez the most prominent figure to be killed in 10 years of 
guerrilla violence in peru was attacked in his car on tuesday by 
at least three men with submachine guns as he arrived at his 
office in the lima suburb of san isidro 
another rebel group the procuban tupac amaru revolutionary 
movement claimed responsibility thursday but a government 
spokesman speaking on condition of anonymity said the claim 
looks pretty thin the attack has the shining path written 
all over it 
on wednesday evening according to a police report rebels 
attacked the army patrols camp in new san martin area 110 miles 
south of tarapoto 
the battle lasted until thursday morning when the soldiers 
apparently ran out of ammunition and the survivors fled police 
said 
an army helicopter recovered the soldiers bodies thursday but 
found no survivors nor did other helicopters dispatched to the 
attack site 
police in tarapoto 435 miles north of lima told the associated 
press that peasants living nearby informed them that the guerrillas 
came to the area a few days before 
the attackers had automatic weapons grenades and dynamite they 
took the weapons and uniforms of the dead soldiers 
the upper huallaga valley is the source of most of perus coca 
the shining path operates there in an alliance with drug 
traffickers allowing them to do business with peasant cocagrowers 
in exchange for part of their profits 
the traffickers buy coca leaves make them into paste and ship 
the paste in small planes north to colombia where it is refined 
into cocaine 
the government says more than 17500 people have died in 
political violence since the maoinspired shining path launched its 
armed insurgency in 1980 
a congressional commission said in lima it will meet friday to 
hear testimony from the ministers of interior and defense on why 
bodyguards were not accompanying lopez when he was killed 
president alan garcia criticized the military on the day of the 
shooting for not providing fulltime protection for the retired 
general 
an article published thursday in the newspaper cambio 
considered an outlet of the tupac amaru movement said lopez was 
shot by their guerrillas in response to the governments politics 
of annihilation and extrajudicial executions of guerrillas and 
civilians 
police say it was the shining path 
they continued stopping cars and checking peoples documents 
thursday in a search for suspects a government spokesman said more 
than 15000 people without identification had been detained since 
tuesday but most were released after proving their identity

three west germans hackers went 
on trial thursday charged with selling western military computer 
passwords and codes to the soviets 
dirk brzesinski peter carl and markus hess were arrested last 
march after an investigation by us and west german officials 
revealed they had obtained information giving them access to key 
military and research computers in the united states western 
europe and japan 
a fourth man 30yearold karl koch who was also arrested in 
the case committed suicide in may 
brzesinski 30 a computer specialist told the court that koch 
had come up with the idea of selling the information 
we decided in 1986 to sell the information to the soviets for 
1 million marks 605000 to help them even out the technical 
knowhow advantage of the west brzesinski said 
carl 35 said he was responsible for contacting the soviet 
trade mission in east berlin where he dealt with a contact 
identified only as serge 
carl said he did not want to reveal anything more about the 
soviets in court for fear of reprisals 
court records show carl made at least 25 contacts with the 
soviets and received a total of 90000 marks 54500 for the 
information 
according to brzesinski koch before his death claimed he had 
managed to gain access to the us defense department general 
databank known as optimus 
after the arrests last year us and west german news media 
reported that other computers the hackers entered included a nasa 
and a star wars research computer as well as computers linked 
to nuclear weapons and energy research in los alamos nm and the 
fermi laboratory in illinois 
however us officials said last year that although the hackers 
obtained sensitive codes and passwords to enter the computers they 
were stopped short of obtaining any highly classified information 
investigators have said that codes and passwords from computers 
in japan britain france italy switzerland and west germany were 
also obtained and sold to the soviets 
a verdict in the trial scheduled to be completed in 12 
sessions is expected feb 8 the men face up to 15 years in prison 
each if convicted

the un secretariat has discontinued 
informal contacts with nationalist leaders of the three soviet 
baltic republics but un officials said thursday no pressure came 
from the soviet union 
francois giuliani spokesman for the secretarygeneral said in 
a briefing thursday the contacts were strictly informational 
between the nationalist groups of estonia latvia and lithuania and 
assistant secretarygeneral james oc jonah 
he said they went on for several months and were initiated by 
the groups secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar had not been 
a party and had not been informed until recently he added 
in answer to a question giuliani said soviet officials had not 
sought to intervene or block contacts 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev currently is visiting 
lithuania trying to diffuse separatist sentiment there 
un officials said soviet deputy foreign minister vladimir 
petrovsky contacted jonahs office about the discussions but 
lodged no protest with the secretarygeneral 
the soviet missions press officer was not available for 
comment although a message was left with his office by telephone 
the un charter bars the world organization from interfering in 
members domestic affairs 
estonia latvia and lithuania once independent were forcibly 
annexed by the soviet union in 1940 and never have acquiesced to 
soviet domination baltic nationalism has been fanned by democratic 
upheavals in eastern europe and by policies of openness and reform 
under gorbachev 
the soviet constitution provides the right of secession to its 
republics but gorbachev opposes any breakup of the soviet union 
baltic groups in new york expressed regret over the un 
decision 
we are sorry to see that these informal informational 
contacts have been discontinued because of soviet sensitivity 
said ginte damusis of the lithuanian information center

fiftyfive drug defendants refusing to plead 
guilty in district of columbia courts were retaliated against by 
prosecutors who moved the cases into federal court said a judge 
who dismissed the indictment against one of them thursday 
the federal court cases carried stiffer penalties 
in dismissing an indictment against vernon holland of 
washington us district judge harold greene said the defendant 
had been deprived of his rights to due process of law and to a 
speedy trial 
holland was charged in the federal court with possession with 
intent to distribute crack cocaine after he refused to plead to a 
lesser crime attempted possession of cocaine in a local court 
where he might have escaped a jail sentence the federal charge 
carries a fiveyear minimum prison term on conviction 
hollands was one of 55 drug cases the us attorneys office 
moved from dc superior court to us district court where the 
defendants were indicted by federal grand juries 
the transfers prosecutors said followed an april 1989 
initiative against violent crime and drug abuse in the district of 
columbia announced by attorney general dick thornburgh and federal 
antidrug czar william bennett 
the us attorneys office in the district of columbia is unique 
in the country in prosecuting crime in both the federal and the 
local courts 
greene served as chief judge of the superior court for seven 
years before being elevated to the federal bench by president 
carter in 1978 
in two days of hearings last week before greene prosecutors 
denied that the defendants refusal to plead guilty played any role 
in the transfers but greene concluded that the case files of the 
transfers proved otherwise 
in case after case the particular defendant whose case was 
transferred had declined to plead guilty in superior court prior to 
his indictment in this court said the judge indeed in 
several instances the relationship between the refusal to enter a 
guilty plea and indictment in federal court was explicitly spelled 
out 
it is the courts conclusion that like a number of the other 
defendants holland has been deprived of his rights under the due 
process clause and under the speedy trial act and the charges 
against him will therefore be dismissed said greene 
in a typical transfer case said the judge a decision was made 
in may or june of 1989 to seek an indictment in federal court even 
though an indictment for the same conduct was pending in superior 
court despite the decision to transfer the new federal indictment 
was deliberately not obtained until the fall of 1989 that was 
just about the time the superior court case was called for trial 
and could no longer be postponed said greene 
the us attorneys office said the transfers were made solely 
on the basis of the provable facts in each case 
the status of the other 54 cases could not immediately be 
determined

more than 25 reporters and editors who resigned 
from the jerusalem post because of a dispute with the publisher are 
trying to put together financing for a new englishlanguage daily 
a spokesman said thursday 
we are engaged in intensive efforts to set up an alternative 
englishlanguage daily that would be what we consider to be the old 
jerusalem post said menachem shalev a former post diplomatic 
correspondent 
we are in touch with both foreign and israeli investors but 
havent concluded anything yet he added 
he declined to say who the potential investors are and said 
millions of dollars would be needed for the venture 
the 58yearold newspaper which began in prestate israel as 
the palestine post has extensively covered the palestinian 
uprising in the occupied west bank and gaza strip and is widely 
read by journalists and diplomats here and abroad 
on wednesday the staff remaining at the post announced they 
were dropping a labor dispute after publisher yehuda levy pledged 
to protect jurnalistic freedom and not impose a political slant 
problems began after levy a career army officer was appointed 
president and publisher last july by the canadian newspaper chain 
hollinger inc which purchased controlling interest in the post in 
april 
the paper announced tuesday that hollinger inc had purchased 
the remaining shares giving it complete control 
the staff charged that levy was interfering in the editorial 
freedom of the paper and said they feared he would steer its 
traditional liberal policy to the extreme right 
in a letter that led to settlement of the labor dispute levy 
pledged that the jerusalem post will be a free and independent 
newspaper and will not reflect a single political orthodox 
position 
he also promised a continuing effort to give the readers 
accurate news reporting and a wide spectrum of opinion and 
commentary and said the editor and subeditors will not be 
instructed to slant articles politically 
levy said he had asked six of the reporters and editors who 
submitted resignations to withdraw them it was unclear if any will 
do so 
shalev said some journalists who quit have been approached by 
other israeli newspapers but he said the groups first choice was 
to start a new paper we hope to provide an alternative he 
said frankly we dont believe in levys promises

about 150 people packed a schools music 
room thursday night to try to cope with their grief and bafflement 
over the slayings of a family of five here reportedly as a cult 
sacrifice 
in the last day and a half ive seen a real positive shift 
increasingly toward acceptance and moving on said the rev dale 
luffman pastor of the church where the victims once worshiped 
we have become more sensitive to how our fellow community 
members feel more sensitive to value people more than things 
luffman said at the kirtland high school forum organized by the 
clergy and community mental health leaders 
kay plona the mother of a classmate of one of the victims said 
she attended the twohour session to try to understand the tragedy 
people are really defensive kirtland is a tighly knit 
community said mrs plona whose son attended kindergarten with 
karen avery who was 7 when she was killed 
mrs plona said her 8yearold son was having trouble handling 
the death of his former classmate i remember the night he came 
home he showed me karens picture in the yearbook and then he 
slammed it shut and said he didnt want to open it again 
last week authorities acting on a tip dug up the bodies of 
dennis avery 49 his wife cheryl 42 and their daughters trina 
15 rebecca 13 and karen 
a service in remembrance of the averys was held wednesday night 
at the reorganized church of jesus christ of latter day saints in 
kirtland the averys who moved to kirtland about three years ago 
from the independence mo area attended services here a few 
times said luffman church pastor 
later however they joined a kirtland cult led by a former lay 
preacher with the reorganized church thirteen members of the cult 
including the leader jeffrey lundgren 39 have been charged with 
crimes including aggravated murder kidnapping and conspiracy in 
the shootings 
lake county prosecutor steven c latourette has said the averys 
may have been killed as a sacrifice that would cleanse cult 
members souls and allow them to travel to the wilderness 
others have suggested that the slayings may have been prompted 
by disputes over money or sex or fear that the averys would leave

the milky way galaxy home of the sun and the 
earth has a core shaped like a football instead of the perfectly 
spherical center many astronomers have long believed according to 
a new study 
astronomers at the university of maryland and princeton 
university announced thursday the discovery of evidence that the 
spiral arms of the milky way actually rotate around an oval center 
causing the sun to follow an elliptical path in its 200 
millionyear orbit of the galaxy center 
leo blitz of the university of maryland said that the discovery 
shows that the milky way is a socalled barred spiral galaxy this 
means that the spiral arms composed of stars gas and other 
matter flare out from a socalled bar structure of stars and gas 
at the center in a normal spiral galaxy the arms curve out like 
spokes from the very center 
it has been something of a holy grail for astronomers to 
determine if the milky way is a barred spiral or a normal spiral 
galaxy said blitz this study shows it is barred 
the milky way galaxy is diskshaped with a large bulge in the 
middle seen from above arms flare out like curved spokes 
creating a spiral appearance the galaxy has a diameter of about 
100000 light years and a thickness seen from the edge of about 
4000 light years 
a light year is the distance light will travel in a year about 
6 trillion miles 
in other galactic news two other astronomers said thursday they 
have confirmed that the milky way and about 100 other galaxies are 
being pulled toward a powerful gravitational source called the 
great attractor over a region of space 100 million light years 
wide 
the new findings expanding on preliminary 1987 observations 
show galaxies on both sides of the attractor are swerving 
toward it in addition to their normal motion away from each other 
said alan dressler of the carnegia instititon of washington and 
sandra faber of the university of california at santa cruz 
the sun and its solar system which includes the earth are 
located in one spoke about midway out from the galaxy center that 
spoke along with the four other arms of the milky way rotate 
about the galaxy core though the rotation rate of the arm at the 
suns location is about 600000 miles an hour the galaxy is so 
large that it takes about 200 million years to complete one 
rotation or orbit 
because the sun is away from the middle of the galaxy about 
25000 light years from the center the galaxy is seen edgeon 
from the earth this means that stars clouds and dust obscures the 
view of most of the milky way and this has blocked astronomers 
from being able to determine the shape of the galaxy center 
directly 
blitz and david spergel of princeton overcame this problem by 
examining the movement of hydrogen gas clouds in the outer regions 
of the milky way an area called the galactic halo that surrounds 
the milky way like a globe 
spergel said the hydrogen movement was first studied about 15 
years ago but the motions were never well understood he said the 
new study developed with the help of a computer showed that 
movement of the clouds caused by gravitational influences could 
be explained only if there is an ellipsoidal center to the galaxy 
the center is like a football said blitz there is 
absolutely no question about the data on this 
since according to the study the sun and its solar system move 
about the galaxy in an ellipse instead of a circle the suns 
distance from the galactic center will change regularly over time 
right now blitz and spergel said the sun is about halfway between 
its closest approach to the center and the farthest point of its 
orbit 
the sun will reach its outermost point from the galactic center 
in 25 million years that is about 1500 light years farther away 
than the point of closest approach to the center 
its not something we have to worry about said blitz 
a paper on the study was given thursday at the 175th national 
meeting of the american astronomical society

a leading transplant surgeon said thursday 
he might be forced to implant a jarvik artificial heart if the need 
arose despite the fdas decision to withdraw approval of the 
device 
jack copeland head of the transplant and artificial heart 
program at the university of arizona said there is no scientific 
basis for the decision earlier this week by the food and drug 
administration to withdraw approval 
the jarvik heart named after its inventor dr robert jarvik of 
utah gained household recognition after it was implanted in barney 
clark on dec 2 1982 he lived 112 days his new heart tethered to 
a bulky external power system before he succumbed to multiple 
organ failure 
jarvik in a statement issued in new york referred to the 
jarvik7 as the sputnik of medical science in artificial heart 
development and said he was disappointed to see this chapter 
close 
he said he had favored continued research but added that he 
has been working to develop the jarvik 2000 an eggsized miniature 
rotary blood pump to be permanently implanted within a patients 
natural heart 
the fda notified symbion inc of tempe the only company that 
has manufactured the jarvik device that it was withdrawing 
approval for human use of the artificial heart both as a permanent 
implant and as a temporary bridge to transplantation and of its 
acute ventricular assist device 
the fda said that during two inspections of the tempe 
arizbased company last year it had found some serious 
deficiencies in manufacturing quality control monitoring of 
research sites servicing of equipment training of personnel and 
reporting of adverse patient reactions to the fda 
copeland acknowledged that the heyday of the jarvik7 has 
passed but he said it still has specific use and he thinks the 
immediate effect of the withdrawal of the symbion devices will be 
to deprive potentially hundreds of critically ill patients of a 
chance for life 
copeland said the fda action means that for now his staff faces 
the option either of not implanting a symbion artificial heart in a 
critically ill patient as a bridge to transplant or what would 
appear to be taking a decision that is not approved by the fda and 
putting a device in anyway 
and i think our decision right now would be to go ahead and 
use the devices he said were confident we have good data 
good statistics were happy with the way the devices have worked 
we think they can save lives 
copeland stirred controversy once before using a different 
artificial heart without approval to keep a patient alive for 11 
hours while he awaited a transplant 
dr william c devries of louisville ky who implanted the 
heart in clark and three other permanent recipients all of whom 
have died said he had not yet been notified by symbion or the fda 
he said he would not comment until he had received official notice 
of the recall 
in jasper ind margaret schroeder the widow of artificial 
heart recipient william schroeder said the heart gave her husband 
another 620 days of life that he otherwise wouldnt have had 
im sure that he would have even died the next day when he 
got the heart on the 25th of november if they hadnt got him on 
that jarvik heart she said in a telephone interview and at 
that time i think thats the only thing that was available 
copeland said he would be willing to testify before the fda to 
defend the efficacy of the jarvik and other devices 
he said the jarvik7 is the best device available for people 
weighing more than 180 pounds with doublesided heart failure the 
greater loss he said is the symbion biventricular pumps 
copelands team has implanted jarvik7s in seven patients 
including two in bernadette chayrez with six going on to 
transplant and four of them surviving five patients received left 
ventricular assist devices and nine biventricular devices with 
four who went on to transplant surviving he said 
in all there have been 159 bridgetotransplants with jarvik7 
hearts since 1985 and 116 biventricular implants since 1986 said 
lane castleton chief financial officer for symbion

drink for drink women get drunker than men now 
scientists believe they know why men have more stomach for booze 
a study published today found that men typically make higher 
amounts of a substance that breaks down alcohol in the stomach 
before it reaches the bloodstream as a result men feel fewer 
effects of alcohol even when men and women the same size drink the 
same amount 
i am convinced that there are sex differences in handling 
alcohol commented dr judith gavaler of the university of 
pittsburgh this is a very important study for all of us doing 
research in alcohol this will change the way we approach this 
subject 
researchers said the study also underscores concerns about 
drinking during pregnancy provides an explanation on the effects 
of drinking on an empty stomach and could be used to help set safe 
drinking levels for men and women

implemented more upbeat vice president dan quayle called the 
announcement a positive step forward for human rights 
but the white house and state department reflected a cautious 
us policy stance by issuing identical statements saying we must 
assess the full scope of this action after observing its 
implementation 
the bush administration dropped its opposition to world bank 
loans to china for earthquakes and other unspecified calamities 
but officials said the step was not related to the lifting of

astronomers at the us naval observatory 
are narrowing their solar system search for a 10th planet a 
mysterious phantom giant that has long captured the speculation 
and interest of stargazers 
speculation about the existence of another planet evolved 
because something perhaps a massive object orbiting the sun on the 
outer edge of the solar system is giving a gravitational nudge 
that disrupts the predicted orbits of uranus and neptune said 
astronomer rs harrington 
we are still incapable of predicting the location of uranus 
harrington said wednesday its clear something is wrong in the 
outer solar system 
astronomers have theorized since the beginning of the century 
that some additional planets existed beyond the orbits of neptune 
the theory sprang from observations that uranus failed to orbit the 
sun with the majestic and mathematical symmetry experts expected

city authorities didnt call on the 
police to take care of stockholms graffiti problem they sent 
teenage graffiti artists to school where they lived out their 
aggression believed to be the underlying reason people spray a 
wall 
not only was there a sharp decline in graffiti said teacher lee 
spangberg but a lot of artistic talent was found among those who 
had been merely defacing walls 
money ran out and the school has closed but social workers 
involved in the project believe it was a good example of the way 
social offenders should be handled with guidance and 
rehabilitation not punishment 
spangberg 18 admits to having scrawled on some walls before he 
became a teacher at the school when it opened last march he has a 
business card that says you say it ill spray it 
the project was set up in an empty high school in central 
stockholm 
as soon as we opened up everybody knew about it spangberg 
said spraycan wielders from 8 to 25 years old came in four 
weekdays after school for a few hours of living out their 
aggressions he said 
we didnt exactly stand at the blackboard and tell them how to 
sit down and the rest he said you would just throw down the 
spray cans on the floor and thered be an explosion of activity 
it was not the kind of school where guys came along with spray 
cans in their attache cases the vandals came here 
the ones who came to us had a pain in their souls said 
fellow teacher svenarne hokenstrom 
social officials claimed graffiti lessened by more than half 
while the school operated the national government awarded it a 
medal in october for reducing vandalism 
then the projects 27500 fund ran out and the group lost the 
lease on the school building nov 1 
now theyre all out there again on the street spangberg 
said 
of 150 pupils about a dozen had serious artistic ambitions and 
came for advice spangberg said 
but youth centers seeking to decorate their walls with 
controlled graffiti began to call the school to hire young artists 
some people wanted their motorbikes or boats decorated some pupils 
found they could get painting jobs that paid as much as 320 
inger wissen a social worker who thought up the project and 
headed it said the idea of a graffiti school was born in 1987 
when a wave of vandalism led to public calls for tougher police 
action aginst the young 
according to insurance company statistics scribblings went 
down by between 50 and 70 percent after the school opened wissen 
said 
she added that she hoped authorities would grant the project 
more money so it could reopen 
ragnar backman who heads stockholms department for the removal 
of scribbling said graffiti lessened considerably last summer he 
said the city spent 406000 to wash away names political slogans 
and drawings in 1989 
backman roams the city in a small van equipped with chemical 
cleansers he said he feels no regret in removing graffiti most 
of it is simply messy 
in april the graffiti students showed off their skill at an 
exibition in a stockholm gallery in august 50 spraycan artists 
went to a youth fair at strangnas outside stockholm where they 
painted for spectators 
police guarded them spangberg said 
now the doors and windows of the graffiti school are bolted and 
barred the building is deserted its outside walls covered in 
graffiti left over from eight months of classes 
what the authorities didnt count on was that the guys would 
spray not only every single wall inside the school but also 
everything outside it spangberg said

not long ago many thais thought milk 
made them sick and cheese was smelly stuff but a younger 
generation is gulping down milk and devouring cheesetopped pizzas 
all across bangkok 
i think the nutritional qualities of milk are wellunderstood 
here said mauri uotila of the bangkok office of the united 
nations food and agriculture organization people here see tall 
european and american people drinking a lot of milk i think like 
all parents they want taller children with stronger bones 
in keeping with an asiawide trend consumption of milk in 
thailand has gone up 56 percent from 1986 to 1988 and cheese 
imports have more than doubled over the past three years 
its quite a nutritional shift for a country where milk was once 
thought fit only for infants and young children 
but thailands milk consumption averaging 94 quarts a year per 
person is still the lowest in southeast asia japanese average an 
annual 755 quarts while americans down 132 quarts according to 
att senasarn general manager for nestle products inc in thailand 
the penetration of western ways is also cited as a factor 
thousands of thais return from studies in the united states with a 
taste for milk shakes pizzas and yogurt 
although the thai dairy industry has been growing rapidly it 
still produces only a third of the 500000 tons of milk consumed 
yearly the rest is imported 
hard to find less than a decade ago fresh milk now takes its 
place next to soft drinks at streetside stands in bangkok and 
grocery stores are stocked with a bright array of more than a dozen 
different brands and types of sweetened flavored plain and lowfat 
milk 
nestles senasarn said that 85 percent of all milk consumed in 
thailand is sweetened or flavored 
the big problem in marketing is with taste i think the 
socalled lactose intolerance problem has more to do with the 
question of taste he said 
it has been claimed that the greatest obstruction in promoting 
milk drinking in thailand and other parts of asia has been the 
prevalence of lactose intolerance among many asians 
many people here say they cant drink milk but actually in 
many cases its because they dont like it rather than because it 
gives them stomach trouble he said 
uotila said that if a person stops drinking milk over a long 
enough period of time the enzyme in the body necessary to digest 
lactose in the milk disappears and the person could encounter 
stomach problems including diarrhea from drinking milk 
he said there are no statistics available on lactose intolerance 
in asia so it is difficult to know the extent of the problem 
about six years ago the government began promoting milk and 
slogans have you drunk your milk today appeared on 
billboards television and radio all over the country 
the program was not so popular said dr sirikul isanurug of 
the ministry of health people thought milk was not for adults 
this was the old concept still in mind the government was trying 
to get all parts of society to drink milk but its not part of thai 
culture 
however unpopular the campaign may have been awareness and 
acceptance of milk increased considerably according to eric simon 
director of foremost friesland dairies one of the leading dairy 
companies in the country 
the major milk campaign has let up in recent years and efforts 
are now being channeled into making milk available in schools said 
jiradej sakulneya at the staterun dairy farming promotion 
organization 
we are aiming milk promotion at the younger generation 
particularly those in schools because they are the most affected by 
malnutrition and are the easiest to convert he said the older 
generation is pretty useless because they are not used to it and 
have problems with their stomachs

theres more capitalism than altruism these days 
behind the resurgence of the once nearly extinct buffalo the 
shaggy animals are easier to raise fetch more per pound and are 
lower in fat and cholesterol than beef 
the buffalo which once roamed the great plains like a moving 
black robe was hunted for meat and hides in such great numbers 
that historians say by 1889 fewer than 600 remained since 1970 
the number of buffalo has doubled in this country to about 60000 
according to the american bison association 
about 400 stockmen ranchers like brian ward of center have 
gone into the buffalo because of a beef market made unstable by 
american eating habits ward runs 1700 head on his 100000acre 
spread in southern colorados san luis valley and sells about 
100000 pounds of boneless meat a year 
we get long winters in this valley he said the buffalo 
hides thicker than cattle they got a lot more hair and they eat 
and tend to be more like wild animals store fat in the fall and 
their metabolism slows down in the winter so they require less 
feed 
there are some exciting times we drive them about 35 miles to 
pasture and back every year cross country we used to use horses 
but we use motorcycles now the buffalo dont charge the cycles as 
bad as they do horses 
the price of good buffalo breeding stock has doubled in the past 
five years to about 1500 for a young breed cow twice what a 
comparable beef cow brings according to the denverbased aba but 
buffalo meat also brings twice the price of beef and its lean 
meat a 3ounce serving has 93 calories compared to 183 for beef 
43 milligrams of cholesterol compared to 55 for beef and 18 
grams of fat compared to 87 for beef the association says 
a buffalo cow can bear calves for 30 years or more while a cow 
is usually sent to slaughter after about 10 stockmen can also sell 
skulls for 100 or so uncured robes for 6 to 12 a square foot 
and mountable heads for 400 on up 
the symbol of the american west is an imposing animal it has a 
blackbrown shaggy head and cape and short curved black horns a 
mature bull stands more than 6 feet tall at its hump and weighs 
2000 pounds 
a century ago the buffalo was nearly exterminated as the 
railroads pushed westward the slaughter was triggered by demand 
for meat to feed the rail crews and the crowded east a new tanning 
method that let the spongy hides be used as leather and political 
expediency to destroy the plains indians food supply 
historian francis haines said the rush of new hunters to the 
kansas plains resembled the stampede to a new gold strike in 
the spring of 1872 the constant booming of the big guns sounded 
more like a battle than a hunt 
in 1872 col richard irving dodge wrote there was apparently 
no limit to the number of buffaloes a year later he found 
myriads of carcasses the air was foul with a sickening stench 
and the vast plain which only 12 short months before teemed with 
animal life was a dead solitary putrid plain 
historians estimate 63 million buffalo were killed in seven 
years 
the plains indians whose society depended on the buffalo for 
food shelter and clothing either starved or surrendered their 
lives were so miserable the ghost dance cult sprang up 
preaching that whites would be buried and the buffalo would return 
the armys massacre of 200 sioux at wounded knee at the end of 1890 
ended the ghost dance movement 
it wasnt until the early 20th century that buffalo preservation 
became a concern the newly created american bison society and 
president teddy roosevelt were able to convince congress to set up 
preserves in oklahoma and montana in 1907 by then there were 
several hundred buffalo in private herds 
it was the ranchers who really took it upon themselves to save 
the bison said duane lammers president of the aba some of 
those early people who wanted to save the buffaloes had indian 
heritage some had indian wives it was very important to them to 
save the bison 
i think too it was just out of genuine care for them 
buffalo stockmen warn that the bison remains a wild animal 
extremely powerful and territorial there is an old saying that you 
can push a buffalo anywhere it wants to go another is never turn 
your back on a buffalo 
but the advantages are apparent as well 
they are easier to take care of said lammers who runs 
about 1000 head on his triple seven ranch in south dakota 
beef producers are living with their cow herds during the 
calving season that first spring when we didnt have cattle we 
went through calving here with free time it was like a couple of 
weeks off he said 
if a storm comes up im not losing sleep over my cattle with 
my buffalo i can just sleep through the night

last summer lynn redgrave filmed an abc spoof 
of juries jury duty the comedy almost everyone in the cast 
was in an abc series then she says and she was about to be 
unfortunately she mused this week mine is demised as 
im sure youre only too aware 
indeed chicken soup wherein she played an irish widow to 
jackie masons yiddishaccented former pajama salesman went poof 
amid much publicity on nov 7 it was a quick yank for a new 
series of great expectations but declining ratings 
redgrave of the english acting dynasty has been an actress 
since 1962 she has seen works in which she was involved go poof 
before but it was a new experience to have it happen just before a 
runthrough of a new episode 
the actress whose jury duty finally is airing this sunday 
still recalls that dark day in a hollywood studio when a chicken 
soup runthrough was halted by the arrival of executive producers 
bernie orenstein and saul turteltaub 
orenstein had a toddy in hand she says and i thought this 
is not a good sign these are very professional writers producers 
they dont drink during the working day somethings wrong with 
this picture 
and indeed it was 
redgraves disposition tends to be sunny side up she does not 
live on rue regret the acting profession has been very very good 
to her starting in the 60s with her london stage debut in a 
midsummer nights dream and first film hit georgy girl 
still she wishes the lords of abc had let soup brew a bit 
longer as future plots called for more of a lovehate relationship 
between her and mason 
id become somewhat becalmed in the early shows a loving 
alwayssupporting person which does not for comedy make but we 
were heading more into laurel and hardy a bit of heres another 
fine mess youve got me into 
it would have been fun its just a shame that nobody saw fit 
to see it through a bit further 
but next is the slogan of the acting profession so after 
soup shut down redgrave and her husbandmanager john clark 
whove lived for 10 years in los angeles adjourned to new york 
where they keep an apartment 
they took a breather from the tv ramble by returning to the 
stage where their respective careers began 
they guestacted for a december week on broadway in ar 
gurneys love letters a play about the friendship and romance 
of a couple from childhood to adulthood all told through letters 
and other correspondence 
the two hadnt acted together since meeting in the late 60s in 
a british television drama she said but love letters was such 
great fun they plan to do it again for two weeks in san francisco 
starting jan 23 
while here redgrave also teamed up with her older equally 
famous sister vanessa and sigourney weaver in a justforkicks 
staged reading of the final scene from chekhovs the three 
sisters 
that was fun too she says im hoping we can do the whole 
play soon perhaps first in england then new york i hope we can 
do it before we get too old and have to call it the three 
grandmothers 
television again someday oh id love to redgrave says 
these things series come and go but you never know each 
season comes along and what a crap shoot it is

even in death stuart continued to fool people the first word 
of his suicide prompted sympathy and sorrow from the dimaitis who 
were expecting him that night for dinner mrs dimaiti had even 
checked what foods chuck could easily digest because of his stomach 
wounds and resultant colostomy 
we were grieving for chuck because we thought he killed 
himself through grief said carl dimaiti he couldnt go on 
without carol and christopher my god hes thrown himself off the 
bridge in the ultimate act of love then to find out from the 
police that he was a prime suspect it was more than you can take 
the dimaitis were devastated giusto 64 who had open heart 
surgery a few years ago was rushed to a hospital gasping for 
breath with his blood pressure rising his wife could not stop 
crying carol was their only daughter her father had paid her way 
through law school by laboring as a pizza dough maker 
many others touched earlier by the attack on the stuarts such 
as the emergency medical crews and mclaughlin the dispatcher felt 
revulsion at the revelations 
its a pretty remarkable turn of events very bizarre and 
twisted a horrific ending to the real tragedy mclaughlin said 
anyone familiar with the case would have an empty feeling 
about it especially the people involved in the mission police and 
nurses 
others felt fury and anger 
stuarts original story about a black assailant touched off a 
vast manhunt police fanned out through the mission hill 
neighborhood frisking black men state politicians called for the 
reinstatement of the death penalty 
when i ordered an aggressive police response i wanted to 
send a strong signal to show the citys outrage mayor 
raymond flynn said 
three weeks after the murder william bennett a 39yearold 
paroled convict with a long record of violence including the 
shooting of a police officer was arrested and held on a warrant 
for a motor vehicle violation 
bennett became the prime suspect in the stuart case after grand 
jury witnesses said he had boasted of committing the crime 
stuarts suicide cleared bennett but black leaders were 
furious they asserted that bennett had been railroaded that his 
and other blacks constitutional rights had been violated they 
accused law officers of being all too willing to narrow their 
investigation to the black community 
paul leary first assistant district attorney of suffolk county 
retorted that black neighborhood residents themselves had led 
police to bennett as the no 1 suspect 
folks charles stuart took us all in said flynn

charles stuarts coldhearted scheme to kill his 
pregnant wife didnt just dupe the police and a sympathetic nation 
by setting the crime in a racially mixed neighborhood and 
concocting a black assailant he also ignited a tinderbox of 
resentment and smoldering anger among boston blacks 
leaders of the black community say racial stereotypes helped 
stuart elude suspicion until he killed himself 2 months after 
claiming a black mugger shot him and his wife 
stuart used the idea of a black man doing violence to a white 
woman because it was probably the most reasonable thing he could 
say to cover up his wrongdoings said paul parks a veteran 
activist and former state secretary of education 
police and city officials have been shaken by the force of the 
outcry but they repeatedly note that they had no reason to doubt 
stuarts claim until his brother turned him in jan 3 
when stuarts suicide cleared william bennett never charged 
but frequently named in police leaks to reporters an angry 
community erupted and bennett a man with a history of violence and 
arrests became an odd cause celebre 
it was not just bennett said city councilor charles yancey 
it was the sense that the entire community of color was somehow 
being blamed for this awful killing 
community and church leaders held news conferences blasting 
police city officials and the news media some called on the mayor 
and police commissioner to resign 
what there has been is a release of feelings from this 
community said georgette watson founder of dropadime drug tip 
hotline there is the release of the hurt that weve been holding 
inside and the shame thats been felt over this particular crime 
blacks say black victims never get the kind of attention paid 
the stuarts they assert that the police squads who flooded the 
mission hill area where the shootings were alleged to have taken 
place ran roughshod over residents in their hunt for clues 
the police went wild it was like wartime said martha 
knight an organizer at the mission main task force who said her 
25yearold son was among the many residents stopped by police 
before he knew it he was surrounded she said the cops 
told him to go into the hallway and drop his pants then his 
underwear 
you couldnt send a kid to the corner store because before 
they got back theyd been searched and questioned at least once 
and you cant tell me everybody they stopped and searched fit the 
description 
most of bostons blacks live mainly in the roxbury mattapan and 
dorchester neighborhoods few are seen amid the everyday bustle in 
the financial tourist capitol and shopping sections of the city 
whose population of 562994 includes 126229 blacks and 36068 
hispanics 
it is a minority community still scarred by the violence of 
forced busing and more recently by redlining and police stops of 
suspected gang members on the street 
charles stuart touched the sore that was left by racial wounds 
in this city said the rev bruce wall who counsels gang members 
if you listened to the radio talk shows the day after the 
killing wall said you heard the white community calling 
black people animals and saying blacks should go back to africa 
but wall was also distressed by the attention accorded the 
claims of some black leaders that the police had conspired to 
railroad a black man and to conceal the real crime 
for my elected officials and for ministers to stand up and 
vent rage that is not the scene that we want people to see of 
this community said wall it bothered me and a lot of people 
that we couldnt come together and make one statement with a united 
voice 
mayor raymond flynn whose tenure has been noted for efforts to 
establish urban harmony has tried to emphasize that much of the 
impact of the stuart case comes from extreme circumstances 
almost forgotten in the uproar of the last 10 days is how the 
widely publicized transcript of stuarts dramatic pleas for help 
over his car phone riveted the publics attention in october 
without that recording of a 911 operators desperate efforts to 
help stuart the story might have faded away as just another urban 
crime tragedy 
said edith flynn a professor of criminology at northeastern 
university what i think has happened has been a collision of 
longstanding prejudices with a very bizarre case

the patient quivered as william mccormick 
applied pressure to pinpoint the source of back pain then he 
inserted a needle no problem this time though sometimes the 
patients try to bite or kick 
mccormick one of about 125 us veterinarians certified to 
practice acupuncture says the therapy used by the chinese on 
humans and animals for 3500 years is an effective alternative to 
western medicine the potential is vast i feel each time i do it 
im touching on new ground 
acupuncture whether in humans or animals consists of 
stimulating precise points on the surface of the body 
traditionally the stimulus is insertion of extremely fine needles 
more recently ultrasound and lasers also are used 
in traditional chinese thought each human or animal is born 
with a fixed amount of energy called chi energy imbalance 
from external or internal causes is thought to be the underlying 
reason for disease by treating certain reflex points the 
acupuncturist helps the body balance its own vital energies 
laboratory studies have found that this balancing occurs 
primarily through the nervous system although physiological 
mechanisms such as hormones also are involved the international 
veterinary acupuncture society says balancing can adjust blood 
flow nerve and muscle tone hormone levels or organ function 
dr meredith l snader of chester springs pa executive 
secretary of the society uses acupuncture exclusively in her 
practice 
people are looking to alternative methods of treatment rather 
than going to drugs ms snader said the public is demanding 
that vets change instead of pumping animals full of medication 
the american veterinary medical association endorsed acupuncture 
in 1988 as valid treatment but it hasnt been totally accepted by 
veterinarians 
some think it is pretty strange and others accept it quite 
readily said mccormick ms snader said her colleagues were 
skeptical when she started using acupuncture eight years ago it 
didnt bother me i said just give me a chance now most of them 
are very willing now they refer clients to me 
acupuncture makes up a major part of mccormicks practice in 
virginias horse country where many owners and trainers insist on 
it my clients have come to expect expertise from me on that 
mostly because the horses have done well he said at its best 
its effective 80 percent of the time 
acupuncture started out as a small part of ms snaders 
practice but the demand became so great that i had to give up my 
traditional practice because i did not have time to do it 
while mccormick and ms snader deal primarily with horses 
acupuncture can be used on any animal the chinese use it on 
chickens pigs camels water buffaloes said mccormick you 
could use it on snakes for that matter 
kitty beveridge who trains show horses at her wind in the 
willows farm near middleburg swears by the technique as mccormick 
applied needles to a horse she described the dramatic 
turnaround of a 3yearold thoroughbred treated for pain in its 
back and legs he became much more relaxed through work and 
didnt try to hurry 
at wind in the willows mccormick treated three horses ms 
beveridge planned to take to florida for winter shows he worked 
quickly inserting needles into the horses backs haunches and 
legs as she held their halters 
a chestnut roan swung its head in a halfhearted attempt to nip 
mccormick an expert on such equine disrespect after having horses 
kick him in the face and lie down on him the worst hes suffered 
is a broken tooth 
working back on this end a kick could kill you mccormick 
said as he inserted needles in an animals hindquarters 
he administered a mild sedative to two of the horses at wind in 
the willows to cut down on rambunctious behavior as he made his way 
under and around them he said the needles themselves cause little 
pain and rarely require anesthesia 
while needles are the preferred implement portable 
batteryoperated lasers sometimes are used on sensitive reflex 
points because they are less intrusive than needles ultrasound 
machines provide deep heat and are useful for such diseases as 
arthritis 
in addition to chronic pain acupuncture is used to treat a wide 
variety of animal ailments including reproductive urinary tract 
and abdominal problems though mccormick said its not effective 
for such problems as broken limbs or acute bacterial infections 
that require antibiotics 
he recalled the case of an expensive race horse with an 
abdominal problem the owner spent 5000 for surgery and 5000 
for treatment of colitis but the horse kept having pain when he 
was called in he performed a 150 acupuncture treatment and the 
animal didnt have the problem again 
ms snader said acupuncture usually produces a positive response 
within minutes usually at the end of my treatment i see a 
reasonable improvement she said over the next several days i 
see changes in gait 
although animal acupuncture was brought to the united states in 
the early 1970s when president richard m nixon reestablished ties 
with china it isnt taught in veterinary schools said dr kent 
roberts an associate professor at the virginiamaryland regional 
college of veterinary medicine 
to receive certification veterinarians must take a 120hour 
course offered by the acupuncture society 
acceptance would become more widespread if it was included in 
veterinary education roberts said but he sees little chance of 
that happening because were pretty well pushed to get everything 
into a 4year curriculum 
still he believes acupuncture is a legitimate therapy it 
certainly has stood the test of time it must have some validity

a tomb built 4300 years ago for a 
palace official and his two wives has been found in the shadow of 
the giza pyramids the first unknown tomb discovered on the plateau 
since the mid1950s 
this is the first time weve seen such a tomb said zahi 
hawass director general of the pyramids area we can find no 
parallel to this tomb during the old kingdom 
giza inspector mahmoud hassan afife found the new tomb in 
october when he chanced upon the edge of a limestone wall we 
looked at the old records to see what early excavators had recorded 
in this spot there was nothing 
hieroglyphics revealed the tomb owners name that he was a 
purification priest who handled religious rituals and that he 
was a palace official 
hawass dates it to the end of the fifth dynasty about 200 years 
after the death in 2528 bc of pharaoh cheops builder of the 
great pyramid 
built of limestone blocks the 26foot by 66foot oblong tomb 
called a mastaba stands over a shaft 23 feet deep that was sealed 
with mud bricks after bodies were lowered into it the mastaba had 
no inner chambers 
on one side ancient artists carved two false doors with the 
owners name pernankh the doors face a courtyard with six 
limestone columns describing him and his wives mitrt nefer and 
nhwy 
the winter archaeology season was a month old when afife found 
the tomb and vigorous excavation has continued since on a recent 
morning a sandstorm so engulfed the dig that workers used rubber 
buckets to shield their heads from the sand debris cascaded onto 
the tombs base faster than diggers could dig 
suddenly from deep in a shaft a workman yelled gumgumah 
arabic for skull as a man above slowly turned a pulley a 
reddishgold skull creaked its way up the pit it appears to be a 
females in excellent condition 
such a find testifies to the sites value nearby pits have 
yielded piles of pottery shards bones and wooden pieces that 
officials said might be part of a bed or other funerary furniture 
to accompany the dead into the afterlife in an adjacent tomb were 
two limestone statues of wives of pharaonic officials 
hawass said he knew valuable leftovers would emerge from 
reexcavation of the vast western cemetery begun in the fifth year 
of cheops reign officials and their families used the cemetery 
over the centuries building limestone and mudbrick tombs along 
avenues of various sizes 
some egyptologists thought the area wouldnt give anything 
else but theyre wrong early excavators were in a hurry indiana 
jonesstyle some even used dynamite he said this tomb lies 
at the edge of the cemetery earlier this century archaeologists 
dumped their dirt onto these hills without checking to see if 
anything interesting lay underneath 
chances are even more tombs still lie just over there 
excavating leftovers is never a waste of time never 
busywork said amal samuel gizas chief inspector who estimates 
that as many as 4000 tombs and pits exist in the area known as the 
western cemetery when people dug in the past they only searched 
for treasure today were looking for history we never think if 
well find something or not 
last spring archaeologists clearing another part of the cemetery 
found the wellpreserved gypsummasked head of a female mummy from 
about the same period her faint smile reminiscent of the mona 
lisas 
giza plateau has two great cemeteries the eastern between the 
great pyramid and the sphinx and the western wedged between the 
pyramids of cheops and chephren generally queens and royal 
offspring are buried in the eastern cemetery officials and their 
families in the western 
the cemeteries of mastabas were arranged in parallel rows 
several feet apart with ownership planned carefully everybody 
wanted to be buried in the pyramids area seeking special benefits 
in life after death over the years as demand increased the 
symmetry went askew small tombs of officials and priests were 
placed among the once neat rows until the area was honeycombed 
we have to think of these cemeteries as a community that 
surrounded the king with the same feeling as when he was alive 
said hawass at the top of his pyramid is the pharaoh the head 
of his country around him lay those who would have been near him 
his family and officials those closest are in the eastern 
cemetery just like in a palace

natures way of recycling water gets some 
wet and wild twists in machines bill williamson builds to clean up 
hazardous wastes for industries ranging from nuclear power to 
perfume 
theres a whole new science that weve got to learn said 
williamson 74 whos been experimenting with evaporation and 
condensation since world war ii when he developed machines that 
distilled sea water aboard warships 
williamson a mechanical engineer turned his attention to 
fighting pollution 14 years ago when he and his sons bruce and 
rod founded the small but fastgrowing licon inc in pensacola 
we are doing some weird things some smart physical chemists 
when they see what we are doing they just throw up their hands 
he said 
licon produces evaporators that clean up wastewater and let 
industries concentrate and reuse toxic metals and chemicals that 
once went down the drain into the environment some plants that use 
the machines dont even have sewers 
the evaporators with a patented heat exchanger operate at 
relatively low temperatures high efficiency and low cost said rod 
williamson they can treat wastewater for 1 or 2 cents a gallon 
compared to as much as 12 cents for other machines and up to 2 for 
disposal in a hazardous waste dump he said 
one is being tested at the three mile island nuclear plant 
nupac services plans to use it to decontaminate 23 million gallons 
of water irradiated in the 1979 accident that shut down the 
harrisburg pa plant 
licon evaporators which cost 14000 to 250000 are in use in 
the united states canada and europe most are in metal plating 
plants although one is cleaning up shampoo wastes at an alberto 
culver plant in puerto rico 
customers can be found in nearly any industry that produces 
liquid hazardous waste but there are limits rod williamson said 
some industries including paper mills and chemical factories 
produce too much wastewater to be efficiently treated with 
evaporators now being produced he said 
bill williamson who holds 30 patents said the key to the 
machines is low air pressure when boiled even freshwater leaves a 
scale although the residue is much worse with saltwater or 
wastewater and would quickly foul and corrode a conventional 
evaporator he said he discovered that heating water in a whole or 
partial vacuum thereby lowering its boiling point would reduce 
the scale and permit recovering specific salts for reuse the 
machines also reuse heat the way a heat pump improves a home 
heating and air conditioning system 
williamson began working on desalinization while employed by 
maxim silencer corp which specialized in equipment to muffle 
diesel engines it was asked to develop a way to purify saltwater 
aboard coast guard cutters so that they could escort convoys in 
world war ii the cutters were too small to carry enough fuel and 
water to cross the ocean but could make the trip if water storage 
areas were used instead for fuel oil he said 
the company rented a beachfront house at clinton conn to test 
the machine its resemblance to a moonshiners still prompted 
neighbors to call the police at first officers who raided the 
place didnt believe the machine was producing nothing stronger 
than water but they looked at it and tasted it and said ok 
williamson said 
he later worked on similar equipment for nuclear submarines and 
in 1970 helped set up a desalting test station near the panhandle 
resort town of destin for mechanical equipment co of new orleans 
williamson and his sons then formed licon short for liquid 
conditioning or liquid concentration and built its first 
evaporator in his garage out of pipe fittings and other parts they 
bought or made

recently discovered comet austin may put 
on a big show in the eastern sky at dawn in late april and early 
may delighting sky watchers who needed binoculars to get a decent 
peek at halleys comet 
comet west in 1976 was the last time a comet provided 
spectacular view for nakedeye observers and its high time we 
had another one said leif robinson editor of sky amp telescope 
magazine 
but the magazines editors wary because of past comet 
predictions gone awry also warned that comet austin could turn 
out to be just another runofthemill faint comet undergoing a 
temporary brightening 
for the rest of the winter comet austin will be barely above 
the western horizon after sunset likely visible only to careful 
observers with binoculars or telescopes and charts telling them 
exactly where to look in early april it will pass 32 million 
miles from the sun which will vaporize large comet ice to create a 
tail of gas and dust millions of miles long sky amp telescope said 
the best viewing will be in late april and the first week of 
may when the comet speeding toward earth should shine in the 
eastern sky at the first light of dawn with its tail pointing 
upward 
if it becomes as bright as hoped youll be able to just step 
outdoors and see comet austin hanging among stars at the first 
beginnings of daybreak at least in areas away from city lights 
the editors said 
comet austin was discovered dec 6 when it was 230 million 
miles from the sun by amateur astronomer rodney rd austin of new 
plymouth new zealand

nasa scientists used radar to figure out 
the shape of eros an asteroid named after the greek god of love 
but its not a very sexy hunk of rock eros is a rounded 
trapezoid in other words it looks roughly like a baking potato 
steven ostro and colleagues at nasas jet propulsion laboratory 
used a new approach to studying radar waves that were bounced off 
eros in january 1975 
they learned that eros is nearly 22 miles long 9 wide and 8 
thick it rotates on its short axis so it appears to tumble 
endoverend every five hours and 16 minutes laboratory spokesman 
jim doyle said 
ostro recently outlined his findings during a meeting of the 
american geophysical union in san francisco his paper was titled 
the shape of eros 
eros was discovered in 1898 its orbit crosses mars orbit 
eros made its closest approach to earth this century in january 
1975 when it was 14 million miles away a few months later it was 
observed using radar at the national aeronautics and space 
administrations goldstone calif facility

by now the resolutions of even the most 
resolute new years dieters may be wearing thin especially if the 
dieter is not 
americans seem forever to be dieting and falling for the latest 
miracle way to a thinner body but experts insist it is only 
through a permanent change in behavior that any weight loss plan 
can be effective 
specialists lately are focusing on two factors exercise and 
dietary fat 
overall if theres anything people agree with among 
nutritionists its that you should cut back on dietary fats 
said dr helene swenerton of the cooperative extension nutrition 
office at the university of california davis 
ron and nancy goor and katherine boyd authors of the choose 
to lose diet houghton mifflin 1795 advise dont focus on 
total calories or sugar or starch focus on fat 
eat pasta and potatoes they say carbohydrates are the good 
guys 
because fat is often a big component of food thats not real 
nutritious anyway and because its more caloriedense its a good 
target for dieters 
fats are twice as concentrated as carbohydrates or proteins 
said jayne newmark a dietician at the arizona heart institute and 
a spokeswoman for the american dietetic association one gram of 
protein or carbohydrate has four calories one gram of fat has at 
least nine 
the choose to lose diet works on the principle of a fat 
budget the dieter determines based on height desired weight 
and frame size how many fat calories can be consumed daily then 
as long as the dieter stays within the budget all foods are ok 
you need to eat some fat newmark said but it is easy to 
get too much because it tastes good in children especially 
fats should not be drastically reduced because they are needed for 
proper growth and development 
the way to make it easier is to do small simple changes one 
at a time she said for example switch from a highfat to a 
lowfat cheese or limit the amount of cheese eaten id rather 
someone follow 50 percent of what i say forever than 100 percent 
for a while 
still dieting is dieting and means cutting down though 
verylowcalorie unsupervised diets are considered dangerous by 
many physicians 
choose to lose which includes calorie and fat tables and 
recipes recommends no fewer than 1000 calories a day and no more 
than 20 percent of the calories as fat a typical american diet is 
35 percent to 40 percent fat 
the authors list foods with high fat concentrations and those 
without lists that could surprise some people they include fast 
foods and frozen diet dinners that get as many as half their 
calories from fats microwave popcorn for example has 99 to 214 
fat calories per ounce popcorn popped at home in oil has 138 
airpopped popcorn has no fat calories 
the goors say the impetus for their new book came from an 
earlier book on lowering cholesterol people who cut back on 
saturated fats to reduce cholesterol found they also lost weight 
although all fats have the same caloric content experts say 
saturated fats such as butter contribute to other health problems 
as well they recommend olive and other vegetable oils 
but while people can take some action with respect to weight 
control we dont have the answers swenerton said noting that 
98 of 100 people regain weight they lose and that many people are 
misled by diet promises 
one kind of misinformation is that obesity is just from eating 
too much she said thats only part of the whole picture 
which also includes exercise psychology and genetics

great northern nekoosa corp has accused 
georgiapacific corp chairman t marshall hahn jr of providing 
untruthful testimony in the paper companies merger fight 
according to documents unsealed wednesday 
great northern charged that hahn falsely said under oath that 
his company had no plans to sell mills in millinocket and east 
millinocket during the time it was asking bankers to finance the 
attempted takeover of great northern at the time georgiapacific 
actually told citibank it would sell the maine assets but did not 
want to go on record saying so the documents indicate 
the latest charges to surface in georgiapacifics 38 billion 
attempt to acquire great northern were unsealed late wednesday by 
us district judge gene carter after citibank said it would not 
oject 
citibank had been approached by georgiapacific to be the lead 
lender in the deal but bank of america ultimately was chosen the 
court documents say 
georgiapacific immediately responded with a statement that 
repeated its assertion that there is no plan to sell the maine 
mills and lashed out at great northerns scurrilous and false 
charges 
great northerns filing came as part of its attempt to persuade 
the judge to block georgiapacifics merger attempt as well as 
georgiapacifics attempt to oust great northerns directors in a 
proxy fight 
the filing says that although georgiapacific told citibank it 
wanted to sell the maine assets hahn told lawyers in a sworn 
deposition last week in new york such sales had been ruled out 
before the first approach through lending institutions for 
financing of the offer 
in its motion for a preliminary injunction great northern says 
georgiapacific broke securities laws by attempting to cover up its 
plans to sell the maine properties 
but atlantabased georgiapacific called great northerns 
accusations unconscionable and intolerable 
for the umpteenth time we have no asset sale plans and no 
undisclosed intentions relating to the acquisition of great 
northern nekoosa hahn said in the statement adding that he 
cannot control what interpretations others may make of our 
discussions 
great northern says georgiapacific has tried to conceal its 
alleged plans to sell the maine assets in order to make the merger 
more politically palatable in maine great northern also is 
challenging the merger on antitrust grounds as is the maine 
attorney general

the new york attorney general says he will sue 
exxon corp for an oil spill off staten island unless the company 
admits its liability and agrees to pay for damages within 48 hours 
it is imperative that exxon immediately accept its liability 
not only to clean up its spill but also to fully compensate the 
state financially for the damage to new york states natural 
resources attorney general robert abrams said in a letter sent 
wednesday to exxon president lee r raymond 
abrams called on exxon to pay for an immediate study to assess 
the damage to natural resources caused by the spill and to 
determine the best ways to restore our natural resources 
abrams said the study should be done under the supervision of 
the state 
more than 560000 gallons of home heating oil leaked from an 
exxon pipeline into the arthur kill waterway off staten island on 
jan 2 
abrams said the oil has contaminated critical waterfowl 
feeding and wetland areas of the environmentally sensitive pralls 
island bird sanctuary 
exxon has also been criticized for the handling of the spill of 
11 million gallons of oil from the exxon valdez tanker last march 
24 along 1000 miles of alaska coastline it was the worst oil 
spill in us history 
on wednesday exxon said it had created a senior management 
position to handle safety and environmental issues 
edwin j hess an executive formerly in charge of marketing 
refining and planning for international operations at the nations 
largest oil company has been named to the new position of vice 
president environment and safety 
hess will report to raymond 
since the alaska spill exxon shareholders have called on the 
company to show greater environmental accountability the company 
subsequently named an environmentalist to the board of directors 
and created a special committee to review environmental issues 
abrams accused exxon of creating a minialaska in the arthur 
kill 
he said the damage was compounded by exxons apparent failure 
to notify new york state and city environmental officials of the 
spill immediately upon its discovery 
on tuesday exxon said a company refinery operator twice 
restarted the flow of oil through the leaking pipeline after 
automatic safety systems stopped the flow 
exxon also told new york and new jersey environmental officials 
that a system to detect leaks in the pipeline had been faltering at 
least once or twice a week for a year 
more than 200 birds have been found dead since the leak was 
detected 
a spokesman for abrams leslie gersing said the attorney 
general would file a lawsuit if exxon had not met his conditions by 
late friday 
a spokesman for exxon bill smith said the company did not 
receive the letter until after business hours and had no immediate 
comment

siemens ag the giant electronics 
company will acquire a majority stake in nixdorf computer ag a 
financially troubled west german data and informationsystems 
maker officials said 
the two companies plan to merge their computer operations after 
the transaction according to a brief announcement from nixdorf on 
wednesday 
the announcement gave few details of the transaction or the 
intended plans of the two companies 
earlier wednesday sources at munichbased siemens said their 
company had acquired 51 percent of nixdorf for an unspecified price 
siemens also officially confirmed the nixdorf pact 
meanwhile the west german federal cartel office said it had 
been informed of the intention of the two companies but that a 
formal application for approval had not yet been submitted 
the cartel office must rule on the agreement and is empowered to 
reject it if it finds antitrust concerns 
the companies said siemens acquired the common stock from the 
nixdorf family which in effect controls all the voting common 
shares there are about 56 million common shares outstanding 
nixdorfs 56 million nonvoting preferred stock shares are 
listed on west german exchanges 
up to now the nixdorf family had been reluctant to part with 
their full control of the company despite deep financial problems 
there had not been any hint of the negotiations with siemens 
which in the past stated publicly its interest in taking a stake in 
nixdorf 
it was not immediately clear what if any measures siemens will 
take to help nixdorf recover from ongoing financial losses that the 
west german news magazine der spiegel recently reported as totaling 
560 million last year nixdorf has not confirmed that figure 
in its press statement wednesday nixdorf said it will continue 
to push through its previously announced broad corporate overhaul 
aimed at improving profitability by cutting costs beefing up 
productivity and redirecting strategic priorities 
the company plans to pull out of lossproducing business areas 
such as the manufacture of various types of computer hardware 
a nixdorf spokesman said his companys exchangelisted preferred 
shares will not be affected by the siemens agreement and that this 
stock will remain in public hands and traded on exchanges 
meanwhile nixdorf said the contemplated business arrangement 
with siemens is predicated on the idea that both companies data 
and information systems businesses would together form a powerful 
market force 
the corporate focus of both companies lies in these areas 
though up to now in different market segments and geographic 
regions nixdorf said 
under the agreement siemens would merge its data and 
information systems operations with those of nixdorf which would 
then become a majorityowned affiliate of siemens 
final details of the transaction and the merging of the business 
lines remain to be worked out the companies said

members of the house banking committee are 
considering abolishing the new office congress established last 
august to regulate thrift institutions during the 1989 savings and 
loan crisis 
rep charles e schumer dny said wednesday he will 
introduce a bill when congress reconvenes to eliminate the treasury 
departments office of thrift supervision and turn its authority 
over to two bank regulators the comptroller of the currency and 
the federal reserve board 
a similar approach has been advocated by rep jim leach of iowa 
the second ranking republican on the banking committee 
schumer said m danny walls resignation as the thrift offices 
top official presents us with a tremendous opportunity to 
straighten out a regulatory system that most agree has been 
jerrybuilt 
wall after being harshly questioned by the house panel in six 
weeks of hearings last fall over his regulation of the now 
collapsed lincoln savings and loan association of irvine calif 
announced in december he would step down from the job as soon as 
president bush finds a replacement 
the new thrift office in the treasury department was established 
as part of a 160 billion taxpayer bailout of sampl lossses to 
replace the federal home loan bank board as the industrys chief 
regulator 
a former banking aide to sen jake garn rutah and onetime 
staff chief of the senate banking committee wall had chaired the 
bank board for slightly more than a year prior to its abolition 
while effectively making sampls come into compliance with federal 
banking rules schumer complained that last years bailout law also 
allowed them to retain their own separate regulator leaving open 
the potential for the same abuses that scarred the industy and 
depositors in the past 
since the two agencies promulgate regulations that are 
required by law to have the same practical effect it is clear that 
only one body is necessary he said of the thrift and 
comptrollers offices 
schumer said his bill would gradually merge the thrift office 
into the comptroller of the currencys agency to coincide with the 
scheduled phaseout in 1994 of the resolution trust corp another 
new agency established in the bailout law 
the trust corporations primary function is disposing of up to 
400 billion in real estate and other property collateralizng 
soured loans by failed thrifts that have been or will be taken over 
by the government

the longrunning feud between american telephone 
amp telegraph co and upstart mci communications corp continues to 
escalate with new charges of deceptive telemarketing practices 
being lodged 
atampt sued mci and its telemarketing agent pioneer 
teletechnologies of sergeant bluff iowa on wednesday claiming 
they stolesome of its longdistance customers by using false or 
misleading information or by switching services without customers 
consent 
mci strongly denied the allegations 
the suit which was filed in us district court in newark 
nj is the latest salvo in a battle that began in the 1970s when 
mci successfully broke atampts longdistance monopoly 
atampt still remains the nations largest longdistance carrier 
with about 68 percent of the market followed by mci with about 12 
percent and us sprint communications co with 8 percent 
last october mci sued atampt for allegedly engaging in deceptive 
advertising by claiming atampts service was superior or that mci had 
misrepresented its services or rates 
atampt countersued questioning claims made in mci ads 
in the latest court action which seeks an unspecified amount of 
damages atampt claims it suffered losses in the tens of millions 
of dollars by mcis alleged deceptive telemarketing practices 
atampt also petitioned the federal communications commission to 
amend its rules so that telephone customers would have to provide 
written permission before switching longdistance carriers current 
rules allow customers to authorize a change verbally 
we believe our proposal to the fcc will curtail the numerous 
instances of unauthorized switching or slamming as its known 
in the industry that consumers have endured merrill tutton 
atampts vice president for consumer services told a news conference 
in new york on wednesday 
i think there are probably an awful lot of people there who 
this has happened to but they havent gone to the trouble to 
complain 
atampt claimed that the many thousands of complaints it did 
receive from consumers about mci particularly from elderly people 
who might suffer from hearing problems or hispanics who faced 
language barriers prompted it to seek legal action against mci 
im talking about a 90yearold woman in new jersey who 
gets a call asking her if shed like to sign up with mci and 
couldnt hear the representative clearly so she asked that they 
send her information by mail tutton said instead she gets a 
letter from mci and learns shes been switched without her 
approval 
tutton claimed other customers said mci erroneously told them 
for example that they needed to switch services because atampt and 
mci were merging or that atampt was going out of business 
when asked tutton said atampt could not provide specific numbers 
of people who complained and did not have permission to release 
names of the complainers 
he said preliminary studies showed that from february to 
november of last year 10 percent to 15 percent of the atampt 
customers switching to other longdistance carriers had been 
unaware of the change 
john houser a spokesman for washingtonbased mci said the 
company categorically denies that we have been misleading 
customers 
mci said atampt is acting out of frustration at mcis success in 
attracting new business since the breakup of the bell system in 
1984 
mci has been winning customers in the marketplace at a rate of 
over 100000 a week based on value and superlative customer 
service the company said in a statement 
this is just another example of atampt preaching competition on 
one hand and whining when competition takes hold in the 
marketplace

a suspended minneapolis lawyer denies charges 
that he illegally traded on inside information to pay back more 
than 1 million he allegedly diverted from clients accounts 
the securities and exchange commission filed a civil complaint 
against james h ohagan on wednesday charging he made 435 
million in illegal profits by trading on inside information about 
grand metropolitan plcs bid for pillsbury co 
the sec also alleged ohagan engaged in insider trading to repay 
money taken from client trust accounts 
in minneapolis ohagan attorney william mauzy said his client 
denied trading on inside information but concededed he borrowed 
money from clients accounts mauzy said ohagan has been charged 
with theft by the hennepin county minn prosecutor but asserted 
he really didnt have to make a score in pillsbury to repay the 
accounts 
mauzy said ohagan was a sophisticated and heavy investor in 
the stock market who accumulated a total of 5 million in his 
accounts before he began trading pillsbury securities 
ohagan also maintains he bought pillsbury shares on the 
recommendation of brokers who have filed affidavits with the sec 
to that effect 
on dec 5 1989 ohagan was temporarily suspended from 
practicing law by the minnesota supreme court 
the sec complaint filed in federal court in minneapolis 
accuses ohagan of trading pillsbury securities in 1988 using 
misappropriated confidential information about grand mets pending 
hostile tender offer 
ohagan at the time was a partner in the law firm dorsey amp 
whitney which was local counsel for grand met a british food and 
beverage producer in the bid for pillsbury grand met acquired 
minneapolisbased pillsbury in january 1989 
ohagan left dorsey amp whitney late last february said robert 
struyk chairman of the minneapolis firm 
struyk said ohagan who specialized in securities commodities 
and medical malpractice litigation had been with the firm since 
1963 or 1964 he said dorsey amp whitney was not involved in the case 
and had cooperated with the sec 
the complaint alleges that ohagan learned of the pending grand 
met offer in july 1988 after speaking with another dorsey amp whitney 
partner 
according to the complaint between late july and sept 21 
1988 ohagan bought pillsbury stock and call options on oct 4 
1988 grand met announced its cash tender offer for pillsbury at 
60 per share driving up the stocks price by 20 
from oct 5 to oct 17 ohagan sold his pillsbury stock and 
options allegedly netting 435 million in profits 
mauzy said in a statement that when ohagan learned in september 
1988 that dorsey amp whitney had been approached to act as counsel to 
grand met he immediately cancelled outstanding orders to purchase 
options to buy pillsbury shares 
the sec complaint alleges that ohagan needed the trading 
profits to repay about 1 million he had secretly diverted from a 
client of his law firm northrup king co 
the complaint also alleged ohagan diverted funds from at least 
two other clients which were not identified 
asked if it was unusual for an sec complaint to go into such 
detail about the alleged motive for a violation harry j weiss an 
sec attorney who worked on the case said keep in mind this case 
is not settled the complaint contains all evidence that the 
commission thinks is relevent 
the complaint seeks a court order requiring ohagan to return 
the profits from his alleged illegal deal plus fines equal to his 
profits

campeau corp has saved face by paying certain 
bills on time but the larger question of whether the troubled 
company and its us retailers can achieve a financial turnaround 
remains unresovled 
campeau said wednesday it was sending payments on schedule to 
numerous merchandise suppliers 
in addition the companys restructuring committee announced the 
appointment of a new executive to direct the financial revival at 
campeaus us holdings including allied stores corp and 
federated department stores inc campeau also owns shopping malls 
and other commercial real estate in the united states 
there has been widespread speculation in the retail trade that 
campeau might seek shelter for its us retailers in bankruptcy 
court which would allow its stores to remain open while they work 
out their financial dilemmas 
by paying money owed to vendors the canadian retail and real 
estate company signaled its interest in maintaining good relations 
with manufacturers that do business with its nearly 260 us 
department stores 
carol sanger spokeswoman at campeaus corporate communications 
office in cincinnati said most of the bills which total about 
100 million were for womens apparel 
the fact that these bills are being paid as they are due 
reinforces the companys desire to deal with its vendors in as 
close to a normal course of business relationship as possible and 
it also reinforces the value we place on our relationships with 
vendors ms sanger said 
she said the campeau board which met monday and tuesday met 
again wednesday at the companys toronto headquarters the meeting 
was adjourned by afternoon and was scheduled to reconvene this 
morning 
after adjourning the board issued an announcement on the 
appointment of chance bahadur to the post of executive vice 
president and chief financial officer of campeau corp us inc 
he will assume his new duties immediately bahadur is joining 
campeau from marriott corp where he has been senior vice 
president of finance and treasurer since october 1988 
the board also said it accepted the resignation of russell s 
davis as executive vice president and chief financial officer of 
campeau federated and allied davis who joined federated in 1984 
had been promoted to executive vice president and cfo of federated 
and allied in may 1988 and added those titles at campeau in april 
1989 
board members said they understook davis desire to relinquish 
a range of responsibilities that has become increasingly 
demanding and unrelenting in recent months 
the bills due wednesday were for goods shipped during the peak 
shopping weeks ahead of christmas companies that regularly deal 
with the campeau stores have said bills from last autumn were paid 
promptly 
but when news of the depth of campeaus financial difficulties 
unfolded late last year many suppliers suspended further 
merchandise shipments and said they would decide whether to resume 
after jan 10 when new bills came due 
a number of manufacturers of womens sportswear and other 
apparel said they had been notified their bills were being 
processed and had no reason to doubt it 
the wednesday deadline had been viewed as an important symbolic 
date by the retail trade even merchants who werent owed anything 
were watching for what campeau would do so they could decide 
whether to take the risk of doing future business with its stores 
spring merchandise typically is shipped starting at the end of this 
month 
janet mangano director of research at the investment firm 
josephthal amp co inc said it is still unclear whether campeau 
will be able to pull out of its problems she said meeting current 
bills from suppliers didnt mean campeau would be able to cover 
debt obligations coming due in the near future 
a more crucial test for campeau will come monday allied and 
federated must assure citibank and other members of a group that 
lent them 234 billion that they are solvent the loan could be 
declared in default if they cannot give the assurance 
disclosures about campeaus financial predicament surfaced in 
september the canadian property company olympia amp york 
developments ltd provided a 250 million cash infusion and campeau 
said it would restructure its farflung operations and attempt to 
reorganize its finances 
campeaus precarious condition was caused chiefly by the heavy 
debt burden it built up when it bought federated in 1988 for 66 
billion and allied two years earlier for 34 billion 
part of the restructuring plan already mapped out involves 
selling federateds bloomingdales department store chain 
considered one of campeaus most valuable possessions 
federateds other chains include abraham and straus burdines 
lazarus and richs allied operates the bon marche jordan marsh 
maas brothers and sterns chains

phil lochner has an excellent resume he appears to have the 
potential to make an outstanding sec commissioner said sen 
donald w riegle jr chairman of the senate banking committee 
which will question the nominee at a confirmation hearing

qualifications carefully during the confirmation process riegle 
dmich said in a statement clearly the position of sec 
commissioner at this time is among the most important in 
government 
lochner had been general counsel of time inc which renamed 
itself time warner inc last year and officially merged wednesday

title to deputy general counsel 
reached at time warners new york office lochner declined to

i think its an excellent nomination said butler who was 
lochners boss for a year in the 1970s he had a lot of 
securities experience when he was here generally said butler 
adding he brings an an excellent businesslegal perspective to 
the sec which it hasnt had for a long time

breeden who was at cravath swaine amp moore during part of the 
time lochner was there hailed the nomination 
his background as a lawyer with extensive experience in 
securities and general corporate law and as a former law professor

headquarters time warner has a tradition of encouraging public 
service and we are very proud of phils nomination 
lochner of greenwich conn was general counsel and secretary 
for time inc and time warner starting in september 1988 
he was among the supporters of time managements decision to 
reject a bid from paramount communications inc last year and go 
ahead with the 14 billion warner merger 
but like several officials at time and warner he found he was 
one of two employees with the same job title at the merged company 
although a time warner spokesman denied that lochners post had 
become redundant 
a 1964 graduate of yale university lochner joined time inc as 
an associate general counsel in 1978 he obtained his law degree

dallas jurors who gave houston lighting amp power 
co a favorable verdict in a 419 million lawsuit will be flown to 
houston at the utilitys expense for a tour of its nuclear plant 
and a stay at a luxury hotel 
the utility confirmed it invited the jurors about a month ago to 
come to houston at hlampps expense the houston chronicle reported 
today 
spokesman graham painter said that because the jurors role in 
the case is over there is nothing improper about hlampp chairman don 
jordans playing host and showing off the plant 
he did not know how many jurors would take up the offer nor 
would he estimate the cost of the air fare and overnight 
accommodations during the trip this weekend 
the jurors decided in july that the utilitys partner in the 
south texas nuclear project the city of austin deserved no 
damages for hlampps withholding information that would have allowed 
the city to anticipate huge cost overruns 
the trial was held in dallas after a judge determined that a 
fair trial could not be held in austin 
city officials in austin said the invitation to jurors and the 
judge was just the latest impropriety in the utilitys push for the 
plant whose cost ballooned from 900 million to almost 6 billion 
its highly unprofessional and very questionable until the 
people of texas realize that this sort of shenanigans cost the 
people hundreds of millions of dollars it wont stop said city 
councilman george humphrey 
when you have a jury that rules the defendant is guilty and 
awards no damages and a short time later theyre offered free air 
fare free lodging free meals and firstclass treatment it cant 
help but cast a doubt 
ive never heard of this happening in civil litigation i 
think its fundamentally unethical but so what else is new said 
councilman smoot carlmitchell 
clarence guittard a retired appeals court judge who presided 
over the fourmonth trial decided not to join the plant tour he 
gave no reason the newspaper reported 
painter said public tours of the plant in bay city 90 miles 
from houston usually include lunch and that the utility decided 
jurors should stay overnight in houston because of the time it 
takes to get from dallas

texas air chairman frank lorenzo 
says eastern airlines rebuilding program is a case of smaller is 
better but that he needlessly provoked a united opposition 
from the carriers three unions 
in a rare miami appearance since all three of easterns unions 
went on strike last march 4 lorenzo told a downtown rotary club 
luncheon crowd wednesday he should have been more sensitive to 
the realities the union leaders were dealing with 
lorenzos remark echoed earlier statements of eastern officials 
that management had underestimated the resolve of the carriers 
pilots the pilots and easterns flight attendants walked off the 
job in sympathy when the airlines machinists went out on strike 
the pilots and flight attendants only returned to work in late 
november 
the last year has been a very difficult one lorenzo told 
his audience there have been mistakes and there have been a lot 
of things i know all parties would like to change 
if you look at the last nine months as a battle he said 
it is a battle no one has won with the possible tiny exception 
of consumers 
arriving for the luncheon lorenzo whose texas air bought 
eastern four years ago walked through rows of striking machinists 
chanting choke frank choke and warned rotarians to secure 
your wallets 
police officers stood guard for the speech 
inside lorenzo told the rotarians eastern losses for the eight 
years before he took over the carrier amounted to 1 billion he 
said major changes were needed but that union leaders were 
reluctant to face the needed changes 
thousands of dedicated employees he said are out of work 
because they got caught in a system that was no fault of their 
own cutting wages and employees was hard from a human point of 
view but there was no choice he said 
but lorenzo said easterns rebuilding was succeeding since 
seeking chapter 11 protection from creditors shortly after the 
strike began 
while the airline thats out there today is not as big as the 
airline it was before i believe very strongly and i believe you 
will too when you see it that a lot of quality has been 
substituted for quantity 
lorenzo said there has been a strong response to easterns newly 
announced discount fares starting at 69 and the airline has been 
getting good consumer response to its service overall 
we face the 90s with great optimism he said 
but frank ortis the machinists union local 702 president said 
afterward that lorenzo is in big trouble as he tries to bring 
eastern out of chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization 
eastern is plagued by cancellations and their load factors 
have been disastrous said ortis who was not allowed to attend 
the speech its time for frank lorenzo to come to his senses and 
sell the airline so we can save it 
ortis said 96 percent of the machinists are still out on strike

at least four major supermarket chains 
switched off vegetablefreshening mist machines like the one 
implicated in a deadly outbreak of legionnaires disease the 
manufacturer said the device wasnt to blame 
winndixie safeway aampp and kroger said their stores stopped 
using the machines as a precaution after learning that one at 
winndixies bogalusa store had been blamed for novembers 
outbreak which killed two people and infected dozens 
researchers traced the bacteria to the onequart water reservoir 
of the mist machine at the supermarket one of three in this 
southeast louisiana town of about 16000 people said dr louise 
mcfarland state epidemiologist 
this is the first time a community outbreak of legionnaires 
disease has been traced to a mist machine of any type she said 
i dont think anyone would ever have suspected it 
the machine fell under suspicion after the store was implicated 
in interviews with the 70 people who fell ill and about 150 who 
didnt 
the centers for disease control in atlanta was examining the 
device to determine what role its design may have played in 
harboring the bacteria which cause flulike symptoms officials 
said 
other supermarkets use mist machines but it was not known if 
they were made by the same company lw beal of portland maine 
said dr thomas farley an epidemiologist with the state department 
of health and hospitals 
beal said his company supplies the sprayers to most major 
grocery chains and has had no other problem with other systems 
the legionnaires virus is in the water in that area beal 
said youll find it in any kind of machine that uses water and 
is not properly cleaned 
if a machine is properly cleaned you wont have a problem if 
you have an ice cream machine and you dont clean it properly you 
cant blame an outbreak of salmonella on the manufacturer of the 
machine 
health authorities long ago learned that the legionnaires 
bacteria thrive in standing water but farley said researchers 
learned important lessons from the bogalusa investigation 
we now know more about where the bacteria can hide and what 
can cause an outbreak he said thats important to louisiana 
and the nation 
the machine was installed more than a year before the outbreak 
said lewis libby vice president of jacksonville flabased 
winndixie 
winndixie had been using the bogalusatype mist machine in 97 
of its 1250 stores in 13 sun belt states libby said the machines 
were removed and those stores are spraying tap water from hoses to 
keep produce fresh 
all misting machines at safeways 1200 stores mostly in the 
western united states and canada have been turned off and were 
being cleaned said bob bradford a spokesman for the oakland 
califbased company 
we have two types we are not sure if we have the one 
involved he said we just thought it would be best to turn 
them off until further notice 
cincinnatibased kroger the nations secondlargest chain with 
more than 1200 stores in 20 mostly midwestern and southern states 
said it has stopped using the spayers in its produce departments 
it said most of its stores use automatic spray or mist systems 
but that stores in the cincinnati and dayton ohio areas use hoses 
montvale njbased aampp originally said it would not stop using 
its misters because they do not have reservoirs to hold the water 
like the one in bogalusa but spokesman michael roarke said today 
that the company had decided to shut down its misters temporarily 
because of customer concern 
he said aampp has 1250 stores in 26 states and canada and uses 
the misters in about 200 outlets 
legionnaires disease first identified in 1976 after an 
outbreak at an american legion convention in philadelphia killed 34 
people is caused by bacteria that often thrive in cool standing 
water found in such places as water towers or air conditioning 
ducts the germ usually enters the lungs through water droplets

savings and loan regulators who penalized two 
directors of a bankrupt colorado savings institution are leaving 
open the possibility of sanctions against other former officers 
including president bushs son 
enforcement officials from the office of thrift supervision met 
monday with bushs son neil who served on the board of silverado 
banking savings and loan association from 1985 until august 1988 
thrift office spokesman william fulwider said today 
hes been here as have other associates of silverado 
fulwider said 
the houston post said in todays editions that bush met with 
thrift office enforcement director rosemary stewart for four hours 
the thrift office said wednesday that two directors of silverado 
have agreed to an order prohibiting them from working at any 
federally insured financial institution without prior approval from 
regulators 
the order covers commercial banks savings institutions and 
credit unions 
richard k vandapool formerly vice chairman and chief operating 
office of the thrift and robert m lewis formerly vice chairman 
and chief financial officer agreed to the penalty without 
admitting or denying the allegations against them 
no action was announced against neil bush however the thrift 
office said it was still investigating the sampl was considering 
what action should be taken against any other former silverado 
directors and senior management and anticipates the initiation 
of other prohibition actions in the near future 
the office said in a statement that examiners had expressed 
grave concerns about the soundness of silverado before closing 
it in december 1988 
the regulators were particularly concerned about what they 
believed to be excessive concentration in commercial loans in a 
depressed market an unusually large number of problem transactions 
with related parties such as shareholders officers and directors 
and inefficiencies in assessing the credit worthiness of 
borrowers the thrift office said 
lewis lawyer michael bender said his client denied any 
wrongdoing but agreed to the penalty because he just doesnt have 
the money to fight the feds liz kearney an attorney for 
vandapool had no comment 
another agency the federal deposit insurance corp is 
reviewing silverado to determine whether to file a civil suit to 
recover some of the institutions losses from officers and 
directors 
james moroney a former examiner at the federal home loan bank 
of topeka has alleged in interviews that regulators did not crack 
down on silverado because of its political ties including the 
presence of neil bush on the sampls board 
neil bush however has denied attempting to influence 
regulators and has said he is cooperating with investigators 
regulators sold silverado to a ford motor co subsidiary first 
nationwide bank of san francisco which renamed it mile high 
federal savings and loan association

jp morgan amp co reported a 40 percent drop in 
fourthquarter earnings thursday and a 13 billion loss for the 
year a decline that reflected a major increase in the banks 
reserves for problem debt 
the 1989 loss which translates to a loss of 704 a share 
compares with earnings of 1 billion or 538 a share a year 
earlier 
for the final quarter of 1989 the nations thirdlargest bank 
reported earnings of 154 million or 81 cents a share vs earnings 
of 258 million or 138 a share in the yearearlier period 
morgan joined a long list of major us banks that moved to 
bolster their reserves when it announced in late september it was 
adding 2 billion to provisions for potentially bad loans to third 
world countries 
loanloss reserves totaled 205 billion for the full year 
while morgan had 36 billion in total outstanding debt to 
restructuring countries the bank noted that at the end of 1989 64 
percent of its total loans to restructuring countries were 
protected by reserves 
in the previous year morgan had set aside 200 million to cover 
potentially bad loans 
net interest income totaled 275 million for the final quarter 
down 54 percent from 603 million in the last quarter of 1988 for 
the full year net interest income was 11 billion down 39 
percent from 18 billion in 1988 
morgan said interest income lagged throughout the year because 
flat yield curves in major markets prevented the bank from taking 
advantage of favorable interest rates 
noninterest income rose 18 percent in the fourth quarter to 444 
million from 377 million a year earlier for the full year 
noninterest revenue totaled 174 billion up 12 percent from 156 
billion 1988 partly reflecting gains from the sale of securities 
and higher trading revenues 
noninterest expenses totaled 535 million in the final quarter 
and 19 billion for the full year up 5 percent and 7 percent 
respectively from 511 million for the yearago final quarter and

bond corp holdings ltd cast doubt 
today on an obscure texas businessmans questionable takeover 
proposal and a canadian brewer said it might offer 16 billion 
for part of the troubled conglomerate 
peter lucas spokesman for the australian group of companies 
controlled by millionaire industrialist alan bond said bond corp 
has not been able to obtain information about a proposed 197 
million cash offer by jeff reynolds 
meanwhile john labatt ltd a canadian brewer said the company 
is considering making a bid for bond corps australian brewing 
operations 
edward stewart spokesman for the torontobased company said 
bond approached labatt about buying the brewing businesses about a 
month ago 
on the basis of the preliminary look we had at the most recent 
profit figures provided to us we believe the offer might be in the 
range of 16 billion to 2 billion australian dollars stewart 
said an australian dollar is worth about 79 cents making an offer 
potentially worth up to 16 billion 
stewart cautioned though that no firm offer would be made for 
several weeks at best 
lucas said the lack of information from reynolds had convinced 
bond corp officials that he could not proceed with his planned 
takeover 
in the absence of any such information having been made 
available so far despite repeated requests we are taking the view 
at this time that he does not have that capacity said a 
statement from bond corp headquarters in perth western australia 
lucas said bond corp had written reynolds asking him to provide 
information confirming his financial intentions with regard to 
purchasing the company 
it was made very clear to mr reynolds and his associates 
right from the very beginning that there would be no discussions 
until bond corp was satisfied that mr reynolds andor his 
companies have the financial capacity to undertake a transaction of 
the size and nature he proposes lucas said 
reynolds reached early today at his mothers home in houston at 
first declined comment then threatened to press on with a hostile 
bid if bond corp does not work with him 
either theyre with me or theyre against me and if theyre 
against me they better look out reynolds told the associated 
press 
he also reasserted that he has the 197 million but said he was 
trying to put together refinancing for bonds huge debt 
lucas also said reynolds public comments were causing bond 
corp considerable embarrassment 
reynolds 28 said in a news release last week that he was 
negotiating with bond corp whose australian brewing assets were 
recently placed in receivership by an australian supreme court 
however little is known about reynolds or his companies which 
us officials said monday did not appear to be publicly traded as 
he contends 
reynolds says he heads a firm called weatherby investments inc 
he has said he planned to visit australia to talk with bond and was 
prepared to take out citizenship to seal a deal thereby overcoming 
any obstacles over foreign investment in australian media 
there is certainly an air of scepticism about the fellow and 
ive got to tell you we share that scepticism lucas said told a 
television station here 
he said reynolds first contacted bond about 10 weeks ago through 
an intermediary and that bond corp had responded asking for more 
details 
bond corp was founded by alan bond a former americas cup 
yachting winner and multimillionaire entrepreneur whose holdings 
include brewing natural resources property and media he also 
owns the g heileman brewing co in wisconsin 
bonds empire is saddled with debts of nearly 6 billion and the 
group of companies is involved in several court actions bond has 
appealed the supreme court action placing his australian brewing 
assets in receivership

ranch foreman bryant copeland eyes 
shaded from the florida panhandle sun by a cowboy hat grinned and 
gazed at the new stock grazing on the 12000acre spread he wasnt 
looking at cows 
crawfish are easier to round up than cattle are he said in 
his arkansas drawl harder to brand but easier to round up 
he was kidding about the branding but not the roundups at mk 
ranches where millions of squirmy crawfish resembling tiny 
lobsters feed in outdoor ponds theyre herded with 40 flatbottom 
boats built in louisiana bayou country where crawfish are a staple 
of the cajun diet 
until five years ago copeland never had eaten crawfish now he 
supervises one of the nations largest crawfishraising operations 
each year mk ranches produce from 850000 to a million pounds 
of crawfish also are known as crayfish or mud bugs the 
operation has 12 fulltime employees but it grows to more than 100 
during harvesting from midjanary through june 
it isnt just a crawfish plantation said jt murff jr 
who owns mk ranches in partnership with his father 
softshell crab freshwater shrimp fingerling catfish and 
tilapia an african perch also are raised in a 
temperaturecontrolled production building although crawfish in the 
19 ponds outside are the main product 
the murffs who had been in the cotton business in memphis 
tenn bought the property almost 18 years ago the land was 
cleared of pine trees and up to 7000 head of cattle roamed until 
1979 
the cattle market at the time made it where that didnt look 
economical murff said in a telephone interview from his memphis 
office 
some cattle remained but most of the land was switched to 
crops corn soybeans rice wheat milo and sunflowers copeland 
an expert in rice growing and watering was brought in by 1984 
rice was the main crop water to flood the rice ponds was diverted 
from the nearby brothers river 
the federal government then removed price supports that had kept 
rice at about 7 a bushel rice prices dropped in half in 1985 and 
it no longer was profitable murff said meanwhile cajun cuisine 
had become a national rage 
a lot of people were eating crawfish and cajun cooking and 
creole cooking copeland said we had the water and we had the 
ground so we put in 2500 acres of crawfish ponds 
crawfish were especially attractive because they could be raised 
with relatively little modification to the shallow rice ponds 
murff said they feed on decaying hay and rice both grown on the 
ranch 
until this year processing had been farmed out to seafood 
plants in panama city and port st joe but mk is building its own 
onsite plant it is scheduled for completion later this month 
the crawfish caught in traps are sold live or preboiled and 
seasoned in frozen blocks of 5 to 25 pounds under the brand name 
crawfish 1 in 29 states up to 15 percent of the catch goes to 
europe where it is prepared in a dill sauce rather than hot cajun 
spices murff said a few months ago mk donated 1000 pounds of 
crawfish to californians made homeless and hungry by the earthquake 
that shook the san francisco area 
tail meat also is sold at a higher price but the most 
profitable product is softshell crawfish it is a gourmet item that 
goes for 750 to 9 a pound wholesale compared to a range of 60 
cents to 125 for hardshell crawfish 
softshell tastes real good and besides that you get to eat the 
whole crawfish copeland said 
for the softshell process immature crawfish are sorted into 
hundreds of shallow holding trays in the production building they 
remain there until they shed their shells which happens about once 
every two weeks 
as soon as a crawfish molts it is plucked from the holding 
tray put in cold water and then frozen before its new shell can 
harden the same process is used with crabs 
the trouble is everyone knows what a softshell crab is but 
very few know what a softshell crawfish is murff said 
he is trying to spread the word through advertising directed 
toward distributors and with displays at trade shows 
the cajun craze has done more for blackened fish chicken and 
meat than for traditional louisianastyle boiled crawfish murff 
said while crawfish have covered the overhead mk hasnt yet 
turned a profit 
we couldnt create the highvalue niche we thought we could 
murff said 
he remains committed to aquaculture but believes diversification 
into species with larger and established markets will be the 
answer he has ordered some ponds converted to raise fresh water 
shimp and new ponds dug for catfish 
the switch to aquaculture meant some retraining for ranchhands 
but copeland said his lifestyle remains little changed 
farming is farming he said its 24 hours a day seven 
days a week

agriculture secretary clayton yeutter 
told wheat growers thursday that developing countries can be good 
customers and that us exporters should take advantage of sweeping 
reforms in eastern europe 
he also told the national association of wheat growers that as 
the 1990 farm bill is debated it will face tight budget 
restrictions and farmers must choose where federal dollars will be 
spent 
i see the developing countries as among your best customers in 
the coming years yeutter told about 700 people at the 
association convention 
wheat growers should continue to watch developments in eastern 
europe and the soviet union where economic changes are taking 
place and countries are getting more involved in world trade 
yeutter said 
but he said those nations must first control their debt which 
has been a barrier to exports 
other export obstacles have been nontariff barriers that 
us negotiators currently are trying to eliminate yeutter said 
referring to talks on the general agreement on tariffs and trade 
known as gatt 
everybody has a gimmick to keep a competitive product out 
he said citing barriers such as quotas import licensing and 
minimum import prices yeutter said he favors converting those 
provisions to tariffs 
yeutter also said he favors continuing to use the export 
enhancement program to counteract european economic community 
export subsidies until international negotiations are concluded 
yeutter refused to disclose details of his agencys farm bill 
proposals until president bush releases his budget plan but he 
said the agriculture department will not be spared the budget ax 
yeutter said the agriculture industry must decide among such 
areas as research deficiency payments and crop insurance in 
spending federal money

grain futures prices fell and soybeans rose 
thursday on the chicago board of trade volume was held down in 
anticipation of several us department of agriculture crop reports 
soybean futures were buoyed by a slight rebound in cash prices 
after farmer selling slowed from the pace set earlier in the week 
soybean prices also were supported by expectations of increased 
export sales 
buying by a number of commerical houses also strengthened 
soybean futures 
wheat futures continued to show weakness due to the lack of 
export business traders were disappointed that the soviet union 
failed to enter the market thursday for 500000 metric tons of 
winter or spring wheat as expected 
a forecast of weekend rain and the national weather services 
latest six to 10day outlook that calls for rain in the central 
plains also dragged down wheat prices said analyst joel karlin of 
research department inc in chicago 
corn futures traded in a narrow range as traders marked time 
before the release of the usda reports 
analysts said the department is expected to announce that 
farmers planted more acres of winter wheat last fall than they did 
a year earlier the department also is expected to raise its 
estimate of the size of last falls corn and soybean harvest 
at the close wheat was a cent to 1 cents lower with the 
contract for delivery in march at 405 a bushel corn was 1 cents 
lower to a cent higher with march at 238 a bushel oats were 1 
cents to 2 cents lower with march at 143 a bushel soybeans

considering making a bid for the australian brewing operations of 
bond corp holdings ltd the australian conglomerate staggering 
under nearly 6 billion in debt 
bond corp controlled by millionaire industrialist alan bond 
approached john labatt ltd about buying the brewing businesses and 
labatt has studied the possibility for about a month said edward 
stewart labatt vicepresident of corporate affairs

profit figures provided to us we believe the offer might be in the 
range of 16 billion to 2 billion australian dollars stewart 
said in a telephone interview from toronto 
based on the present exchange rate of about 79 cents per

months before labatt makes any offer adding that labatt is not 
interested in acquiring bond corps us brewing unit g heileman 
brewing co 
the australian beer operations bond brewing holdings ltd were 
forced into receivership last month by a syndicate of australian

dayton hudson corp named a new president 
thursday and announced the start of an employee stock ownership 
plan 
stephen e watson who has been chairman and chief executive of 
the dayton hudson department store co will replace bruce g 
allbright as president of the parent corporation when allbright 
retires at the end of january the nations fifth largest retailer 
announced 
watson 45 has been the top executive at the minneapolisbased 
department store company for the past five years as president of 
the parent corporation he will be responsible for financial 
legal personnel public relations and audit functions under 
chairman and chief executive officer kenneth a macke 
watsons successor at the department store company will be named 
later this month macke said 
the stock ownership plan authorized by the board of directors 
in july will supplement an existing retirement and savings plan 
dayton hudson said its esop will be funded with 379 million of 
newly authorized preferred stock that can be converted into 438 
million shares of common stock to fund the stock purchase the 
esop will borrow 379 million with a 15year loan from the 
corporation 
dayton hudson has about 712 million shares of common stock 
outstanding when all of the esop shares are added the esop would 
account for about 58 percent of the total shares

more stock in friendly hands but company spokeswoman ann barkelew 
said thats not what drove the decision to have an esop the 
primary motivator is to improve the benefit program for our 
employees 
dayton hudson became the target of a hostile takeover attempt in 
1987 when the haft family of washington dc acquired 46 
million shares the company sought help from the minnesota

october 1987 soon after the hafts announced they were selling 
their dayton hudson stock the company announced a program to buy

friendly hands in july when the esop was authorized the board of 
directors also approved the repurchase of up to 7 million

directors increased the regular quarterly stock dividend by 18 
percent from 28 cents to 33 cents per share

reflecting a supply glut 
coffee for march delivery slumped to the equivalent of almost 
1010 a metric ton 33 below the 14year low touched late last 
month and down 4455 from wednesdays closing level 
the big consumers were holding off buying according to analysts 
at coffee traders edamp f man 
its the wellknown story of too much coffee and doubts that 
the markets safetynet can be restored quickly one analyst 
said the longerterm view is even more pessimistic with expected 
good crops from april onward from indonesia and brazil and the 
continuous offer of coffee from west africa 
the london market trades in robustatype coffee which is 
traditionally cheaper than the higher quality arabica variety grown 
throughout latin america 
arabica prices are also depressed but remain above their 
14year lows reached last october 
both markets plunged then following the decision of the 
74nation international coffee organization in july to abandon its 
marketsupport role indefinitely its safetynet for prices of 
export quotas was suspended 
supplies of arabicas have been tightened by recent frosts in 
mexicos coffeegrowing region and the decision of central american 
producers to keep 15 percent of their current crop off the market 
to help stabilize prices traders said 
there are also delays to shipments of arabicas from colombia el 
salvador and nicaragua and prospects of a worse than expected 
brazilian arabica crop according to man 
brazil grows mainly arabicas but also robustas 
informal consultations among producing and consuming countries 
on restoring the coffee organizations quota stystem have so far 
made little progress according to experts at west german coffee 
specialists fo licht 
producer and consumer officials said thursday they expected no 
breakthrough on the issue when the two sides meet in london jan 
1617 for what promises to be a routine meeting of the coffee 
organizations 16nation executive board 
they said hopes of quick action may have been set back by 
differences between colombia and the united states over 
washingtons decision to station warships off the latin american 
nations coast in an attempt to intercept drug shipments 
the united states and colombia respectively the worlds 
biggest consumer and the secondbiggest producer of coffee have 
so far been at the forefront of efforts to restore the coffee

analysts said prices seemed to reach levels where they attracted 
bargain hunters willing to stake their money on the possibility 
that the economy can avoid a recession in the months ahead 
still some observers questioned whether the market could mount 
a sustained rally before traders get a look at the fourthquarter 
earnings reports due out over the next three weeks or so 
the profit figures for the octoberdecember period are expected 
to be unimpressive or worse for many companies 
an exception to that prospect was federal national mortgage 
which jumped 1 to 37rsqb as one of the days most active issues the 
company reported fourthquarter earnings of 90 cents a share up 
from 63 cents in the comparable period of 1988

grain futures prices fell and soybeans rose thursday on the 
chicago board of trade volume was held down in anticipation of 
several us department of agriculture crop reports 
on other markets livestock and pork prices were higher 
precious metals were mixed and energy futures climbed 
wheat settled cent to 2 cents lower with the contract for 
delivery in march at 404 a bushel corn was 2 cents lower to a 
cent higher with march at 238 a bushel oats were 1 cents to 2 
cents lower with march at 143 a bushel soybeans were a cent 
lower to 2 cents higher with january at 569 a bushel 
soybean futures were buoyed by a slight rebound in cash prices 
after farmer selling slowed from the pace set earlier in the week 
soybean prices also were supported by expectations of increased 
export sales 
wheat futures continued to show weakness due to the lack of 
export business traders were disappointed that the soviet union 
failed to enter the market thursday for 500000 metric tons of 
winter or spring wheat as expected 
a forecast of weekend rain and the national weather services 
latest sixto 10day outlook that calls for rain in the central 
plains also dragged down wheat prices said analyst joel karlin of 
research department inc in chicago 
corn futures traded in a narrow range as traders marked time 
before the release of the usda reports after the close of trading 
the usda estimated the 1989 corn crop at 75 billion bushels 
which was below expectations 
soybean production was put at 19 billion bushels also lower 
than expected 
the usda reported farmers planted about 57 million acres of 
winter wheat for harvest this year up 3 percent from 1989 
winter wheat is planted in the fall and harvested the following 
year it accounts for about threefourths of the total us wheat 
output meanwhile us wheat stockpiles have continued to shrink 
thus keeping market prices at high levels 
energy futures rebounded from losses suffered in early trading 
to post a gain on the new york mercantile exchange 
the gain was led by heating oil futures which surged on 
expectations of a return of cold weather in the northeast said 
analyst peter beutel of elders futures inc in new york 
west texas intermediate crude oil was 9 cents lower to 24 cents 
higher with february at 2314 a barrel heating oil was 33 cent 
to 244 cents higher with february at 6932 cents a gallon 
unleaded gasoline was 57 cent to 117 cents higher with february 
at 6550 cents a gallon 
despite being pressured by profittaking gold prices closed 
higher on new yorks commodity exchange silver suffered a slight 
loss 
pressure on gold came from a relatively firm dollar and gains on 
the new york stock exchange said jim steel an analyst with refco 
inc in new york 
the overnight gold bullion market was firm although gold came 
under pressure from the rally on the tokyo stock exchange steel 
said 
gold was 140 to 160 higher with february at 41560 a troy 
ounce silver was 2 cents to 3 cents lower with march at 5365 a 
troy ounce 
livestock and pork futures were higher in light trading on the 
chicago mercantile exchange 
cattle prices were up sharply due to computergenerated trading 
further gains were checked by declining demand for beef and lower 
cash prices 
hog futures were supported by steady prices in the cash market 
and frozen pork belly prices were boosted by commercial and 
commission house buying 
live cattle were 22 cent to 65 cent higher with february at 
7752 cents a pound feeder cattle were unchanged to 27 cent 
higher with january at 8437 cents a pound hogs were 08 cent 
lower to 33 cent higher with february at 5127 a pound frozen 
pork bellies were 112 cents to 160 cents higher with february at

foreign currencies rather than the us currency 
gold prices rose modestly with bullion for current delivery 
gaining 160 an ounce to 414 on the new york commodity exchange 
republic national bank of new york quoted a late bid price of 
41360 up 235 
its essentially been a cross market said robert white 
manager of corporate trading at first interstate bank in los 
angeles it isnt so much the dollar its the yen against the 
market its the market against the swiss 
swiss national bank president markus lusser said thursday that 
swiss interest rates might remain above rates in west germany for 
some time to prevent the swiss franc from weakening further against 
the german mark 
higher interest rates would make the currency more attractive 
for investors to hold and lussers comment drove the franc sharply 
higher 
the market is just a bundle of nerves because there is no 
clear trend for the dollar white said 
dealers are watching political developments in eastern europe 
closely for signs of instability which might lead investors to 
rush into dollars as a safe haven he said 
traders also are keeping a keen eye on us interest rates for 
any sign of credit easing by the federal reserve which would tend 
to make the dollar less attractive he said 
at the start of the day in tokyo the dollar slipped 003 
japanese yen to 14527 the dollar eased further in london to 
14525 yen before closing in new york at 14545 yen down from 
14555 late wednesday

the dollar rose slightly against sterling the british pound 
fell to 16597 late in new york down from 16625 in london 
earlier the pound fell to 16575 from 16625

a majority of american workers are doing what 
they do for such reasons as simple chance or lack of choice while 
just 41 percent hold jobs that they had planned according to a 
poll released thursday 
the results indicate that many people are trapped at less than 
they could do said sharon danann research director at a 
clevelandbased group called 9 to 5 national association of 
working women 
the survey of 1350 people was conducted last october by the 
gallup organization for the national occupational information 
coordinating committee a panel congress created to make better use 
of job information the poll which asked a variety of jobrelated 
questions had a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage 
points 
other findings showed that about half of americans say job 
stress affects their health personal relationships or their 
ability to do their job nearly onethird of the work force expects 
to change jobs within the next three years and that 65 percent 
said that given a chance to start over they would try to get more 
information about career options 
while 41 percent of the employed respondents consciously chose 
their job or career 18 percent got started in their present job 
through chance circumstances 12 percent took the only job 
available and the rest were either influenced by friends or 
relatives 
theres a real dilemma the labor market isnt matching up 
well with what people are trained to do and what they want to do 
said jim green a labor historian at the university of 
massachusetts he said the results may indicate that many people 
view their jobs as necessary evils 
green and ms danann said part of the reason people are in jobs 
they never planned is because most new jobs being created are in 
the service industry 
juliette lester executive director of the committee that had 
the poll conducted said those results demonstrate the need for 
government and job counselors to improve the way they educate the 
public about career options 
the people who are most in need are not getting it she 
said noting that only 21 percent of those without a high school 
degree had planned their jobs and 25 percent of that group had 
taken the only jobs they could find 
in a separate finding 25 percent of employed adults who 
responded said job stress or pressure had interfered with their 
offthejob relationships 20 percent said it had affected their 
physical health and 20 percent said it had affected their ability 
to do their job 
but responding to the same question 48 percent reported little 
or no job stress over the past year the totals exceeded 100 
percent because of multiple responses 
ms danann said more americans probably suffer from jobrelated 
stress than admit it 
theres lots of people who probably dont realize thats what 
it is that their job is full of interruptions or that they have 
multiple bosses telling them its priority work and that its 
driving them nuts she said 
the poll also showed that 40 percent said higher pay would give 
them an incentive to accomplish more at work while 31 percent cited 
more recognition other incentives included additional training 
chance for advancement and more control over their job 
in another finding 68 percent said there was no discrimination 
in the workplace 5 percent said minorities are discriminated 
against but not women and 5 percent said women are discriminated 
against but not minorities ten percent think both groups are 
treated unfairly while 6 percent said women and minorities are 
treated better

an independent soviet newspaper that has 
chronicled the recent wave of reforms in eastern europe has become 
an advertising vehicle for several us companies intrigued by the 
potential sales territory 
advertising space in atmoda the journal of perestroika is 
being sold in minneapolis by john freivalds who also is a foreign 
language business consultant 
freivalds a latvian native who now is a us citizen opened 
the downtown sales office after traveling back to his home country 
in may to obtain permission from the latvian national front the 
twoyearold political party that publishes atmoda 
atmoda latvian for awakening is a weekly newspaper that 
promises access to latvian decisionmakers getting their first 
taste of economic freedom 
the soviet union is changing freivalds tells potential 
clients the communists are not going to have the power they once 
had you have to reach the new decisionmakers the new 
decisionmakers read this atmoda the society is still in flux 
but given the ad rates this is an inexpensive way to test the 
waters for your product or service 
the newspapers first us ads ran during october so far five 
us advertisers have run 20 ads totaling five pages a total of 
seven advertisers have bought an additional 20 ads that will begin 
running next month freivalds said 
he says hes lost about 30000 on the venture but plans to 
give the project two years before determining whether to continue 
the 18monthold atmoda has a circulation of up to 100000 for 
its latvian edition and is distributed throughout the soviet union 
its estimated readership is 15 million meaning that each copy is 
read by 15 people 
the 600 cost of a fullpage ad in atmoda is the equivalent of 
three months salary for the average latvian but its roughly 
onetenth of what us newspapers with comparable circulation 
charge said andrea luhtanen vice president of the haworth group 
a minneapolis media services company 
freivalds said soviet president mikhail s gorbachevs 
restructuring program is giving the most latitude to the baltics 
latvia lithuania and estonia which once thrived as capitalistic 
markets 
ive always thought that perestroika was invented by gorbachev 
for the baltic states because they can remember what capitalism 
was like they are closest to taking advantage of it he said 
the most successful us companies in latvia probably will be 
sellers of industrial products that can stimulate fundamental 
economic development for example garden way inc of albany 
ny has sold 31 small tractors in latvia at 3000 each 
freivalds said the companys agent has advertised in atmoda since 
the fall he said 
lowpriced consumer goods also are in demand said freivalds 
event sales a minneapolis company that sells surplus consumer 
goods recently signed an atmoda advertising contract he said 
but freivalds said hes approaching corporate giants about 
advertising their products in the soviet union 
that level of sophistication is not going to happen for 10 
years at least he said

the julien co one of the worlds largest 
cotton merchants filed for bankruptcy court protection from 
creditors thursday one day after three major creditors urged the 
court to intervene 
the private company founded and run by julien hohenberg of 
memphis estimated its debts at 344 million and assets at 160 
million in filing for protection under chapter 11 of federal 
bankruptcy law 
the companys problems apparently stem from speculation in 
cotton futures during the summer analysts say 
the filing came one day after three major creditors petitioned 
the us bankruptcy court in memphis to put julien into bankruptcy 
and appoint a trustee to run it 
bankers trust co one of the creditors renewed its request for 
a trustee thursday 
the julien co does not have the management or the assets to 
run the company said bob orians a lawyer for the bank bankers 
trust has 172 million in secured loans outstanding to julien he 
said 
judge william h brown set a hearing for tuesday to consider the 
motion 
during a break in court proceedings hohenberg refused to 
discuss his financial troubles or comment on reports that he 
recently lost millions of dollars on the futures market 
his financial troubles became public last month when painewebber 
inc filed suit claiming julien co failed by some 23 million to 
meet margin calls on cotton futures 
cotton analysts say hohenberg may have run into trouble by 
buying futures heavily in the summer and fall expecting prices to 
rise cotton prices have fallen instead with cutbacks in purchases 
by textile mills and a large domestic crop this year apparently 
contributing to the decline 
orians said bankers trust has paid the companys payroll for the 
past month he told the court that the company has come close in 
recent weeks to having utilities turned off at its headquarters 
edward l montedonico julien cos lawyer said the company is 
likely to have more than 600 creditors the company does business 
with numerous banks farmers textile mills warehouses and 
shippers around the country and abroad 
montedonico said 19 million of the companys debts are 
unsecured most of the secured debts are covered by cotton stored 
in warehouses or in various stages of shipment around the country 
he said 
the judge directed montedonico to notify creditors holding 
julien co assets not to sell them to cover the merchants debts 
weve got to stop the flow of any assets until we get a 
handle on it the judge said 
orians said the cotton securing bankers trusts loans may be 
sitting in hundreds of warehouses 
were in the process of determining where all this collateral 
is he said

campeau corp painted a gloomy sales picture 
thursday for the next two years at its retailing businesses in 
documents that also disclosed that a total liquidation of its 
stores might not be enough to pay off its debts 
the canadian corporation which amassed huge debts in acquiring 
allied stores corp and federated department stores inc disclosed 
its best and worsecase scenarios for the next five years in a 
filing with the securities and exchange commission 
in the document released thursday campeau projected that allied 
and federated earnings could fall by up to 64 percent in the 1990 
fiscal year 
the documents also indicated that even if federated and allied 
were completely liquidated the sale proceeds still might not be 
enough to help pay the companies combined total debts of some 8 
billion 
both retail units face a monday deadline to renegotiate a 234 
billion loan from a syndicate headed by citibank 
on wednesday campeau surprised wall street and seventh avenue 
by paying 100 million on schedule to numerous merchandise 
suppliers 
on thursday campeaus board effectively turned over control of 
the companys us operations to outside hands 
the board said in a statement it approved the transfer of 
control of the us division campeau us to trustees it also 
recommended that the division appoint its own chairman and chief 
executive officer and its own board of directors which would be 
composed of independent us residents 
campeaus chairman robert campeau said in the statement he 
only would remain involved in the companys real estate operations 
under the reorganization 
in its filing campeau projected earnings for allied and 
federated would fall as much as 64 percent in fiscal year 1990 
due to management distraction limitations on the companys 
ability to negotiate better prices with vendors and increased 
promotions needed to stimulate business before recovering in 
1991 
the corporation projected that it would return to a normal 
operating environment by the beginning of fiscal year 1992 
campeau projected federated would have operating earnings of 
483 million on sales of 492 billion for fiscal 1989 and allied 
would have operating earnings of 273 million on sales of 274 
billion 
campeau also stated that its projections had not been updated 
since it opened talks on dec 13 with major creditors about 
possible financial restructurings 
the documents also stressed that the unusual operating problems 
facing the company made the projections highly uncertain 
another set of projections assumed that allied and federated 
might have to operate under increased restrictions imposed by 
suppliers and factors which in turn could significantly impair 
their ability to obtain inventory 
inventory could be off by as much as 400 million retail 
compared to the projection for fiscal year 1990 
there was no mention in the documents of seeking us bankruptcy 
code protection from creditors however the document noted 
there can be no assurance that restructurings can be completed on 
satisfactory terms within a satisfactory time frame if at all 
campeaus problems stem chiefly from the debt it acquired when 
it bought federated in 1988 for 66 billion and allied two years 
earlier for 34 billion 
part of the restructuring plan it already has mapped out 
involves selling federateds bloomingdales department store chain 
considered one of campeaus most valuable possessions 
federateds other chains include abraham and straus burdines 
lazarus and richs allied operates the bon marche jordan marsh 
maas brothers and sterns chains 
the sec document projected an aftertax price of between 340 
billion and 370 billion if all of federateds divisions were sold 
individually under the best circumstances the price would fall to 
255 billion to 270 billion the divisions were sold under 
distressed circumstances such as in a bankruptcy 
reorganization 
a fire sale of allieds divisions would net between 12 billion 
and 135 billion campeau projected compared to 160 billion and 
180 billion in an orderly process 
according to the documents federated has a total debt and 
accrued interest of 519 billion and allieds debt with interest 
of 299 billion 
the documents projected an aftertax liquidation deficit of 
between 168 billion and 835 million for federated and 179 
billion and 139 billion for allied depending upon the 
circumstances of a selloff 
allied alone is expected to pay 113 million in debt service 
next year 106 million in 1991 379 million in 1992 6 million 
in 1993 and 4 million in 1994 assuming refinancing

the food and drug administrations ban on use 
of the jarvik artificial heart could slow research in the field but 
probably wont affect patients needing temporary implants medical 
experts said thursday 
but a major user of the device said he might defy the ban 
the fda in a letter sent earlier this week and disclosed 
wednesday withdrew symbion incs approval for continued 
investigational uses of its artificial heart both as a permanent 
replacement and a temporary bridge for patients awaiting a human 
heart transplant 
by removing the jarvik you take the first and main artificial 
heart player out of the ballgame said dr jack kolff a 
professor of cardiac surgery at temple university in philadelphia 
whose father dr willem kolff developed the first artificial 
kidney in 1943 
that leaves a bit of a vacuum for those researchers who think 
there may be a future for an artificial heart he said 
dr antonio gotto chief of internal medical services at baylor 
college of medicine in houston and past president of the american 
heart association said that because of the availability of 
alternative temporary heartassist devices the fdas action 
probably wont have an impact on heart patients 
but it does represent a setback in terms of time toward 
eventually getting a completely implantable heart he said 
the jarvik heart named after its inventor dr robert jarvik of 
utah gained household recognition after it was implanted in barney 
clark on dec 2 1982 he lived 112 days his new heart tethered to 
a bulky external power system before he succumbed to multiple 
organ failure 
clark was the first to person to receive a permanent artificial 
heart several others since clark received the artificial heart 
but recipients have been plagued by blood clotting and strokes 
in tucson ariz dr jack copeland head of the heart 
transplant program at the university of arizona said the ban means 
he and his staff could be faced with the decision of putting a 
device in anyway either an artificial heart or related heart 
pumping helper in a critically ill patient 
and i think our decision right now would be to go ahead and 
use the device we have good data good statistics were happy 
with the way the devices have worked we think we can save lives 
copeland told a news conference at which he presented transplant 
candidate paul sicola 48 of old bridge nj who has been kept 
alive for 119 days with a ventricular assist decive 
sicola said he would advise fda to leave the system alone 
copeland stirred controversy once before using a different 
artificial heart without approval to keep a patient alive for 11 
hours while he awaited a transplant his team has used symbion 
hearts in seven patients and assistance devices in 14 
the fda said that during two inspections of the tempe 
arizbased companys facilities last year it had found some 
serious deficiencies in manufacturing quality control monitoring 
of research sites servicing of equipment training of personnel 
and reporting of adverse reactions to fda 
the agency felt the deficiencies were great enough that risks 
to patients were outweighing benefits said fda spokesman jeff 
nesbit 
he said the letter was sent monday 
symbion issued a statement saying it had received the fda notice 
and would release further information at the appropriate time 
dr donald olsen director of the university of utahs institute 
for biomedical engineering said he was surprised and 
disappointed by the fdas action and hoped it would not hurt 
future federal funding of artificial heart research in general 
particularly for totally implantable devices 
the permanent jarvik heart consists of a fistsize pump that is 
implanted into the chest and which is attached to two plastic tubes 
connected to a large compressedair power system contained in a 
large cart that must move with the patient 
withdrawal of the permanent jarvik heart leaves only one other 
naturalheart replacement with fda investigational approval but 
that device is used only as a temporary bridge and only at hershey 
medical center of pennsylvania state university 
in recent years the jarvik has functioned mainly as a temporary 
bridge in patients awaiting transplants alternatives to the jarvik 
are available because other companies have approvals for such 
temporary implants and for left ventricular assist pumps that help 
the natural heart work without replacement 
copeland said symbion hearts have been used in 155 patients and 
pumping assistance devices in 55 
dr thomas preston chief of cardiology at pacific medical 
center in seattle and a vocal critic of permanent artificial 
hearts said the jarvik venture has been a failure 
theyve set the whole program back with premature useage of 
the permanent artificial heart he said now the whole 
artificial heart program has a bad name because the thing didnt 
work 
its another sad instance of people in the medical profession 
rushing in for fame and glory and riches with great acclaim from 
the media and then disillusionment he said 
however preston said he hopes work continues on the technology 
because some day its going to be better

floridas orange harvest will plunge by 29 
percent this year due to damage from the christmas weekend freeze 
yielding the smallest crop in 25 years the department of 
agriculture estimated thursday 
also thursday gov bob martinez asked president bush to declare 
seven florida counties disaster areas and vowed to seek the 
declaration for more counties once citrus and sugarcane salavage 
operations are complete 
the usdas monthly crop forecast the first since the dec 
2426 freeze that iced fruit throughout the 700000acre citrus 
belt also projected a 13 percent drop in the grapefruit crop from 
earlier production estimates 
the report is the first official estimate of damage to the 
citrus crop worth 14 billion last season 
this is the lowest estimated production since 196465 said 
robert r terry a usda official who specializes in florida citrus 
some industry officials have estimated losses at farm level at 
between 100 million and 200 million loss of added value from 
harvesting and processing are expected to be at least another 150 
million 
but the full extent of the financial damage cannot be calculated 
for months until a full assessment is made of damage to trees 
usda analysts predicted 92 million 90pound boxes of oranges 
would be harvested during the 198990 crop year this compares with 
the 130 million boxes of oranges forecast in early december for the 
current season the orange harvest in the 198889 season was 146 
million boxes 
the analysts are projecting a florida grapefruit crop of 38 
million boxes for this year compared with the prefreeze forecast 
of 44 million boxes the 198889 grapefruit harvest was almost 55 
million boxes 
the usda also estimated that florida processors would pack 130 
gallons of frozen concentrated orange juice from each box of 
oranges a drop in the prefreeze estimate of a 148gallon juice 
yield 
its a pretty substantial overall loss almost equal 
percentage wise to the 198384 season said terry 
he said the december freeze could be considered one of the 
worst freezes of the century 
successive crop forecasts in the coming months are expected to 
be even lower as possible damage to trees is assessed the final 
verdict on crop losses and tree damage will probably not be known 
until the end of the harvesting season industry officials said 
the juice will be just as good but were expecting a whole 
lot less of it said john smoak president of smoak groves in 
lake placid we were just getting back on our feet since the last 
two freezes 
temperatures dropped and stayed in the midteens and low 20s 
across the citrus belt during the twoday freeze last month when 
ice forms in oranges tiny cells burst and the juice dissipates as 
the weather warms again the fruit begins to dry up 
much of the fruit can be salvaged and processed into juice and 
processing plants are operating aroundtheclock as harvesters rush 
to get as much of the fruit off the trees as possible before it 
spoils 
don farmer assistant executive director of the florida 
department of citrus expressed concern about the valencia crop a 
prized variety which is not ripe enough to be harvested but is 
expected to show heavy damage from the freeze 
there was obvious damage to this crop said farmer who 
grows valencias some of those wont be picked at all theyre on 
the ground

the chairman of ual corp warned employees of 
the airline company in a letter that a recapitalization under study 
by the board of directors could hurt the company and urged 
employees instead to support a buyout 
it is time to decide whether we want to take control of our 
destiny and therein buy a majority of united airlines or allow 
events to transpire as they may and hope for the best wolf 
wrote according to the new york times 
the times said the letter was dated tuesday and released 
thursday 
on monday uals board said it asked its financial advisers to 
study a recapitalization under such a plan chicagobased ual 
would borrow money in order to buy back some of its shares 
recapitalizations also sometimes involve a special dividend to 
shareholders 
the boards action was prompted by coniston partners a new york 
investment group that holds 118 percent of ual stock coniston had 
presented the board with a monday deadline to negotiate a buyout or 
take other action to raise the companys stock price 
the board in a statement also said it was still interested in 
a buyout proposal such a proposal from management and uniteds 
pilots union collapsed last year after it failed to obtain funding

representatives of uals management and the airlines pilots and 
flight attendants unions met in new york on thursday 
wolf met on wednesday with representatives of the companys 
19000 salaried employees to discuss options faced by the company 
in his letter to uniteds 70000 employees wolf said that 
unless a buyout bid is devised the board would put through a 
recapitalization or a new board installed by coniston would take 
the same step the times said 
do you want to allow the coniston partners to cripple united 
financially or do you collectively want to pay for and buy a 
majority of the company he wrote 
wolf said united would not be able to pay for the 19 billion in 
aircraft it has on order if the company funds a stock buyback
