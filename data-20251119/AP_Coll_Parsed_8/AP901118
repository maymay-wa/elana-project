the harvest has been abundant this year 
fat tomatoes sweet potatoes melons pecans and purplehull peas 
the rains came as farmers gathered in a spring field prayed they 
would 
we were blessed produce grower louis lazzari said 
at thanksgiving dinner in annie whites house the grace her ill 
80yearold husband jack plans to say will be simple hell say 
he hopes it continues 
by that she meant not just the fecundity of the good earth here 
by mobile bay but the sharing of its riches between farmers like 
lazzari and families like hers families in need through people 
known as gleaners 
from beangrowing time in the spring to the gathering of mustard 
greens turnips and broccoli in cool weather farmers invite the 
gleaners into their fields to take whats left behind after 
harvest 
on one afternoon this summer 200 hands picked 16220 pounds of 
tomatoes altogether last year the gleaners organized by a local 
group called ecumenical ministries carried away 100000 pounds of 
vegetables and fruits 
the pickers must be needy they cannot sell anything they glean 
and they must share it with someone else in need such as the 
whites who cannot pick on their ownbecause theyre disabled 
the rules are as simple as the verses from the old testament 
that underlie the 10yearold project 
when thou cuttest down thine harvest and hast forgotten a 
sheaf in the field thou shalt not go again to fetch it enjoins 
deuteronomy 241921 
it shall be for the stranger for the fatherless and for the 
widow that the lord thy god may bless thee in all the work of 
thine hands 
mrs white who at 69 has heart trouble and more other ailments 
than she can name and whose husband has cancer learned of 
ecumenical ministries about eight years ago on a day she was 
desperate for food that day i really didnt have anything to 
cook she said 
before i looked around it was no time before they were out 
with boxes and bags of groceries she said 
after that gleaners brought regular deliveries of whatever 
vegetable was in season without the food she said i guess id 
starve 
the program began a decade ago with dot threadgill who saw a 
television news item about people from a california senior citizens 
center who supplemented their diet by picking leftovers in the 
fields 
mrs threadgills energy seems to keep the gleaning operations 
going and growing from about 300 pounds of food distributed 
during the first year about half of that out of my garden she 
said 
now 15 farmers call her or she calls them as harvests near and 
shes learned tricks over the years 
mechanical harvesters cant pick where they turn at the end 
of the rows she said referring to potato picking machines so 
we know where to be 
she scouts the fields estimating how many gleaners the crop 
will feed plentifully we dont want them to use their gas money 
and not have sufficient for several days then she quickly goes 
to the telephone tree to mobilize pickers before the farmer 
plows the field under to prepare for the next crop 
suzanne zellner got a call when a turnip patch was offered 
recently she and her husband have five children the youngest 
2yearold twins besides improving nutrition and stretching 
grocery money gleaning has an educational value she said 
teaching children how to pick how to know when somethings ready 
or when its too ripe 
another regular in the fields is gussie winston 53 who first 
went gleaning because her family had nothing to eat but now makes 
ends meet with housekeeping jobs and gleans and cans vegetables for 
herself and a list of mostly elderly people unable to get out 
themselves 
when you become a gleaner youre an emissary she said 
looking across a sunny field to pickers stooped at their work 
youre supposed to see that no one goes hungry 
for mrs threadgill that requires judicious juggling of her 
phone list for instance she said i know that mary jones has 10 
or 15 people under her so i know that if theres only enough for 
10 or 15 i dont need to call but mary 
and if we get peas for mary this week we call somebody else 
and kind of divide around the wealth 
and the wealth keeps blooming 
around the fourth of july one farmer makes sure to call the 
gleaners to gather ripe watermelons 
just before christmas last year a rare spell of extreme cold 
brought a call from another farmer who said he couldnt protect all 
of his broccoli crop the gleaners cut 1200 pounds 
a grower who has a upick operation with tomatoes planted in a 
staggered schedule offers the gleaners whats left in deadripe 
patches that his paying customers picked through the week before 
standing in the shade of an old pecan tree on his farm 
60yearold louis lazzari said the vagariesof the market sometimes 
open his fields to the gleaners 
this year one day i sold my broker 240 bushel boxes of beans 
and he wanted the next day 340 he said i had the beans some 
of the prettiest i ever raised in my life but the going price 
wouldnt have covered expenses after i paid the help i paid for 
the box i paid the freight to the place of business i dont know 
honestly but i may have went backwards 
i could have plowed em under lazzari said but really he 
couldnt it hurts me so bad to see something go to waste 
he said and he knows there are plenty of people here who havent 
had his good fortune 
i was born in the depression he said but i never had to 
go to bed one day in my life without a decent meal im thankful to 
say 
instead of plowing those pretty beans under he phoned mrs 
threadgill 
once a few years ago lazzari spontaneously called and offered 
sweet corn 30 big croker sacks full 
mrs threadgill went back a few days later to thank him with a 
cake he said you know i had that big field of corn and it 
wasnt moving after i gave you that 30 sacks that evening a man 
came and bought the whole field from me

an academic dispute with roots in the 
vatican is growing at auburn university a state school known more 
for producing farmers and football players than roman catholic 
rifts 
the controversy centers on the rev charles e curran who was 
selected for an endowed professorship at auburn although he is the 
only american barred by rome from teaching catholic theology his 
views on topics such as abortion and contraception have put him at 
odds with the vatican for years 
but it was currans treatment by auburn president james martin 
that has enraged the university senate a facultystaff body 
martin denied tenure for curran although the post was 
advertised as being a tenured or permanent position and hasnt 
explained his decision publicly or to curran he denies the 
conclusion of a senate committee that he violated university tenure 
policies 
thus far hes the most controversial person we have ever 
hired martin said in an interview thursday 
the senate scheduled a special meeting for tuesday to discuss 
currans treatment and chairman gary mullen said the senate is 
likely to take some kind of formal stance against martin 
the action could range from doing nothing which is not 
expected at all to requesting tenure to a formal censure of 
the president mullen said 
a blowup over religious beliefs and academic freedom is 
uncharacteristic at auburn a landgrant school in a mostly 
protestant state with 21000 students and a reputation for 
achievement in agriculture and athletics last year its religion 
department had only two fulltime teachers and a pair of graduates 
but academic eruptions are not completely foreign to auburn in 
eastcentral alabama the school was censured in 1983 by the 
american association of university professors following another 
tenure dispute and the rebuke has not been lifted 
curran author of 20 books on christian ethics and morality 
lost his last tenured position at catholic university in 
washington in 1986 the vatican said his dissenting views on 
conservative church positions made him unfit to teach theology 
among other things he supports abortion in limited 
circumstances 
since then curran has held temporary posts at cornell 
university and the university of southern california where he was 
working when auburn called 
while currans views earned a vatican rebuff they have not cut 
him off from the rest of the church some 750 catholic theologians 
have signed a statement backing him and the university of notre 
dame continues to publish his books he has been president of three 
major theological societies 
hes considered quite moderate actually hes fairly 
conservative said john ehmann administrative director of notre 
dame press 
only a rightwing fanatic would refer to charlie curran as a 
wayout theologian said the rev richard mcbrien head of 
theology at notre dame the vatican is way out hes a 
centrist 
a tiny minority of catholics in alabama has influenced an 
academic decision at a major state institution said mcbrien 
curran said his views represent those of the catholic 
mainstream mcbrien said curran has been a target for rome since 
1968 when he led opposition to a vatican decree against artificial 
birth control 
currans post is a new endowed chair created through a program 
approved by the alabama legislature the eminent scholars plan 
is supposed to boost the reputations of statesupported schools by 
attracting leading academicians 
the university advertised the chair nationwide as being a 
tenured position meaning it was a lifetime job except for severe 
misconduct curran said it was with that understanding that he 
decided to take the job after he was recommended by a search 
committee and discussed it with a school vice president 
i wouldnt have gotten near the thing if i didnt think it was 
tenured curran 56 said last week 
but curran said that once he had called auburn to formally 
accept the chair he was told martin had decided against tenure 
curran said he had little choice but to come to auburn for this 
school year having turned down other job offers in favor of the 
auburn post 
martin and auburns trustees have denied that any outside 
pressure led to the decision the sole catholic on auburns board 
bessie mae holloway has denied any involvement in the tenure 
decision but curran said catholic archbishop oscar lipscomb of 
mobile told him of twice talking with mrs holloway although 
lipscomb denies being against currans hiring 
the episode has been a disappointment for curran who had hoped 
to put his disputes with rome behind him 
one of my reasons for even thinking of auburn is it would be a 
quiet place where i could fade into the woodwork and do my work 
he said

when americans everywhere were 
giving up luxuries for the effort to win world war ii mary babnick 
brown gave up something much more personal than a favorite food 
her belowkneelength hair 
brown now 83 was honored saturday for contributing to the war 
effort in a ceremony at the us air force academy she received a 
special achievement award from the colorado aviation historical 
society 
what she didnt know back in 1942 was that her hair was used as 
cross hairs in a secret bombsight used on bombers 
brown said she didnt really want to give up her blond hair but 
caring for it was becoming a lot of work the government wanted 
hair at least 22 inches long she sent 34 inches hair that had 
only been trimmed never really cut for her first 36 years 
in 1942 she saw an advertisement in a pueblo newspaper that the 
government was looking for women to contribute their hair to the 
war effort she sent an inquiry and quickly received a telegram 
asking her to send a sample 
a few days later she received another telegram pleading for her 
hair it was exactly what they needed said officials with the 
institute of technology in washington dc 
i saw so many people crying their eyes out not wanting their 
sons to go she said i was sad i wanted to do something for 
the war effort 
bill feder founder of the international b24 memorial museum in 
pueblo learned recently that a pueblo woman had donated her hair 
and he began looking for her 
he told brown that her hair was used experimentally as cross 
hairs in a bombaiming device known as the norden bombsight 
the bombsight invented in the mid1930s by a swiss immigrant 
named karl norden was essentially a mechanical computer used in 
high altitude bombing the device took into account such things as 
altitude the planes speed and wind velocity 
when the target reached the center of the cross hairs the crew 
could drop the bomb with dependable accuracy 
used on the b24 liberator the b29 super fortress and the b17 
flying fortress the norden bombsight was so secret that it was 
equipped with explosives feder said and crews were ordered to 
destroy it if their bomber ran the risk of falling into enemy 
hands 
at altitudes as high as 20000 feet the bombsight cross hairs 
were subjected to freezing temperatures and rapid changes in 
humidity black widow spider webs which contracted and expanded on 
scale under those conditions were originally used but were fragile 
and hard to come by 
feder said browns fine blonde hair which had never been 
bleached or touched with a hot iron was unique and shared many of 
the qualities valued in the black widow spiders web 
in addition to the bombsight her hair was used in scientific 
equipment such as humidity measuring devices important in the 
production of airplanes and other war machinery 
the norden bombsight eventually was replaced by electronic 
bombsights but when the newer devices did not prove accurate 
enough to drop radio transmitters along jungle trails in vietnam 
the norden bombsight was successfully used to do the job

steam and hot mud spewed sunday from a volcano that 
was dormant since causing one of japans largest natural disasters 
nearly 200 years ago 
no injuries have been reported since mount unzen erupted 
saturday and no evacuations were reported the volcano is about 
510 miles southwest of tokyo on the island of kyushu 
the eruption also did not appear to worry tourists visiting hot 
springs near the crater the town of unzen about 2 miles from the 
volcano currently has about 3000 tourists said unzen tourist 
association spokesman tadakiyo kato 
all the rooms at unzen hotels are full kato said we have 
been booked solid because of the autumn tourist season and no one 
has canceled out because of the eruption 
the 4458foot volcano composed of several volcanic peaks last 
erupted in 1792 killing 15000 people in the worst volcanorelated 
disaster in japanese history many of the deaths were caused by a 
huge landslide and tidal waves 
scientists and local police refused to make predictions on the 
eruption but said they were preparing for the worst 
lava flows are not expected but it is impossible to tell for 
certain said an official at the mount unzen observatory who 
spoke on condition of anonymity 
twin plumes of steam and ash rose hundreds of yards into the 
air observatory seismographs recorded temblors too weak to be felt 
by humans 
mount unzen is one of 19 active volcanoes in japan designated as 
potentially dangerous and under constant observation by the 
meteorological agency

an army soldier who had served in the 
persian gulf and three other men have been arrested in the theft of 
a huge cache of military weapons and explosives federal and local 
officials said saturday 
the materiel seized friday and saturday from a warehouse and one 
suspects home in jacksonville included enough military explosives 
to destroy an entire city block said willi ellison agent in 
charge of the federal bureau of alcohol tobacco and firearms in 
jacksonville 
michael tubbs a us army special forces sergeant had been 
brought back from operation desert shield in saudi arabia within 
the past several weeks ellison said tubbs was already facing 
possible federal firearms and explosives charges in connection with 
a january 1987 incident at fort bragg nc in which two soldiers 
were jumped and tied to a tree by two masked men who stole their 
rifles 
he remained restricted saturday to the base at fort campbell 
ky ellison said 
another soldier army warrant officer jeffrey jennett has 
already been arrested and charged for the 1987 incident jennett 
was arrested in charleston sc on thursday night and charged in 
federal court with assault with intent to commit felony theft and 
with stealing an m16 rifle ellison said 
also seized friday and saturday were military weapons manuals 
magazines describing how to wage urban warfare and make homemade 
bombs and hate materials including videotapes of speeches by adolf 
hitler ellison said 
all the literature focused on just a litany of hate against 
jews blacks and other minorities ellison said they were 
wellequipped to engage in major warfare 
our preliminary indications are that these individuals are 
related to the kkk and the aryan nation added john gordon deputy 
director of police operations at the jacksonville sheriffs office 
arrested in jacksonville on friday were michael tubbs brother 
john and stephen fussell a 26yearold handyman both men face 
federal firearms and conspiracy charges 
the seizures and arrests resulted from a multistate 
investigation by federal and local agencies focusing on the theft 
of weapons and explosives from military installations ellison 
said 
this investigation spans several states ellison said 
were talking about tennessee kentucky north carolina and 
jacksonville 
much of the firearms and explosives are believed to have been 
stolen from us army posts at fort bragg and fort campbell 
ellison said 
the arsenal recovered at john tubbs home and a miniwarehouse 
included soviet ar15 and us m16 automatic rifles thousands of 
rounds of ammunition an antiaircraft machine gun antipersonnel 
land mines numerous handguns and shotguns a 40mm grenade 
launcher hand grenades smoke grenades tear gas dynamite 
blasting caps booby traps and other highexplosives 
ellison and gordon wouldnt comment on any possible motives the 
four men had for stockpiling such destructive material 
the investigation is still continuing and there may be more 
arrests in the future ellison said

a tentative settlement was reached saturday 
to avert a strike at the san francisco bay areas three largest 
newspapers negotiators for both sides said 
management accepted a union proposal at 10 am after 
considering it during a short break in negotiations that went 
through the night said richard jordan chief negotiator for the 
san francisco newspaper agency 
the 45month pact calls for a 35 percent to 4 percent annual 
wage increase for all unions according to a report in sundays 
editions of the san francisco examiner that amounts to 89 per 
week more over the course of the contract for craft unions such as 
printers and engravers and 95 for reporters editors and drivers 
the contract also included benefits such as tax breaks for 
working parents and for newspaper guild employees the right to 
return to work part time after maternity or paternity leave 
workers also won new protection against hand and arm injuries that 
result from repetitive use of computers 
no strike carl hall shop steward and examiner reporter 
told cheering newspaper workers gathered at strike headquarters 
saturday morning 
thats a group of people that were afraid they were going to 
strike but now know they arent said tom wheelan a driver for 
the examiner and the san francisco chronicle 
the unions representing 4500 employees at the san francisco 
examiner the san francisco chronicle and the san jose mercury news 
had threatened to strike at 5 pm friday instead talks were 
continued after both sides agreed that progress was being made 
were happy for all concerned that theres a settlement 
jordan said i think both sides made concessions 
jordan said the the federal mediator told him the union 
negotiating committee was unanimously recommending the contract to 
its members 
leaders of the 10 unions involved in the dispute planned to meet 
monday morning to set dates for ratification votes union leaders 
indicated the votes would be taken after thanksgiving 
the agreement provides for an average 89 a week wage increase 
over the term of the contract which expires in november 1993 
jordan said 
workers represented ranged from reporters and editors to 
delivery drivers and press operators current topscale pay is 801 
a week for reporters and editors 669 for clerical and library 
workers and 675 for drivers 
the three papers have a combined circulation of about 1 million 
there were improvements in terms of child care and dependent 
care and flexible spending programs which allow a portion of 
earnings to be shielded from taxes jordan said 
other details of the proposal were not immediately released 
apparently its a good contract hall said 
the negotiations didnt hamper production of the san francisco 
chronicle and the san jose mercury news both of which were at the 
stands this morning the afternoon san francisco examiner combines 
with the chronicle to print a sunday paper 
the san francisco newspaper agency runs all departments of the 
chronicle and examiner except for the news operations 
san franciscos last newspaper strike was in 1968 and lasted 55 
days the mercury news was last struck in 1959 for four months

president bush keeping the 
persian gulf crisis at the top of his agenda flew to germany today 
to meet with german chancellor helmut kohl in advance of the 
opening of a 34nation summit in paris 
bush was met here in a cold rain by kohl and the two leaders 
boarded a helicopter for a flight to speyer in kohls home region 
where bush was to attend an organ recital in speyer cathedral and 
speak in the town square 
kohl was then to take the us president to his home in nearby 
ludwigshafen 
afterwards bush was flying to paris for dinner with french 
president francois mitterrand at the elysee palace on monday bush 
will join soviet president mikhail s gorbachev in paris for the 
signing of a landmark treaty to slash nonnuclear weapons in 
europe nonnuclear weapons in europe 
the signing ceremony will be followed immediately by the opening 
of a threeday meeting of the 34nation conference of security and 
cooperation bringing former adversaries of the cold war together 
in a new era of reconciliation 
todays stop in germany retraces some sites visited by gorbachev 
last weekend when he visited kohl bush first will hear an organ 
recital at an 11thcentury cathedral in speyer and then go to 
kohls home in oggersheim for lunch a news conference is scheduled 
before the meeting ends 
aside from the gulf a prime topic for discussion was the 
deteriorating political and economic situation in the soviet union 
which is braced for a winter of extreme shortages of food and fuel 
kohl announced last week that germany will provide emergency 
food aid to moscow and he urged other western nations to do the 
same us officials said the bush administration is developing 
contingency plans to provide emergency supplies 
from the start of his visit to prague bush put a spotlight on 
the gulf crisis linking the past year of revolution in europe to 
the crisis in the persian gulf 
i have this feeling in my heart that no peoples understand 
better what is at stake in the gulf than czechs and slovaks bush 
said 
you know from your own bitter experience that the world cannot 
turn a blind eye to aggression you know the futility and vain hope 
that aggressors can be appeased he said 
president vaclav havel said czechoslovakias own history has 
taught us ample lessons about the consequences of appeasement 
onethird of czechoslovakias territory was ceded in 1938 to the 
nazis in an unsuccessful attempt to prevent adolf hitler from 
conquering other countries 
a huge crowd braved cold temperatures and biting winds to see 
bush place a wreath at a memorial in wenceslas square site of many 
turning points in czechoslovakias turbulent history czechoslovak 
television estimated the crowd at 150000 but us officials 
claimed the turnout was much larger 
america will not fail you in this decisive moment bush 
promised the crowd america will stand with you 
he delivered the same pledge earlier in a speech to the federal 
assembly and yet bush did not bring any major package of aid 
offering instead a modest package of incentives to spur us

following is a transcript of the news 
conference by president bush and chancellor helmut kohl outside the 
german leaders home 
kohl mr president mrs bush ladies and gentlemen allow me 
to thank you once again very warmly for having met with me here 
in my home region the weather doesnt correspond at all to the 
kind of mood were in and to the overall feeling but unfortunately 
november in germany means rain but the relationship between the 
federal republic of germany and the united states of america is an 
excellent one and this is due first and foremost to the personal 
involvement of president bush 
ive already said this in my short statement in front of speyer 
cathedral the third of october 1990 the day of german unity 
would not have been possible would indeed have been inconceivable 
without the help and support which we received from the americans 
throughout the century and well never forget this 
right now over the next few years over the next few decades 
indeed we the united germany want to do our utmost in order to 
foster and deepen this relationship particularly among young 
people we want to promote the exchange of students of high school 
students scientists scholars and this in the closest possible 
way and obviously mr president i would be most pleased to see as 
many american companies as possible investing in the new state 
the new federal lander which was formally the german democratic 
republic 
i know that the president of the united states is a very busy 
man indeed but if perhaps in one of your next speeches in front 
of the chamber of industry and commerce in the us you were in a 
position to introduce a few remarks about the possibilities of 
investment in the eastern part of germany in what was formally the 
gdr i think that would be a very good and very beneficial thing 
today we talked about a number of issues where we think we can 
help each other we exchanged views and we expressed agreement on 
the fact that we hope that the next gatt round the uruguay round 
may be a successful one 
were going to work on that one also over the next few weeks and 
we talked about the challenge to the international community in the 
middle east in kuwait and in iraq we were in agreement here that 
it is very important indeed that the international community 
stand together here stand fast and in a coalition and this on the 
basis of the un resolutions in the sense that we want to see 
respect for international law restored and we were in agreement 
that it is of utmost importance to see a release of all hostages of 
all nationalities as soon as possible and that this indeed was 
one of the most important prerequisites for any further talks 
we also said that it was wished that negotiations would lead to 
a peaceful outcome of the situation there but that these 
negotiations can only be successful if both sides want their 
success and if the consequences of this assault are removed 
again mr president thank you very much for coming here thank 
you barbara and with all my heart let me wish you all the best 
and the best of success in your very difficult office and may god 
bless you 
bush thank you sir and may we thank you and mrs kohl for 
your hospitality theres something very special about conducting 
the kind of discussions we had within the home of two friends in a 
warm ambiance and in a setting that lends itself to frank and open 
discussions and agreement as the chancellors outlined and again 
were very grateful to you for this extraordinary hospitality 
thank you all very much 
q mr president in your prepared speech today you said that 
germany a united germany must take responsibility for leadership 
in the world what would you like to see germany do in the persian 
gulf crisis 
president bush the german i think exactly what chancellor 
kohl says keep the coalition together in my view they are 
fulfilling their roles and when i was talking about their 
leadership clearly anybody that takes a look at the map and 
understands the realities of the world knows that this united 
germany is and will be a tremendous force for peace and certainly 
for economic good in the world 
so i think were together with germany both in the gulf and i 
have no i made no special request of chancellor kohl at all 
but i agree with him that this coalition is holding and should 
continue to hold and thats the best way to get a peaceful 
solution send a solid signal to saddam hussein that his 
aggression will not be rewarded 
q do you think you see eye to eye 
kohl in english one moment please 
translator do you mind if we translated it 
q do you think you see eye to eye on 
bush well ive read what hes said and i think were in very 
close accord here and were not ruling out any options were not 
ruling any options in i want to see a peaceful resolution of this 
question 
q mr chancellor in a radio address today warned inaudible 
the gulf did he deliver a similar warning a similar warning to 
you 
bush he made very clear hed like to see a peaceful resolution 
to this question and so would i 
kohl goodbye in english

the key amphibious portion of the 
imminent thunder military exercise was called off sunday because of 
bad weather but troops in helicopters went ashore in a mock 
assault 
military officials said the seaborne assault would have gone off 
in wartime 
in peactime there are limitations and you dont want to lose 
anybody said maj gen harry w jenkins commanding officer of 
the 4th marine expeditionary brigade 
it was not immediately clear when the amphibious landing would 
be tried again 
the helicopter assault and air exercises held on the fourth day 
of imminent thunder went well jenkins told reporters in a media 
pool covering the exercise 
but marine officers expressed disappointment that the key 
amphibious portion of the mock invasion held about 100 miles south 
of the kuwait border was called off because of choppy waves 
reaching 4 to 8 feet high 
whenever i dont get to do everything i try to do thats a 
disappointment said lt col robert p mcaleer commanding 
officer of the battalion of marines involved in the drill if we 
had had a realworld situation you always stretch the parameters 
of what you can do and what you cant do 
the troops in the helicopter assault left the uss guam despite 
winds of 20 to 25 mph hovercraft aboard the uss gunston hall 
situated 25 miles from shore were not dispatched because of high 
waves 
among those who came ashore on helicopter gunships were 34 saudi 
arabian marines 
us and british warplanes provided simulated air support and 
cover for the troops no live ammunition was fired officials said 
imminent thunder as the sixday exercises in the gulf are 
named involves about 1000 troops and 1100 aircraft the largest 
force of warplanes yet assembled for a desert shield exercise 
the drill is meant to emphasize gaining control of the skies 
which would be critical to smash iraqi defenses a key objective of 
the amphibious assualt had been to practice an attack from ships 30 
miles from shore

president bush today prodded germany to 
play a bigger role in the persian gulf showdown with iraq urging 
this newly united and powerful nation to take responsibility for 
leadership in the world 
but german chancellor helmut kohl cautioned against a military 
solution urging that everything be exhausted that there is to 
exhaust with negotiations 
whoever believes the problem can be solved militarily must 
consider not only the mission but the end of the whole 
undertaking kohl said in a german radio interview aired shortly 
after bush arrived 
under pressure from the united states and other allies kohl has 
agreed to provide 22 billion for the american and allied troop 
buildup in the gulf but citing constitutional barriers germany 
has not sent any troops 
as europe forges a new future europe must not turn inward 
the president said in prepared remarks 
just as a new europe must look beyond its borders so too must 
a united germany take responsibility for leadership in our 
commonwealth of nations bush said 
joining ohl to answer questions later outside the chancellors 
home however bush said he had made no special request of the 
german leader during their private talks about the middle east 
when asked what he meant by asserting that the newly reunified 
germany should assert leadership he replied in my view they are 
fulfilling their role he said he agreed with kohl about the 
importance of remaining unified against saddam hussein 
so i think were together with germany in the gulf 
bush said 
bush said kohl made very clear hed like to see a peaceful 
resolution to this question and so would i 
following the news conference bush departed germany for a short 
flight to paris where he joins 33 other leaders monday for a 
conference formally ending the cold war 
earlier the president was to deliver a speech to an outdoor 
audience but was forced to cut it short because of a heavy 
downpour the rains are coming so i will conclude mercifully 
bush said 
the nations of europe have overcome conflict and the 
partitions that are its bitter fruits bush said in the prepared 
text now by working together in the spirit of unity and 
determination we can help achieve the same for the world 
bush arrived at ramstein air force base to be greeted by kohl 
and a crowd of 400 people braving pouring rain and powerful winds 
the two leaders and their wives then flew by helicopter to the 11th 
century cathedral town of speyer in kohls home region 
bush began his eightday tour of europe and the mideast on 
saturday with a oneday stop in prague becoming the first american 
president to visit czechoslovakia 
he told reporters flying with him from prague to germany that 
his visit was very moving and very emotional and very good 
bush said havels denunciation of the iraqi invasion of kuwait 
should be well noted around the world this country 
czechoslovakia has learned it means to be taken over it just 
redoubles my conviction that aggression cant stand 
kohl said it was very important to maintain western solidarity 
in isolating iraqi leader saddam hussein and he urged intensive 
efforts so that iraq quickly frees all foreign hostages 
once the hostages are free he said the chance for 
negotiations is far greater 
asked about the firing on friday of soviet prime minister 
nikolai i rhyzhkov by president mikhail s gorbachev bush said 
very interesting well have a chance to talk to mr gorbachev 
about all of that 
bush and gorbachev will meet over breakfast tuesday in paris 
amid a 34nation summit of east and west countries the two leaders 
also will get together monday morning for the signing of a historic 
treating slashing nonnuclear weapons in europe 
bush said the arms treaty seems to be overshadowed by whats 
happening in the gulf but it is a significant milestone 
on another subject bush was asked about reports that william 
bennett who resigned as national drug control director will 
become chairman of the republican national committee 
bush smiled and said were not discussing that a lot happens 
when i leave 
bushs first stop was an organ recital at the speyer cathedral 
from where he was proceeding to kohls home for lunch 
in his speech bush said the revolutions in europe had brought 
a peaceful conclusion to the divisions of the cold war 
and yet bush said new challenges to peace and freedom are 
arising from distant shores 
if the world rewards naked aggression if we ignore the 
proliferation of the technologies of mass destruction if we 
conclude that these challenges are not everyones concern then we 
put at risk everything we have achieved bush said 
the president said that no people on earth are more thrilled 
by your achievement than your friends in america german unity 
came in part because americans stood by the free people of 
berlin from the daredevil pilots of the airlift to a young 
president who made his bold declaration on a windswept day before 
the wall he was referring to president john f kennedys 1963 
speech at the berlin wall 
bush also saluted kohl as the man who united germany kohl 
is facing national elections in two weeks in a bid to become the 
first chancellor of a united germany 
aside from the gulf a prime topic for discussion with kohl was 
the deteriorating political and economic situation in the soviet 
union which is braced for a winter of food and fuel shortages 
kohl announced last week that germany will provide emergency 
food aid to moscow and he urged other western nations to do the 
same the bush administration is developing contingency plans to 
provide emergency supplies 
from the start of his visit to prague bush put a spotlight on 
the gulf crisis linking it to the past year of revolution in 
europe 
i have this feeling in my heart that no peoples understand 
better what is at stake in the gulf than czechs and slovaks bush 
said 
president havel said czechoslovakias own history has taught 
us ample lessons about the consequences of appeasement onethird 
of czechoslovakias territory was ceded in 1938 to the nazis in a 
vain attempt to prevent adolf hitler from conquering other 
countries 
america will not fail you in this decisive moment of the 
difficult transition from communism to a free market economy bush 
promised a giant crowd which braved bad weather to attend a rally 
at wenceslas square saturday america will stand with you 
and yet bush did not bring any major aid offering instead a 
modest package of incentives to spur us investment

east and west meet this week determined to set a 
peaceful course for europe after four decades of tension but the 
celebrations of the cold wars end are clouded by threat of war in 
the persian gulf 
leaders of the 34 nations of the conference on security and 
cooperation in europe converged sunday on paris where their 
threeday summit opens monday 
for the first time in 40 years said secretary of state 
james a baker iii europe will be meeting and discussing and 
planning without an artificial eastwest divide to block 
progress 
the nations meet at a time when they have an absolutely new 
european space in front of them an absolutely new state of 
things said vitaly ignatenko spokesman for soviet president 
mikhail gorbachev 
french foreign minister roland dumas describing the summit as 
the most important international event since world war ii said it 
will design the architecture of europe for the century to come 
on monday the leaders of nato and the six nations of the 
lifeless warsaw pact will sign a treaty slashing arsenals of tanks 
helicopters and other conventional weapons 
the text of the final summit document has been worked out in 
advance ensuring closer cooperation among the onetime adversaries 
us and french officials say major lastminute modifications are 
unlikely 
talks on the fringes of the summit could eclipse the conference 
itself focusing on the crisis spawned by iraqs invasion of 
kuwait just as europe settled into its embrace of peace the gulf 
crisis put much of the world on a heightened military footing 
president bush will meet privately with a host of leaders allied 
with the united states against iraq including gorbachev french 
president francois mitterrand and british prime margaret thatcher 
the summit will produce sideshows as well 
some leaders arrive in paris under severe domestic political 
pressure 
thatcher and mitterrands premier michel ocard both face 
votes by parliament members during the summit that conceivably 
could topple them gorbachev continues to struggle against 
rebellious politicians and economic troubles 
dozens of prominent french people including a pop singer and a 
catholic bishop are organizing a rally in paris on monday to 
protest the deployment of western troops in the gulf 
monitoring protests will be one of many tasks facing the 
10000strong security force contingent assigned to the summit 
antiterrorist squads including rooftop snipers will be deployed 
and thousands of policemen will seal off several blocks around the 
conference center barring any pedestrian or motorist who lacks a 
special pass 
the conference for security and cooperation in europe was 
created with the signing of the 1975 helsinki final act one result 
of the summit will be to institutionalize the csce setting up a 
small secretariat in prague a center in vienna for the prevention 
of conflict and an office in warsaw to help monitor elections 
the summit document also includes the recommendation that the 
heads of member states meet at least once every two years their 
foreign ministers annually and senior officials even more often 
france is proposing creation of some sort of conciliation 
process to resolve differences between member states regarding 
ethnic minorities 
several participants have stressed that they do not want too 
firm a structure for the csce to prevent overlapping with nato and 
the european community 
lets avoid creating useless structures whether they be 
duplicates of those that already exist or whether their functions 
are insufficiently defined dumas said 
a conservative swedish newspaper svensa dagbladet said in an 
editorial that a possible european confederation is best built on 
the foundation brussels has laid the european community rather 
than the looser csce process 
between the formal summit sessions primarily speeches by the 
34 leaders and the private consultations most of the 
participants will have little leisure time the one major social 
occasion on the agenda is a dinner tuesday at the chateau of 
versailles preceded by a ballet performance

a mass grave has been discovered 
near the site where more than 100000 asian slave workers and 
allied prisoners died building a railroad for the japanese during 
world war ii 
the remains of several hundred people have been dug up since 
tuesday when the excavation began it is being carried out by the 
pothipawana songkroh foundation which for religious reasons wants 
to provide proper burials 
several dozen workers were digging sunday in a sugar cane field 
in kanchanaburi province about 70 miles west of bangkok one skull 
was left out overnight but workers first covered it with paper so 
it would not be cold 
about half the small plot has been excavated 
the mass grave is about three miles from a bridge made famous in 
the 1957 hollywood movie bridge over the river kwai which 
celebrated the heroism of the war captives 
a foundation official santi assawaseeyotin said it appeared 
the bones had been dumped into the ground because they were 
found in some disorder 
santi said the bones were dating back to the world war ii era 
we believe they were bones of asian people as the skulls found 
were not big he said there also were childrens bones 
he said the remains were being brought to the foundations 
office in bangkok where they will be cleaned and cremated 
there was no direct evidence the bones belonged to the world war 
ii prisoners no such remains have been found in kanchanaburi in 
recent years 
also recovered were metal plates and bowls on the back of 
several were written made in japan or made in hong kong the 
bangkok post newspaper said some had the year 1939 imprinted on 
them 
more than 100000 chinese indian malay burmese and other 
asian slave laborers lost their lives building the railway in 
194243 along with more than 16000 british dutch australian 
american and new zealand prisoners of war 
they died of disease malnutrition exhaustion beatings and 
executions 
the japanese had the 268mile line connecting thailand and burma 
built for their planned invasion of india 
ladda matcha 38 who lives near the grave said the owner of a 
motorcyle repair shop also near there recently dreamed that the 
dead told him they could not breathe and asked him for help 
the man contacted the foundation whose representatives secured 
permission from the landowner to dig mrs ladda said the owner 
knew of the remains on her plot but used it to grow sugar cane 
mrs laddas mother pab borngern 77 said the japanese 
constructed a military camp and tunnel in the area during the war 
when the indians workers died they just carried them into 
the hole they dug up she said at the place where they found 
the bones that was thousands of people buried there those peple 
died because of fever 
the bangkok post quoted the landowners sister lek pailom 64 
as saying field hospitals for asian slave workers were in the area 
every morning the indians dug a hole in this area to bury 
dead bodies in the evening she said some days two or three 
bodies were buried some days more than five 
this happened throughout the period of the railway 
construction she said 
the discovery of the remains came just before the annual 11day 
river kwai bridge festival this major tourist attraction of 
special shows and exhibitions is scheduled to begin friday 
in march prime minister chatichai choonhavan responded to 
objections by australian veterans groups and prime minister bob 
hawke by barring shows that a tourism company planned along the 
railway they were to have featured japanese soldiers supervising 
work gangs

the main opposition party made a 
strong showing in parliamentary elections in the faeroe islands 
and the partys leader said he planned to form a new government 
danish public radio said sunday 
the incumbent conservative coalition led by prime minister 
jogvan sundstein lost four of its 21 seats in saturdays balloting 
while former prime minister atli dams social democrats gained 
three the radio said 
the social democrats now hold 10 of the 32 legislative seats in 
the selfgoverning territory which is under the danish crown 
sundsteins rightist peoples party holds only seven 
dam who was prime minister for three fouryear terms between 
1970 and 1988 said he planned to form a new coalition government 
with one or two of the other main parties 
we will talk with all the parties there are many coalition 
possibilities dam said in a radio interview 
there was no immediate comment from sundstein 
the faeroese constitution forbids minority administrations and 
the government must command at least 17 seats 
the elections only the second early poll in 40 years were 
called to break a political deadlock on how to rescue the 
foundering economy 
sunsteins peoples party which came to power in the 1988 
ballot and formed a coalition with the unionist and the republican 
parties dropped one seat in the election 
the volcanic archipelago of 18 islands located about halfway 
between scotland and iceland in the north sea has a population of 
47000 
the six parties represented in the loegting or parliament are 
split both ideologically along leftright lines and on the question 
of separation from denmark

rain seeps through cracks in the ceiling and 
spiders spin webs above vats of dough at bread factory no 14 once 
the filipov bakery whose raisin buns have been famous since 
czarist times 
women and teenagers toil at open ovens with no protective 
gloves or masks they work in a ratinfested neighborhood and live 
in crowded dormitories 
managers of the 150yearold bakery one of 33 in moscow say 
they want to make improvements but are caught between the 
dissolving structure of soviet communism and a new economic order 
not yet formed 
the bakerys plight illustrates the difficulties soviet 
businesses and workers face in converting from a centrally planned 
to a market economy 
leonid vorobyev the bread factorys 47yearold director is 
trying to figure out how to fit into the plan the soviet 
legislature adopted oct 19 for switching to a market economy 
he also is pondering how to attract foreign capital to modernize 
the bakery how much to pay his workers and how much to charge his 
customers when prices are freed from their artificially low fixed 
levels 
vorobyev is worried and so are his employees 
in a stormy meeting with the workers who demanded to know what 
their salaries and positions would be he said give me results 
and the money will be there 
the manager who has been in the baking industry 25 years said 
in an interview afterward we and they are afraid of a free 
market what will it be like 
under current conditions its amazing the bakery produces 
anything edible 
economic planner tatiana zimina said the 200 workers make 20 
tons of baked goods daily using wornout equipment 20 years old 
there are 19 varieties from white bread to the famous raisin 
rolls 
rats that infest the neighborhood are attracted by the aroma of 
baking bread and by flour spilled on the floor 
bakery workers 70 percent of whom are women have no machines 
for moving sugar margarine and flour from heavy steel vats to the 
mixers so they do it by hand 
those who work the unsealed ovens have the worst job 
blasts of hot air pound their faces the only ventilation is a 
window that cannot be fully opened because too much heat would be 
drawn from the ovens 
the women some with scars from burns on their arms and hands 
slit the tops of molded loaves with knives and slide them into the 
ovens on trays 
because of the difficult conditions pay averaging 324 a month 
and a sixday week the bakery has trouble attracting workers and 
is 40 people short most employees are older women or teenagers 
a vacant apartment building next to bread factory no 14 looks 
as if it had been bombed or is in the process of being razed with 
broken glass dirt and plaster piled kneedeep on the floors 
in august a construction crew digging nearby cut a natural gas 
pipeline forcing the bakery to shut down for a few days 
vorobyev and his fellow managers want to hire their own drivers 
bypassing unreliable state truckers and are negotiating with 
foreign companies to renovate the plant 
they also are negotiating with the soviet bureaucracy to improve 
working conditions and keep more of the profit most of which now 
goes to government ministries workers got pay raises in september 
ms zimina said her goal is for the workers to own the factory 
we dream about privatization she said but added that 
bureaucrats stand in the way 
the russian republics government approved private ownership of 
many factories in september but the bread ministry later excluded 
large bakeries including factory no 14 
another difficult problem is changing the psychology of workers 
many of whom seem disinterested in increasing production or 
streamlining the operation 
the factorys bookkeeper a powerful employee in a soviet 
business is 78 and not enthusiastic about change ms zimina said 
adding 
how can she do anything new or fight the bureaucracy

and a rare one at that 
when justice david h souter replaced the retired william j 
brennan the courts nine members gathered for an official portrait 
taken by a photographer for national geographic magazine 
photographers and camera crews from various news organizations 
also were invited for the session but waited in another room until 
the official shot had been taken 
at one point while the national geographic photographer changed 
some equipment the prim and proper justice sandra day oconnor 
standing behind a seated justice byron r white struck a pose 
found in countless family albums 
she stealthily raised her right hand close to whites head and 
extended her index and middle fingers to eyewitnesses standing in

since beginning its 199091 term last month the court has been 
spending less time on the bench hearing oral arguments due to a 
shortage of available cases the justices increased selectivity 
last spring is why 
the number of cases that have arrived since oct 1 more than 
1800 is running slightly higher this term than last and the 
justices have granted full review to 44 so far a few more than 
last term 
but when the current term began only 57 cases were available to 
be argued compared to the 81 available the previous october and 
the 105 the year before 
some court watchers are grumbling about those cases granted the 
legal issues they raise seem comparatively lackluster some say

president elias hrawi crossed into 
lebanons christian heartland sunday his first such visit since 
his election a year ago and a dramatic illustration that the citys 
dividing lines are eroding 
the syrianbacked hrawi a maronite catholic attended mass in 
the chapel of maronite patriarch nasrallah sfeirs seat in bkirki 
12 miles north of beirut 
a convoy of jeeps carrying troops swept ahead of the presidents 
shining black bulletproof mercedes as it passed through the 
museum crossing once the only link between the mainly moslem and 
christian sectors of the sprawling metropolitan area 
the motorcade sped without incident through streets lined with 
scores of battlescarred highrise apartment buildings used as 
sniper nests during 15 years of civil war 
at bkirki known for its soaring statue of the virgin mary 
hrawi sat in the front row of worshipers 
sfeir warned in his sermon against the domination by one side 
over the other which could tip the balance required for peaceful 
coexistance 
hrawi and sfeir then held a 40minute conference behind closed 
doors the president said afterward we have reached an 
understanding over all issues facing the nation my government will 
be fair to all 
the patriarchs sermon appeared to reflect fears among the 
maronite community their ranks depleted by a year of fighting in 
their heartland that a peace plan brokered by the arab league to 
end the civil war might herald moslem domination of power 
it was within the framework of that peace accord that hrawi was 
elected president by parliament last nov 24 
in september he signed into law constitutional reforms 
envisaged by the plan that gave moslems an equal share of power 
with the christians 
the maronites the largest christian sect have dominated the 
government army parliament judiciary and financial sector since 
lebanon gained independence from france in 1943 when they were 
thought to be the majority 
the moslems who now make up about 55 percent of lebanons 4 
million inhabitants have pressed for equality in the civil war 
that claimed more than 150000 lives since 1975 
on oct 13 hrawis army backed by syrian troops crushed an 
11month mutiny against his government by rebel christian gen 
michel aoun that removed the last obstacle facing the peace plan 
the syrians maintain 40000 troops in lebanon under a 1976 arab 
league peacekeeping mandate 
after aouns ouster hrawis government dismantled beiruts 
green line and reopened nearly all crossings between the moslem and 
christian sectors 
it also set a deadline of midnight monday as a deadline for 
moslem and christian militias to evacuate the capital and its 
environs to proclaim a unified greater beirut

the cabinet overrode opposition protests and 
approved legislation sunday to restrict indecent advertising 
and public transport on jewish holy days 
prime minister yitzhak shamir agreed to the measures to draw the 
ultraorthodox agudat israel party into his coalition government 
a coalition agreement signed friday also provides for 
restrictions on abortion and a ban on the breeding and sale of 
pork in line with jewish religious law 
the curbs on advertising and transport were approved for 
parliamentary scrutiny with only one vote against by agriculture 
minister rafael eitan agudat israel has been promised speedy 
passage of the laws through the knesset parliament 
the law on transport will forbid buses to operate between 
sundown friday and sundown saturday and high holidays a measure 
strongly opposed by those who travel to and from remote settlements 
on weekends 
currently buses generally do not run on holy days but those 
serving outlying areas have to set out before the holy day is 
finished in order to meet their schedules 
the law on advertising is supposed to curb nudity on public 
billboards and carries a sixmonth prison term for offenders 
such an ad is defined in the coalition agreement as a picture 
of naked men and women a picture containing a stimulation of 
sexual arousal or a temptation to commit sexual relations or a 
picture of nude parts of the body which offends the religious 
belief or feelings of the public or which harms minors or their 
education 
bus stops and billboards featuring scantily clad women have 
frequently been defaced by orthodox jews seeking to impose their 
moral code on israels secular majority 
fifteen members of the liberal shinui change party protested 
outside the cabinet office and the socialist kibbutz arzi 
movement representing some 80 socialist kibbutzim collective 
farms warned the legislation could lead to a cultural war 
between secular and religious jews 
shinui legislator avraham poraz claimed shamirs likud bloc was 
selling the secular public to agudat israel and that the laws 
will take us back to the middle ages 
health minister ehud olmert acknowledged the laws were 
unpopular but said in the present political circumstances we 
have no choice but to pay this price 
roni slavtau directorgeneral of the advertisers union said 
the curb on advertising was illdefined 
what is indecent if they define as indecent ads of high 
esthetic value that fulfill different cultural criteria of the 20th 
century there will be some disagreement here he said 
legislator shulamit aloni head of the leftwing citizen rights 
movement said the new laws were aimed to force us into chains of 
coercion i am very very worried 
little criticism was heard from the main opposition the labor 
party which had offered agudat israel much the same legislation 
when it was trying to form a coalition with the party 
agudat israels four seats give shamirs rightwing coalition a 
majority in the 120member parliament since it was formed in june 
the government has ruled with 60 seats plus tacit support from the 
two members of the rightist moledet homeland party 
however the respite may not last eitans twomember tzomet 
crossroad party is dissatisfied that the government has not met 
his demand for electoral reform 
shas a sixmember religious party is threatening to quit the 
coalition saying it is dissatisfied with the governments handling 
of arabisraeli peace efforts

at least two and possibly three of the four 
nuclearpowered submarines that carry britains polaris nuclear 
missiles have developed cracks in their cooling systems newspapers 
reported sunday 
they said repairs to correct the fault will probably reduce the 
number of patrols and might halt them entirely 
the four subs carry 16 polaris nuclear missiles each it is 
policy to have at least one on patrol at all times if none can be 
at sea britain has no effective nuclear deterrent until new more 
powerful submarines to carry us trident missiles are ready in 
1995 
the observer weekly said there are cracks in the nuclear reactor 
cooling systems of two of the vessels hms revenge and hms renown 
it said that a third hms repulse may also be cracked 
when the remaining polaris submarine hms resolution returns 
from patrol later this month there may be no boat ready to replace 
her the observer said 
the ministry of defense on sunday denied the nuclear capability 
had been undermined by the reactor problem 
the polaris deterrent is being maintained at sea and on 
patrol a department spokesman said on condition of anonymity 
he declined to discuss technical matters or the operational 
deployment of the polaris fleet 
the observer attributed its information to lawmaker john mcfall 
and defense and industrial sources mcfall a scot has contacts

scotland

existed in three of the four submarines it said senior officials

voters wanted new faces and thats what 
theyre going to get 
political observers anticipate as many as 50 candidates may run 
for nine elected municipal posts being vacated because voters 
approved a twoterm limit this month moreover some black and 
hispanic residents plan to challenge the term limit in court 
while incumbents warn that the limit could put more power in the 
hands of city hall bureaucrats others say theyre looking forward 
to a needed switch 
itll be a breath of fresh air said charles wheeler a 
former mayor who helped get the issue on the ballot 
its going to be a zoo countered the rev emanuel cleaver 
one of nine incumbents who will lose seats on the 13member 
council 
unlike term limits recently approved in oklahoma colorado and 
california kansas citys measure is retroactive anyone who 
already has served two consecutive fouryear terms cant run in 
april when the municipal election will be held 
the nine incumbents losing jobs have spent between eight years 
and 21 years governing the city of 450000 
three already had planned not to seek reelection including 
threeterm mayor richard berkley who serves as an ex officio 
voting council member and cleaver and another council member both 
of whom plan to run for mayor 
none said they would wait four years and run again as the law 
allows 
besides those running for mayor just one said he will 
definitely seek another political office at least two are looking 
for other work 
incumbents are not the only ones worried that the new council 
made up of beginners and lame ducks will be too weak to control a 
large city staff 
katheryn shields a firstterm council member who plans to run 
again said council members already struggle against an 
unresponsive bureaucracy 
now well have a situation where the staff if they disagree 
with a council member on something can simply say hey theyre 
going to be gone in two years or three we can wait them out 
she said 
others worry that term limits will dilute the power of the 
citys minorities four of the soontobeousted incumbents are 
black and one is hispanic the other four are white including the 
mayor 
citizens in two districts plan to file a lawsuit claiming that 
the term limits violate the federal voting rights act they say it 
was unfair for voters citywide to decide the fates of candidates 
from particular districts the mayor and six other council members 
are elected citywide and six are elected by district 
many people in those black districts feel it will be a long 
time before they can elect candidates who had the same kind of 
experience and influence and maybe never said cleaver who is 
black 
still others think the term limit wont have much effect on the 
citys underlying political structure they say the powerful 
political clubs that endorse candidates will simply reach down to 
the next available person 
everybody acts like 50 philosopherkings are going to step 
forward to run for office shields said but there arent 50 
philosopherkings out there it probably will be the same caliber 
of people 
she contends the limit will merely succeed at getting rid of 
certain council members who are disliked citywide but considered 
virtually unbeatable in their districts 
to wheeler and others that would be enough 
they say the current council is unaccountable to voters 
neglecting to ask their opinion on how tax money should be spent 
and using favoritism to decide what city projects should be done 
in addition one city council member served a 30day federal prison 
sentence in 1988 for failing to file a federal income tax return in 
1983 
we need a clean slate wheeler said this is going to give 
us that

ten years after crawling to safety from 
his hotel room through 21 floors of choking smoke dennis casey 
will be in church to mark the day the mgm grand hotel burned 
time and a 50 million remodeling job to the 26story resort 
now known as ballys have dimmed memories of one of the nations 
worst hotel fires which killed 87 people nov 21 1980 
but mental scars remain for survivors like casey 
you always wonder why you lived and they died the 
pittsburgh public relations executive said i have nightmares 
about it im not ashamed to admit that i see a therapist for it 
on a regular basis 
explaining that hell attend church wednesday as he has done 
every anniversary of the fire casey said i go at the exact 
eastern time of the fire and i say a prayer for those that lived 
and died its my way of remembering the people in the hotel 
the 2800room resort now boasts one of the finest fire safety 
systems of any highrise and tough state retrofit laws passed 
after the disaster forced other nevada hotels to also install 
topoftheline sprinkler and fire safety systems 
but on the morning of the blaze the then 7yearold resort had 
no sprinklers and an array of code violations 
casey and some 4000 others were inside when a short circuit in 
a delicatessen pie case sparked a smoldering blaze that went 
unnoticed for hours 
in a restaurant next to the deli a vacationing illinois 
firefighter kurt schlueter was sitting down to breakfast with 
fellow firefighter dave beshoar and his brother when guards first 
noticed the fire and began to evacuate the restaurant 
two other friends were on their way down from a 12thfloor suite 
the five had rented for a weekend of fun and gambling in las vegas 
the two were later found dead 
a security guard came in said there was a small problem next 
door and asked us to leave said schlueter a lieutenant in the 
western springs ill fire department by the time we got to the 
front of the restaurant we could see smoke piling up on the 
ceiling and we knew what was happening 
a few people kept gambling in the casino but the firemen and 
security guards hustled most of the guests toward the exits as the 
main floor began filling quickly with dark acrid smoke 
by the time schlueter and the beshoars had gotten to the front 
door they had been forced to their knees by the smoke suddenly 
shortly after 7 am the lights went out and the blaze exploded 
into a fireball that flashed across the casino floor at an 
estimated 17 to 19 feet a second 
dave and i were the last ones out before the fireball hit 
schlueter said we heard a loud click all the lights went out 
and it was pitch dark all of a sudden there was a massive heat 
that pushed us clear out the door if we hadnt been right at the 
door we would have been trapped in there 
a handful of people were killed by the fireball but the toxic 
smoke from the casinos synthetic furnishings would prove far more 
deadly 
smoke billowed up elevator shafts to the top of the hotel and 
was trapped on the upper floors of the tower of the 61 people who 
died in their rooms or in hallways 60 were on the 19th floor or 
above 
figuring he would die if he stayed in his room casey doused 
himself with water from a bathtub and put a wet towel around his 
face opening his door he saw the body of a woman lying in her 
doorway 
i crawled to her body and felt her neck for a pulse casey 
said she was dead it was the first time i fully realized that i 
might die and i began to cry youve got to remember that no more 
than five minutes earlier i had been asleep 
six months later the mgm had a 5 million sprinkler and safety 
system and the melted charred slot machines had been replaced by 
a glittering new casino actor cary grant was the first guest to 
check in

negotiators from nato and warsaw pact 
countries initialed an agreement sunday to detroy tens of 
thousands of nonnuclear weapons and build a peaceful europe on the 
ruins of cold war conflict 
the ceremony in viennas hofburg palace the site of 
negotiations for the past 20 months means the treaty is ready to 
be signed by president bush soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
and other heads of state monday in paris 
from this treaty the soviet union is ceasing to become a 
militarized state with all the consequences of that economic 
political and social said oleg a grinevsky soviet ambassador 
to the talks 
all the wealth of our society can be used for the benefit of 
the people instead of building up an expensive and sometimes 
useless war machine 
before initialing the 160page treaty representatives of the 16 
nato and six warsaw pact countries exchanged thick packets of 
information on the size of their arsenals in europe 
officials said they could not yet release the figures in those 
documents but they said that more than 100000 pieces of military 
hardware would probably be destroyed 
no battle in the history of mankind destroyed such an 
immense number of tanks armored combat vehicles artillery and 
combat aircraft grinevsky told reporters 
no agreement was included on numbers of combat soldiers a 
ussoviet understanding on the number of soldiers each may have 
in europe was overtaken by german unification and negotiators will 
go back to work in vienna nov 29 in an effort settle that 
question 
the warsaw pact countries the soviet union poland 
czechoslovakia hungary romania and bulgaria will have to 
destroy many more weapons than the western alliance to reach the 
quotas which are equal for both sides 
the countries will have 40 months to eliminate the weaponry from 
the moment the last nation ratifies the treaty 
destruction of such a large number of weapons will make it 
difficult for any country to attack another said us ambassador 
james woolsey 
the united states and its allies began the negotiations in march 
1989 determined to cut into the soviet unions ability to launch a 
surprise attack woolsey said 
but about six months later a tide of revolution began that 
swept away eastern europes hardline communist rulers 
the arms talks took on a broader meaning as the warsaw pact 
allies broke away from soviet domination and began defining an 
independent position in the heart of europe 
officials of warsaw pact countries now say the eastern alliance 
is likely to end its military business in mid1991 and transform 
itself into a loose political alliance 
but even if the warsaw pact ceases to function militarily its 
individual countries still are bound by its terms 
the treaty limits each alliance to 20000 main battle tanks 
30000 armored combat vehicles 20000 artillery pieces 6800 
fighter planes and 2000 combat helicopters 
the accord also regulates troop movements from both alliances 
and permits mutual inspections across europe from the atlantic 
ocean to the ural mountains

the imminent thunder maneuvers 
were supposed to be a dress rehearsal for war but 10foot waves 
forced the us marines to postpone the amphibious landing portion 
of a mock invasion sunday 
officials said the landing wold probably have gone off in a 
real war 
one hovercraft from the uss gunston hall was launched in the 
choppy persian gulf but it sputtered in a heavy spray and 
sometimes disappeared behind waves before the seaborne assault was 
scrapped 
its real disappointing said gunnery sgt mike pupkar who 
services the hulking landing craft but it isnt worth hurting 
people and wrecking equipment on a day like this 
the landing was rescheduled for monday morning 
meanwhile 14 ch46 sea knight helicopters from the uss guam 
ferried about 400 troops to shore at exactly the scheduled time 
sunday morning among them were 36 saudi arabian marines the wind 
and helicopter blades kicked up stinging sheets of sand 
overhead hundreds of us british french and saudi attack 
jets and surveillance planes provided cover and air support no 
live ammunition was fired 
maj gen harry w jenkins jr commanding officer of the 4th 
marine expeditionary brigade told reporters the exercise was a 
success despite the inability to use the hovercraft to assault a 
barren stretch of saudi beach 
one of the training objectives for this exercise was to bring 
all these allied forces together and make sure were all talking to 
one another jenkins said im pleased weve had as few 
glitches as weve had we dont want to risk anybody if we 
dont have to 
the commander of the battalion of us marines that was supposed 
to board hovercraft expressed disappointment when the exercise was 
aborted 
whenever i dont get to do everything i try to do thats a 
disappointment lt col robert p mcaleer said anytime you 
get cut out of an exercise its not a good day for you 
despite being unable to use landing craft to get marines ashore 
officers said it didnt affect the outcome of the mock invasion and 
changed their mission only slightly 
by the time naval gunfire got done with this area there 
wouldnt be much opposition left said marine capt david dysart 
30 a company commander whose troops were assigned the task of 
securing a road junction 
under us military rules this section of the sixday exercise 
was covered by several media pools 
the marines have done three other amphibious practices on the 
arabian peninsula but this one was the first on saudi soil and it 
involved the highest concentration of warplanes assembled since 
operation desert shield began 
according to news reports imminent thunder was supposed to be 
held as close as 10 miles from the kuwaiti border the actual 
landing was about 100 miles south of kuwait reportedly after 
complaints from iraq and in the united states that it might provoke 
saddam hussein 
they moved the goalposts said marine maj john toolan of 
brooklyn ny 
the amphibious assault was supposed to commence 25 miles 
offshore in a tecnhique called over the horizon because shore 
cant be seen when the hovercraft are launched 
but winds of 20 to 25 mph stirred up choppy waves estimated at 4 
to 10 feet high marines were first forced to endure a tedious 
wait then got the word of cancellation over a loudspeaker 
if it was the real thing we could probably go said cmdr 
bill marshall captain of the uss gunston hall 
but he said were not going to put them in the water if its 
not safe to do that

the news of 1990 saddens robbie waisman yet 
strengthens his resolve 
when the holocaust survivor reads about the desecration of 
jewish cemeteries in france former ku klux klan leader david duke 
making a strong bid for the us senate and neonazis in the 
pacific northwest he wonders 
if this happens when there are still survivors what will 
happen when were gone 
the world lost 11 million people of which 6 million were 
jews to think people look at that and still have that hate it 
leaves one completely aghast why why 
now a hotelier in vancouver british columbia he has spent much 
of the past seven years reminding people of the nazis slaughter of 
6 million jews 
he was one of several speakers being featured during the twoday 
conference that began sunday marking 45 years since the end of 
world war ii captive and free lessons of the holocaust for 
today and tomorrow was organized by the interfaith council on the 
holocaust which is devoted to preserving the memories and lessons 
of those years of genocide 
by the spring 1945 waisman at 14 had spent nearly onethird of 
his life in concentration camps the last eight months at 
buchenwald in germany he lost both parents and four brothers in 
the holocaust 
when us troops arrived to liberate the camp he recalled in a 
telephone interview last week he thought he was dreaming when two 
soldiers with brown skin approached he thought he was dreaming he 
had never seen black men 
in 1983 he saw pictures of soldiers in a magazine article about 
the liberators one of them was leon bass a former philadelphia 
high school principal who waisman learned was active as a speaker 
on the holocaust he was one of the black men waisman had seen 38 
years before 
waisman called bass who was a corporal in the 183d engineer 
combat battalion part of the pattons third army and they got 
together and talked for hours 
we have sort of shared a moment in time where we just glanced 
at each other waisman said and 40 years later we met again 
and became very close friends 
bass was at first dubious that waisman truly remembered him he 
certainly remembered no faces 
when i came into the camp i did not see him bass said i 
saw all the walking dead in front of me he was looking out the 
window all skin and bones 
bass said he has seen enough in 65 years not to be disheartened 
by current events 
if people dont stand up to racism we would go downhill he 
said maybe we havent moved as far ahead as we might have moved 
but if we hadnt tried we would be farther down the hill 
john raines the interfaith councils cochairman and a temple 
university religion professor said a rash of antisemitic 
incidents in europe made sunday and mondays conference more 
timely 
clearly what we are seeing in eastern europe is the revival of 
very ancient hatreds he said 
as the communist bloc dissolves he said people revert to old 
nationalistic loyalties and traditional religions 
an unfortunate part of those traditional religions in eastern 
europe and russia is antisemitism he said 
waisman who moved to western canada to get as far away as 
possible from europe and the memories broke nearly four decades of 
virtual silence in 1983 after hearing that a teacher in alberta was 
telling students the holocaust never happened he now speaks 
frequently on the subject 
you have no idea how gratifying it is waisman said i 
speak about the camps and i have to dig back into my memory its 
painful as hell but when you speak to the students and they 
come up afterward and they write you letters the pain is worth 
it

the soviet military plans to cut its manpower and 
weaponry to make the armed forces more efficient and less of a 
burden on the state the chief of staff was quoted as saying 
sunday 
a draft of the 10year threestage restructuring plan has been 
forwarded to the supreme soviet legislature said gen mikhail 
moiseyev the armed forces chief of staff he made his comments in 
an interview with the military newspaper red star 
the newspaper also quoted an official identified as only col m 
ponomarev as saying today we have no apprehensions nor do we 
suspect any nation of planning a war against the soviet union this 
has allowed the soviet leadership to adopt a new militarypolitical 
doctrine of reasonable sufficiency 
the first stage of the restructuring which depends on the 
signing of the geneva and vienna arms agreements calls for the 
total withdrawal of soviet troops from czechoslovakia hungary 
mongolia and germany by 1994 moiseyev said 
under the plan civil defense units will be scrapped along with 
the militarys road construction units and some other construction 
units 
the second stage to take place from 1994 to 1995 calls for the 
formation of a new strategic grouping of armed forces on soviet 
territory a reorganization of the central command structure and a 
realignment of military districts 
the third and final stage calls for a 50 percent cut in 
strategic offensive weapons by the year 2000 it envisions 
enhancing soviet military efficiency by combining units with 
similar tasks and weapons 
it calls for eventually cutting the size of armed forces from 
the current 4 million to at least 32 million about 1300 
generals 22000 officers and 250000 noncommissioned officers 
would return to civilian life 
moiseyev said the restructuring will make the armed forces 
less of a burden on the state and more efficient at the same 
time and would reduce it to the corresponding level of real 
military danger and with the new political economic and social 
environment 
in the draft plan pay raises will be given next year to all 
ranks ordinary soldiers who now receive only 1350 a month will 
get 54 to 63 
officers and noncommissioned officers whose pay averages 360 
to 720 will get pay increases of about 25 percent 
the draft will continue moiseyev said but alternative service 
will be allowed for those who object to service on religious 
grounds 
ponomarev said the conditions were right both domestically and 
internationally to carry out military reforms although there is 
no immediate threat of war with the west he said the previous 
stockpiling of weapons still posed a danger 
we cannot remain indifferent to this and therefore disarmament 
has become the call of the day he said

like hundreds of other colombians under 
threat from drug traffickers francisco santos traveled in a 
chauffeurdriven bulletresistant car 
but the precautions werent enough on sept 19 a group of 
gunmen forced the car to stop killed the driver and abducted 
santos news editor of colombias biggestselling newspaper el 
tiempo 
santos 28 is one of nine journalists who have been abducted in 
the past three months by the medellin cocaine cartel 
the traffickers having already resorted to bombings and 
assassinations are attempting a more subtle form of intimidation 
some reporters belong to colombias most influential families 
in one communique the cartel threatened to kill its hostages if 
the government launches a new offensive against traffickers 
an anonymous caller to el tiempo warned that a dead journalist 
would be sent to the presidential palace in a plastic bag if 
president cesar gaviria didnt establish direct negotiations with 
traffickers 
why are reporters the target 
the cartel wants access to the media said one source close 
to the investigation he asked not to be identified 
cartel leaders have said the kidnappings are a response to human 
rights abuses by police they said security forces in medellin 
colombias second largest city were torturing and murdering their 
associates 
whatever the reason the abductions are taking a heavy toll not 
just on the kidnapped reporters and their families but on 
journalism itself 
aside from the hundreds of people murdered by drug traffickers 
freedom of expression has been our most noteworthy casualty 
wrote rafael santos franciscos brother in a recent editorial 
the drug war has been a colombian journalists nightmare he 
added the medellin gang has killed about 30 reporters including 
guillermo cano publisher of the bogota daily el espectador 
that newspapers main offices were all but destroyed by a 
powerful bomb blast set off by drug traffickers last year 
many reporters are afraid to write stories about drugs those 
that do write dont use bylines 
journalists who speak out against the cocaine mafia have grown 
accustomed to guns bodyguards and armored cars 
those who have shown the most bravery in working under these 
conditions are either dead or in exile el espectador columnist 
jose salgar wrote recently 
until the first week of november many colombians believed the 
kidnapped journalists would soon be returned to their homes 
a group of political and church leaders were engaged in a public 
exchange of letters with a lawyer for the medellin cartel 
the lawyer guido parra outlined the cartels demands amnesty 
an end to extraditions and un mediation in colombias drug war 
the polite exchange between parra and the church and political 
leaders offered hope of a solution 
but the leaders insisted that the drug barons demands could not 
be considered until all the hostages were released 
the cartel responded nov 7 by abducting journalists maruja 
villamizar and beatriz guerrero from their car in northern bogota 
the kidnappers murdered the journalists driver angel maria roa 
in short order the negotiations were called off 
all along the gaviria administration has refused to negotiate 
with the cartel 
no issue is debatable under force said one senior official 
who spoke on condition of anonymity 
another casualty of the kidnappings has been the optimism which 
accompanied gavirias ascension to the presidency on aug 7 
former president virgilio barco left office saying the cartel 
had been severely debilitated 
peace talks between the government and armed groups both on 
the left and right appeared to be bearing fruit the country was 
preparing for a national assembly to reform its 104yearold 
constitution 
the violence which had claimed tens of thousands of colombian 
lives in the past decade seemed to be diminishing 
one of gavirias first moves as president was to prohibit 
extraditions to the united states of drug traffickers who 
surrender 
the kidnappings seemed an unlikely response to gavirias 
concessions but they underscored the cartels ability to make life 
difficult for many colombians despite a series of government 
victories in the drug war

mikhail gorbachev enters the 34nation eastwest 
summit fresh from a major government crisis at home and with 
uncertain prospects for what could be a hungry and tumultuous 
soviet winter 
gorbachev said before leaving moscow that the conference on 
security and coopration in europe would be major landmark in the 
history of our continent 
but the real action was back in the soviet union 
on thursday gorbachev became the first soviet leader ever 
summoned before parliament to account for his failures and on 
friday he proposed a new government structure 
the disarray within the soviet empire could hardly contrast more 
sharply with the first csce summit that session held in helsinki 
in 1975 produced the socalled helsinki accords which defined the 
human rights obligations of the participants and ratified the 
presence of soviet ground forces and promoscow regimes throughout 
eastern europe 
soviet power and prestige may have reached their peak during 
that year it was the summer of the ussoviet joint space 
mission a few months after the inglorious american withdrawal from 
vietnam the year a prosoviet government came to power in angola 
a time when communists were strong in italy france and portugal 
for now gorbachev has turned his attention to the meeting in 
paris where the scheduled highlight is a treaty that ostensibly 
slashes eastwest conventional armies in europe 
the pact in fact consecrates the retreat of most soviet ground 
forces behind their own borders by the end of 1994 
the collapse of the soviet bloc over the past 15 months has 
outpaced conventional forces negotiations and diplomats already 
are talking about a followup treaty to keep up with events 
another highlight of the 34nation conference was to be the 
signing of a nonagression pact between the north atlantic treaty 
organization and the kremlinled warsaw pact this agreement too 
would have seemed impossible three years ago but today recognizes 
established fact 
gorbachev arrives in paris straight from rome one of the many 
west european capitals he has visited in the past month seeking 
financial and moral support 
president bush already has told officials to draw up plans to 
rush food to moscow if needed and british prime minister margaret 
thatcher commissioned a fund to convey british industrial knowhow 
to the soviet union 
no one knows whether such aid will bolster gorbachev 
confronting the revolt this week in the formerly tame supreme 
soviet legislature gorbachev announced not simply that he was 
dumping the unpopular prime minister nikolai ryzhkov but that he 
was changing the very structure of government 
the council of ministers that ryzhkov heads will be scrapped 
along with the newly created presidential council 
gorbachev announced plans to enhance the federation council a 
body that previously had little power but has the virtue of 
including representatives from the 15 soviet republics 
by boosting the power of the federation council gorbachev 
effectively embraced a proposal put forward by his rival russian 
president boris yeltsin to form a government made up of 
representatives from the 15 soviet republics 
gorbachevs solution however did not seem to move the soviet 
union closer to his stated goal of a government of laws rather than 
unchecked power and fit the pattern of his increasingly stopgap 
measures to prop up central power 
although the helsinki summit of 1975 ratified the borders of 
postwar europe those borders are again in flux the demolition of 
the berlin wall just over a year ago removed a frontier that two 
generations of soviet leaders struggled to preserve 
now the borders of the soviet union itself are threatened as 
the three baltic republics of lithuania latvia and estonia along 
with the caucasian republics of armenia and georgia seek outright 
independence and moldavian nationalists agitate to reunify with 
romania 
in russia by far the largest soviet republic yeltsin and his 
russian government are waging what promises to be a successful 
campaign for control of stateowned oil and gas fields as well as 
other natural and industrial resources 
the ukraine the second largest soviet republic is also getting 
restive and is likely to win enhanced rights if it agrees to 
gorbachevs proposal to sign a new treaty of union replacing the 
1924 charter that united the soviet republics 
despite the promise of western aid it is not clear what if 
anything bush and the other leaders will be able to offer the 
soviet union or whether there is anything they could do to bolster 
gorbachevs collapsing authority 
equals

more than half the members of the house are 
asking secretary of state james a baker iii to use us influence 
to reduce the atmosphere of fear and repression in the 
southeast asian nation of east timor 
a group of 223 house members signed a letter to be sent to baker 
on monday that calls attention to reports of arrests detention 
torture and other human rights violations on the island nation in 
the last year 
we believe that it is of great importance that united states 
concern over the timor situation be stressed at this time the 
letter said 
east timor is a former portuguese colony that was annexed by 
indonesia in 1975 
the group likened indonesias takeover of east timor to iraqs 
occupation of kuwait 
the lawmakers including 53 republicans cited reports of 
detentions of proindependence demonstrators following an october 
1989 visit to east timor by pope john paul ii 
they also said human rights advocates were beaten by indonesian 
police after their meeting with the us ambassador to indonesia 
during a visit to the country in january 
the letter also points out the potential for periodic cycles of 
hunger and malnutrition brought on by indonesian military 
policies such as restrictions on where timorese villagers can farm 
their crops 
the united states should use its influence to help ensure that 
humanitarian needs of this nature are promptly addressed the 
lawmakers said 
additionally the united states should support a process of 
peace talks that could lead to negotiations without preconditions 
among parties directly involved the letter concluded 
the letter was spearheaded by rep tony hall dohio chairman 
of the house select committee on hunger

nationalist parties accused 
communists in the yugoslav republic of bosniahercegovina of 
rigging elections sunday the contest could make or break 
yugoslavias future as a federation 
foreign observers in sarajevo to monitor the republics first 
free vote since 1938 confirmed there were irregularities but they 
said they were probably because of poor organization 
many people came to vote but were not on the lists which 
caused a lot of nervousness said joseph d dwyer of the hoover 
institution at stanford university 
i dont think it was a bad intention by any party but just 
poor organization added dwyer who visited 15 polling stations 
western observers said saturday they were impressed by the 
organization of the balloting 
the republics electoral commission also said it was checking 
the claims 
voter turnout was reported low only 30 percent of the voters 
had been to the 5000 polling stations by 3 pm 9 am est 
polls opened at 7 am and closed at 8 pm 2 pm est 
first official results were not expected until the end of the 
week 
in a rare show of unity serb croat and moslem nationalist 
parties accused communists of tampering with electoral lists just 
before polling stations opened 
bosniahercegovina an ethnic melting pot of 42 million people 
whose feuds sparked world war i is a microcosm of yugoslavia 
itself 
the republic is at the heart of the countrys bitter rivalries 
both geographically and politically and it could play a pivotal 
role in deciding yugoslavias political future 
radovan karadzic leader of the serbian democratic alliance one 
of three nationalist parties claimed thousands of noncommunist 
voters were struck from lists and replaced by known communists from 
outside bosnia 
stjepan kljuic leader of the croatian democratic union and alia 
izetbegovic president of the moslem union for democratic action 
backed karadzics claims of fraud 
the reformed league of communists currently in power denied 
the charges 
the nationalist parties are inventing accusations against us 
because they know they will lose league leader nijaz durakovic 
said he predicted that communists would capture at least 30 
percent of the republics 240seat bicameral assembly 
a small group of voters gathered at the electoral commissions 
headquarters after they found their names missing from electoral 
lists in sarajevo 
ive lived at the same address for 20 years and i always voted 
in singleparty elections now mysteriously my name is gone 
said retiree dragan djordjic 
the state news agency tanjug said problems with the voting lists 
were evident in northwestern bosnia 
some 3 million voters could choose among 1551 candidates from 
40 parties for parliament and among 28 candidates for the 
sevenseat republican presidency 
no single party seems likely to win a clear majority in sundays 
first round first official results were expected late next week 
and runoff elections will be in two weeks 
in the struggle to shape the countrys future the western 
republics of croatia and slovenia where centerright parties 
ousted communists in spring elections are pushing for more 
independence or even secession from the federation 
they are pitted against serbia and the other poorer southern 
republics who want a strong central government serbia and 
montenegro are still in communist hands ahead of dec 9 elections 
bosnia has so far charted a neutral course between the two 
feuding blocs as mounting ethnic tensions in yugoslavias six

a pipe bomb hidden in a borrowed stereo 
blew up when the stereo was plugged in at a motel and an apparently 
unrelated bomb exploded on a store roof police said sunday

sgt bob ensley but he doubted the explosions were at all 
connected 
the boobytrapped stereo went off when kathy dastrup plugged it 
in at her motel room ms dastrup 32 suffered only minor injuries 
because she was bending near a table at the time said ensley 
an acquaintance 21yearold herman nathaniel belkins who had 
borrowed the stereo was sitting on a couch 12 feet away and was 
uninjured 
ensley said he did not know who loaned belkins the equipment 
about 90 minutes earlier saturday evening a pipe bomb exploded 
on the roof of a kmart store

soviet president mikhail s gorbachev said sunday he 
is convinced there is a peaceful way out of the persian gulf crisis 
and that new ideas have emerged to avert war 
efforts for a political solution in the gulf figured prominently 
in gorbachevs brief stay in rome and his talks with pope john paul 
ii who said he was praying the world will be spared the 
horrors of a military conflict 
gorbachev renewed his invitation to the polishborn pope first 
made during their historic talks a year ago for a papal visit to 
the soviet union 
the pope later told reporters he hoped to go but would not 
commit himself to a date 
the right moment will come said john paul whose efforts 
for religious freedom contributed to the revolutionary changes in 
eastern europe 
vatican officials said the trip could not take place before 
1992 stressing that the vatican first needs to assess the number 
of faithful priests and bishops and the overall state of the 
church in the soviet union 
for gorbachev who was greeted by large and friendly crowds his 
brief stop gave him a respite from his political and economic 
troubles at home 
he signed a 20year friendship treaty with italy which includes 
a nonaggression clause won commitments of nearly 5 billion over 
five years in support for the soviet economy and received a 
450000 human rights prize from an italian foundation backed by a 
mineral water company 
much of his day was spent in talks on the crisis caused by 
iraqs aug 2 invasion of kuwait 
after signing the friendship treaty at the quirinal presidential 
palace gorbachev said it was a test for the international 
community to try to resolve the gulf crisis peacefully 
i am convinced that we will succeed in finding a way out of 
this deep crisis he said speaking in russian which was 
translated into italian 
there are new ideas which need to be examined we are headed 
to the quest of a solution to this grave crisis which involves 
everyone 
gorbachev did not elaborate on the new ideas his spokesman 
vitaly ignatenko said they were discussed in the private talks 
between gorbachev and premier giulio andreotti 
the soviet spokesman said gorbachev and the pope stressed the 
need for un involvement and the importance of the role played by 
arab countries 
ignatenko said gorbachev would discuss the ideas with president 
bush german chancellor helmut kohl french president francois 
mitterrand and other leaders during the eastwest summit opening 
monday in paris 
the spokesman said gorbachev stressed that the united nations 
still has the chance to increase the pressure on saddam 
hussein 
andreottis spokesman pio mastrobouoni said the two leaders 
agreed that efforts to avoid a military conflict in the gulf must 
continue 
one cannot be resigned to the need to resort to force unless 
absolutely necessary he quoted andreotti as saying 
gorbachev termed his talks with the pope very satisfying and 
said they discussed the most important problems in europe and the 
world 
in its communique the vatican said the talks were open and 
very friendly adding that it viewed the audience as a 
continuation of the dialogue started during gorbachevs first visit 
on dec 1 1989 
those historic talks paved the way for the establishment of 
official moscowvatican ties in march and the exchange of 
ambassadors 
gorbachev kept his promise to the pope for enactment of a 
freedom of religion law which among other things legalized the 
long suppressed ukrainian catholic church the ukranian issue had 
been a major impediment to a papal visit 
ignatenko quoted gorbachev as saying his next meeting with john 
paul would perhaps or probably be in the ussr 
gorbachev was accompanied to the vatican by his wife raisa who 
wore a gray suit for last years visit she wore a red dress 
raising eyebrows here

the sultan of oman marked his 20th year in 
power sunday by offering to create a council of representatives to 
give residents of this desert monarchy more say in government 
sultan qaboos became the latest arab monarch to indicate a 
willingness to allow greater democracy saudi arabia and kuwaits 
governmentinexile earlier made such offers 
the sultan in a speech before thousands of omanis said the 
council known as the majlis alshura would be created within a 
year and would be made up of representatives from the countrys 42 
provinces 
he did not say whether they would be elected or appointed 
the majlis alshura is described in the koran islams holy 
book as a consultative council to help rulers manage affairs of 
state normally its members are society elders chosen by the ruler 
oman a nation of 15 million already has a state consultative 
council whose 55 members were chosen by the sultan qaboos implied 
the two bodies would exist side by side as he did not say the 
existing council would disappear 
this is another step on the road of participation that serves 
the aspirations of the citizens he said 
iraqs aug 2 invasion of kuwait has made the gulf sheikdoms 
uneasy about maintaining their hold on power and exposed them to 
western scrutiny and some have made concessions to their 
populations 
in neighboring saudi arabia king fahd announced nov 8 that a 
consultative council would be formed a move saudi kings have 
discussed periodically for decades but never acted on 
in october exiled kuwaiti leaders met in jiddah saudi arabia 
and told politicicians that a rebuilt kuwait would be more 
democratic 
in oman and saudi arabia the monarch is the center of the 
power serving as his own prime minister the two leaders observe 
the islamic tradition of a weekly majlis an open meeting at 
which the ruler and princes listen to petitions from their 
citizens 
the united arab emirates and qatar also have shura councils 
among the islamic countries on the arabian peninsula only 
kuwait had a westernstyle elected parliament although it had been 
dissolved at the time of the invasion of kuwait 
the sultans speech came during a weeklong celebration of his 20 
years in power and his 50th birthday nightly fireworks light up 
the skies while floats carrying musicians and arabian tableaux 
drift through the streets 
on sunday britishmade attack planes zoomed over a military 
parade at maidan alfateh stadium about 1000 dhofar tribesmen 
barechested and wearing indigo loincloths performed acrobatic 
feats for the king tossing their swords 30 feet into the air 
speaking after the parade qaboos called for iraq to leave 
kuwait but stressed his wish for a peaceful settlement 
as part of an economic reform package qaboos offered incentives 
for small businesses and said this oilproducing country needed to 
diversify its economy 
like the other gulf nations oman relies heavily on an 
expatriate workforce one third of the countrys population 
according to western diplomats most foreign workers are from the 
indian subcontinent

washington to end its economic embargo and normalize relations with 
vietnam said cherie rankin a 44yearold psychotherapist from 
norwood mass who was a red cross worker in vietnam in 197071 
the other reason was to try to do something constructive in a 
country where i was involved in doing something destructive she 
said

and because we learned nothing about vietnam before except for 
what our government told us

find the truth about the people and this has been the most 
incredible experience of my life he was quoted as saying

battalion attached to the 1st air calvary

us secretary of agriculture clayton 
yeutter said sunday that prospects for an international agreement 
on reduced agricultural subsidies are bleak 
the dispute over farm subsidies pitting the united states 
against france and germany is threatening to jeopardize a 
fouryear effort to reform the global trading system 
speaking of an agreement on subsidies yeutter told swedish 
national television the chances of success are very very slim 
we hope that something will change in the next couple of weeks to 
alter that assessment he spent the last week meeting with 
european officials to seek a farm subsidies agreement officials 
had hoped to resolve the issue in time for global trade talks 
scheduled to open in brussels belgium on dec 3 
the united states and other big farm exporters like argentina 
want the agriculture agreement to include 75 percent cuts in 
subsidies and 90 percent cuts in customs tariffs 
the 12member european community including france and germany 
has offered to agree to a 30 percent cut in farm subsidies over 10 
years sweden and other european countries that are not members of 
the ec have agreed to subsidy cuts of up to 50 percent 
the global trade talks known as the uruguay round for the 
country where they were launched in 1986 involve 105 nations 
us trade representative carla hills warned thursday that a 
failure of the trade talks in belgium would increase tensions among 
trading partners and could frustrate international cooperation on 
issues ranging from the gulf crisis to the environment 
the bush administration has a lot riding on the trade agreement 
us officials believe that removing trade barriers is the best 
hope for lowering huge us trade deficits by expanding overseas 
sales 
farmers in europe have staged noisy protests in recent weeks to 
assure their governments do not buckle under to pressure to lower 
farm subsidies

female grain inspectors will 
no longer board iranian ships here after the crew of one vessel 
refused to allow an agriculture canada official on board without a 
veil 
a federal official said recently that the action was the only 
solution to a sensitive cultural and religious issue but a womans 
organization decried the policy as reinforcing bias against women 
the canadian position when dealing with a country like iran 
which has certain culturalreligious practices is that we should 
be as nonconfrontational as much as possible said kingsley 
chong agriculture canada district manager 
whenever there is an iranian ship in port operational 
requirements permitting then we will avoid sending women aboard 
the policy arose after an incident on oct 16 when two canadian 
inspectors tried to board the iran jamal an iranian ship docked at 
a british columbian port one of the inspectors was a woman the 
crew barred her from boarding until she put on a veil 
here we have a case where canadian women are being forced into 
being culturally sensitive by being barred from doing their job 
said sunera thobani of the vancouver status of women committee 
it is clearly a case of discrimination against women 
canada shipped 256 million worth of grain to iran in 1989 
about 9 percent of all canadian grain shipments last year

the supreme court refused by a 72 vote sunday 
to give cable news network permission to broadcast tape recordings 
of conversations between panamas gen manuel noriega and his 
lawyers 
the court rejected an emergency request by cnn that was aimed at 
lifting a federal judges order forbidding the broadcasts until he 
could determine what the tapes disclose 
the emergency request had called the nov 8 order by us 
district judge william hoeveler in miami an unconstitutional 
prior restraint of free speech but only two justices 
thurgood marshall and sandra day oconnor agreed with that 
assessment 
voting against cnn were chief justice william h rehnquist and 
justices byron r white harry a blackmun john paul stevens 
antonin scalia anthony m kennedy and david h souter 
the justice department had joined with noriegas lawyers in 
opposing the request 
in addition to the emergency request the court also turned down 
a formal appeal filed by the cable network in a onesentence 
order 
cnn president tom johnson called the courts decision a loss 
of a battle in a continuing war against censorship 
johnson said the network would immediately turn the tapes in its 
possession over to judge hoeveler he said cnn is confident that 
after he reviews them he will decide on the merits to deny the 
prior restraint 
cnn is committed to establishing its full freedom to telecast 
newsworthy information to the american people and it will pursue 
this case vigorously in order to do so johnson said 
floyd abrams cnns attorney in the case said the courts 
decison has left an opening through which defense lawyers and 
prosecutors may try to muzzle news articles 
the refusal of the court to hear the case does seem to 
countenance brief prior restraints of a few days duration based on 
almost no showing of need at all by the courts abrams said 
noriegas defense attorney jon may said cnn had opened a 
pandoras box with its first amendment challenge 
we think its a correct ruling may said this is a case of 
the messenger shooting itself to whatever extent the media may 
complain this is a significant adverse decision cnn has only 
itself to blame 
in a dissenting opinion for himself and oconnor marshall said 
this case is of extraordinary consequence for freedom of the 
press 
our precedents make unmistakably clear that any prior 
restraint of expression comes to this court bearing a heavy 
presumption against its constitutional validity and that the 
proponent of this drastic remedy carries a heavy burden of showing 
justification for its imposition marshall said 
i do not see how the prior restraint imposed in this case can 
be reconciled with these teachings marshall said even more 
fundamentally if the lower courts in this case are correct in 
their remarkable conclusion that publication can be automatically 
restrained pending application of the demanding test established by 
a 1976 decision that severely limited the power of judges to 
impose such restraints then i think it is imperative that we 
reexamine the premises and operation of that decision 
jane kirtley executive director reporters committee for 
freedom of the press said she was stunned by the decision 
which she called truly unprecedented 
the fact that the court would be willing to tolerate a prior 
restraint in these circumstances signals a new era in first 
amendment jurisprudence kirtley said it will have a 
farreaching impact going beyond this case extending to many cases 
in state and federal courts around the country 
bruce sanford an attorney for the society of professional 
journalists said the courts decision is troublesome because it 
seems inconceivable that noriegas counsel would ever be able to 
prove that his right to a fair trial was in jeopardy because of the 
cnn tapes 
walt wurfel a spokesman for the national association of 
broadcasters said his group was very disappointed with the 
courts decision we view the lower courts order as prior 
restraint he said 
the bush administration saturday had urged the high court to 
leave intact hoevelers order solicitor general kenneth starr the 
governments topranking courtroom lawyer argued in written briefs 
that the restraining order was justified to give the judge time to 
determine whether seven tapes in cnns possession might interfere 
with noriegas ability to receive a fair trial 
noriega who is awaiting trial on charges of taking 46 million 
in payoffs to protect cocaine trade through panama is being held 
in a federal prison near miami federal prison authorities monitor 
and tape record all inmates telephone conversations except those 
between an inmates and their defense teams but the cnn tape 
recordings reportedly contain some conversations between the 
deposed panamanian leader and his defense lawyers 
sundays high court order issued without any explanatory 
opinion does not necessarily preclude the possibility that some 
day the court will rule that hoevelers order did violate cnns 
freespeech rights 
the court conceivably could have refused to help cnn because of 
some procedural reason the cable network might carry its legal 
battle back to the court at some later date 
but meanwhile cnn is under court order not to broadcast those 
portions of its tapes divulging noriegas conversations with his 
lawyers if those conversations are broadcast cnn could be cited 
with contempt of court and fined heavily 
the federal government lost a muchpublicized battle over a 
prior restraint in 1971 when the supreme court allowed the new york 
times and the washington post to publish the socalled pentagon 
papers detailing american involvement in vietnam 
in a key 1976 decision stemming from pretrial publicity in a 
nebraska murder case the court ruled that forbidding the news 
media from publishing or broadcasting information in its possession 
almost never can be justified 
the court in that decision called such prior restraints 
sometimes referred to as gag orders the least tolerable 
measures of assuring fair trials 
in seeking the prior restraint against cnn noriegas lawyers 
argued that broadcasting the tapes would poison their clients 
fairtrial rights in two ways through pretrial publicity and by 
compromising his relationship with his lawyers

iraqs offer to free all foreign hostages by march 
25 is just further cynical manipulation of innocent peoples 
lives us secretary of state james a baker iii said sunday 
iraqi president saddam hussein never should have taken them in 
the first place baker said 
he has it in his power to release them immediately as the 
united nations and indeed the international community are 
demanding and i think this is just further cynical manipulation of 
innocent peoples lives 
baker later met with soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze 
for two hours in anticipation of a meeting monday between president 
bush and soviet president mikhail gorbachev 
both officials declined afterward to say whether the soviet 
union would back a usproposed resolution in the un security 
council authorizing the use of force against iraq 
i cannot say that we have reached any decisions 
shevardnadze said tomorrow these discussions will continue at a 
presidential level its not so simple that we can just come out 
and announce something 
baker told reporters after the meeting to stay tuned and 
indicated an announcement could come monday night 
i have pointed out before the importance of maintaining to the 
extent we can a common approach and a common understanding with 
respect to this problem and were working on that he said 
baker commented on the iraqi announcement just before meeting 
british foreign secretary douglas hurd one of series of talks on 
the eve of a threeday european summit baker was seeking support 
for the us stance against hussein 
after his talks with baker hurd said saddams offer was just a 
further demonstration of the policy of the human shield in 
which iraq has placed hostages in strategic places to try to 
discourage an attack 
why doesnt he let them go this week hurd said of saddam 
and the hostages 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said the 
announcement appeared deliberately timed by saddam as an effort to 
divert attention from president bushs planned thanksgiving visit 
with troops in the persian gulf region 
he saddam does it all the time fitzwater said referring 
to other earlier gestures by saddam in freeing foreigners we 
want all the hostages released 
earlier baker said the united states was not sure whether iraq 
is armed with highly accurate sovietmade ss12 missiles capable of 
carrying chemical warheads 
we would be concerned about that if it is confirmed baker 
told reporters after talks with french foreign minister roland 
dumas 
as of yet it has not been confirmed it is something we are 
inquiring into baker said 
the washington post reported friday that a western diplomat in 
baghdad reported that the soviets had given iraq some of the ss12 
mediumrange missiles the diplomat said he did not know how many 
missiles were sent or when they were sent 
baker also discussed a possible un resolution with the foreign 
ministers of romania and finland both current members of the 
security council

a landmark arms treaty cutting nonnuclear 
forces in europe is far from the final step in disarmament but it 
offers one over arching reward the end to fear of a massive 
surprise ground attack 
it also may open the way for the eventual elimination of us 
and soviet nuclear weapons from europe some analysts believe 
although that issue is strongly debated 
the conventional forces in europe or cfe treaty scheduled to 
be signed monday in paris alters the military balance in europe 
mainly by erasing moscows ability to mass huge numbers of tanks 
and other heavy armor in central europe 
it is the definitive end of the surprise attack option for 
the soviets said jonathan dean a former us representative to 
eastwest conventional arms negotiations 
nato and warsaw pact negotiators in vienna initialed the 
document on sunday ending 20 months of talks 
from the start of the cold war and the creation first of nato in 
1949 and then the sovietled warsaw pact alliance the military 
landscape of western europe has been dominated by fear of a bolt 
from the blue communistbloc ground assault 
to eliminate that perceived threat the cfe treaty limiting 
the weapons of 22 countries and covering european territory from 
the atlantic ocean to the ural mountains requires the soviets to 
drastically reduce their forces including 
tanks from about 41000 before the treaty negotiations began 
in 1989 to 13150 moscow already has reduced its tank holdings in 
the territory covered by the treaty to about 21000 mainly by 
moving its best models east as replacements for older ones 
the allowable number tanks for all of eastern europe will be 
20000 the united states and its nato allies also will be allowed 
20000 tanks that will require a cut of about 4000 for nato 
although more than 1000 of the topoftheline american m1a1 
tanks already are being moved from europe to saudi arabia 
armored combat vehicles from the 32300 now deployed by the 
soviets to 30000 nato will not have to make any cuts in this 
category which includes such warfighting machinery as the us 
bradley fighting vehicle used to move infantry protect maneuvering 
tanks and help consolidate gains in an offensive 
artillery pieces providing the essential firepower for a 
combat operation from about 52000 for the soviets before the cfe 
negotiations began to 13175 the soviets already have reduced to 
18300 nato will stay at its current level of 18500 
those three weapon categories tanks armored combat vehicles 
and artillery are especially important to the military balance in 
europe because they form the core of nonnuclear offensive 
capability for both the soviets and nato 
once the treaty is implemented neither side will be able to 
marshal enough firepower within striking range of the other to 
launch a land invasion without setting off warning bells months or 
even years in advance analysts say 
because most of the cuts will be made by the soviets no 
significant cost savings will be felt immediately by the nato 
countries according to the institute for defense and disarmament 
studies a research group based at brookline mass 
the treaty does not include cuts in military personnel in 
europe a ussoviet agreement last february to limit each side to 
195000 foreign troops in central europe plus an additional 30000 
us troops elsewhere in europe has been abandoned the plan was 
overtaken by events including the soviets declared intent to 
withdraw all their forces from central europe within four years 
the newly unified germanys agreement to limit the size of its 
armed forces and the dissolution of the warsaw pact as a coherent 
military force 
just last month washington announced it would unilaterally 
withdraw 40000 troops from western europe and close some of its 
bases there then on nov 8 president bush ordered about 100000 
us army combat forces from europe to saudi arabia as 
reinforcements against iraq that cuts us army strength in europe 
by onehalf although it was presumed that some of those troops 
would later return to europe 
most of the weapons to be withdrawn from europe under the cfe 
treaty will be destroyed although the treaty permits some to be 
converted to nonmilitary or military support purposes 
neither the soviets and their warsaw pact partners nor the 
united states and its nato allies will be required to destroy any 
attack helicopters limited by the treaty those in excess of the 
2000 permitted by the treaty can be converted to noncombat roles 
for other combat aircraft the soviets will be required to 
eliminate about onethird of their inventory in the area covered by 
the treaty no cuts are required of the nato countries because they 
already are well below the treaty limit of 6800 combat aircraft

two crewmen from a factory trawler were 
in federal custody sunday facing assault charges after a shipboard 
riot over unpaid wages 
the skipper and the chief engineer of the 205foot arctic hero 
barricaded themselves inside the wheelhouse and engine room 
respectively after about seven of the 45 crew members rampaged 
through the vessel friday coast guard and fbi officials said 
james r smith jr 26 and reginald collins 28 both of 
seattle were being held in the unalaska department of public 
safety jail in unalaska adjacent to dutch harbor in the aleutian 
islands the fbi said they were to be brought here for arraignment 
on the federal charges 
the incident occurred in international waters in the bering sea 
100 miles west of dutch harbor which is 800 miles southwest of

the coast guard intercepted the vessel friday after the captain 
called for help the arctic hero was escorted to dutch harbor 
where it was boarded saturday by fbi coast guard and national

it has been more than 25 years since zero mostel 
first trudged across the stage of the imperial theater as tevye the 
philosophical milkman in fiddler on the roof 
there have been a lot of tevyes since then from herschel 
bernardi to jan peerce but the role has been coopted in recent 
years by topol the israeliborn actor who starred in the london 
production of the musical as well as the movie version 
now after a long national tour topol has arrived on broadway 
where fiddler opened sunday at the gershwin theater its no 
surprise to report that star and show both hold up well in fact 
this is a glorious revival with topol delivering a genuine star 
turn and the material hasnt grown old at all 
fiddler on the roof was the last great musical in the 
rodgers and hammerstein tradition a style ramph developed and 
perfected in the 1940s with such classic shows as oklahoma 
carousel and south pacific 
fiddler which originally opened in new york in september 
1964 has that same extraordinary integration of story and song 
there is not a wasted moment in the musical 
songs music by jerry bock and lyrics by sheldon harnick are 
used to explain character or advance plot the story which joseph 
stein artfully adapted from the stories of sholom aleichem serves 
as a framework for those musical numbers and everything was tied 
together perfectly by jerome robbins whose original direction and 
choreography have been faithfully reproduced here by ruth mitchell 
and sammy dallas bayes 
there quite simply isnt a better opening scene in the american 
musical theater in that one song tradition the musicals 
underlying theme the ties that bind together the small jewish 
community in the turnofthecentury russian village of anatevka 
are brilliantly stated 
the story of how those ties start to unravel torn apart by 
personal social and political upheavals are brilliantly 
delineated by bock harnick stein and especially robbins 
topols tevye is more aristocratic than mostels milkman he has 
a commanding voice full and deep and he moves with an authority 
that makes the eventual destruction of his world and the dispersal 
of his family especially poignant yet topol doesnt miss a moment 
of the shows humor never forgetting the mans indecisiveness 
whether he is arguing with his wife or with god 
the dances remain firstrate particularly teyves dream 
sequence in which motel the tailor is chosen as the husband for his 
oldest daughter 
marcia lewis makes a wonderful golde shrewish yet ultimately 
sympathetic there are some sharp cameos particularly ruth jaroslow 
as the busybody matchmaker mark zeller as the butcher lazar wolf 
and tia riebling as the sweetvoiced hodel 
boris aronsons original designs with their echoes of marc 
chagall paintings remain as evocative as ever particularly 
teyves house which spins around the large stage and opens 
gracefully to reveal its homespun interior to the audience 
at one of the final preview performances the audience was swept 
up into the show as soon as the curtain rose many of them began 
humming along with the score they knew what to expect and this 
revival delivers it 
the one surprise may be that this fiddler on the roof turns 
out to be as good as they remember the musical to be

for two years animal trainer gunther 
gebelwilliams has been bidding farewell in what has arguably been 
one of the longest exits in entertainment history

the top opposition party is ending its 
fourmonthold boycott of parliament the party leader announced 
monday 
kim daejung head of the largest opposition party for peace and 
democracy said the partys 70 national legislators would take 
their seats in the national assembly later in the day 
the other opposition party in parliament the splinter 
democratic party said members had not decided whether to follow 
suit that party has eight legislators 
there are numerous tasks and issues waiting to be resolved 
kim told a news conference he said rival political leaders had 
reached agreement on ending the boycott including a key pledge to 
hold local elections in 1991 
if the regime fails to fulfill its promise on all the issues 
affecting peoples lives it should be prepared to resign kim 
said 
the 78 opposition members of the 299member parliament resigned 
en masse in july charging president roh taewoos governing 
democratic liberal party with railroading bills and reneging on 
democratic reform 
the boycott was effectively ended over the weekend after rival 
political leaders reached agreement on holding the local elections 
south korea has not had local elections since they were 
abolished by an authoritarian regime 30 years ago 
the opposition had also demanded the cancellation of governing 
party plans to change south koreas system of government from 
presidential to parliamentary critics said it was a ploy by the 
governing party to prolong control of power 
that matter was settled earlier this month after a rival faction 
within the governing party revolted against the president and

penny a gallon over the past two weeks the biggest drop 
nationwide since the persian gulf crisis began according to a 
survey released sunday 
prices dropped for all grades except leaded regular at full 
service pumps the lundberg survey of 13500 stations found the 
survey compared prices nov 16 with those of nov 2 when the 
survey was last conducted 
the national average for all grades of gasoline was 14598 
cents a drop of about 94 cent a gallon since nov 2 
trilby lundberg who directs the survey attributed the drop to 
recent declines in wholesale prices

13510 cents for regular unleaded 15119 cents for premium 
unleaded and 13161 cents for regular leaded 
averages at fullservice stations were 15776 cents for regular

a blood test has been devised to help 
doctors diagnose chronic fatigue syndrome a flulike illness some 
have dubbed yuppie flu a scientist said sunday 
dr jay levy of san francisco announced the development at a 
national conference on the disease here he predicted the 
mysterious illness will be the disease of the 90s as the 
public and the medical community become more aware of it 
it takes about decade before the public wakes up and realizes 
that this is not going to go away levy said 
the weekend conference titled unraveling the mystery drew 
400 people including researchers and people afflicted with the 
ailment 
chronic fatigue syndrome is characterized by fatigue 
exhaustion joint and muscle aches and an array of other problems 
that persist for more than six months and often for years 
tens of thousands of americans believe they have chronic fatigue 
syndrome although the extent of it is uncertain some researchers 
believe the disease may be centuries old and its just been 
misdiagnosed all this time 
because it has been widely reported among welleducated women in 
their 30s and 40s the syndrome was dubbed yuppie flu 
an effort to discover how widespread it is an interagency 
coordinating commmittee has been formed said dr walter gunn a 
chronic fatigue syndrome researcher at the centers for disease 
control in atlanta 
levy an aids researcher at the university of california at san 
francisco led a group that developed a blood test for the disease 
levy said his team was unable to find one virus that caused the 
illness some research has linked the syndrome to a retrovirus one 
of the family of viruses that causes aids 
because of the immune profile of these patients we believe 
there has been an infection by some agent though this agent may no 
longer be in the body levy said or it may be hidden it 
cannot as yet be identified 
in any case he said the immune system of chronic fatigue 
patients is activated for months or years creating high levels of 
a particular white blood cell caled the cd8plus cytotoxic t cell 
the persistence of the white blood cell causes symptoms of a 
viral infection levy said 
the cd8plus cytotoxic cells appear to be the major cell type 
activated in the disease a signature unique to chronic fatigue 
syndrome levy said so the blood test checks for high levels of 
those cells 
this is a way to distinguish those with fatigue alone from 
those with an immune reaction that causes chronic fatigue he 
said 
levy said the level of the white blood cells along with an 
examination of the patients medical history could determine 
whether a patient is suffering from the syndrome 
levy and other researchers suggested the syndrome be renamed 
chronic immune activation syndrome to reflect their findings

president bush on sunday began a series of meetings 
with allied leaders aimed at solidifying support for his persian 
gulf policies he urged german chancellor helmut kohl to take a 
more active role in confronting iraqs challenges to peace and 
freedom 
during a raindrenched half day in germany kohl cautioned bush 
against pursuing a military solution before exhausting all avenues 
of negotiation bush said he too would like to see a peaceful 
solution to the crisis 
the president then traveled to paris for a 34nation summit of 
north american and european nations it was the third stop on an 
eightday trip highlighted by the signing monday of a conventional 
forces treaty with the soviet union and thanksgiving dinner with 
us troops in saudi arabia 
french president francois mitterrand hosted bush for sunday 
dinner and the iraqi invasion of kuwait was high on the agenda 
mitterrand like kohl is stressing a nonilitary outcome to the 
persian gulf crisis 
during the 45minute dinner bush and mitterrand agreed that 
it is necessary to pursue and strengthen the action taken in the 
framework of the un security council mitterrand spokesman 
hubert vedrine said 
in rome meanwhile soviet president mikhail s gorbachev said 
new ideas have emerged to avert a war in the persian gulf i 
am convinced that we will succeed in finding a way out of this deep 
crisis he said 
gorbachev did not elaborate 
bush and gorbachev planned to meet over breakfast tuesday 
 
bush is seeking to build support for a united nations resolution 
authorizing military action to drive iraqs saddam hussein from 
kuwait so far the soviets have not agreed 
secretary of state james a baker iii and soviet foreign 
minister eduard shevardnadze both declined to say after meeting 
sunday if the soviets would support the usproposed resolution on 
using force against iraq 
i cannot say that we have reached any decisions 
shevardnadze said tomorrow these discussions will continue at a 
presidential level its not so simple that we can just come out 
and announce something 
baker told reporters after the meeting to stay tuned and 
indicated an announcement could come monday night 
i have pointed out before the importance of maintaining to the 
extent we can a common approach and a common understanding with 
respect to this problem and were working on that he said 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater shrugged off iraqs 
announcement that it would release the hostages it has been 
holding letting them go in groups between christmas and march 25 
we want all the hostages released fitzwater said in paris 
he saddam does it all the time the spokesman added 
referring to other earlier gestures by saddam in freeing 
foreigners 
fitzwater called the saddam offer to release hostages after 
christmas another cynical attempt by him to manipulate families 
hopes and fears 
he claimed the announcement appeared deliberately timed by 
saddam as an effort to divert attention from bushs planned 
thanksgiving visit with troops in the persian gulf region 
baker said saddam never should have taken them in the first 
place 
bush landed early sunday evening at orly airport in paris after 
visiting kohls home region of oggersheim 
although bush and kohl sought to gloss over their differences 
the two clearly came down on different sides of the issue of using 
force in the persian gulf 
were not ruling out any options were not ruling any options 
in bush said at a joint news conference with kohl outside the 
german leaders home in this suburb of the industrial city of 
ludwigshafen 
but kohl urged that everything be exhausted that there is to 
exhaust with negotiations 
whoever believes the problem can be solved militarily must 
consider not only the mission but the end of the whole 
undertaking kohl said in a german radio interview aired shortly 
after bush arrived 
bush asked whether kohl had delivered a similar warning during 
their private session said he made very clear hed like to see 
a peaceful resolution to this question and so would i 
clearly anybody that takes a look at the map and understands 
the realities of the world knows that this united germany is and 
will be a tremendous force for peace and certainly for economic 
good in the world bush said 
the bush administration is looking to germany to do more in the 
usled effort to drive saddam from kuwait 
just as a new europe must look beyond its borders so too must 
a united germany take responsibility for leadership in our 
commonwealth of nations bush said in remarks prepared for a 
rainshortened speech in the nearby 11th century cathedral town of 
speyer 
although the driving rainstorm forced bush to conclude his 
speech before he got to the part on the persian gulf white house 
aides said the president stood by the remarks 
under pressure from the united states and other allies kohl has 
agreed to provide about 2 billion to assist frontline nations 
like turkey and jordan whose economies are battered by the economic 
boycott of iraq 
but citing constitutional barriers germany has not sent any 
troops 
kohl with national elections set for next week may have been 
emphasizing his distaste for military action for domestic political 
purposes but white house aides traveling with bush privately 
voiced disappointment with his remarks particularly coming during 
the presidents visit 
rain dogged bush throughout his sixhour visit to germany and 
he and kohl were drenched as they stood on an uncovered raised 
wooden platform in the town square of speyer 
i see the rains are coming so i will conclude mercifully 
bush told his audience of 1500 many of them huddled under 
umbrellas the rain also prompted kohl to cut short a joint news 
conference later in the day but not before he put in a pitch for 
us investment in what used to be east germany 
despite their differences on the persian gulf bush praised kohl 
as the man who united germany for his part kohl called bush 
one of the great architects of how europe looks today 
earlier as he flew to germany from prague czechoslovakia bush 
called gorbachevs plan to dump his prime minister and give himself 
more power very interesting 
gorbachev on saturday won tentative approval from soviet 
lawmakers for a radical reorganization of the executive branch that 
will result in the dismissal of prime minister nikolai ryzhkov 
well have a chance to talk to mr gorbachev about all of 
that bush told reporters aboard air force one 
bush and gorbachev will be among nato and warsaw pact leaders 
signing a historic treaty slashing nonnuclear weapons in europe 
the two superpower leaders will also have a private breakfast on 
tuesday 
bush said the arms treaty which was initiated sunday in vienna 
by nato and warsaw pact negotiatiors seems to be overshadowed by 
whats happening in the gulf but it is a significant milestone

police and troops armed with machineguns on sunday cleared sections 
of a strategic jungle road blocked 
for more than two weeks by protesters supporting the former contra 
rebels 
in a communique broadcast on radio and television late saturday 
president violeta chamorro said she had ordered the army to clear 
the rama road which connects the eastern caribbean coast with 
managua and western nicaragua 
the statement read by the information minister danilo lacayo 
indicated the government planned a crackdown on the protests that 
have left 24 people dead in the south and central regions of the 
country 
in her communique mrs chamorro also accused former contra 
leader aristides sanchez herdocia of plotting the recent protests 
she said he had orchestrated a broad plan against peace 
sanchez who is under arrest in managua was a director of the 
usbacked nicaraguan resistance that battled the former leftist 
sandinista government for nine years 
vice president virgilio godoy who is at odds with mrs 
chamorro met with 18 protesting mayors sunday and said the 
government should be responding to the protesters with political 
answers not arrests 
the government should seek a way to satisfy the popular 
demands without showing it is humiliated or that it is losing 
authority godoy told the mayors 
he called their actions a beautiful movement of civic 
patriotic and peaceful protest with a popular base he added that 
the government crackdown was intended to simplify and hide the 
responsibility of seeking solutions to the problems 
about 200 soldiers and police backed by helicopters on sunday 
were tearing down barricades on the strategic 200milelong 
highway where at least 13 barriers had been erected 
most of the troops were armed with automatic weapons and some 
rode in armored cars the operation was peaceful reporters at the 
scene said 
in her statement mrs chamorro said faced with the existence 
of this dangerous plan and the need to reestablish free 
transportation along the rama highway the government ordered 
the forces of public order to normalize transit with the 
total clearing of all of the highway 
the protesters want the government to fulfill promises of land 
and aid made to the former rebels they also want members of the 
sandinista opposition removed from key military and police posts 
the sandinistas still control security in nicargua despite 
losing a feb 25 election to mrs chamorro who took office in 
april rebels laid down their weapons in return for the promises of 
assistance 
but by the governments own figures barely 3000 of the 20000 
rebels have received land 
in her communique mrs chamorro said sanchez had tried to 
manipulate the demands of the demobilized rebels with the intention 
of destabilizing the country she did not elaborate on her 
allegations 
on saturday a convoy of armored cars police patrols and 
antiriot vehicles rolled into santo tomas about 75 miles east of 
managua to dismantle the barricades they started work on saturday 
afternoon 
rosa jimenez de farjardo owner of a boarding house in santo 
tomas said the convoy apparently met with no resistence 
antiriot police used tear gas thursday to dislodge a group of 
protesters on a stretch of road between juigalpa and santo tomas 
town mayors in eastern and southeastern nicaragua backed by 
former contra rebels launched the protest movement nov 1 to 
demand that mrs chamorros administration break all ties with the 
leftist sandinistas 
they demand the firing of the sandinista army chief gen 
humberto ortega they also have asked for the replacement of the 
minister of the presidency antoio lacayo and interior minister 
carlos hurtado 
protesters have also taken over churches and public buildings 
eighteen mayors have formed a committee to save democracy to 
back the demands as many as 75 out of nicaraguas 147 mayors are 
said to be supporting them they have been negotiating over the 
demands with the government 
if we dont arrive at a satisfactory agreement we will meet 
with all the mayors of the country to find a more energetic 
posture said armando incer a leader of the protest movement

iraq promised sunday to release its remaining foreign hostages 
over three months starting on christmas unless something mars the 
atmosphere of peace president bush said he hoped for peace but 
left open the prospect of war 
there has been speculation that any military move to drive iraq 
out of kuwait would take place in the first several months of the 
year and the iraqi offer to free the hostages during that time 
appeared aimed at staving off such a strike 
in a move meant to underscore us readiness for war american 
troops tried to stage a fullscale practice assault on a stretch of 
saudi beach on sunday high winds and heavy seas however 
prevented hovercraft from making landings in more limited 
maneuvers troops came ashore by helicopter while us and british 
warplanes provided simulated air cover 
thousands of foreigners were stranded by iraqs aug 2 invasion 
of kuwait but hundreds have since been selectively released by the 
baghdad government 
the latest mass departure was sunday when 136 people flew into 
london from iraq early monday on a usarranged flight officials 
at the us embassy in baghdad said the passengers included 75 
americans many of them wives and children of kuwaiti nationals 
i stayed as long as i could said a woman from san clemente 
calif who would not give her name kuwait went from the top to 
total destruction 
the official iraqi news agency said the decision to free the 
rest of the hostages came at a meeting presided over by saddam the 
foreign guests as it calls the captives would be allowed to 
leave beginning dec 25 it said 
the last batch would leave the iraqi territories on march 
25 unless something would take place that mars the atmosphere of 
peace said the news agency 
the white house dismissed the move as another ploy by saddam 
and repeated its demand that all the captives be unconditionally 
freed 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater in paris with the 
president called the move a cynical attempt to manipulate 
families hopes and fears 
western governments in the past have denounced efforts by saddam 
to use the captives as leverage in the gulf crisis 
bush in germany en route to paris conferred with chancellor 
helmut kohl about the antiiraq alliance which has assembled tens 
of thousands of troops in the gulf region 
bush called on the german leader to help keep the coalition 
together kohl in a radio interview underscored the need to do 
everything possible to resolve the gulf crisis diplomatically 
before resorting to force 
although bush has spoken in strong terms about the possibility 
of a military strike he played down any differences of opinion 
were not ruling out any options were not ruling any options 
in he said 
bush and soviet president mikhail s gorbachev were to join 
leaders of 20 other nations in paris signing a conventional forces 
treaty that reduces troop and arms levels in europe from paris 
bush was flying to the mideast and planned to spend thanksgiving 
with us soldiers in the gulf region 
gorbachev who met with pope john paul ii at the vatican before 
leaving for paris said he believes there is a peaceful way out of 
the gulf crisis 
i am convinced that we will succeed in finding a way out of 
this deep crisis gorbachev said speaking in russian that was 
translated into italian the vatican said the pontiff in the 
meeting with gorbachev expressed hopes that war could be avoided 
secretary of state james a baker iii meanwhile conferred with 
french foreign minister roland dumas about a potential un 
resolution authorizing force against iraq 
dumas repeated the french position that the un economic 
embargo is the best way to force iraq to relinquish kuwait baker 
said such views did not mean the coalition was divided 
let me suggest to you that im not aware of any countries 
going back to the very beginning of this crisis who have taken the 
position under any and all circumstances that the option of force 
should be ruled out baker told reporters 
the us amphibious landing exercise that was canceled sunday 
was to have been the centerpiece of the sixday imminent thunder 
maneuvers but if it had been war instead of practice the 
amphibious landing would have gone ahead despite high winds and 
heavy seas us military officials said 
one of the landing craft was launched from the uss gunston hall 
but it wallowed in seas of up to 10 feet the exercise was 
rescheduled for monday 
the maneuvers were held about 25 miles off the saudi coast 100 
miles south of the kuwaiti border iraq had denounced the exercises 
as provocative after reports they would be held as close as 10 
miles from kuwait 
in other developments

relatives of hostages not to accept an iraqi invitation to visit 
but william stevenson of panama city fla whose brother john is a 
captive told reporters at the amman airport this is strictly a 
family business

whether its handling complaints from irate 
shoppers or pampering hotel guests customer service has become a 
top priority for most american executives according to a poll 
released sunday 
about half the customers have noticed according to the poll 
the poll commissioned by john hancock financial services and 
conducted by louis harris and associates inc surveyed both 
consumers and senior executives from serviceoriented businesses 
such as retailers utilities and financial services companies 
the poll found the vast majority of executives placed a premium 
on quality customer service but 50 percent of the consumers said 
service is improving 
that number was the highest it has been in the 19 years the 
harris group has surveyed attitudes on service 
fortyfive percent of the customers polled however still feel 
quality is declining moreover 51 percent reported declining 
personal attention from service providers and 60 percent perceived 
declining value for the money they spend 
there is a big gap there said stephen l brown president 
of hancock you have to assume the customer is always right in 
this case 
the poll also asked the public to rank various service 
industries on how well they respond to customer complaints from 
top to bottom they were retailers 
leisureentertainmenthospitality banks telecommunications 
utilities health care other financial institutions and insurance 
companies 
brown whose company specializes in insurance said he was not 
surprised by the low ranking of his industry 
insurance is a complex product he said it lends itself 
to misunderstanding its difficult to deliver the service people 
expect 
four out of five senior executives said quality service can help 
increase their market share and profitability and would encourage 
customers to buy other products and services from their companies 
also 95 percent of the executives have made quality service an 
explicit part of their business plan and 91 percent said they 
have taken steps to monitor quality service and customer 
satisfaction 
some executives have been able to drive this message down to 
every level of their organizations but i dont think its been 
done at a lot of companies brown said 
the survey questioned 500 executives and 1250 consumers around 
the country in july and august the poll had a margin of error of 
plus or minus 3 percent

the justice deprtment has not given the 
investigation and prosecution of fraud in the multibillion dollar 
savings and loan scandal the priority the public demands a house 
panel concluded in a report released sunday 
the government operations subcommittee on commerce consumer and 
monetary affairs said the department repeatedly has misled congress 
over the past two years about funding needed to catch and jail 
savings and loan crooks 
in addition the report said the department has failed to 
address issues that have hampered investigation and prosecution of 
savings and loan fraud such as the fbis lack of document subpoena 
authority and inadequate pay for fbi agents and prosecutors 
the justice departments rhetoric concerning its priorities 
has not matched its willingness to address a number of issues 
which continue to adversely affect the us governments ability to 
apply the criminal justice system to culpable individuals rep 
doug barnard dga chairman of the subcommittee said in a 
statement 
i have great difficulty in accepting that a person who commits 
substantial fraud against a sampl or bank may completely escape 
investigation and prosecution if that person committed the offense 
in most areas of the united states that did not receive enough 
additional resources he said 
doug tillett a spokesman for the justice department said he 
could not comment on the report until the department has a chance 
to review it 
but he noted that in the past 13 months 519 individuals have 
been charged in major savings and loan fraud cases those 
involving losses of 100000 or more and 355 have been convicted 
congress authorized 75 million in the 1989 savings and loan 
bailout legislation to beef up prosecution of individuals who 
looted thrift institutions but the administration sought and 
congress appropriated only 50 million for fiscal 1990 
in its fiscal 1991 budget the administration initially sought 
to increase that allocation only by 18 million but after 
complaints from congress president bush announced last june he 
wanted to double the 50 million in fiscal 1991 
congress ultimately appropriated 176 million to the justice 
department and the internal revenue service for sampl fraud 
investigation and prosecution during the fiscal year that began 
oct 1 
but even with the extra money according to barnards 
subcommittee the fbi still is 8 million short of what it needs to 
hire the agents and support staff its division offices requested in 
1989 for sampl fraud enforcement and 26 million short of what it 
needs to deal with a backlog of more than 21000 inactive sampl 
cases 
these past failures to ask for sufficient funds have resulted 
in more delays more stale cases and many cases which may not be 
brought because of statute of limitations problems or fading 
memories the report said 
the house subcommittee recommended that federal bank regulatory 
agencies make 140 to 180 examiners and attorneys available within 
the next four months to help the fbi and federal prosecutors 
eliminate the backlog of financial fraud cases 
the panel also recommended that congress upgrade the pay of 
federal law enforcement agents and prosecutors to reduce the rapid 
personnel turnover that is seriously delaying and negatively 
impacting investigation and prosecution of financial fraud 
especially in new york and california 
in another area the subcommittee said congress should grant the 
fbi the authority to subpoena documents related to savings and loan 
fraud currently federal prosecutors must impanel a grand jury to 
issue a subpoena during an ongoing investigation each time the fbi 
requires documents 
while the fbi already has document subpoena authority in drug 
cases and has been seeking similar authority in sampl fraud cases 
since 1988 the report said opposition from key federal prosecutors 
apparently has kept the justice department from seeking the 
appropriate legislation
