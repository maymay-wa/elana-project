a 50000gallon oil slick from two 
collisionruptured barges in galveston bay moved away from shore 
sunday as cleanup crews tried to deflect the 5milelong patch from 
sensitive marshlands the coast guard said 
both barges were damaged saturday in a collision with the 
liberian oil tanker shinoussa in the houston ship channel one 
barge nearly sank and the other was listing 
the barges were among three being towed by the tugboat chandy n 
the tug was undamaged and no injuries were reported 
crews worked sunday to contain the spilling oil as the ship 
channel remained closed backing up several vessels for the second 
time in a week 
oil leaking from the nearly sunken barge bubbled to the waters 
surface while oil spilling from the other vessel was mostly 
trapped by absorbent pads 
in addition to the main slick a smaller patch developed near 
the accident site said coast guard capt thomas greene 
its nothing significant compared to the patch in the north 
greene said however the new patch was about a mile from a beach 
south of the accident site 
coast guard cmdr frank whipple said officials flew over the 
slick sunday afternoon its in the same general area where it 
was this morning and thats good news whipple said 
our concern right now is mainly the oil in the water and 
keeping it out of the sensitive areas and the barge thats leaking 
securing it so that it stops leaking oil he added 
the patchy slick drifted northnortheast earlier sunday further 
into the larger part of the bay but also on a possible path towards 
trinity bay which has several sensitive estuaries coast guard 
petty officer larry meredith said 
the slick which starts about two miles from the accident site 
changed to a southerly course as currents changed sunday afternoon 
greene said 
the slick is going to keep oscillating back and forth each 
time farther and farther north and south with the tides greene 
said 
coast guard petty officer dennis schaefer said salvage crews 
were working to right the nearly sunken barge while tugboats 
surrounded the second barge to keep it afloat 
booms were placed around both barges to contain spilling oil 
together the two were carrying about 700000 gallons of catfeed 
oil similar to a no 5 heavy crude used in refining greene said 
he said crews also placed about 2500 feet of boom at the 
slicks leading edge 
we hope to encircle the patch and hold it there so they can 
get skimmers out there to suck it before it hits land greene 
said 
apex reampt inc a st louisbased towing firm owns the tug and 
barges and was working with salvage contractor tampt marine of 
galveston on the cleanup schaefer said 
salvage crews had planned to transfer the fuel from the barges 
to other vessels sunday evening but coast guard petty officer gene 
maestas said the transfer process would not begin before monday 
divers were expected to examine the almost sunken barge monday 
to determine the best way to transfer the oil maestas said 
the third barge carrying 20000 barrels of fuel was moved up 
the ship channel schaefer said 
the 601foot tanker carrying 29400 metric tons of jet fuel 
remained anchored schaefer said although the collision left a 
gash in its hull the vessel didnt leak because of its double 
hull the 27793ton shinoussa was built this year he said 
texas water commission chairman bj buck wynne iii said 
there was some difficulty getting booms in place in the bay because 
of the shallows surrounding the channel 
its in the open bay and were quite concerned about that 
although this is not a relatively big spill wynne said there 
are some very sensitive estuary areas in galveston bay and they 
could be threatened 
although more oil was spilled from the norwegian supertanker 
mega borg last month the latest accident could be more serious 
because of the heavier oil and the proximity to marshlands wynne 
said 
our sensitive areas are behind the barrier islands where this 
spill is wynne said 
some thought has been given to employing oileating bacteria 
which were used experimentally to clean up the mega borg spill oil 
and were found to have done so without hurting the environment 
wynne said 
but the results of that bioremediation experiment havent been 
fully analyzed so it might not be prudent to use the microbes to 
clean the galveston bay spill he said 
houston audubon society president gary clark said 75 to 100 
species of texas birds including egrets herons and terns nest 
around the bay he said the worst scenarios would be for oil to 
pollute armand bayou which he called the only pristine tributary 
left in texas 
were going to have to do a lot of hoping clark said 
the mega borg which was transferring oil to a smaller vessel 
about 57 miles off galveston was rocked by a series of explosions 
june 8 and spilled 39 million gallons of light angolan crude into 
the gulf of mexico four crewmen were killed in the blast and 17 
were injured cleanup crews worked in the area for more than two 
weeks to contain the spill

six months after the leaning tower was closed 
to the public work to keep it from toppling has yet to begin and 
the mayor of the touristabandoned city is appealing to rome for 
help 
the towers 293 steps to the top were last climbed on jan 7 
when the mayor reluctantly locked the wooden doors to the 180foot 
tower with a steel key and expressed hope work would begun soon so 
the monument can reopen 
since then the mayors office has a new occupant and the city 
has been losing hundreds of thousands of dollars in entrance fees 
the monument attracts some 800000 tourists a year who pay 335 
apiece to climb the spiral staircase for a disorientating view of 
the tuscan city 
some tourists of course still pass through pisa but with the 
tower closed the city is less appealing 
newly elected mayor sergio cortopassi said hes appealing to 
premier giulio andreotti in hopes of spurring a quick start to 
work italian newspapers reported sunday 
the reports said cortopassi wants the government to convene a 
meeting on the situation in the next two weeks 
cortopassis predecessor signed a order in december authorizing 
closure but experts have yet to get moving on a plan to stop the 
tower from leaning further parliament hasnt yet appropriated the 
400 million experts estimate the work will cost 
the tower began to lean almost immediately after bonnano pisano 
began work on it in 1173 the ground beneath it shifted it now 
leans some 13 feet off perpendicular 
at least once a year italian experts announce new findings that 
the tower has leaned some more usually a couple a millimeters at 
this rate the tower will eventually topple experts say but even 
without intervention it should stand at least 100 years 
one plan under consideration calls for a wheelshaped support to 
be planted around the base of the tower and connected by spokes to 
the marble foundation although experts disagree on which is the 
best strategy all say the tower must keep its famous lean

former chancellor bruno kreisky 
austrias most popular postwar political leader and an architect of 
its policy of neutrality died sunday he was 79 
kreisky was being treated at lainz hospital for a heart 
condition and had been in critical condition doctors said 
a jew kreisky was forced to flee austria from the nazis but 
returned to become its longestserving chancellor 
during his tenure as chancellor from 1970 to 1983 he took 
advantage of austrias position as a neutral country on the border 
between east and west to carve a mediating role that gave his 
nation prominence 
he drew criticism abroad especially from israel for his middle 
east policies and his ties to plo chief yasser arafat as well as 
for receiving libyan leader moammar gadhafi and freeing arab 
terrorists who staged a 1975 attack on opecs vienna headquarters 
however he was also widely respected in europe as one of the 
leading postwar social democrats along with west germanys willy 
brandt and swedens olof palme 
born on jan 22 1911 the son of a wealthy industrialist 
kreisksy was forced to leave vienna in 1938 after the nazis annexed 
austria to germany 
he went to sweden where he first met fellow exile brandt and 
married vera fuerst 
kreisky returned to vienna in 1949 and entered the government in 
1953 as state secretary in the foreign ministry he served as 
foreign minister from 1959 to 1966 and became chancellor in 1970 
it was the socialists failure to win a clear majority in 1983 
elections that led kreisky to step down and hand over the party 
leadership 
foreign policy was kreiskys passion 
a longtime champion of eastwest detente he espoused the idea 
of a common europe long before soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev 
coined his phrase of a common european house 
there will only be a europe when we accept that europe is 
everywhere in the west and in the east as well as in the middle 
he said in 1975 
kreisky sought improved relations with austrias then communist 
neighbors but he did not shy away from criticizing human rights 
violations in the soviet bloc and helped establish austrias 
liberal policy of granting asylum to tens of thousands of refugees 
from eastern europe 
it was kreiskys proarab stance and friendly policy toward the 
palestine liberation organization however that drew the most 
attention abroad and brought him into bitter conflict with former 
israeli prime minister menachem begin 
kreiskys embrace with arafat at the vienna airport in 1979 
stunned many austrians and drew sharply worded commentaries in 
israel and elsewhere 
he once said i am a friend of the arabs not with motives 
like laurence of arabia as a socialist i am a friend of every 
people also those in the middle east whether arabs israelis or 
kurds i am for people carrying out their differences in peace 
he also provoked outrage in the west in 1982 when he received 
gadhafi 
in 1978 kreisky suffered a strong defeat when austrians voted 
in a national referendum to reject nuclear power 
in 1986 after indecisive elections forced the socialists to 
form a government with conservative rivals kreisky broke with his 
party 
however he remained a vice president of the socialist 
international he gave up that post in june 1989 and was elected 
honorary president 
kreisky is survived by his son peter and his daughter susanne

a siege at a central london nightclub ended 
peacefully sunday when police arrested a gunman holding hostages 
and reportedly demanding an aircraft to take him to beirut 
scotland yard said 
the gunman wrapped in a red blanket which covered his head 
emerged first from tokyo joes a popular middle east haunt in 
clarges street off piccadilly and was bundled into a police 
vehicle four or five men in suits and casual clothes were then 
escorted from the building by police 
everybody is out and nobody has been hurt said david dowell 
of scotland yard a man has been taken away for questioning 
the four or five male hostages in the club when the siege ended 
appeared tired and dazed but otherwise unhurt scotland yard said 
police had no immediate details on how the siege ended 
the gunman had demanded a bus and plane to take him to beirut 
with 60 arab hostages according to a hostage who escaped 
the arab hostages included members of the kuwaiti royal family 
according to another eyewitness yacoub ibrahim who got out of the 
club earlier 
scotland said a number of arab vips had been in the club but 
gave no names 
police carried out lengthy negotiations with the man reported 
to be armed with a shotgun a pistol a swordlike knife and a 
bomblike device strapped around his waist 
when the man burst into the club brandishing guns at about 2 
am there were between 100 and 200 patrons inside some managed 
to escape and scotland yard said a number were released after two 
smoked salmon sandwiches were sent in to the gunman this morning 
police said some of the escapees needed medical attention and

a california real estate agent returning to 
the united states was stopped by customs officials because a 
government computer identified him falsely as a suspected drug 
smuggler 
norbert steyer was taken to a small room at the dallas airport 
where customs officials spent a halfhour searching him and poking 
through his belongings 
steyer eventually received an apology from the customs service 
and his name was expunged from its tecs ii computer system but the 
may 3 episode illustrates what the general accounting office called 
deficiencies in controls over who is listed as a suspect in the 
customs computer system 
a gao report concluded that because of sloppy dataentry 
procedures there is an increased risk that known or suspected 
law violators may enter the united states undetected and that 
innocent persons may be stopped and intensively inspected at the 
borders for offenses they did not commit 
on july 20 customs commissioner carol hallett approved new 
procedures aimed at improving the accuracy and reliability of the 
system 
when someone arrives in the united states the persons name or 
licenseplate number is entered into a computer which crosschecks 
the information with records on suspected smugglers terrorists 
drug traffickers or fugitives 
a persons name is included in the computer list if an arrest 
warrant is pending or authorities suspect the person may commit a 
crime or a terrorist act officials said 
the computer network which serves 14 federal agencies connects 
to the fbis national crime information center system with records 
on 5 million people tecs ii also is being considered by the bush 
administration as the primary computer system for the antidrug 
effort 
steyers case showed the system is fallible 
the 38yearold real estate agent from costa mesa calif was 
listed as a suspected drug smuggler 
steyer says that over a threeyear period he was searched every 
time he returned to the country from a foreign trip 
it has been a real problem for a couple of years said 
steyer it became inconvenient and a hassle because everybody i 
travel with ends up being searched as well 
steyer said he finally discovered the reason for the searches 
after stepping off the plane in dallas i happened to glance at 
the computer to read it i got very concerned he said 
steyers lawyer complained to the customs service in june he 
said the agency wrote a formal apology and promised to purge the 
false information from its extensive computer system 
customs service officials declined to comment on steyers case 
saying only that problems of mistaken identity are isolated 
customs is not perfect said spokesman dennis shimkowski 
that is the reason why we do issue letters of apology in the 
isolated occasions that mistakes do happen 
the spokesman acknowledged the agency receives a steady though 
small stream of letters from people who say their names dont 
belong in the computer 
but critics of tecs ii short for treasury enforcement 
communications system say steyers experience in dallas last 
spring underscores the weaknesses of the electronic network 
stories of people being detained because of inaccuracies are 
rampant said mark rotenberg the washington director of computer 
professionals for social responsibility an advocacy group that 
studied the fbis national crime information center 
the gao the investigative arm of congress looked at 69 records 
at the customs services san ysidro calif checkpoint it found 41 
examples of missing inaccurate or incomplete information about the 
individuals 
it also found 82 discrepancies between information in the 
records and casefile documents 
customs objected to some of the findings in the gao report but 
we agreed that we need better guidelines for what defines an 
accurate and complete record said rod macdonald the agencys 
director of enforcement systems 
the new customs procedures call for closer review of records 
being entered into the computer by customs service supervisors 
macdonald said 
more than 30000 people throughout the government have varying 
degrees of access to the system information also is entered by 
other federal law enforcement agencies including the fbi and dea 
officials said 
part of the problem is evaluating the accuracy of sketchy tips 
from informants you have to make a decision of how good is your 
information macdonald said 
we want to alert our people there is a potential smuggling 
event to take place we got to get it into the system he said 
if the guy is bad if he is trying to bring a load of dope 
into the country you certainly dont want to be the one who 
doesnt follow up 
macdonald noted a computer hit does not trigger anything 
more than a special search which many travelers are subjected to 
for other reasons 
our inspection personnel dont take action based on something 
in the system alone he said that record in the system may 
cause them to start asking questions but our inspectors take no 
legal action without evidence of wrongdoing

president bushs choice of david h souter for 
the supreme court may help the president avoid further inflaming 
the abortion issue in the fall elections but analysts say it no 
more than papers over a fundamental division within the republican 
party 
while scouring souters record for clues to the thinking of this 
relatively unknown judge democrats privately saluted bushs savvy 
in choosing a man with no fingerprints on the most explosive 
political issue of the time 
both democrats and republicans cautioned however that the 
republican party remains internally split on what to do about 
abortion 
it is a division that threatens the successful electoral 
coalition ronald reagan bound together using economic appeals to 
unite social conservatives and moderates and it is one that 
inevitably will come to a head perhaps before bush comes up for 
reelection in 1992 
observers also caution that unforeseen information about souter 
could change the political equation at any time 
from a narrow political perspective in 1990 unless something 
comes up undoubtedly hes the safest choice said eddie mahe a 
republican political consultant it clearly keeps the life issue 
from being a major topic of debate this year 
abortion is a major issue in some of this years hottest races 
iowas senate and governors race and the governors races in 
florida ohio and texas are among them but mahe and other 
republicans argue that the choice of souter doesnt raise the 
political temperature 
most people who view abortion as a voting issue are already 
activated on both sides said david keene a gop consultant and 
president of the american conservative union i dont think 
anythings going to happen to change that equation i think its a 
wash 
i can imagine nominations that would have increased the 
fervor but i dont think this nominee will decrease the fervor 
said gary bauer a former reagan administration official who heads 
the antiabortion family research council 
still the selection of a seeming abortionneutral nominee only 
postpones the gops indecision on abortion 
president bush embraces the antiabortion position although in 
his political past he once supported the supreme courts 1973 roe 
vs wade decision legalizing abortion 
in what could be read as a warning to bush from the right wing 
bauer and some others warn that if souter turns out to be other 
than what they hope on abortion bush may face trouble within the 
party 
if he does not go on the prolife side then i think george 
bush would have some problems in 1992 some kind of challenge from 
the prolife side mahe said 
house republican whip newt gingrich of georgia said fellow 
conservatives should have no problem with a man who was considered 
a potential supreme court nominee by thenattorney general ed meese 
during the reagan administration 
if david souter is good enough for ed meese and ronald reagan 
then hes certainly good enough for me gingrich said on nbctvs 
meet the press program sunday 
the party continues to have a strongly antiabortion platform 
pledging dedication to reversing the roe decision 
at the same time the party has several candidates who take the 
opposite view and support abortion rights the gop suffered 
electoral losses in 1989 that were attributed to shifting public 
sentiment toward keeping abortion legal in the face of fresh court 
challenges 
the day after bush announced his choice of souter he made a 
campaign appearance in pennsylvania where the republican candidate 
for governor barbara hafer supports abortion rights 
some of the gops best chances for capturing senate seats 
central to the partys hopes of regaining control of that chamber 
are also abortion rights supporters such as rep lynn martin in 
illinois and rep claudine schneider in rhode island 
bushs republican national committee chairman lee atwater has 
tried to make both sides feel welcome and several groups of 
republicans have formed in an effort to push the party away from 
its antiabortion platform 
bob beckel a democratic consultant said the souter nomination 
means moderate republicans such as martin schneider and sen pete 
wilson of california who is running for governor wont be put on 
the spot by having to defend a vote for an ideological 
antiabortion nominee nor will they have to oppose their president 
its probably on balance pretty good news for any republican 
candidates having to worry about defending righttolife court 
candidates beckel said of souters nomination the last thing 
wilson would have wanted in california was having to defend a 
hardright candidate 
but the issue could be forced to a head by 1992 
going past the 1990 elections to 1992 were going to have a 
fairly early opportunity to see where he souter is on abortion 
bauer said 
democrats will be trying to put republicans on the defensive 
this fall of course 
you have all kinds of people running for the senate who are 
going to have to address the question of how they will vote a lot 
of candidates for governor who will have to address the question of 
what they would do if the abortion issue comes back to the 
states said democratic national committee spokesman mike mccurry 
frank greer a democratic consultant for abortionrights 
candidates said much depends on what picture of souter emerges 
from confirmation hearings 
if he emerges as a moderate not out to reverse the abortion 
decision greer said that could soften the image of the republican 
party as the antiabortion party 
if hes perceived as a very conservative selection set to 
upset roe vs wade then i think its going to hurt republican 
candidates from the congressional level statehouses and senate 
races greer said

oklahomas political history is replete 
with knockdown dragout democratic primaries for governor but 
its the republicans this year who are mixing it up early in a bid 
to keep the governors office in gop hands 
with gov henry bellmon retiring after one term in office five 
republicans are in a hotly contested battle for the gop 
gubernatorial nomination in the aug 28 primary 
the democrats too have a fiveway primary race and us rep 
wes watkins is the oddson favorite largely because he has raised 
a 15 million campaign war chest 
gop primaries in oklahoma generally have been hohum events 
state gop chairman clinton key says the fact that this years race 
is hotly contested is a sign that the republican party is reaching 
maturity 
it shows we have come of age as a party in this state key 
said i cant recall any time when we have had so many viable 
candidates 
education jobs and taxes are among the big issues in the 
campaign and candidates of both parties appear to be taking note 
of public sentiment against professional politicians 
the gop primary is regarded as a wideopen race between former 
federal prosecutor bill price and attorney burns hargis with 
restaurateur vince orza also making his presence felt 
hargis has attacked prices support for repeal of a 223 million 
school reform and tax bill enacted at a special legislative 
session saying that killing the measure would create financial 
chaos 
price meanwhile has accused hargis of violating former 
president ronald reagans 11th commandment against speaking ill of 
another republican 
on the democratic side watkins 51 has raised nearly three 
times as much in campaign contributions as that of any other 
opponent and more than bellmon spent for the entire campaign four 
years ago 
he is the son of itinerant fruitpickers and likes to tell the 
story of his humble beginnings how he overcame a speech 
impediment worked his way through college and went on to gain the 
house seat that had been held by former house speaker carl albert 
one watkins campaign ad in black and white opens with a farm 
scene reminiscent of the dust bowl it shows a little boy and the 
voiceover says route 66 from oklahoma to california parents 
with little education picked fruit to survive the experts say a 
kid from this background an outsider should be doomed to 
failure but not this kid education and guttough determination 
were his way out 
watkins is expected to be a strong candidate in the rural areas 
but a big question remains on how his homespun style will sell in 
metropolitan areas like oklahoma city and tulsa 
a tireless campaigner watkins is taking credit for an increase 
in jobs in his district and pledging to turn the lights back on 
in oklahoma a state still recuperating from an economic nose dive 
in the early 1980s 
watkins stresses that he was not the favorite of established 
political leaders when he won a state senate seat and then was 
elected to congress 
his main challengers in the primary appear to be house speaker 
steve lewis and businessman david walters the 1986 democratic 
nominee 
lewis ads say he ushered the school reform and tax bill to 
passage when a lot of politicians said steve it will never 
pass 
walters is voicing praise for a proposed constitutional 
amendment to limit legislative service to 12 years saying the 
public is tired of career politicians 
all of the major democratic candidates have taken prochoice 
stands on the abortion question while the main contenders for the 
gop nomination except orza oppose abortion

in some ways toshiki kaifu resembles that american 
vice president of nearly half a century ago who was seen as a 
political expedient a compromise choice destined for a quick 
return to obscurity 
like harry s truman japans prime minister has proven a 
surprisingly resourceful leader during his first year in office 
kaifu has exhibited a talent for both politics and statesmanship 
that by vastly exceeding expectations has sent his popularity 
booming 
he has left little doubt as give em hell harry was quick to 
do that he is capable of handling the nations highest office 
when kaifu was chosen last year he was a career member of 
parliament gien little chance of surviving long in an office 
coveted by the governing partys older generation in the sedentary 
politics of japan his elders were lined up ahead of him and had 
every right to it 
this time there was a difference the recruit bribery and 
insidertrading scandal which tainted nearly all the liberal 
democratic party elders 
kaifu youthful and untouched was chosen to fill the position 
until the scandal died down the scandal abated but kaifu did not 
behave as expected 
the 59yearold prime minister has fought off powerful faction 
leaders who sought to manipulate his cabinet beat a more glamorous 
rival in a hardfought election and won over his western colleagues 
with an aggressive performance at the houston economic summit 
a poll published three weeks before his first anniversary in 
office aug 9 gave his administration a 60 percent approval 
rating the second highest for a japanese government since world 
war ii 
in april 1989 the height of the influencebuying scandal a 
survey indicated only 39 percent of the people supported the 
government of noboru takeshita then prime minister 
that came as a shock to the liberal democrats who have governed 
japan since the party was formed 35 years ago 
some of the pundits who predicted he would last only a few 
months now concede that kaifu whose motto is be resolute and 
even the devil will run was the right man for the moment 
a lot of people thought he was weak said hideo sato dean 
of international relations at tsukuba university such 
expectations turned out not be true that was psychogically very 
important 
many japanese wanted an end to the political oldboy network 
that was generous in protecting big business at the consumers 
expense 
the whole political scene in the last year has made it clear 
that the average japanese citizen is fed up with the old odiferous 
poitics as usual said patricia steinhoff former head of the 
center for japanese studies at the university of hawaii 
sato said i think people want new leadership not based on 
factional power hes not the maneuvering type the japanese people 
want a leader to be exercising some sort of leadership not just 
reacting to outside pressure and events 
in that respect he resembles truman the compromise choice for 
vice president in 1944 who was made president the following year by 
the death of franklin d roosevelt like truman kaifu has taken 
plainspoken arguments to the people 
there is less similarity between politics in the two countries 
in some ways politics here works less like us constitutional 
government than like new yorks tammany hall early in the century 
when political bosses wielded power by carefully building a web of 
personal support based on patronage 
japans political bosses are the leaders of four major factions 
in the liberal democratic party the main danger to kaifus future 
is the fact that he is wedded to one of two minor factions 
his rivals for future party leadership such as former foreign 
minister shintaro abe and former finance minister kiichi miyazawa 
are heads of powerful factions who have remained visible 
miyazawa recently led a japanese mission that met with president 
bush in washington the welltraveled abe will lead a delegation to 
moscow in september 
kaifu could stumble on his promises of reform revision of an 
unpopular sales tax measures to tighten political ethics and 
change the national election system and opening japans markets to 
more foreign goods 
i would say that if he continues to have very high popularity 
ratings it would be less easy for the ldp to simply elbow him 
aside steinhoff said its a question of whether he can 
sustain it

the slayings of 15 palestinians this month for 
suspected collaboration with israel are raising fears among 
palestinian leaders that the uprising is turning on itself in 
frustration 
a statement from a palestine liberation organization official 
was published in a jerusalem weekly criticizing the killings and 
saying arabs should be battling israelis not each other 
the mounting internecine toll is particularly conspicuous 
because it contrasts with a marked drop in fatal clashes with 
israeli troops who have adopted a more restrained strategy in the 
occupied west bank and gaza strip 
just one palestinian has died in clashes with soldiers in july 
analysts blame the increased killings of palestinians by their 
own people on a noticeable slowdown in the 31monthold uprising 
against israeli occupation and its failure to make political gains 
israeli politicians have used the killings as ammunition in 
their campaign against the plo while plo leaders have expressed 
fears the killings are getting out of hand 
in a statement friday in jerusalems an nadwa weekly intisar 
wazir a member of the mainstream plo fatah factions central 
committee said palestinians were undercutting their own cause 
masked activists who appear during the night and attack 
citizens and property must be condemned said mrs wazir widow 
of the plo military leader khalil alwazir 
the uprising security committees must confront those who hurt 
the revolution of stones and endanger its continuation she said 
from amman jordan 
according to figures kept by the associated press 724 
palestinians have been killed by israeli soldiers or civilians and 
45 isralis have been slain by palestinians since the uprising began 
in december 1987 
in that time 243 palestinians have been killed by fellow arabs 
in most cases the victims have been taken from their homes or 
shops by masked palestinians they later have been found hanged 
beaten or stabbed to death and wall slogans or leaflets have 
proclaimed them collaborators with israel 
yossi olmert director of the government press office denied 
that all of those killed were collaborating he suggested that 
palestinians involved in crime or family feuds try to legitimize 
killings by saying they the victims are collaborators 
olmert also blamed the plo for the deaths charging that they 
were aimed at blocking israeli efforts to cut the plo out of the 
peace process israel considers the plo to be a terrorist 
organization 
the plo and its accomplices want to show that no one should be 
under the impression he can talk with israel without being 
punished olmert said 
the plo has several times tried to stop the killings leaflets 
from the local uprising leadership have criticized needless 
slayings and last fall plo chief yasser arafat issued a radio 
appeal during a series of attacks in the west city of nablus 
this week in the west bank town of qalqilya slogans appeared on 
walls and a leaflet was issued saying a supposed collaborator 
killed last sunday by masked palestinians was an innocent man 
the leaflet distributed by arafats fatah faction blamed his 
death on mercenaries linked with the enemys israels 
intelligence 
his killing is our concern because the goal is to hurt the 
uprising and its reputation said the leaflet which pledged to 
avenge the attack 
in another incident feuding fatah factions on thursday 
exchanged gunfire and petrol bombs in the village of salem east of 
nablus 
residents told reporters that one faction blamed the other for 
kidnapping and badly beating a member suspected of collaboration 
he is not guilty and he is one of us the activists announced 
over loudspeakers before attacking the rival group 
daoud kuttab a respected palestinian journalist blamed the 
internal conflict on the stalled peace process 
israel has refused any steps toward compromise with the arabs 
and lately the revolt has drawn less attention abroad 
the palestinian people need to have something to look forward 
to a realistic goal said kuttab this hope is fading because 
of the failure of the political process 
he added this lack of hope and the clever israeli military 
policy of withdrawing and avoiding confrontations have distracted 
the people from their common enemy 
the key he said is whether the palestinian leadership in 
the next three to six months can pull itself together and find 
courageous solutions

couples like faustino and gloria 
aquino are one reason mexican officials are having trouble reducing 
population growth 
their shop on a hillside overlooking metropolitan mexico city 
is next door to a family planning clinic they have eight children 
and are expecting a ninth 
there didnt used to be planning said aquino 45 his wife 
added now that there is we dont practice it 
aquino his dark eyes twinkling was leaned against a meat case 
at their butcher shopfruit stand gloria 37 dipped a shet of 
pork rind into a vat of smoking fat outside the store 
an extensive network of familyplanning programs shrank mexicos 
annual population growth from 35 percent in the early 1970s to an 
estimated 21 percent 
now the goal is 1 percent growth officials recently presented a 
plan that backed off on that target but an annoyed president 
ordered them back to their original goal 
it isnt an easy task 
aquino jokes with the doctor hipolito ascencio mateo at the 
clinic next to his butcher shopfruit stand painted sunny yellow 
the clinic occupies two rooms rented to it by aquino 
but the aquinos dont avail themselves of its services aquino 
says he is afraid to have a vasectomy and his wife gloria 37 
says her body wont tolerate contraceptives 
their children range in age from 1 to 19 
a wellpublicized family planning program quickly reaches half 
the women those who want to limit their families and are waiting 
for the means to do it said evold hosein director of program 
support for the international planned parenthood federation 
that figure stabilizes unless we do something differently 
he said by telephone from new york were not sure what it is 
that we must do differently 
about 55 percent of mexican women of reproductive age use 
contraceptives according to the health department the number 
varies widely by education level and between rural areas and the 
cities 
young families with only two children once an oddity are 
becoming common in large cities 
abortion is illegal but common although mexico is 
overwhelmingly roman catholic the church does not actively oppose 
family planning 
the 1 percent annual growth goal was in 1977 four years after 
the constitution was changed from advocating births to promoting 
family planning and the sale of contraceptives was legalized 
to reduce population growth to that level 82 percent of fertile 
women will have to use contraceptives more than in the united 
states or china government demographers say the number of 
children a woman bears must decline from an average of 34 this 
year to 167 in 1999 
president carlos salinas de gortari links reducing population 
growth to development 
the social needs and economic demands especially for job 
creation are too many for us to abandon this original goal of 1 
percent demographic growth by the year 2000 he said in february 
even reaching it the challenges will be formidable imagine if 
we dont achieve it 
he spoke after officials admitted missing earlier marks and 
proposed a goal of 15 percent a year that would put the 
population at 105 million in 2000 about 4 million more than at 
salinas pace according to estimates made before the 1990 census 
in a rare public reprimand salinas singled out the three 
largest public health services 
your effort has diminished and as a consequence we have to 
redouble it especially in rural areas he said the director of 
the national population program was replaced 
mexico is emerging from deep depression and has difficulty 
providing education public services and utility installations 
with half the population under age 19 more than 800000 people 
enter the job market each year 
in may the united nations said in its annual population report 
world fertility rates were declining more slowly than expected the 
1990s will determine whether the world population of 53 billion 
doubles or triples before leveling off said dr nafis sadik 
director of the un population fund 
uncertain figures make it even harder to chart mexicos growth 
preliminary figures from the 1990 census released friday show 
the population is 811 million more than 4 million below earlier 
government projections the validity of the estimated population 
growth rate has been questioned said a public health official who 
asked not to be identified and the announcement gave no new 
current growth figure 
jesus kumate the health secretary calls for better education 
and job opportunities for women more local health workers to 
insert intrauterine devices increased sex education in schools and 
a subsidy for an injectable contraceptive developed in mexico 
aquino whose youngest children were playing at his feet said 
he approved of salinas objective because that way everyone will 
be able to eat the same 
after this next one he said were going to stop

after months of screaming headlines 
closeddoor hearings and tellall articles in adult magazines 
sex and prostitution wound up having little to do with the house 
reprimand of rep barney frank 
that frank paid prostitute stephen l gobie 80 for sex in 1985 
and then allowed him free access to his capitol hill apartment 
played almost no role in the punishment meted out to frank 
what mattered to the house was franks word 
frank lied twice in a document he prepared under his 
congressional letterhead which was sent by a friend to a virginia 
prosecutor overseeing gobies probation on sex and drug 
convictions frank lied about how he met gobie and he lied when he 
wrote that as far as he knew gobie was obeying the law 
as congress becomes increasingly inured to sex violation 
allegations against its own and as homosexuality diminishes as an 
issue unto itself in public life the enduring problem for frank 
among his peers may be his own credibility 
frank already back to his old feisty self discounts talk of 
any longterm damage 
if this was the first thing people knew about me then it might 
have that sort of effect frank said after fridays reprimand 
earlier on the house floor he said i have a reputation for 
honesty 
if anything the homosexual nature of franks relationship 
benefited the massachusetts democrat frank himself said he wrote 
the misleading statements on the 1986 memo because to do otherwise 
would have revealed his homosexuality it was a year later in june 
1987 that frank publicly stated that he is homosexual 
the committees interpretation of the memo received relatively 
little attention during floor debate the committee said frank 
failed to mention gobies prostitution in the memo and the fact 
that he met gobie by answering an ad for an escort service in 
order to help gobie avoid a longer probation on sex and drug 
charges 
during last weeks floor debate democrats and republicans alike 
repeatedly said that the sexual aspects surrounding the case had 
nothing to do with franks punishment 
the issue was not the sexual preference of barney frank the 
issue was conduct rep william dannemeyer rcalif who led an 
unsuccessful effort to expel frank said sunday on nbctvs meet 
the press program 
this should not be perceived as a referendum on purely private 
lifestyle or conduct said rep julian dixon dcalif chairman 
of the ethics committee 
gay bashing just isnt popular among respectable people any 
more said christopher foreman jr a congressional expert at the 
brookings institution a washington think tank its not 
surprising that allegations or revelations that would have been 
shocking or damaging no longer are 
franks reputation as a champion of progressive causes also gave 
him a builtin group of allies in the house some of whom made a 
point of sitting beside and around him during the debate 
this wasnt just member x this was barney foreman said 
were this some other individual who were less well liked less 
well respected as a person and for his intellect things might have 
gone quite differently 
politically frank appears to have a smooth road ahead of him 
his most serious republican opponent dropped out of the race 
recently citing personal reasons that leaves an unknown 
attleboro mass attorney as his only opponent 
even the challenger john soto acknowledged that the reprimand 
amounted to a victory for frank soto continues to argue that 
franks behavior warrants his departure from congress 
in washington frank was already getting back into the daily 
life of a member of congress on friday he attended legislative 
hearings and this week he plans to take part in floor debate on 
housing legislation 
stuart rothenberg editor of the political report a 
washingtonbased periodical said frank began his recovery from the 
ethics allegations months ago and to some degree he said he used 
the points in the ethics report that upheld his own claims to his 
advantage 
frank particularly emphasized that the committee concluded he 
was unaware that gobie was running a prostitution ring out of his 
apartment and that the two did not have sex in the house gymnasium 
two of the more sensational charges 
barney put a good spin on it from his point of view 
rothenberg said barney franks a tough cookie he knows how to 
play politics

soviets have grudgingly endured scarcities of 
soap sugar and shoes but they are fuming at an economy that has 
stubbed out their supply of cigarettes 
what is being called the worst cigarette shortage in decades has 
some smokers doing a slow burn in lines of more than 200 people 
while others are expressing their anger with strikes 
demonstrations and vandalism 
communist party give us a light proclaimed a sign at a 
rally of angry smokers last week in the ural mountains city of perm 
government officials are blaming the shortage which began more 
than a month ago on various reasons factories that are shut down 
for annual summer repairs a lack of paper foil glue and cotton 
supplies to make the cigarettes ethnic unrest disrupting a factory 
in armenia that produced cotton filters and reduced purchases of 
cigarettes from bulgaria a key supplier for the soviet union 
hardcore addicts are picking up butts in the streets puffing 
dried tea leaves or buying tobacco dust that gardeners use as an 
insecticide according to the workers tribune newspaper 
three times ive tried to quit but i almost went mad said 
viktor mayorov as he waited in line for cigarettes in moscow 
tobacco is much worse than vodka my god its worse i can do 
without vodka but i cant do without cigarettes 
the pungent odor of cheap tobacco hangs in most public places in 
the soviet union a country of 70 million smokers who persist in 
lighting up despite government warnings and kickthehabit 
campaigns in the west 
the shortage has pushed black market prices up they range from 
480 for a pack of the most inferior nonfilter brand about 10 
times its official statesubsidized price to 1280 for a pack 
in perms central market 
perms tobacco rebellion began at 6 pm on july 26 when up 
to 1000 people gathered on lenin street in front of a smoke shop 
that hasnt sold cigarettes for days they blocked trams cars and 
trucks according to the interfax news service 
the workers tribune reported that the crowd grew angry calling 
for bureaucrats to come out of their offices one person suggested 
smashing the windows of city hall 
a strike committee of 12 was formed went to city hall and 
demanded that authorities straighten out the problem interfax 
said by 7 pm the authorities had produced 12000 packs of 
cigarettes from an army garrison which were sold to the dispersing 
crowd it added 
we have to admit that the situation with the sale of 
cigarettes has gotten out of control g karavayev the head of 
the regional government told the workers tribune but who could 
think that such things could happen just because of cigarettes 
soviet media have chronicled the smoldering discontent 
combines halted during the harvest near the russian city of 
krasnodar in early july as farmworkers protested the lack of 
cigarettes similar strikes have been threatened or have occurred 
in the western russian cities of kuibyshev berezhniki ulyanovsk 
lipetsk and ufa 
smokers tired of lining up for cigarettes blocked the main 
thoroughfare in the ukrainian city of dnepropetrovsk on july 23 
demanding that authorities restore order in cigarette sales 
in the city of voronezh more than 15 street kiosks were broken 
into in an apparent search for cigarettes in the latter half of 
july according to v zvyagintsev head of soyuzpechat which runs 
the newsstands 
an aircraft factory in kuibyshev has a plane prepared to fly to 
whatever city is selling cigarettes 
i have heard on the radio about those strikes like in 
kuibyshev and i think they are right grumbled valentina v 
nikonorova 36th in a line of 58 at a tobacco kiosk two blocks from 
the us embassy in moscow 
the 17yearold muscovite said she sometimes waits in line for 
more than an hour as an unofficial rationing system in moscow 
limits city residents to five packs per person and outoftowners 
to two packs per person she claimed authorities were stockpiling 
cigarettes at storehouses 
izvestia reported that 16 out of 24 cigarette factories have 
closed for repairs in the russian republic alone it said there 
were 17 billion fewer cigarettes produced in the first half of 
1990 compared with last year 
economic planners saw the shortage coming last year but they 
could do nothing because of a lack of hard currency izvestia 
reported 
the soviet union also bought 5 billion fewer cigarettes from 
bulgaria this year izvestia said apparently because of its hard 
currency problems on july 21 the council of ministers decided to 
dip into its reserves and buy more cigarettes from india and 
elsewhere promising relief in a month 
according to our newspapers almost all americans have quit 
smoking said a man who gave his name as leonid who went without 
cigarettes for five hours before he finally got a pack so its 
time for us to do the same

four years ago president samuel doe asked the 
united states for an unusual favor would it fix liberias budget 
mess 
the administration agreed sending 17 experts to monrovia doe 
spent 10 minutes with them said one us official does 
interest in this didnt last very long 
nor did the twoyear project the united states brought the 
experts home midway frustrated with does insistence on keeping 
much of his budget outside government control 
that was the final break in the bond that has tied the united 
states to liberia since that nation was founded in the 1840s by 
africa slaves set free from american plantations 
and in recent weeks as rebels threaten does rule and his life 
the united states appears to have washed its hands of the problem 
the resolution of this civil war is a liberian 
responsibility assistant secretary of state herman cohen said in 
recent congressional testimony the united states will not 
intervene to stop the fighting or to influence the outcome of the 
conflict in any way 
the seeds of the deterioration were sown when william tolbert 
the strongly prowestern president of liberia was overthrown in 
1980 by master sergeant doe and a band of noncommissioned officers 
tolbert a member of a tiny urban elite that traces its ancestry 
to liberias founders was shot and disemboweled by does followers 
poorly educated tribesmen resentful of the minoritys monopoly on 
power 
we had two options walking away or trying to deal with this 
new group of people said a us official we decided the 
historical relationship dictated that we remain engaged 
history wasnt the only factor 
libya was making overtures to doe in the early days of his rule 
and the united states wanted to make sure he didnt respond 
liberia was considered important to the united states as a 
buffer against the spread of soviet influence in africa which was 
at its height in the early 1980s and the united states had much 
invested in liberia 
two us facilities relayed diplomatic communications from 
washington to us embassies in africa the voice of america 
relayed its broadcasts to africa through a station in liberia a 
military airfield was always available for use by american 
aircraft and a tracking station run by the coast guard emitted 
navigational signals for us shipping 
little wonder then that us aid to liberia more than tripled 
from 191 million in 1979 to 614 in 1981 and special attention 
was paid to making the military does mainstay happy for 
example the united states built new barracks for his troops 
in return doe promised to restore an independent judicial 
system and hold elections 
he did so in 1985 but the balloting was fraudulent all agree 
including the united states they disagree about the scale 
human rights organizations and domestic critics complained of 
wholesale fraud and ballot burning but the united states argued 
that by announcing he only won 51 percent of the vote doe conceded 
a sizable opposition 
that was a slap in the face to us a complete insult said 
ellen johnson sirleaf an opposition senate candidate who served as 
finance minister until doe took over 
the reagan administrations policy engendered a sense of 
betrayal among liberians across a broad spectrum said michael h 
posner of the new yorkbased lawyers committee for human rights 
an aborted coup against doe in november 1985 unleashed 
widespread repression including executions and imprisonments 
without trial torture and suppression of press freedom 
the administration cajoled doe in private to mend his ways but 
in public criticism was withheld and even some praise awarded 
foreign policy is not about getting up on soapboxes we dont 
think it particularly effective said the us official 
congress however was fed up starting in 1986 lawmakers began 
whittling away at aid to liberia until in fiscal year 1990 it was 
down to 75 million food aid only the administration 
despairing of doe and bowing to the inevitable from congress 
suspended all military aid in 1989 
in recent months the administration focused its efforts on 
trying to get doe to negotiate with the rebels that didnt worked 
either 
the administration offered doe one last favor if doe asked and 
if the fighting that approached his palace was not a danger to 
american lives us officials would escort him to asylum in 
another african nation 
doe ignored our urgings the us official said theres 
nothing more we can do

one cuban woman in her 80s can probably sum up as 
well as anyone whats good and bad about cubas revolution these 
days 
she hurt her back in a bathtub fall and shell be laid up for 
three months she lavishly praises her doctors using words like 
magnificant to describe her care under cubas free medical 
system 
but dont ask this woman who did not want her name used what 
its like to go shopping for food 
no hay nada she says theres nothing its a common 
refrain these days 
a dozen cubans interviewed in recent days agreed that food has 
seldom if ever been so scarce 
not far from the elderly womans home plantains and pineapples 
were the only items available for 100 or so people lined up at a 
local market at a market next door the shelves were almost empty 
a joke making the rounds alludes to the mathematical impact of a 
recent 15 cent increase in the price of eggs h plus h15 x 10h equals 
ms90 
translated that means hunger plus 15cent eggs times 10 hours 
of work a day equals certain death muerte seguro in 1990 
to cubans a line for food means theres probably something to 
buy at the end of it they worry when theres no line because that 
means nothings available 
the more fortunate households have one or more retired people 
who spend their twilight years standing in line buying food that 
spares the rest of the family from the timeconsuming duty of 
buying food 
this spring a local communist party leader exhorted her 
neighbors at a meeting not to complain publicly about shortages 
because that would only benefit american imperialism 
but a few weeks later the same woman was heard complaining 
loudly about the meager selection at a market a fellow shopper 
reminded her of her earlier admonition the situation has become 
intolerable she responded 
waiting in line at a market the other day several women 
expressed outrage that the government had invited to cuba for an 
extended stay some russian children who were fallout victims of the 
nuclear disaster at chernobyl four years ago 
the women all agreed that they had nothing against the children 
but felt that the government should put the interests of cuban 
children ahead of those of foreign children 
in some ways though cuban children are better off than 
children elsewhere 
the government has worked hard to keep down the rate of infant 
mortality a scourge in much of the third world official tallies 
indicate that the figure nowadays is 111 per 1000 which compares 
favorably with wealthy industrialized countries 
president fidel castro cites the lowered infant mortality rate 
saying that if not for the revolution 300000 cubans would not be 
alive today 
so extensive is cubas ability to deliver medical services that 
increasing numbers of middleclass latin americans unable to get 
proper care at home and unable to afford treatment in the united 
states come to cuba 
this phenomenon known as health tourism attracted 1200 
foreigners to cuban hospitals and clinics last year according to 
official figures the country also has had some success with 
earning hard currency through the export of vaccines 
castro has spoken of turning cuba into a medical power 
still even the health system here is draws some of the same 
kind of criticism heard at food markets many medicines are simply 
nowhere to be found

nearly one in four state inmates in prison for 
killing someone committed the crime against a close relative or 
intimate friend according to a justice department report released 
sunday 
almost 60 percent of prisoners serving time during 1986 for a 
violent crime did not know the victim said the bureau of justice 
department statistics 
at the same time only 43 percent imprisoned that year killed 
strangers and 24 percent killed a close relative or intimate 
friend according to the report 
and almost one of every six of the offenders committed a violent 
crime against a minor the bureau said slightly more than half of 
the sex offenders reported their victim was younger than 18 
the 245562 male and female offenders serving time in state 
prisons for crimes of violence had victimized a total of 408936 
people in all they killed about 79300 sexually assaulted 
51100 robbed 201200 and assaulted 56400 the report said 
minors made up about 10 percent of the victims totaling more

committed a robbery most of them armed 
another 16 percent had sexually assaulted someone 15 percent

had victimized one person on their current imprisonment offense 
almost 16 percent said they had two victims and just over 10 
percent said they had victimized three or more people 
some statistics differed for men and women for example while 
only 26 percent of the men in state prison for a violent crime had 
killed someone homicide was the reason why almost half of the 
women imprisoned for a violent crime had been incarcerated the 
study found 
a separate report on family voilence released sunday by the 
justice departments national institute of justice said fbi figures 
showed that 30 percent of female murder victims in 1986 were killed

nelson mandela accused the 
government sunday of using an alleged communist conspiracy to delay 
peace talks he spoke before tens of thousands of people 
celebrating the launch of the south african communist party 
mandela said the government was trying to whip up hysteria with 
claims that communist members of his african national congress had 
plotted to seize power 
to suggest that these outstanding sons and daughters of 
our people harbor ideas of unilateral military action against the 
peace process is an insult manufactured by the enemies of 
democracy mandela said 
if it is genuinely interested in peace and negotiations the 
government must act to bring about this result mandela said 
mandela also stressed that the anc was not a marxist movement 
although many communists hold senior positions in the anc 
they have never sought to transform the anc into a tool and 
puppet of the communist party mandela said 
police claim communists and militants within the ancs military 
wing have stockpiled weapons and were formulating plans to seize 
power if talks between the government and the anc on ending 
whiteminority rule fail 
government officials in pretoria said they were studying 
mandelas charges and had no immediate response communist party 
officials said they were committed to a negotiated solution to 
south africas racial divisions 
president fw de klerk has reportedly asked mandela to drop the 
communists from the talks the anc and the government are to meet 
aug 6 to try and clear the way for fullscale negotiations 
about 35000 people nearly all of them black turned out for 
the rally marking the communist partys move into mainstream 
politics after being banned for 40 years by the south african 
government 
thousands sang chanted slogans and waved red hammerandsickle 
flags during the rally held at a football stadium in the black 
township of soweto outside johannesburg 
viva south african communist party viva the crowd roared 
despite the enthusiasm of the crowd the turnout in the 
70000seat stadium appeared smaller than organizers had predicted 
communist officials told the crowd many people had been 
stopped from attending but gave no details 
witnesses said police used tear gas to disperse small crowds of 
youths who tried to march after the rally but there were no 
serious clashes police had no comment on the report 
mandela received a huge ovation when he arrived with communist 
party secretary general joe slovo and other top party leaders 
slovo also denied the charges of a communist plot calling it an 
outright and deliberate lie 
he indirectly defended the oppositions right to wage an armed 
struggle against racial injustice however 
until the police stop hunting blacks we have a right not 
only to protest but to defend ourselves he said 
slovo said south africas communists were hated by many whites 
because of their long fight against apartheid 
they fear us even more than the devil he said 
slovo said the communists in south africa supported democracy 
and acknowledged that the partys authoritarian approach elsewhere 
such as in eastern europe had failed 
but at least many socialists recognize some of the mistakes 
and misdeeds he said 
jai naidoo a trade union leader said democracy and socialism 
were the same thing apartheid is proved to the most brutal and 
inhuman form of capitalism the world has ever seen he said 
the party introduced its internal leadership for the first time 
including chris hani head of the ancs military wing at least 
half of those presented are also prominent anc officials 
but the party is keeping the identity of some top leaders secret 
for strategic reasons 
de klerk legalized the communist party the anc and other 
opposition groups in february to help set the stage for the talks 
on sharing power with the black majority

unofficial postfactum news service are demanding the georgian 
parliament or supreme soviet convene immediately to adopt a law 
to register groups for oct 28 elections 
parliament is not scheduled to meet until aug 17 
the protest destabilizes the situation bears heavily on the 
socioeconomic life of the republic and aggravates its critical 
position the republics government warned in a statement 
confrontation of force is not ruled out which may lead to 
anarchy chaos and to hard unpredictable consequences said a 
statement by communist party leader givi gumbaridze published in 
the capital of tbilisi and quoted by pravda 
gumbaridze urged protesters to show the maximum political 
prudence and responsibility strictly observe the current laws in 
order to prevent a further complication of the situation and avert 
a threat to civil peace pravda said 
on april 9 1989 soviet soldiers moved into a crowd of peaceful 
demontrators in tbilisi and killed 19 of them a patrol shot a 20th 
person for violating curfew 
gumbaridze became georgian leader after that and has spoken out 
for more autonomy for the republic 
the june 17 election was postponed by georgias parliament in 
order to introduce a multiparty system and permit opponents to 
organize against the ruling communists 
on march 9 the caucasus republic joined the other republics 
trying to break with the kremlin its parliament condemned what it 
called the republics forcible annexation into the soviet union in 
the 1920s and demanded negotiations on restoring independence 
several small proindependence parties have been pressing hard 
for georgian secession for more than a year 
proindependence groups have done well in local elections this 
year elsewhere in the soviet union 
georgias parliament also struck the article of the republics 
constitution granting the communist party a monopoly on political 
power the amended constitution gives all political parties and 
public organizations the right on an equal basis to take part in 
working out the policies of the government in managing government 
and public affairs 
the peoples front political movement had sought the change 
arguing such a provision already had been dropped from the national 
law

former chancellor bruno kreisky 
austrias longestserving chancellor and an architect of its 
poliicy of neutrality died sunday he was 79 
kreisky was admitted to lainz hospital last week with a heart 
condition which seriously worsened over the weekend he died of 
heart failure at 6 am wolfgang enenkel a doctor at the hospital 
said 
a jew kreisky was forced to flee austria from the nazis but 
returned to become its longestserving chancellor 
kreisky won an absolute majority in parliament for his ruling 
socialist party three consecutive times in the 1970s representing 
a lone record in the free democratic world the austria press 
agency reported 
with kreiskys death austria loses one of its most 
distinguished postwar politicians european democracy one of its 
most convincing leading figures the socialist international one of 
its most highly esteemed honorary presidents said former west 
german chancellor willy brandt 
socialist chancellor franz vranitzky said i believe it is no 
exaggeration when i say that we have lost with bruno kreisky one of 
the greatest austrian politicians of this century 
condolences were received from around the world including from 
plo chief yasser arafat kreisky was the first western leader to 
receive arafat 
during his tenure as chancellor from 1970 to 1983 kreisky took 
advantage of austrias unique position between eastern europe and 
western europe to carved out a mediating role which gave his tiny 
nation unexpected prominence 
he drew criticism abroad especially from israel for his middle 
east policies and his ties with arafat he was also criticized for 
receiving libyan leader moammar gadhafi and freeing arab terrorists 
who attacked the vienna headquarters of the organization of 
petroleum exporting countries in 1975 
but he was also widely respected in europe as one of the leading 
postwar socialists 
at home kreisky was an adored if irascible figure who 
skillfully handled the press 
born jan 22 1911 the son of a wealthy industrialist kreisky 
was forced to flee his native vienna in 1938 after the nazis 
cheered by many austrians annexed the nation to germany 
he went to sweden where he first met fellow brandt who was 
living in exile 
there he married vera fuerst the couple had two children 
peter born in 1944 and susanne born in 1948 who survive him 
his wife died in 1988 
kreisky returned to vienna in 1949 and entered the government in 
1953 as state secretary in the foreign ministry he served as 
foreign minister from 1959 to 1966 and became chancellor in 1970 
it was the socialists failure to win a clear majority in the 
1983 elections that led kreisky to step down and hand over the 
party leadership 
but foreign policy was kreiskys passion 
a longtime champion of eastwest detente kreisky espoused the 
idea of a common europe long before soviet leader mikhail s 
gorbachev coined his phrase a common european house 
kreisky sought improved relations with austrias thencommunist 
neighbors although he did not shy away from sharply criticizing 
human rights violations in the soviet bloc he also helped

palestinian guerrillas wrested two key 
hills from iranianbacked fundamentalists sunday in savage combat 
that forced the red cross to cancel a plan to remove decomposing 
corpses from the battlefield 
police said at least 35 combatants were killed and 90 wounded in 
36 hours of fighting for the hamadeh and sakhriah hills near the 
zone israel occupies in south lebanon that raised the toll to 180 
dead and 536 wounded since the region erupted in violence on july 
16 
the casualties included seven palestinian dead and 12 wounded 
the rest were lebanese militiamen of the iranianbacked hezbollah 
and the prosyrian amal said a police spokesman who by regulation 
cannot be named 
yasser arafats palestine liberation organization guerrillas 
intervened on amals side in an attack launched before dawn 
saturday to dislodge hezbollah from the strategic village of kfar 
milki the spokesman said 
the sakhriah and hamadeh hills above kfar milki command all 
supply routes to hezbollahs 50member garrison holed up in the 
village whose 5000 inhabitants have already fled their homes 
seeking refuge in sidon 
kfar milki is six miles southeast of sidon where the plo has 
its main bases the fighting later spread to jarjou on the 
southeastern edge of hezbollahs enclave in the apple province 
the region covers 50 square miles of rocky highlands on the 
northern flank of the zone israel carved out in 1985 as a buffer 
against crossborder guerrilla raids 
israels chief of staff gen dan shomron toured the zone 
sunday and told reporters israel was closely watching the progress 
of the amalhezbollah fighting 
we shall not interfere in lebanons domestic wars unless it 
develops into a threat endangering us shomron said according to 
the radio station of the israelifunded south lebanon army militia 
hezbollah and the more secular amal arabic for hope have been 
fighting on and off for three years for mastery of the 12 million 
shiites who make up lebanons largest sect more than 1200 have 
been killed and 4000 wounded in the inconclusive power struggle 
the allswiss international committee of the red cross called 
for a fourhour mercy ceasefire sunday morning to allow red 
cross teams to evacuate corpses that have been rotting for days in 
jarjou 
but the fighting raged without letup forcing the red cross to 
call off the mission and withdraw its rescuers and ambulances 
waiting in hills near jarjou back to sidon 25 miles south of 
beirut 
an international committee and lebanese red cross statement 
later renewed urgent appeals for a humanitarian truce but set 
no new deadline

when the final vote on the 1990 farm bill was 
taken on the senate floor it was a time for tears or cheers for 
about 200 special spectators 
special interest spectators that is 
ralph page a lobbyist for minority farmers rushed into the 
anteroom of the senate floor joyfully punching the air with his 
fist 
we got it he said as he rushed to a small knot of 
colleagues among the 40 or so lobbyists milling about 
he threw a bear hug around a senate aide to express his pleasure 
at the senates unanimous approval of an amendment to the farm bill 
that sets up a program to end racial discrimination in agriculture 
department programs and halt the decline in numbers of minority 
farmers 
others had less to crow about last friday 
sam white of the national agricultural chemicals association 
had been working the bill until 2 am the night before and was up 
at five friday morning for a breakfast meeting 
but the senate didnt go along with his efforts to change a 
section of the bill that bans export of pesticides that are 
unregistered in the united states 
the lobbyists that are a part of any legislative process were 
out in force for the 54 billion farm bill which passed the senate 
7021 on friday 
theyre still on the job as they try to educate cajole and 
seduce members of the house into their way of thinking on the 
issues still unfinished by that body then theyll start working on 
the conference committee members assigned to put the two bills 
together 
one lobbyist a former congressional agriculture aide estimated 
that there are more than 200 people like him working on various 
aspects of the farm bill 
its a whole community its what they do he said 
throughout consideration of the bill a flock of farm lobbyists 
stood vigil around the rooms and corridors off the house and senate 
chambers glancing up each time someone moved toward the chamber 
there were the usual representatives of commodity groups and 
organizations such as the american agriculture movement 
but among the farm corps some with cowboy boots protruding from 
under their suit pants were unlikely allies the labor and 
environmental lobbies 
they started watching agriculture after passage of the 1985 farm 
bill that measure contained landmark conservation provisions and a 
section that used overseas sales of surplus grain to subsidize the 
us merchant marine 
it was a coalition rep charles schumer dny couldnt defeat 
when he tried to eliminate subsidies from the wealthiest farmers in 
the house version of the bill 
we never had enough support on the outside schumer lamented 
after his amendment failed 263159 the farm lobby was out there 
in force and they were united 
he said the members of the agriculture committee pour all their 
efforts into this one bill every five years making friendships and 
doing favors for colleagues to ensure its passage 
this is the most important issue to 40 or 50 members of 
congress and thats hard to beat he said 
rep tom downey dny who tried unsuccessfully to cut back 
subsidies in the sugar program said some of the better labor 
lobbyists were watching the farm bill closely 
bartering 40 or 50 solid votes is a very powerful coalition 
he said of the agriculture bloc i was astonished by the number 
of votes that beat us on the sugar amendment they play 
hardball 
house agriculture chairman kika de la garza dtexas 
acknowledged the some of the unlikely bedfellows that were joining 
the farm lobby you take help wherever you can get it he said 
if you drive farmers out of the program you take acres out of 
the program that you will not be able to keep environmentally 
sound he said of the environmentalists interests in keeping 
even the wealthiest farmers on government subsidies 
as for organized labor i think their interest is jobs like i 
tell my friends in the uaw in detroit no farmer no pickup

testimony in a federal civil trial here has raised 
new questions about thenvice president bushs knowledge of the 
illegal contra supply network run by oliver north 
bush has repeatedly denied being informed of air drops of 
supplies to the nicaraguan rebels in 1986 at a time congress had 
barred lethal aid 
but richard gadd a retired air force colonel who helped set up 
the network for north and and retired air force gen richard 
secord said in a deposition that he was told that the vice 
president was briefed on the operation at the time 
a federal grand jury has been meeting in washington to continue 
the investigation into the irancontra affair and is reportedly 
considering the roles of bush and former president reagan 
gadds sworn deposition was read friday during trial on a damage 
suit filed against secord by contra supply plane crewman eugene 
hasenfus the sole survivor from a c123 shot down over nicaragua 
in october 1986 the crash and hasenfus capture helped unravel the 
irancontra affair 
in gadds deposition hasenfus lawyer asked if former cia agent 
felix rodriguez who helped oversee the base in el salvador where 
many contra supply flights originated had ever voiced complaints 
about shoddy equipment rodriguez worked closely with robert 
dutton supervisor of secords contra supply network 
the deposition sworn testimony taken outside of open court 
continues 
gadd i can recall one conversation that mr dutton related to 
me that mr felix rodriguez discussing sic those kinds of issues 
with the vice president 
attorney did mr dutton say that rodriguez was discussing 
those issues with vice president bush 
gadd yes he told me that 
attorney did he tell you where he got that information 
gadd i dont recall 
outside the courtroom rodriguez who also testified friday in 
the case but did not say what he told bush strongly denied 
discussing contra aid with the vice president he said two meetings 
they had in 1986 dealt only with rodriguezs legitimate mission 
helping the el salvador air force hunt leftist guerrillas 
he said he deliberately avoided discussing the contra operation 
with bush because he wanted to avoid another watergatetype scandal 
spokesmen for the president did not immediately respond to the 
deposition but in the past bush has energetically denied his 
meetings with rodriguez covered the illegal contra supply network 
there was no discussion direct or indirect on the contra aid 
network the president has said previously 
questions about that account were first raised in 1987 when a 
memo by bushs national security aide col samuel j watson was 
released by the irancontra investigating committee 
the memo dated april 30 1986 mentioned a meeting planned for 
the following day between rodriguez and bush 
felix rodriguez a counterinsurgency expert who is visiting 
from el salvador will provide a briefing on the status of the war 
in el salvador and resupply of the contras the memo said 
bush aides later testified the memo was simply mistaken 
in may copies of norths diary were released by a private 
watchdog group showing that north met with bush only hours after 
lying to a congressional panel by denying that any us officials 
were helping the contras at the time aug 6 1986 federal aid to 
the contras had been cut off 
both gadd and dutton also a retired air force colonel 
testified for the prosecution at norths 1989 trial and they also 
testified under grants of immunity at the irancontra hearings 
efforts to locate gadd over the weekend were not successful 
there is no telephone listing under his name in the area of 
washington dc where the deposition was taken

the worlds most powerful agriculture officials 
prepared sunday to tackle some of the thorniest disputes in world 
trade farm issues 
top agriculture officials from the united states japan canada 
and australia were to open a twoday meeting in ireland on monday 
with the european communitys agriculture minister 
the european community said the five farm officials will assess 
developments since the group of seven summit in houston earlier 
this month where the industrial worlds leaders gave impetus to 
efforts to end farm supports 
the meeting is an occasion for certain major players to 
exchange views that is extremely useful an ec official who 
spoke on conditon of anonymity said friday 
through the general agreement on tariffs and trade gatt 105 
nations are negotiating for more liberalized world trade which 
could bring added growth and prosperity to the worlds economies 
there are doubts that an overall agreement can be reached by the 
end of gatt talks in december 
the gatt talks cover 15 areas of trade including intellectual 
property rights textiles traderelated investment and trade in 
services but the principal disagreements center on agriculture 
the united states and 14 other farmexporting countries want the 
12nation ec to end its export credits system and cut direct 
subsidies for farmers which the critics say distort trade 
the developed worlds farm subsidies cost consumers and 
taxpayers 245 billion last year according to the parisbased 
organization for economic cooperation and development it said the 
ecs cost was 93 billion japans 68 billion and the united 
states 46 billion 
the ec agriculture minister ray macsharry of ireland called 
this weeks meeting to be held at dromoland castle near shannon in 
western ireland 
attending are agriculture secretary clayton yeutter japanese 
agriculture minister tomio yamamoto australian agriculture 
minister john kerins and canadian agriculture minister donald 
mazankowski 
domestic agricultural policies international agricultural 
trade rural development and eastern europe are on the agenda the 
ec said 
the communique issued at the houston summit left it to gatt 
negotatiators to decide how much to cut subsidies but suggested 
that trade negotiators use as a basis a compromise proposal written 
by the chairman of gatts agricultural negotiating committee 
dutchman aart de zeeuw 
the paper called for quick cuts of export subsidies as part of 
lowering farm support levels 
the farm subsidies were the toughest issue negotiated at the 
houston summit attending by the leaders of the united states 
japan germany france britain italy and canada as well as the 
ec 
the summits communique called for substantial progressive 
reductions in support and protection of agriculture covering 
internal regimes market access and export subsidies 
but it also conceded the ec point that variations among 
countries in the mechanisms of agricultural support reflect the 
differences in the social and economic conditions of farming

this winters tale of haute couture as seen last 
week was a fabulous fantasy with designers spinning out their 
dreams in rich confections for the elite or just for show 
short to shorter is the norm in daytime lengths though houses 
like saint laurent and givenchy generally kept skirts wearably just 
above the knee 
and was enough gold and jeweled embroidery around to boost many 
prices into the stratosphere 
but dream on and take note of silhouettes fabrics and 
color often more modestly available in readytowear there is a 
rainbow of possibilities with each designer pushing his own 
outlines and themes 
the fashion world was pleased to see claude montana win the 
coveted golden thimble award for his lanvin collection following 
his disappointing debut there last january 
his pyramid shortie coats and babydoll jackets his lean pants 
or skirt suits his great use of luxury fabrics from cashmere to 
faille taffeta showed montanas mastery of his art so often 
praised before in his own luxury readytowear line 
the pyramid shape or other shortiecoat looks cropped up all 
over the place saint laurents more sober versions have deep full 
dolmen sleeves 
shoulders are mainly rounded even sloped the only holdouts 
for important padding are saint laurent and givenchy 
suits are bodyskimming but not so tight as a few seasons ago 
with great long jackets and some nice flyaway boleros 
generally the daytime fabrics were smooth light and soft in 
cashmeres or broadcloth or tweedy with flecked or herringbones 
some bold black and red plaids great at valentino for example 
python is a new favorite for trim at givenchy for a whole jacket 
or more at saint laurent 
daytime colors included fall standbys siena gray burnt 
orange ochre pine and brick plus some white and all the browns 
from caramel to chocolate diors gianfranco ferre did 
extraordinary things with mixes of blue shades from plum to 
ultramarine or indigo 
in both daytime and lateday wear karl lagerfeld at chanel 
pleased those who would like to look young and kittenish with minis 
over fancy thigh boots from hot satin to jeweled or embroidered 
suede 
lagerfelds boots were among the most flamboyant in a 
newlyrevived trend for long lean and high or flatheeled boots 
he seems torn between the 1960s ingenue look and the l8th 
century of marieantoinette topping dressy skimpy minis with big 
satin and taffeta embroidered pannier skirts 
exotic lands and themes inspired many designers jeanlouis 
scherrer was praised for a collection based on the splendors of 
north africa and the near east in persianrug weaves for his suits 
and colorful hooded burnoosestyle coats 
except for a wild jeweled bathing suit with tights christian 
lacroix kept his exuberance in check though there was plenty of 
glamor in evening dresses inspired by goya or contemporary gold 
lame suits topped with enormous velvet artists berets as well as 
some extravagant moorishstyle embroidery 
everything came up roses at ungaro who used magnificent flower 
prints from dawn to dark his bright piped tweed daytime suits in 
grey red or royal blue with their checked stoles were stunning too 
it was in evening wear however that ungaro and other 
couturiers turned into real showmen his extravagant rosy silk 
panniered dresses might not be to everybodys taste but he offered 
an alternative glamorous black slinky crepe or chiffon gowns with 
halter necklines camisole or scoopedout tops draped in 
rhinestones or pearls 
for evening anything goes as long as it looks rich and 
decolletes are more daring than ever with bosoms pushed up under 
empire curved bodices visible in sparkly net or chiffon 
seethroughs or suggestive with necklines slashed to the waist 
feathers came out often ostriches pheasant cock and other 
types were used scherrers spicy asymmetrical draped and feathered 
minis were especially titillating

most of alaska is the sort of country 
smokejumpers were born for vast tracts of roadless wilderness 
accessible only by air 
but in this extremely dry summer many fires are too big for the 
crack parachute firefighters whose purpose is to prevent small 
fires from growing and the men are grounded for days by 
unfavorable weather 
sundays weather was slightly improved with lower temperatures 
and showers scattered across the state meaning fires werent 
growing nearly as fast as they did last week said trish 
hogervorstrukke of the interagency fire coordination center in 
fairbanks 
dozens of fires burned hundreds of thousands of acres of 
unpopulated land saturday near the central alaska city of mcgrath 
about 225 miles northwest of anchorage 
nobody was fighting them 
theyre a little bored we havent jumped a fire in two 
days said allen biller 34 of fairbanks leader of a 
smokejumper unit that was killing time at the mcgrath airport 
nobody smoked the air just smells that way here these days 
we were pulled off a fire two days ago because the winds 
kicked up and it got away from us he said there was no use in 
staying because we couldnt catch it 
as of sunday morning 2176501 acres of alaskan timber and 
tundra had been burned since the fire season began this month an 
area more than three times the size of rhode island and 119 fires 
were still active hogervorst said more than 5 million acres 
burned in 1957 in 1969 more than 4 million acres burned 
the states largest fire had burned 210000 acres at kanuti 140 
miles northwest of fairbanks 
smokejumpers the top firefighting units of the bureau of land 
management and the forest service usually can keep nine of 10 
alaska blazes they attack from spreading they say 
not so this year 
ive been on a lot of fires this year in alaska and i think 
weve only caught one said roger staats 26 of mccall idaho 
its hard on guys morale 
smokejumpers need a good head start on a fire catching it when 
its still small this summer smoke from other fires has obscured 
the flames giving the small ones time to grow undetected 
biller whose job is to spot fires from the plane to see if 
smokejumpers should jump said he has bypassed more sites than 
usual this summer because the fires were already too big for the 
small number of people on hand 
and while fire retardant usually is dropped from planes to help 
smokejumpers this summer the vegetation is so dry the retardant 
isnt working officials said 
alaska is having one of its most arid seasons on record 
according to the national weather service since june 21 mcgrath 
has had about 1 inch of rain compared with an average 18 inches 
last week billers unit of eight smokejumpers parachuted to a 
threeacre fire southwest of mcgrath they worked on it from noon 
all the way to 5 pm the next day but couldnt prevent it from 
racing to 500 acres the smokejumpers pulled out and have been in 
mcgrath waiting ever since 
the vast majority of fires those that arent near villages or 
cabins are just being left to burn out 
even so there were about 2700 people working 19 fires in 
alaska only a fraction of them smokejumpers officials said 
were just bare bones with people resources said andy 
alexandrou a state forester in mcgrath weve been bouncing 
people around from fire to fire trying to keep pace with it 
firefighters in alaska face problems not often encountered in 
the lower 48 states in addition to forests they must fight blazes 
on the treeless tundra a mat of arcticregion vegetation that 
usually sops up water like a sponge this summer firefighters say 
even the bottom of the sponge is dry 
a fire doused on the surface can leave embers that burn through 
the lower layer and erupt to the surface elsewhere 
down south a fire usually creeps along the ground from tree to 
tree but once you get a line around it you can mop it up said 
staats here you soak it and soak it and you turn around and 
its burning all over again 
and heavy equipment like bulldozers cant be used against fires 
here partly because the tundra is too fragile but mainly because 
usually there isnt a road within hundreds of miles 
beneath the tundra is permafrost down south you could scrape 
a fire line with your boots theres dirt said alexandrou 
here youd break your boot

president mikhail s gorbachev on sunday urged 
impatient soviet republics not to print their own money saying it 
would damage efforts to reform the banking and credit system 
gorbachev made the appeal in a directive setting in motion an 
analysis of the countrys banking system by officials from both the 
15 soviet republics and moscow 
gorbachev in an appeal transmitted by the tass news agency 
said he wanted the republics to understand the negative 
socialeconomic consequences that could result from breaking the 
united monetary system of the country releasing money of the 
republic that would have closed sphere of circulation 
to correct the finances of the country the strength of all 
union republics and the carrying out of active coordinated money 
and financialbudget policy is necessary he said 
the baltic republics of lithuania latvia and estonia are all 
working on plans to print their own money as they press for 
complete independence from the soviet union earlier this month 
the ukraine included plans for a separate currency in its 
declaration of sovereignty 
the chairman of the european community which is looking for 
ways to help the soviet economy said on a visit to moscow on july 
20 that it would be a devastating blow to soviet efforts to 
integrate into the world economy if republics started printing 
their own money 
to complete the building of a european community we decided to 
have a single financial system and a single currency jacques 
delors said 
that is why we said we were surprised on hearing that the 
ukraine and other republics want to introduce their own 
currencies delors said i think that at this stage of economic 
reforms that step would have devastating consequences 
on saturday foreign minister eduard shevardnadze said the 
soviet union is ready to join the international monetary fund 
our country regards its membership in the imf as a logical 
continuation of its policy of wider involvement in global economic 
cooperation tass quoted shevardnadze as telling michel 
camdessus the managing director of the fund 
camdessus responded positively to the proposal tass said

the heads of the worlds main 
cocaineproducing countries said sunday they welcomed us 
antidrug efforts but said poor andean peasants who grow the coca 
leaf need another way to make a living 
members of the andean presidential council issued a joint 
declaration saying the fight against drugs was not only a law 
enforcement problem but one with political economic and social 
dimensions 
the presidents virgilio barco of colombia jaime paz zamora of 
bolivia alberto fujimori of peru carlos andres perez of 
venezuela patricio aylwin of chile and carlos menem of argentina 
met privately late saturday in lima only hours after fujimoris 
inauguration 
ecuador was represented by its vice president luis parodi 
perus presidential office said 
at his swearingin ceremony on saturday fujimori said peru will 
combat drug trafficking but he said it is not fair or realistic to 
expect peruvian peasants to simply stop growing coca leaf from 
which cocaine is made without some other livelihood to turn to 
the andean presidents said cropsubstitution efforts were a top 
priority 
they reiterated overall support for a us antidrug plan 
announced by president bush in cartagena colombia in february 
involving bolivia colombia and peru but they said the united 
states also must provide financial help to the poor latin nations 
trying to stop drug production 
the bush administration has proposed a 2 billionplus program 
of military economic police and drug enforcement administration 
aid to bolivia colombia and peru through 1994 
latin countries however have been wary about allowing direct 
us antidrug operations in their countries often on the grounds 
that in doing so would represent a loss of sovreignty

she was a playboy club waitress turned 
policewoman then a fired officer convicted of killing her 
husbands exwife in a trial that left many doubting her guilt 
now 31yearold lawrencia bambi bembenek has captured the 
publics taste for the lurid again this time by escaping from 
prison and apparently fleeing with her fiance dominick gugliatto 
the couple disappeared july 15 just three weeks before their 
scheduled prison wedding touching off a fugitive love story that 
has caught the publics fancy and left many cheering her escape 
theres something about her history that appeals to the voyeur 
in everyone said sociologist eleanor miller 
the renewed interest in the case has prompted entrepreneurs to 
sell run bambi run tshirts and bumper stickers and cardboard 
cutouts of the former model 
it also has left hundreds calling for a new trial for her 
creating a circuslike atmosphere in her native milwaukee 
ms bembenek once a waitress at the nowdefunct playboy club in 
lake geneva became a police officer in milwaukee in the late 
1970s she was fired from the department in 1980 for lying and the 
next year was arrested in the shooting death of christine schultz 
mrs schultz was the exwife of ms bembeneks thenhusband 
police detective elfred schultz she was found by her two young 
sons in her bed she had been bound gagged and shot in the back 
apparently by schultzs gun 
police speculated ms bembenek took her husbands revolver and 
shot mrs schultz over the 700amonth in alimony that schultz had 
been ordered to pay his exwife 
a jury convicted ms bembenek of firstdegree murder despite 
testimony from one of the victims sons that the person seen in the 
house the night of the killing was not ms bembenek 
prosecutors while rejecting calls for a new trial have 
conceded their case against ms bembenek was based on 
circumstantial evidence 
when ms bembenek escaped she was serving a life term but would 
have been eligible for parole in 1993 her efforts to win a new 
trial have been rejected by state appeals courts three times and 
the state supreme court once 
even nine years later many remain convinced she was innocent 
the victim of circumstantial evidence and poor police work more 
than 200 people showed up for a run bambi run rally friday 
outside the courthouse where she was convicted 
they gave impassioned speeches calling for a new trial raised 
money for a legal defense fund sold bembenek memorabilia and even 
wished her good luck in avoiding capture 
police believe ms bembenek fled with gugliatto a 34yearold 
milwaukee factory worker whom she planned to marry aug 3 in a 
prison chapel wedding prison officials say she squeezed out of a 
laundryroom window and scaled a 7foot high fenced laced with 
barbed wire 
gugliattos parents and his sisters were among those gathered at 
the rally last week florence gugliatto his mother said the 
family believed the two were together although they had not heard 
from the couple 
even before the escape ms bembeneks case got plenty of 
attention 
a private investigator volunteered to painstakingly review all 
evidence in the case in hopes of finding a compelling argument to 
overturn her conviction a suitor donated 30000 for her legal 
expenses and a congressman asked the fbi to review the evidence 
so why such a fascination for a woman branded by the justice 
system as a killer 
ms bembenek is very beautiful and can look very beautiful in 
a variety of ways and that has added to her mystique explained 
ms miller a professor at the university of wisconsinmilwaukee 
the sense is somehow the criminal justice system is the bad 
guy and she is the good guy she said 
another sociologist claims ms bembenek fits the role of the 
femme fatale the alluring but dangerous woman fancied in novel 
and movies 
no one knows exactly who she is said richard knudten of 
marquette university in milwaukee either she is very clever or 
else she fully believes in her innocence its much more 
titillating and much more exciting than most homicides by far

president chadli bendjedid said sunday 
that he would move up parliamentary elections making a major 
concession to moslem fundamentalists who swept junes local 
elections 
bendjedid said the decision to dissolve the national peoples 
assembly and hold early elections in the first four months of 1991 
was made after lengthy reflection and my conviction that the 
political parties will respect the rules of democracy 
elections had been scheduled for february 1992 
the decision came days after islamic salvation front leader 
abassi madani made his latest call for the immediate dissolution of 
the assembly 
the islamic salvation front won a wide victory in the june 12 
municipal and provincial elections the first multiparty voting 
since algeria gained independence from france in 1962 since then 
madani says the parliament represents nothing 
the ruling national liberation front holds all 295 seats in the 
assembly the party trailed second in the june balloting which was 
boycotted by many opposition parties 
bendjedid said the elections would only take place if conditions 
for peace and security are met he did not elaborate 
we are thus giving the people the occasion to choose freely 
their representatives said bendjedid at a special cabinet 
session installing the nations first defense minister gen khaled 
nezzar 
he added that his decision in no way signifies that the actual 
assembly has failed in its mission 
the front has ruled algeria for nearly 30 years but is in the 
midst of a broad restructuring following its june defeat in local 
elections 
a new constitution allowing pluralism was approved in a february 
1989 referendum the changes were made following the 1988 riots 
spurred by an economic crisis in which hundreds of people were 
killed 
since the june elections the islamic salvation front has moved 
to introduce programs based on islamic law in the localities it 
controls 
algerian radio announced earlier sunday that wearing shorts has 
been made illegal in the vacation town of jijel in eastern algeria 
a decree forbidding shorts in tipaza a tourist resort 50 miles 
west of algiers had been issued earlier the islamic salvation 
front controls both towns 
islamic fundamentalists consider wearing shorts to be immodest

a referendum on sunday calling for 
popular presidential elections was headed for defeat because voter 
turnout was too low media reports said 
under current law legislators pick the president switching 
over to a popular vote would have required the backing of 50 
percent of hungarys 78 million voters 
hungarian television said only 15 percent turned out far short 
of the number needed 
scorching weather and the holiday season were blamed in part for 
the low turnout sunday was the hottest day in hungary this year 
with 90degree temperatures 
of those who did take part 88 percent voted in favor of a 
direct presidential vote while 12 percent voted for presidential 
elections by lawmakers 
parliament is currently dominated by the conservative democratic 
forum and other centerright parties 
if the failure of the referendum is officially confirmed it 
would be a blow to the the socialists the former communists who 
were defeated in this springs first free multiparty elections in 
more than 40 years 
the socialists wanted a direct presidential vote because former 
premier miklos nemeth still enjoys considerable popularity and 
they believed he might have had a chance to be elected president in 
a popular vote 
at least one parliamentary faction the smallholders party had 
called for a boycott of the referendum it said the country needs 
economic improvement not a referendum or presidential election 
others criticized the election date in the middle of the 
summervacation season and criticized the referendums 66 
million cost 
an agreement signed last september by the government and 
opposition state that hungary called for revival of the 
parliamentary system that existed before the communist takeover 
after world war ii 
some politicians though contended the parliamentary system was 
fragile and the country needed an independent presidency 
a constitutional amendment passed in the final days of the 
previous communistdominated parliament stipulated that the 
president must be elected directly 
in april the biggest party in parliament the hungarian 
democratic forum and the biggest opposition party the league of 
free democrats signed an agreement calling for the constitution to 
be amended yet again and the president elected by parliament 
in response the socialists launched a petition drive and 
succeeded in calling a referendum on the subject

well as in the disputed region of nagornokarabakh according to a 
spokesman for the armenian national movement 
the measure will be discussed further at the legislative session 
monday said the spokesman in a telephone interview from armenias 
capital of yerevan 
the spokesman who declined to give his name said the lawmakers 
believe the presidential decree contradicts the armenian 
constitution 
gorbachev issued a decree wednesday giving illegally armed 
militants across the country 15 days to turn in their weapons or 
risk having them confiscated by local police officials of the 
republics or interior ministry troops 
soviet interior minister vadim a bakatin said friday that if 
armed groups disobeyed the order military force would be used he 
referred specifically to armed groups in armenia 
he estimated that between 10000 and 20000 armenians were 
involved in illegally armed groups but said others put the figure 
at 40000 and as high as 100000 
bakatin acknowledged there could be problems implementing 
gorbachevs decree if moscow does not have the full cooperation of 
the republics 
the interfax news agency affiliated with radio moscow reported

wanted to form an independent armenian army during the 15 days 
gorbachevs decree encompassed all groups that threatened 
peoples lives seized arms assaulted soldiers or police or 
attacked military and civilian facilities 
besides armenia bakatin said illegally armed groups also 
operate in moldavia georgia azerbaijan latvia lithuania and 
estonia 
bakatin said interior ministry troops would be sent to republics 
requesting them and army troops could go in if a state of 
emergency were declared he said many local officials are swept up 
in the same nationalism as their neighbors and are powerless to 
stop ethnic fighting

automatic weapons bakatin said 
interior ministry soldiers already patrol the border between 
azerbaijan and armenia at least 200 more have been killed and 
many thousands have been forced to flee their homes in violence 
between armenians and azerbaijanis in the past two years 
much of the bloodshed has been over who should govern the region 
of nagornokarabakh a mostly armenian enclave controled by 
azerbaijan since 1923 
meanwhile in the republic of georgia hundreds of protesters 
demanding immediate registration of political groups for multiparty 
elections were blocking trains at a railroad hub

nearly 6000 people crowded into this small 
southcentral oregon town for a tongueincheek celebration of an 
insect whose bite and whining buzz drive people up the wall 
the seventh annual mosquito festival featured giant replicas of 
the insect and the coronation of a ms quito 45yearold joanne 
solheim 
the festival was started in 1983 as a way to raise money to 
combat swarms of hungry mosquitoes that flew into the town of 365 
residents from irrigated fields on nearby ranches and from adjacent 
swamps 
a woman named beverly hills cochairwoman of the event said 
saturdays festival was the biggest and best we have had in seven 
years and if youll notice there werent any mosquitoes that 
means our program is working 
organizers said the festival usually raises about 20000 with 
approximately 11000 left over for mosquito control after expenses 
are paid 
the money buys biologically safe insecticide that is sprayed in 
town to knock down adult mosquitoes and attack mosquito larvae in 
the ponds and puddles where they breed 
the parade was indicative of the towns laidback style there 
were several gaps between entries with some float drivers stopping 
occasionally to talk with friends along the route 
before mosquito eradication efforts began in ernest 17 
varieties of the little pests were identified around paisley

walkers point 
i cannot tell you whether there was any fish caught

israel called sunday for the elimination of 
chemical weapons in the middle east and denied that israel 
possesses such arms 
the statement issued by the defense ministry came two days 
after science minister yuval neeman warned that israel could 
respond in kind if iraq used chemical weapons against it 
neeman who also heads israels space program later said he had 
been misunderstood 
iraqs president saddam hussein has threatened in the past to 
use chemical weapons against israel if iraq was attacked with 
nuclear weapons 
sundays statement said israel is a signatory of the geneva 
protocol of 1925 and abides by it the protocol prohibits the use 
of chemical weapons 
the statement issued by ministry spokesman dan naveh expressed 
dismay that other countries who also are signatories of this 
protocol have violated it 
israel hopes that in the near future we may have a new 
comprehensive convention for the total elimination of chemical 
weapons a convention that will deal with the middle east problem 
and israels security needs the statement added 
in iraq a spokesman for the foreign minister criticized the 
united states for maintaining silence over neemans statement on 
friday 
everybody knows that israel has all kinds of weapons of mass 
destruction said the spokesman who was not identified but we 
are surprised that america and the west made a lot of fuss about 
iraqs weapons potential and kept silent on the statement by the 
isreli minister 
saddam threatened in april to attack israel with chemical 
weapons if the jewish state attacked iraq with nuclear arms 
in my opinion we have an excellent response and that is to 
threaten saddam hussein with the same merchandise neeman said 
friday 
israeli officials have refused to discuss foreign reports that 
the country has stockpiled nuclear arms although it is widely 
believed that israel has chemical weapons officials have never 
admitted it

kuwait said sunday it welcomed a meeting aimed at 
settling differences with iraq but said both countries should have 
a chance to air their grievances 
two weeks ago iraq accused its tiny neighbor of border 
encroachments and producing more than its opec quota of oil and 
iraqi president saddam hussein threatened use of military force 
kuwait said it hoped the talks set tuesday in saudi arabia 
would bring a just settlement of all pending problems between 
the two countries in a manner ensuring the national sovereignty 
and legitimate rights of each country 
the kuwaiti statement stressed the need for objective and cool 
dialogue but did not specify what kuwait was seeking 
the saudi press agency said late sunday that the meeting was 
scheduled for tuesday the official iraqi news agency also 
announced that the meeting would take place then 
a diplomatic source in saudi arabia speaking on condition of 
anonymity said kuwait had balked at iraqi conditions for the 
talks saying that would amount to acknowledging all iraqi charges 
and demands beforehand 
mediators egypt and saudi arabia had hoped to arrange earlier 
talks between iraq and kuwait in the saudi summer capital of 
jiddah but they did not materialize 
the kuwaitiraq tension eased somewhat last week after members 
of the organization of petroleum exporting countries agreed to 
respect production quotas in an effort to reach a target price of 
21 per barrel 3 above the previous target the aim is to boost 
the price of oil 
sundays kuwaiti statement issued after the weekly cabinet 
meeting said it hoped all opec states would adhere to the quotas 
to boost cohesion of the organization and achieve the interest of 
all parties concerned 
diplomatic sources said kuwait had demanded that as a condition 
for talks iraq withdraw troops sent to the 100mile border during 
the crisis 
however the sources said the 30000 troops remained in place 
and kuwait apparently shelved that precondition

an official with the agency that arranges tours 
for jewish teenagers said sunday he hoped a bomb explosion on a 
beach that killed a 17yearold canadian will not frighten visitors 
from israel 
marnie kimelman of willowdale ontario died of a shrapnel wound 
saturday after a bomb exploded on a tel aviv beach she had been 
visiting israel on a tour organized by the canadian zionist 
federation 
no group claimed responsibiliy for the explosion police 
detained eight arabs for questioning in the bombing 
on sunday the 42 canadians also on miss kimelmans tour 
returned to the beach where she was killed for a brief memorial 
service several other people on the tour were among the 19 
slightly wounded in the blast 
in ottawa external affairs minister joe clark said sunday that 
canada was shocked and angered by what he described as acts 
of senseless violence which only serve to deepen fear and 
hatred 
the canadians who are on a sixweek tour are among 5000 north 
american youths who are participating in summer programs in israel 
this year 
it is only natural after a tragic accident that people will 
have a second thought but i think if this happens then the 
terrorists simply get what they want and nobody wants that said 
gad ben ari a spokesman for the quasigovernmental jewish agency 
this is very clearly a tragic event which could not be 
prevented or anticipated he said 
saar kadmon the israeli tour guide for the canadian group said 
at least 15 teenagers who were on the beach when the bomb exploded 
have asked to return to canada and that ten families have asked 
that their children be sent home 
its hard to argue with parents when they hear that even in 
tel aviv its not safe for their kids kadmon said on israel army 
radio 
ms kimelman was the fourth tourist and third canadian killed 
during the 31monthlong palestinian uprising against israeli 
occupation of the west bank and gaza strip the other three were 
among 16 people who died when a palestinian grabbed the steering 
wheel of a bus and sent it plunging down a ravine off the tel 
avivjerusalem highway in july 1989 
in the revolt 724 palestinians have been killed by israeli 
soldiers and civilians and 45 israelis have been slain by 
palestinians

housing minister ariel sharon presented a plan 
sunday for housing about 1 million immigrants mostly soviet jews 
that is expected to cost 135 billion over the next five years 
sharons plan presented to the rightwing governments cabinet 
does not include constructing new housing in occupied arab 
territories 
the cabinet held a fivehour debate on the program but made no 
decision and scheduled further deliberations for a special meeting 
thursday an assistant to cabinet secretary elyakim rubinstein said 
most of the housing will be needed for an expected massive 
influx of soviet jews which has resulted from rising fears of 
antisemitism in the soviet union liberalized soviet emigration 
policies and tighter us restrictions on visas for soviet jews 
going there 
already this year 61000 soviet jews have emigrated to israel 
and 90000 more may arrive by the end of the year 
the immigration wave has pushed up rents and caused a housing 
shortage creating a potentially explosive ethnic and social 
situation 
according to sharons plan details of which have been widely 
reported in the israeli media the country will need 550000 new 
housing units in the next five years for israeli families and an 
estimated 1 million immigrants 
sharon has proposed purchasing locally or importing 50000 house 
trailers and 40000 prefabricated homes 
of these 3000 house trailers and 20000 prefabricated homes 
would be bought immediately as part of an emergency package that 
also includes renovating 8500 governmentowned apartments 
the hebrew daily yediot ahronot said sharons plans call for 
initial funding of 22 billion the israeli media reported 
sharons plan would cost 135 billion over five years but housing 
officials would not confirm the figure 
sharons new program is opposed by finance minister yitzhak 
modai who dislikes the idea of prefabricated housing for new 
immigrants 
speaking friday on israel army radio modai suggested housing 
soviet immigrants in tent camps or barracks like those used for 
sephardic jews arriving in the 1950s he said the government should 
concentrate on finding jobs for the new arrivals 
after sundays cabinet session modai said sharons plan was too 
expensive and he would present a more modest plan at 
thursdays cabinet meeting 
israel has been seeking 400 million in loan guarantees from the 
united states to help house the soviet immigrants 
the bush administration has made any us aid for helping 
absorb soviet jewish immigrants conditional on an israeli guarantee 
that money would not help settle the new arrivals in areas outside 
israels 1967 borders including arab east jerusalem 
israel has declined to provide such a guarantee saying it would 
not encourage immigrants to move to the occupied territories but 
would not prevent them from doing so either 
israeli officials have said only a fraction among the tens of 
thousands of soviet immigrants arriving since april 1989 have 
settled in the occupied territories

portofspain trinidad ap looters hauled away carloads of 
television sets and other appliances while vigilante squads guarded 
some homes sunday during the chaos of an armed uprising by moslem 
extremists 
fires broke out in several parts of the capital portofspain 
and a thick cloud of acrid smoke hung over the city 
a governmentimposed curfew took effect in midafternoon and 
the streets were deserted except for looters 
everybody is trying to secure themselves because people dont 
know whats going to happen said trinidanian ian mckenzie who 
was watching looters on the outskirts of portofspain we dont 
want our country this way we are a democratic country 
in middleclass and upperclass neighborhoods residents banded 
together to stave off attacks several homes in the westmoorings 
suburb about six miles northwest of the capital were ransacked 
and residents fenced off the area to keep intruders away 
a witness said he said two men armed with 12gauge shotguns 
and a 38caliber revolver trying to shoot open a large safe by 
the side of a road 
widespread looting broke out along the churchillroosevelt 
highway the main artery between the airport and the capital 
people pulled their cars up to warehouses and filled them with 
refrigerators televisions and radios 
supermarkets pharmacies clothing hardware and appliance 
stores were systematically stripped by convoys of vehicles looting 
also spread outside the capital to the villages of barataria san 
juan mount hope and el socorro 
anglican bishop clive abdullah broadcast an appeal over 
governmentrun radio for looters to stop 
my heart goes out to those who are hungry and have to enter 
places to take foodstuffs i can perhaps ask gods forgiveness for 
this he said 
but when you line up a convoy of vehicles to take away items 
like refrigerators television sets and videos that is not right 
army and police patrolled downtown portofspain around the 
parliament building known as red house where prime minister 
arthur robinson was being held hostage by black moslem rebels 
but in many parts of the city no police were visible some 
people kept an eye out for police while friends looted stores 
on saturday a witness in the picadilly area of eastern 
portofspain said about 50 policemen fired shots into the air to 
stop the looters but people ignored them and continued to plunder 
stores

cockroaches inspire most people to swat smack 
or stomp or withdraw in disgust 
but they inspire jamie buchsbaum to create sculpture of a sort 
dressing giant dead roaches up in celebrity costumes 
buchsbaum 26 is president of cockroaches unlimited a business 
he founded last october to market his cockroach creations 
pete roach elvis proachley santa roach and his eight tiny 
roachdeer all have found a place in buchsbaums pantheon of pests 
if it sounds disgusting well thats what buchsbaums after 
everyone recognizes roaches and most people are pretty 
disgusted by them he said i thought that would add to what i 
was doing to pick the most disgusting insect and turn it into 
something not disgusting 
buchsbaum said he has made roach couture a serious pursuit for 
about two years starting in 1988 with a santa roach display 
everything kind of took off from there he said 
buchsbaum said he gets most of his roaches after they die of 
natural causes at the insect exhibit at the cincinnati zoo where 
he works as a volunteer these are not your average domestic 
roaches they are nightmaresize exotics including the bat cave 
cockroach and the south american giant 
he stores the little corpses in the freezer until he is ready to 
create 
before painting or clothing one he positions its legs then 
bakes it for two hours 
buchsbaums elvis proachley sculpture is a south american giant 
roach displayed in elvis presleys trademark regalia white 
jumpsuit guitar microphone and blue suede shoes 
he acknowledged that there hasnt been a consumer stampede for 
his creations 
everyone seems to think theyre really neat but as far as 
buying it hasnt been going too well buchsbaum said 
the only poster of his creations that he has out on the market 
so far batroach the antitrend has raised the ire of time 
warner inc which owns the rights to batman 
time warner sent buchsbaum a letter claiming the poster 
infringed on its rights to batman said buchsbaums lawyer nancy 
greiwe 
were continuing to discuss the matter to work out a 
resolution ms greiwe said 
however that turns out buchsbaum a research assistant at the 
university of cincinnati isnt through with roaches 
i definitely want to keep going with it to see what i can do 
as long as i dont lose too much money on it he said

its no more yo ho ho and a bottle 
of rum for the navy which is trying to deglamorize alcohol a 
switch of longstanding tradition in its clubs for enlisted men and 
officers 
its not like it used to be i remember those days when you 
would just get totally bombed and stay at the clubs until you 
passed out said pensacola naval air station spokesman harry 
white 
the change in navy philosophy is evident at navy bases here and 
in pensacola where antidrinking programs abound and recreation 
and other activities are becoming popular on navy bases 
we want to get across to sailors that there are ways to enjoy 
their leisure time other than drinking said julian barrs 
director of mayport naval stations morale welfare and recreation 
department 
nick young spokesman for jacksonville naval air station and a 
former sailor said hes seen a 180degree change in the navys 
philosphy about alcohol 
for years us sailors were given a daily ration of spirits 
called a grog with their bread salt pork and peas a tradition 
rooted in the rumpowered british navy the practice was banned in 
1862 and one lament went theyve raised his pay three cents a 
day but stopped his grog forever 
all booze was banned in 1914 when the bluenosed teetotaler 
josephus daniels as secretary of the navy ended the custom of 
officers having wine in their quarters he earned the bitter 
nickname grape juice josephus 
even so drinking was the rule at navy parties 
now it often is the exception young said 
i attended a goingaway party at noon and the only alcoholic 
beverage was consumed by the guest of honor everyone else had 
cokes and iced tea young said recently drinking is thoroughly 
frowned upon 
the navy now realizes that alcohol can cause work family and 
health problems he said 
happy hours when sailors used to guzzle down two brews for the 
price of one are now forbidden free food instead now induces 
sailors into the clubs instead of extra booze 
our bartenders are instructed to stop serving sailors before 
they get too many barrs said 
in addition the naval bases in jacksonville and pensacola use a 
designateddriver program or arrange transportation to keep 
drinkers from behind the wheel 
drinking is not as popular among navy personnel as it once was 
partially because the average sailor has changed from a young 
single man to one with a wife and children barrs said 
weve got a lot of young sailors with families and drinking is 
not that attractive to them anymore barrs said 
a new 12 million mayport sports club opening in october will 
feature indoor and outdoor sports activities such as volleyball and 
basketball mayports new sports bar is one of three being opened 
on bases by harborage a dallas company the others are at norfolk 
and san diego barrs said 
the switch to the sports bars was partially resulted from a 1986 
study conducted for the navy by the university of georgia on how 
sailors liked to spend their leisure time and what they wanted in 
recreation and entertainment 
they wanted a different atmosphere in clubs barrs said 
cecil field naval air stations club just underwent a 1 
million sevenmonth renovation and has reopened as aces place a 
sports bar with a new chief petty officers club and refurbished 
dining and dance areas 
at jacksonville naval air station 19 million in improvements 
are being made to the enlistment personnel club and adding a dining 
room game room ballroom and fastfood restaurant 
the main thrust is to give people activities that are 
alternative to sitting in a bar and drinking young said 
at the pensacola naval air station a sports bar is in the 
planning stages white said 
besides providing an atmosphere that reduces drinking the clubs 
are having to scramble to find ways to recoup the money that had 
been spent on alcohol 
and come october the navy is cutting off all funds to base 
clubs 
they have to be selfsufficient or they close young said

darkness and rugged terrain slowed the 
rescue of eight injured victims of a helicopter crash that also 
killed five soldiers mostly green berets officials said sunday 
the modified uh60 blackhawk helicopter crashed during a combat 
training mission on a rugged forested mountainside about five 
miles south of this army base in western arkansas late friday night 
it was one of two fatal military helicopter crashes friday 
night the second in the southern california desert killed two 
marines and injured three others

obstacles officials said the helicopters payload was heavier 
than normal 
usually with vision problems you run into something fort 
chaffee spokesman cecil green said this one didnt run into 
anything it went down 
rescuers had to walk more than a mile in darkness and didnt 
reach the crash site until about 2 am saturday 2 hours after

a probe that is expected to take several months green said 
green said he did not know whether the pilots were wearing

portofspain trinidad ap black moslem rebel abu bakr long 
at odds with authorities says their decision to spend 500000 on 
a memorial to a dead woman leader was the straw that broke the 
camels back 
shortly after his followers seized parliament house friday bakr 
commandeered the government television station and announced he had 
overthrown prime minister arthur robinson and was holding him 
hostage with his cabinet 
speaking to the country on television he accused robinsons 
4yearold government of mismanagement and corruption he singled 
out robinsons announcement on june 23 that a monument would be 
built in honor of jean miles a senior public servant who died more 
than a decade ago 
that was the straw that broke the camels back the allocation 
of 500000 to create a concrete statue to this woman while poor 
people all over the country are starving he said 
bakr a broadshouldered 6foot2inch charismatic leader has 
long considered himself a spokesman for the poor 
a former mounted policeman who converted to islam while studying 
in canada in the early 1980s bakr founded and has been the leader 
for six years of the jamaat almuslimeen commune it is on eight 
acres of former swamp land on the western edge of portofspain 
the capital 
the rebel leader in his late40s is married and has a son and 
daughter believed to be attending the university of toronto his 
wife annisa is an executive for the trinidad and tobago 
industrial development corp 
another major source of friction with authorities is the city 
councils contention that bakr built his commune without a clear 
title to the land 
in the early 1970s the late prime minister eric williams 
donated the land to east indian moslems to build whatever they 
wanted but they never picked up the offer 
abu bakr returned from canada in 1984 and grabbed the land 
saying his black moslems had a right to it 
he built a mosque in the center and living quarters for his 250 
to 300 followers four major buildings include a kitchen for the 
poor and a large school 
the dispute came to a head in the 1980s when bakr was jailed for 
several weeks for contempt of court when he failed to answer 
charges of illegal occupation brought by the council 
over the years the commune has been raided by police looking 
for arms and ammunition they found a few rifles and small amounts 
of ammunition 
three months ago police and defense force soldiers seized a 
portion of the commune where bakr was constructing a new building 
bakr sought a court order to remove the troops 
a week ago high court judge ivol blackman ruled against bakr 
another irritant was the governments recent refusal to 
distribute free medical supplies and pharmaceuticals bakr wanted to 
donate to people of the island 
he said he had received the supplies from a un agency 
however it was widely believed in trinidad that they came from 
libya 
bakr is thought to receive financial support from libya and has 
visited that north african country several times 
he has also been highly critical of the governments record on 
fighting drugs and even formed a paramilitary squad to raid drug 
dealers this earned him the enmity of the police 
moslems in mostly hindu and christian trinidad make up 6 percent 
of the population of 13 million people 
there are only a small number of black moslems outside bakrs 
group most are east indians who consider the blacks as 
opportunists guided by politics more than the koran 
a moslem leader in canada who knew bakr when he converted to 
islam said he was committed to social justice 
hardon salamat head of the toronto and region islamic 
congregation said in an interview that he thinks bakrs action 
resulted from years and years of frustration and government 
harassment 
salamat said bakrs group receives financing from moslems around 
the world including those in toronto and montreal

easterners and scotland yard confirmed a number of arab vips had 
been there though it gave no names 
the gunman who appeared to be lebanese had been armed with a 
12bore shotgun a rifle a bayonet a replica hand gun and a fake 
bomb edwards said 
the bomb was a sophisticated hoax edwards said it 
appears he had put some great effort into his planning 
edwards said his motive for taking hostages remained a mystery 
several hostages said the man claimed relatives of his or his 
english wife were being held hostage in beirut 
the clubs owner hrad darian said the gunman lectured the 
arabs among the hostages 
his major complaint was that his arab sister countries like 
saudi arabia iraq and syria are not giving enough support to the 
palestinians darian said 
but edwards who commanded the operation said the gunman had 
been drinking heavily and appeared to have taken drugs 
his demands changed constantly and at one point the gunman 
threatened to kill himself edwards said 
bartender peter antonello said the gunman demanded a bus and 
plane to take him to beirut with 60 arab hostages 
he just said he was doing it for his wife who had gone to 
beirut with their three children this morning the barman said 
a lot of what he said just didnt make sense but at one stage 
he said god sent me to do it and i dont care if i burn myself 
up antonello said 
the barman said he was forced to help the man count the 
hostages which at the time totaled 115 
when the man burst into the club about 145 am he fired one 
gun and told club members to get downstairs said doorman 
dennis tuerena 38 who escaped with two others and alerted police 
armed officers surrounded the club and detectives started 
lengthy negotiations with the man many patrons managed to escape 
and some were released including two freed by the gunman in 
exchange for two smoked salmon sandwiches edwards said 
antonello said the gunman forced several british girls to sit in 
front of him on a coffee table as a human shield while he crouched 
behind them to avoid any possibility of being hit by a police 
marksman 
christina broderick 20 one of several young british women the 
gunman used as a human shield said she escaped when he fell over 
after drinking heavily and snorting cocaine 
the gunman had a button on his belt which was connected to 
electrical wiring and what he claimed was tnt she said he 
kept calling to the police saying come and check it its real 
she said she believed he hoped to exchange some of the arab 
hostages for relatives in beirut 
when the siege ended at 1210 pm the gunman wrapped in a red 
blanket that covered his head emerged first and was searched 
before being bundled into a police vehicle

in one of his first acts as president 
political newcomer alberto fujimori dismissed the heads of the navy 
and air force but refused sunday to explain the decision 
the moves were widely seen as an effort by fujimori a 
political outsider with little support in congress or among the 
countrys established parties to impose his authority over the 
military the military overthrew a civilian government in 1968 and 
ruled the country until 1980 
fujimori the upset winner in junes elections made the 
changes late saturday night just hours after he was sworn in as 
president and he confirmed the dismissals at a news conference 
sunday 
at his first news conference fujimori also announced a bank 
holiday for monday and tuesday he said the banks would be closed 
to help prepare the way for emergency economic measures he planned 
to announce later in the week 
peru is facing one of its worst economic crises ever with 
inflation running at 3000 percent a year 
the new president said his government needed at least 700 
million in emergency economic aid this year to feed and provide 
basic services to the countrys poor 
fujimori also said he wanted to restore perus standing with the 
international financial community by resuming payments on its 
foreign debt which now totals 20 billion 
his predecessor alan garcia had suspended debt payments in 
1986 causing peru to be cut off by international lenders 
regarding the military changes fujimori said he was confident 
that the armed forces would continue to respect the powers of the 
presidency to the same degree as in recent years 
i must deny that there exists any discontent in the armed 
forces fujimori said 
on saturday fujimori removed gen german vucetich as head of 
the air force replacing him with gen arnaldo velarde ramirez 
press reports had raised allegations of corruption against vucetich 
he also appointed adm luis montes lecaros to replace adm 
alfonso panizo as head of the navy 
however the new president retained gen jorge zegarra as head 
of the army the most powerful of the three branches of the armed 
forces 
there had been recurring rumors before fujimori defeated 
novelist mario vargas llosa in the presidential race that the navy 
might back a military coup 
highranking sources in garcias government had said senior navy 
officers were plotting a military takeover if fujimori won the 
election by a narrow margin 
but the 52yearold former college professor the son of 
japanese immigrants won a landslide victory 
panizo told the newspaper la republica that such dismissals had 
not accompanied previous changes of government the ousted navy 
commander said he expected an explanation from the new president 
asked at a news conference about panizos remarks fujimori 
refused to explain his decision 
the president does not have to give explanations he said 
he added that the laws give this right to dismiss military 
commanders to the president 
earlier this year a leading television newsman cesar 
hilderbrandt accused vucetich of making money for himself by 
manipulating air force funds deposited in private banks vucetich 
has denied the corruption allegations 
in his inaugural address saturday fujimori pledged to wage a 
campaign against what he described as widespread government 
corruption

the nations governors moved sunday toward 
endorsing a democraticled call for a national commission to 
investigate the savingsandloan crisis in what one governor called 
a vote of no confidence in the federal response so far 
on a day when the national governors association broke from its 
normal bipartisan consensus the groups executive committee voted 
to send the full governors a resolution to investigate the sampl 
bailout and find a way for equitable recovery of taxpayer money 
spent on the bailout 
the action came on a busy opening day of the governors annual 
summer conference which concludes tuesday 
michigan gov james blanchard a democrat predicted congress 
and president bush would ignore the sampl request directed at them 
but he said the statement amounted to a vote of noconfidence 
in federal action on sampls 
its really a way to say we dont have a lot of confidence in 
whats happening so far blanchard said 
republican governors mounted a futile effort to strip the 
recommendation of a commission from a statement of concern over the 
sampls gov garrey carruthers of new mexico called it a 
feelgood vote and gov john ashcroft of missouri said it would 
only delay any solution 
we dont need rocket scientists and commissions we need 
action ashcroft said 
the vote came after the governors divided in a partisan dispute 
on education a subject on which they previously had voiced only 
consensus before tentatively agreeing on the makeup of a panel 
that would grade states on their progress in education 
at democrats insistence they added a provision that the panel 
also vote on the federal governments progress toward meeting 
education goals 
democrats concerned that they not give up a political advantage 
to the white house and republicans forced cancellation of a 
bipartisan task force meeting on education reforms while they met 
alone 
they met later in private with gop colleagues and white house 
officials and announced a tentative agreement but not before 
republican gov carroll campbell of south carolina who is 
cochairman of the governors bipartisan task force on education 
reform blasted the democrats he said they were disrupting 
consensus and trying to polarize this 
if partisanship is more important than education then ill 
let them defend that campbell said 
white house chief of staff john sununu a former chairman of the 
governors association defended president bushs budget before the 
governors and said bush would insist on fundamental budget reform 
as part of any deficitreduction package 
sununu was politely received and only gently questioned about 
the bush administrations latest proposal to raise revenues by 
limiting the deduction for state income taxes by federal taxpayers 
the sampl resolution was tacked onto an existing policy statement 
sununu had authored when he was governor of new hampshire 
gov richard celeste of ohio chairman of the democratic 
governors noted to sununu that when sununu was chairman of the 
nga one of the concerns you raised at that time was how to 
protect the revenue base of state and local government 
sununu said he could not comment on details still being 
negotiated with congressional budget leaders but said the 
administrations preference was for bushs proposed budget now 
virtually discarded which had no such tax increase 
thats consistent with the concerns you raised sununu said 
the governors have written the administration opposing the 
elimination of state tax deductibility saying it would increase 
pressure on the states to limit or roll back taxes 
gov douglas wilder of virginia was one of those pushing the 
resolution on sampls he said he was not trying to attack the bush 
administration but wanted the commission to act without any 
desire to protect the reputation of those responsible 
its not a witch hunt that im interested in he said before 
the governors met the question is how did we get in this 
quagmire he said 
gov madeleine kunin of vermont a democrat pushed a proposal 
calling for regions hardest hit by the sampl collapse to pay more of 
the bailout cost but the resolution the governors took up did not 
refer to regional inequities 
the dispute over the education panel marked the first time in 
recent years that the governors have voiced anything other than 
bipartisan agreement on the issues they debate the democrats 
unscheduled meetings ran for more than two hours 
the democrats restiveness followed a private meeting they held 
a day earlier in nearby pascagoula miss 
some democrats voiced concerns privately that they were turning 
over too much influence to republicans by giving president bush 
authority to put some members on the judging panel 
the panel recommended by the governors in their meeting last 
winter would be made up of governors members of congress and 
white house appointees 
arkansas gov bill clinton cochairman of the education panel 
said the dispute was resolved with a plan to put on the panel six 
governors three from each party four bush administration 
officials and two members of congress from each party who would 
have no voting power 
white house domestic policy adviser roger porter also agreed to 
the plan 
the governors rejected a proposal by house speaker thomas s 
foley dwash and senate majority leader george mitchell 
dmaine that education specialists be included 
the panel would be given authority to issue a report card on 
each states progress in meeting education goals clinton said the 
governors wanted the panel to also issue reports on how the federal 
government was doing in meeting education goals the governors and 
bush agreed on last fall in a meeting in charlottesville va 
the governors on saturday released a report calling for a 
significant overhaul of the nations schools including a 
deemphasis on grouping elementary and secondary students by age or 
narrow categories of ability

convicted with five other people in federal court sunday in a 
scheme to launder 32 million in cocaine profits for colombias 
medellin cartel 
prosecutors hailed it as a precedentsetting case the first in 
which international bankers have been convicted under us 
moneylaundering laws and as a key victory in the war on drugs

packed with friends and relatives of the accused 
the defendants showed little emotion but people in the gallery 
broke into wails wept and hugged one another and shouted curses in 
a tumultuous scene following the verdicts one woman appeared to 
faint then ran screaming from the courtroom when she recovered 
six months in court and for this said an angry gloria 
bilgrami whose husband akbar a bilgrami and three other 
defendants are natives of pakistan all this for lies so 
this is america 
defense attorneys had little comment but one vowed appeals 
in a statement issued in washington us attorney general dick 
thornburgh said money laundering is the secret accomplice of 
deathdealing drug traffickers and todays guilty verdicts are 
significant victories in our efforts to dismantle the drug cartels 
ability to hide their tainted profits in the worldwide banking 
system 
this case is important to the united states of america said 
assistant us attorney mark jackowski because it shows that 
those who sit in the ivory tower of society the bankers in the 
gray suits they dont touch the dope but they should know that if 
they violate the law and they are convicted theyre going to jail 
an 11member panel decided the case after one original juror was 
kicked off last week for independently phoning a reputed member of 
the medellin cocaine cartel while the jury was deliberating 
jurors ordered sequestered following the incident reached 
their decision late saturday but us district judge william 
terrell hodges delayed announcing it to give outoftown attorneys 
time to get to court 
awan and the other defendants were arrested oct 6 1988 at a 
bachelor party and wedding staged by the us customs service to 
lure them to tampa 
an undercover agent who infiltrated the ring had brought in 
another undercover agent posing as his girlfriend they became part 
of the suspects social and business circles and later announced 
their engagement 
wedding invitations were sent and the suspects were put up at a 
posh resort for the weekend limousines chauffeured by undercover 
agents ferried the suspects to the bachelor bash but instead of 
stepping out of an elevator into a penthouse suite the suspects 
walked into the arms of federal agents waiting with handcuffs 
they were accused of conspiring with an undercover customs agent 
to launder 14 million in proceeds from the sale of cocaine in six 
us cities during the twoyear investigation the government 
processed 32 million in partnership with a medellin cash launderer 
before the trial began in january two subsidiaries of the 
luxembourgbased bank pleaded guilty to the moneylaundering 
charges and forfeited 15 million to the government more than 
triple the previous largest penalty ever assessed against a bank 
in addition to the hefty fine bcci one of the worlds largest 
private financial institutions with 72 offices was put on five 
years probation under the federal reserve system and agreed to open 
the books to prosecutors investigating noriega a bcci customer 
bcci in a statement issued from its london office said the 
offenses charged in the case were contrary to the expressed 
written policies of the bank and were not known to senior 
management or its board of directors 
also convicted sunday were ian howard and sibte hassan of bccis 
paris branch akbar a bilgrami of the banks miami branch syed 
aftab hussain who worked for bcci in panama and the colombian 
businessman aircraft broker rudolph armbrecht 
hodges ordered all the defendants taken into custody by us 
marshals but he did not set a date for sentencing the six each 
face up to five years on the main conspiracy charge they also 
individually face sentencing on specific moneylaundering counts 
that each have a 20year maximum 
hassan was convicted on three of six moneylaundering counts 
the others were all convicted of all the moneylaundering counts 
lodged against them awan on 14 bilgrami on 21 hussain on 19 
armbrecht on nine and howard on four 
prosecutors portrayed the defendants as greedy men eager to help 
hide hefty sums of cash from drug sales in american cities through 
intricate global banking transactions 
defense attorneys however maintained their clients didnt know 
they were breaking any laws and were set up by overzealous 
government agents who turned what seemed to be a legitimate banking 
relationship into a moneylaundering business

mongolians narrowly elected 
communist party chief gombojavyn ochirbat in a key legislative race 
of this nations first multiparty elections early results showed 
monday 
more than 90 percent of eligible voters some braving heavy 
rains that washed out roads cast ballots sunday to determine 
whether the communist party should stay in power after nearly seven 
decades of authoritarian rule 
by holding its first multiparty election ever this remote 
central asian nation joins the ranks of sovietbloc countries that 
are experimenting with democracy 
results from individual races began trickling in monday morning 
in the most dramatic race of the election the communist party 
leader narrowly defeated his noncommunist challenger ganbold a 
29yearold lawyer ganbolds party the party of new progress 
said ochirbat won slightly more than 51 percent of the vote in ulan 
bators legislative district 12 to ganbolds nearly 48 percent 
some votes were invalid 
nationwide figures will not be ready until tuesday said 
sharvamdy secretary of the national election commission who like 
most mongolians uses only one name 
both the communists and the opposition say they want to 
establish rule by law reform the stagnant economy and build closer 
ties to the west however the opposition claims the communists are 
insincere and chiefly seek to stay in power 
the communists were guaranteed control of the national 
legislature because of a shortage of opposition candidates 
but the five new noncommunist parties born out of popular 
demonstrations hoped to win in a smaller body that will meet 
between annual sessions of the full legislature 
its just a beginning said jargaal a member of the 
opposition social democratic party who was observing balloting at 
the gachuurt state farm outside ulan bator she said more time was 
needed for mongolians accustomed to a oneparty system to gain the 
courage to join another party 
entire families arrived by horse truck and car at gachuurts 
school a holiday atmosphere prevailed the elderly wore their best 
clothes usually traditional herders costumes 
sukhe a 69yearold veteran of world war ii pinned his 15 
medals on his chest some from the war and some for civilian honors 
it is a happy event he explained 
in some parts of the country heavy rains cut roads and 
telephone lines and election officials in ulan bator sent 
emissaries by plane to learn the results sharvamdy said 
polls opened at 7 am 6 pm edt saturday and closed at 10 
pm 7 am edt as of an hour before closing 919 percent of 
the approximately 1 million eligible voters had cast ballots the 
official said 
local election commissions began counting ballots by hand 
immediately after the polls closed and most expected to finish by 
monday morning the results are to be telephoned and then carried 
to the national election commission in ulan bator for computation 
voters selected candidates for the national provincial and 
local legislatures and on a separate ballot selected their 
favorite party the results of the party popularity poll will be 
used to allocate the 53 seats in the small hural which will meet 
between sessions of the 430seat great peoples hural and have 
considerable power 
the poll gives opposition parties that did not have time to put 
up candidates a chance to win small hural seats the opposition 
parties had complained that nominations were already made in many 
districts by the time they registered 
the communists formally known as the mongolian peoples 
revolutionary party legalized opposition parties only in april 
following mass demonstrations for democratic reform that were 
inspired by the ouster of communist governments in eastern europe 
mongolias communists also overhauled their leadership and 
declared their readiness to make democratic reforms 
a communist election victory would not necessarily indicate 
popular confidence in the party urban votes carry less weight than 
rural votes under the new election law skewing results in favor of 
the communists they are weakest in the cities where there is more 
knowledge of the outside world 
having a choice was confusing for some voters 
in the past there was only one name on ballots said 
davaasambuu chief of the election commission at a polling station 
in western ulan bator this time there are two names and you have 
to choose 
observers came from britain the united states poland and the 
soviet union and hungary none reported major problems

the most restrictive state abortion law in 
the nation goes before a federal judge monday in a case that could 
eventually give the us supreme court another chance to reevaluate 
roe vs wade 
senior us district judge daniel h huyett iii is to hear 
arguments on whether bills passed by the state legislature in 1988 
and 1989 illegally restricted the rights of women to abortions 
should the bill end up in the supreme court as many observers 
expect it would be the second time in a decade that huyett has 
considered a key abortion rights challenge on its way to the high 
court 
huyett rejected provisions of a 1982 pennsylvania abortion law 
that in 1986 was rejected by the supreme court in a stunning 
confirmation of the 1973 roe vs wade ruling 
gov robert p casey signed the nations most restrictive 
abortion bill last year but huyett ordered the provisions 
temporarily blocked 
the hearing this week springs from a challenge to the state 
bills by planned parenthood of southern pennsylvania other womens 
organizations and doctors in the state who perform abortions 
the contested provisions would require married women to inform 
their husbands before they can obtain abortions and generally ban 
abortions after the 24th week of pregnancy 
some of the other challenged provisions also were included in 
the 1982 bill 
they include measures to obligate doctors to provide pregnant 
women with specified information regarding fetal development and 
their rights to obtain child support require a 24hour waiting 
period between a womans visit to a doctor and the performance of 
the abortion and force clinics to publicize the names of doctors 
who perform abortions and other information 
opponents say the law interferes with doctors and invites 
harassment of abortion facilities and staff members while imposing 
reproductive choices on women but not on men 
what it does is pose a series of restrictions that put 
roadblocks in a womans ability to have an abortion said kathryn 
kolbert of the american civil liberties unions reproductive 
freedom project 
robert r gentzel a spokesman for the attorney generals 
office said the commonwealth believes the bills restrictions are 
permissible under existing supreme court rulings 
only guam in the pacific has adopted a more stringent abortion 
code than the one passed in pennsylvania in november the us 
territorys legislature banned all abortions except when a womans 
life is endangered and outlawed all abortion referrals 
as in pennsylvania that law has been temporarily blocked by a 
federal court order 
stringent antiabortion measures were passed this year by the 
idaho and louisiana legislatures but were vetoed louisiana 
legislators have threatened to call a special session to override 
gov buddy roemers veto 
the us supreme courts 1973 decision in roe vs wade outlawed 
state regulation of abortions unless the regulations were clearly 
to safeguard the health of the woman 
but last years high court ruling in a missouri case webster 
vs reproductive health services gave greater restrictive power to 
state legislatures 
the pennsylvania law is being challenged by planned parenthood 
womens suburban clinic womens health services inc reproductive 
health and counseling center allentown womens center and dr 
thomas allen of allentown on behalf of all pennsylvania physicians 
who perform or make referrals for abortions 
the defendants in the suit are casey state secretary of health 
n mark richards and state attorney general ernie preate

relatives and friends of a retarded man 
found naked and hanged from a tree in january say he may have been 
lynched but authorities ruled the death an accident caused by a 
deviant sexual practice 
the body of tommy phillips who had the mental capacity of a 
kindergartner was found outside a group home where he lived a 
sock was stuffed in his mouth and his hands were loosely tied 
behind his back 
authorities at first ruled the 36yearolds death a suicide 
but the department of public safety later determined he had died 
accidentally because of a sexual game gone awry the dallas morning 
news reported sunday 
the police report said phillips rigged the noose to partially 
cut off air to the brain and enhance sexual excitement there have 
been previous reports of accidental death from the practice police 
said 
staff members at the group home where phillips lived said he was 
incapable of the detailed preparations involved in the hanging 
they said the reports authors ignored the fact that phillips 
was severely scalded six months earlier by someone who reportedly 
threatened to kill him if he talked about it 
several employees of the group home said they had received 
threatening phone calls after phillips death and were told to 
leave town the group home closed in april 
its absolutely the worst excuse for an investigation that 
ive ever seen in my life said eve stickney a supervisor at the 
waxahachie home who found phillips body 
texas ranger george turner said he drew a conclusion of 
accidental death the moment he saw the crime photographs 
if i thought somebody had dusted him then id try to dust 
them in return turner said but its just not that it is not 
a homicide 
an independent forensic pathologist hired by the morning news 
said that it would have been almost impossible for phillips who 
had an iq of 34 to devise and complete the task 
the only thing that would be more inconceivable would be to 
call it a natural death said pathologist linda norton 
eight current and former state employees who supervised phillips 
at the home said they also are convinced that he was killed they 
said many people in the neighborhood resented the presence of the 
group home 
the scalding phillips suffered caused severe burns to his back 
legs and genitals requiring hospitalization for two weeks the 
former employees said although phillips told police a neighbor 
attacked him no arrest was made

the soviet economy tumbled from january through 
june as workers earned more rubles for producing less and paid 
higher prices for scarce necessitites according to statistics 
released sunday 
the gross national product dropped 1 percent and labor 
productivity fell 15 percent compared with the first half of 1989 
but the government printed 9 percent more rubles and the average 
wage for industrial and service workers shot up from 236 rubles 
407 to 257 rubles 443 said a firsthalf economic report 
printed in official newspapers 
also sunday president mikhail s gorbachev urged impatient 
soviet republics not to print their own money saying it would 
damage the ecnonomy 
gorbachev in an appeal transmitted by the tass news agency 
said he wanted the republics to understand the negative 
socialeconomic consequences that could result from breaking the 
united monetary system of the country 
the baltic republics of lithuania latvia and estonia are all 
working on plans to print their own money as they press for 
complete independence from the soviet union earlier this month 
the ukraine included plans for a separate currency in its 
declaration of sovereignty 
 
the price of potatoes meanwhile shot up 10 percent fruit 
prices were up 14 percent and vegetable prices increased 9 percent 
overall consumers spent 142 percent more on basic goods and 
services 
the litany of economic gloom released by tass and the government 
paper izvestia should have provided few surprises to soviet 
consumers who battle daily with finding food clothing and other 
daily necessities 
but it indicated that the government so far has been unable to 
make progress on correcting some of the economys major problems 
a definite increase in pay for labor in comparison to the 
output of production is continuing which worsens the situation on 
the consumer market tass reported the output of money 
increased the buying power of the ruble dropped the foreign 
trade balance remains negative 
this years budget deficit is estimated at about 103 billion 
the balance of trade also continued to worsen the value of 
exports dropped from 576 billion in the first half of last year 
to 522 billion this year meanwhile imports increased from 619 
billion to 633 billion 
exports to countries of comecon the sovietled economic union 
that includes its former east bloc allies dropped 102 percent 
those countries most of which threw out hardline communist 
dictators last year are trying to reorient their economies away 
from the soviet union 
gorbachev and premier nikolai i ryzhkov have pledged to start 
putting reforms in place next year that will free the economy from 
heavy state control they have acknowledged that statecontrolled 
prices will have to be raised 
but the plans have been met with stiff resistance from more 
traditional minded communist party and parliamentary officials as 
well as consumers worried that their standard of living will fall 
even further 
at the same time the government has acknowledged that some of 
its plans were illconceived last month yuri d maslyukov the 
head of economic planning said the supreme soviet parliament had 
been wise to kick back a government plan to raise the price of 
bread beginning july 1 
the reports citing figures from the state statistics 
commission said that while there were no improvements in basic 
economic indicators some decentralization was taking place in the 
soviet economy 
about 13 million people were working in enterprises in which 
groups of workers were renting facilities from the government 
rather than working directly in the state economy they said 
the number of people working in cooperatives small privately 
run businesses almost doubled and the value of their goods and 
services reached 517 billion it said 
the amount of consumer goods produced in factories retooled from 
defense production meanwhile increased more than 20 percent it 
said

american movies have been such a hit in the 
soviet union the movie magazine couldnt have been far behind 
movies usa which gives away 1 million copies a month to 
american moviegoers will be distributed in theaters and video 
stores in leningrad beginning with the september issue actor jack 
nicholson will be on the cover to welcome soviets to the american 
world of movie news 
some american business and scientific magazines have begun 
soviet distribution recently but the atlantabased movies usa is 
the first entertainment magazine 
and even though the soviets will be reading about movies that 
wont get to their theaters for months magazine officials and 
soviet experts expect the first 10000 copies to sell quickly 
the magic of american pop culture shouldnt be 
underestimated said thomas remington a soviet media expert at 
emory university 
todd macrae movies usa publisher said the magazine signed a 
oneyear test agreement with russkoye video association the soviet 
unions first independent media company to distribute the magazine 
in five leningrad theaters and four video stores 
i thought it would be a great idea to test the waters he 
said adding that if the magazine sells well more copies will be 
distributed in october 
the issues will be in english with a greeting in russian in the 
first issue macrae said he may distribute russian versions by next 
year 
the idea started with larry namer the founder of the movietime 
cable network who last year created global media alliance a 
company to help media development in the soviet union and eastern 
europe 
namer became a consultant for russkoye which set up the first 
independent film production company in the soviet union and started 
the countrys first commercial tv station in leningrad namer says 
an entertainment magazine was the next logical step 
it just made all the sense in the world to bring that magazine 
over there namer said in a telephone interview from los angeles 
theres a tremendous amount of people that speak and read and 
study english 
there is of course in my country a tremendous interest in 
all things american fashion music and especially movies said 
russkoye president dimitri rozhdestvensky perhaps someday well 
have a movies usa and movies ussr 
american publishers have been hesitant to sell their magazines 
in the soviet union because rubles are not convertible to dollars 
but business week began distributing a russian version in the 
soviet union this month and will begin monthly publication in 
1991 omni a consumer science magazine began bilingual 
publication last fall 
soviet magazines and newspapers including liternaya gazeta and 
moscow news also have begun distribution in the united states but 
remington said it is too early to say how well it is doing 
movies usa will be sold for the ruble equivalent of 1 about 
enough for the company to recoup its publication and distribution 
costs this is not a moneymaking venture macrae said 
but it will be soon namer insists because western companies 
that have reinvested their rubles in the soviet union will become 
big moneymakers if rubles become convertible 
the way we need to look at this is as a culture exchange a 
developmental phase for what will become a very lucrative deal 
he said its just like mcdonalds theyre investing their 
rubles in building a second store and a third in five years when 
rubles are convertible and mcdonalds has a few hundred stores 
theyll be perfectly positioned for a massive consumer market 
at a smaller scale so will we

the worlds largest babyfood company 
gerber products co says its getting ready for when the baby boom 
goes bust 
gerber has new products and selling strategies aimed at 
expanding sales beyond the 1yearold and younger babies who 
currently slurp throw and spit most of its applesauce strained 
carrots and other mushy meals 
with such a specialized market gerber executives keep a close 
eye on demographic trends snatching up indications of how many 
babies are born or will be born 
last year for the first time in 25 years births topped the 4 
million mark gerber products division president robert l 
johnston reassured stockholders in the high school auditorium in 
gerbers western michigan headquarters town of fremont it isnt 
over yet he said at the annual meeting 
food industry analyst william mcmillin of prudential bache 
research in new york said that for gerber the test will come 
later in the decade when the birth rate slows 
baby boomers arent having as many children as their parents 
who filled the nurseries with a record 43 million new tots in 1957 
at the height of the postworld war ii boom said greg spencer of 
the us census bureau in washington 
births have surged recently as many of those children had 
children said martin oconnell head of the bureaus fertility 
statistics branch 
many babyboom women put off having babies in the 1970s while 
they were in their 20s and busy with college or careers oconnell 
said 
by the end of the 1980s they were in their 30s and decided it 
was time to have children if they were going to 
the boomlet will fade spencer said thousands of babyboom 
women are turning 40 every day a much smaller number of women are 
turning 16 
later in the 1990s oconnell said i would say the companies 
that prosper will be those dealing with 3 4 and 5yearolds 
gerber employs more than 12400 people sells baby products in 
50 countries and reported 114 billion in sales in its last fiscal 
year 
it has no intention of going to its room just because of a burp 
in the demographics 
to start with said chairman alfred a piergallini our 
strategy is to attempt to dominate the zero to 4yearold range 
three to 5 and 5 to 10 might be the next alternatives 
johnston said 
stockholders were told gerber has ways to ride with the trend 
sell to different ages highfiber juice drinks aimed at older 
children and adults will be in stores next month microwave snacks 
like spaghetti and meatballs for children up to 3 hit the shelves 
in september 
they carry the gerber name but the gerber baby is gone from the 
label 
new age groups are fertile ground johnston said infant formulas 
introduced last year snatched up 36 percent of a 16 billion 
formula market and could nurse that to 5 percent this year 
the company already has 715 percent of the 900millionayear 
market for traditional baby foods like strained carrots applesauce 
and cereals for babies up to 1 the market for babies up to 3 also 
could thrive johnston said we feel it is equal to the baby food 
market or about 900 million 
streamline gerber which makes about 180 baby food products 
has sold some sidelines to raise cash for the basics it sold 115 
daycare centers in may for an undisclosed amount in the past two 
years it has shed a trucking company and furniture and carseat 
making units 
in march it cut unprofitable clothing lines such as 
lowprofitmargin private label sleepwear for older children and 
sold three apparel plants it closed a canadian baby food plant 
consolidating food making in three us plants which johnston said 
cut 2 million a year from manufacturing costs 
sell in more countries piergallini said sales in poland 
recently topped the 1 million mark the company anticipates new 
business in hungary and czechoslovakia and has new ventures under 
way in egypt turkey greece and saudi arabia 
add products mothers trust us piergallini said he said 
gerber will put its brand on bottles pacifiers dishes and toys 
and add gerber clothing to that marketed by its buster brown and 
weather tamer units

less than 24 hours after contel corp and gte 
corp announced a 6 billion merger this month federal regulators 
were in court charging insider trading by a group of overseas 
investors 
in january even before rorer group inc sold a large stake to 
rhonepoulenc sa of france a court froze the us brokerage 
accounts of three foreign firms charged with insider trading during 
merger talks 
last november when asea brown boveri ltd bid for combustion 
engineering inc the government quickly accused a liechtenstein 
company with making 28 million in illegal profits 
the bad guys in insider trading scams arent necessarily 
americans recent cases show us regulators are cracking down on 
foreigners profiting from the notorious activity made famous by 
ivan boesky in the 1980s 
chasing overseas insider trading using nonpublic information 
to profit from securities trades means negotiating a maze of 
foreign laws tangled bureacracies mystery investors and 
clandestine bank accounts not to mention foreign languages 
the securities and exchange commission has made the process 
easier in recent years by signing information exchange agreements 
with foreign governments countries that winked at insider trading 
or didnt consider it a crime in the past now have tough laws 
theres no question that other countries are reacting to the 
american experience said donald langevoort a vanderbilt 
university law professor 
virtually all major capital marketplace countries have 
prohibitions on insider trading but they dont have secs he 
said so you have conduct thats illegal but you dont have 
someone there to enforce the law 
japan only recently assigned a prosecutor to its securities 
investigations branch after years protecting its vaunted bank 
secrecy switzerland has outlawed insider trading and signed a 
cooperation treaty with the united states 
ten years ago if we had a case involving a swiss bank it was 
almost a dead end said a former sec lawyer now working for a 
major wall street firm who asked not to be named 
sec chairman richard breeden has said he wants to ensure us 
markets arent at a competitive disadvantage overseas 
part of that is assuring that people understand that there 
isnt going to be an advantage in going to a swiss bank or a 
liechtenstein trust to trade in violation of our standards said 
john olson a washington securities lawyer 
the us government can pursue insider trading by foreign 
investors as long as trades are made on a us exchange sec 
investigators scour daily trading records looking for sharp jumps 
in trading volume of stocks especially ones mentioned in takeover 
or merger talk 
if a spike up is apparent as it was in the gte rorer and 
combustion engineering deals regulators quickly ask a federal 
judge to freeze trading accounts of those suspected of insider 
dealings 
why options trades which are popular in merger deals because 
they give investors the option but not the obligation to buy a 
stock within a given time are cleared by brokerage houses 
overnight stock transactions take seven days 
after transactions settle the money is turned over to 
investors after money is transferred out of the united states 
its practically irretrievable 
the sec has not attempted to get back money after the fact from 
defendants overseas but it is expected to make such an attempt 
soon in the case of eddie antar the former crazy eddie discount 
electronics store chain whom investigators believe squirreled away 
millions overseas 
in those cases where we need to protect the assets from being 
moved and secreted we have to act quickly said thomas newkirk 
the secs chief litigation counsel 
that means seeking an injunction based on the mere suspicion of 
illegal behavior judges are giving the sec the benefit of the 
doubt by signing orders before receiving hard evidence a runup in 
a stock price is due to insider trading 
in freezing more than 4 million in two trading accounts in the 
rorer deal us district judge shirley wohl kram supported the 
governments use of circumstantial evidence the sudden and 
timely interest these defendants had in rorer securities is 
suspicious and has not been adequately explained she wrote 
in the contelgte deal the sec got a freeze before identifying 
the investors accused of making at least 1 million through insider 
trading last week it named four west germans three european 
companies and nine swiss bank employees 
the judge in that case concluded that there appeared to have 
been a leak of information so he blocked twelve us banks and 
securities firms from disposing of contel stock and options none 
of the banks or firms was charged but they were forced to 
cooperate with investigators and name their customers 
brokerage houses often get caught in a jurisdictional tugofwar 
between regulators and customers overseas complicating matters 
some investors remain unidentified by trading through banks 
in a key 1981 case involving insider trading in the takeover of 
the mining company santa fe international by the kuwaiti 
government merrill lynch amp co had its accounts frozen here and 
was sued in kuwait 
chasing insider trading involving foreigners also is expensive 
and can be fraught with delays such as getting justice department 
clearance hiring foreign lawyers getting foreign judges to 
approve investigations securing evidence such as foreign telephone 
records and translating sheaths of documents 
we have to try to gain disgorgement of illgotten gains or 
profits and that can be a very cumbersome process sec 
enforcement director william mclucas said

fraud lax government regulation and talk of a 
taxpayer bailout 
it sounds like a litany from the savings and loan crisis 
instead it is the story of federally guaranteed student loans 
the two problems cannot be compared in magnitude or severity 
but there are parallels 
both speak to the inherent abuses that can occur anytime the 
federal government attempts to protect private parties against 
risk both involve what critics charge is lax government oversight 
cracks in the student loan system were underscored last week 
when the higher education assistance foundation or heaf said it 
needed federal help to avoid a financial collapse 
heaf is the largest of 47 state government and private 
nonprofit agencies guaranteeing student loans made by 12000 
commercial banks savings and loans credit unions and other 
lenders 
based in overland park kan it has guarantees 88 billion in 
loans or about 17 percent of the national total of 51 billion 
disclosure of heafs problems last monday sent ripples through 
the financial markets contributing to a 105point plunge in the 
stock market during the first 90 minutes of trading 
at stake is a system that last year lent 12 billion at 
subsidized rates to 47 million students at 8000 fouryear 
universities community colleges and trade schools 
bankers say that if the government allows heaf to default the 
entire student loan program could be jeopardized 
student loans if not for the guarantee would be very risky 
and would probably not be made said floyd stoner of the american 
bankers association they are loans to people with no credit 
history no assets and no fixed address 
if people get nervous they tend to get more cautious and the 
way you get more cautious as a lender is to make fewer loans he 
said 
analysts say the markets reaction to heafs crisis is evidence 
of broader investor concerns about the federal budget deficit 
which is being swelled by the sampl bailout and the potentially 
staggering taxpayer liability for government guarantee programs 
benefiting farmers and home buyers in addition to college students 
the question is how many of the government funding agencies 
will go the way of the thrift funding agency said economist 
allen sinai of the boston co 
education department officials rushed to reassure nervous 
lenders borrowers and investors they dispatched a team of 
auditors to heaf offices and said they were hoping to avoid a 
default by finding another guaranty agency to take it over 
an administration official speaking on condition of anonymity 
said that following a weekend meeting office of management and 
budget and education department officials hoped to resolve the 
problem this week 
they heaf have the cash flow to make it for another week 
the official said the situation is urgent but not so urgent that 
we dont have time to sit back and assess our options 
student loan problems affect taxpayers in two ways directly 
through the education department and indirectly through sallie mae 
the student loan marketing association 
the education department is budgeted to spend 2 billion this 
year on student loan defaults it reimburses guaranty agencies for 
100 percent of the loss for default rates under 5 percent 
reimbursement drops to 90 percent when the default rate tops 5 
percent and to 80 percent when the rate hits 9 percent 
heaf is the only guaranty agency to reach the 9 percent default 
level this year its income from insurance premiums paid by 
borrowers has not been enough to make up for the loss of federal 
reimbursement 
but because heafs default could scare off all lenders the 
federal government is under great pressure to arrange a takeover 
which will probably require an additional expenditure of taxpayer 
dollars 
education undersecretary ted sanders told the senate banking 
committee on friday that the outside number for a bailout would 
be 100 million but he said the department still hoped to arrange 
a takeover that would avoid additional federal liability 
sanders said five to seven other guaranty agencies are 
experiencing difficulty but none are having as much difficulty as 
heaf and collectively they are about half as big as heaf he said 
sallie mae is a federally chartered but shareholderowned 
secondary market company that buys student loans from lenders it 
finances about four of every 10 loans 
in theory there is no credit risk on its 173 billion 
portfolio because all of the loans are insured by the guaranty 
agencies but 29 billion of the loans are insured by heaf 
thats why sallie mae stock led the price decline last week at 
the end of trading friday it sold for 4650 a share off 14 
percent from a week earlier 
technically taxpayers arent at risk from sallie mae beyond its 
1 billion line of credit to the us treasury but most investors 
assume the government would not stand idle if the fortunes of 
sallie mae considered the healthiest of the governmentsponsored 
enterprises turned sour 
congress shellshocked by the savings and loan crisis wasted 
little time in exploring the causes and laying blame for the 
student loan woes 
once again it appears that the federal government has 
explicitly or implicitly guaranteed risks stemming from the 
behavior of financial institutions over which it has little or no 
control said sen donald w riegle jr dmich chairman of the 
senate banking committee 
administration officials vigorously reject the comparison 
while we take these problems very seriously analogies of this 
situation to the savings and loan crisis are quite simply 
inappropriate sanders said 
estimates of the cost of the sampl crisis run to 500 billion or 
2000 for every man woman and child in the nation 
if every single student loan in the country soured it would 
amount to a 51 billion problem and 89 percent of student loans 
are in fact sound according to the general accounting office 
congress auditing agency 
still the default problem is growing four times as fast as the 
loan program while all student loans increased 83 percent from 
1983 to 1989 defaults are up 352 percent over the same sixyear 
period according to the gao 
heaf is attributing its problems to its numerous loans to 
students attending beauty truckdriving and other trade schools 
where defaults are highest 
critics charge that although many trade schools run good 
programs others are scam operations existing only to collect 
tuition from students who borrow the money and then default the 
default rate hits 90 percent at a handful of the schools 
sen claiborne pell dri chairman of the senate education 
subcommittee blames student loan problems on budget cuts during 
the reagan administration 
no school can participate in a federal aid program unless it is 
certified by the department of education however pell said the 
departments audits dropped from 1977 in 1981 to 890 in 1986 
more fundamentally he said loan problems are occurring because 
the reagan and bush administrations have been using loans as a 
substitute for grants 
we began the last decade with the typical student aid package 
composed threefourths of grants and only onefourth loans today 
it is precisely the opposite he said

roger b smith an accountant who drove general 
motors corp over some of its roughest roads retires tuesday as 
chairman ending a 9year tenure criticized for focusing too much 
on money and too little on cars 
money is among the things smith bragged about during an 
interview two weeks before leaving 
i think the corporation is in super shape he said we 
made more money last year than any corporation in the world except 
royal dutch shell 
i dont think thats too bad a target 
gm reported 42 billion in profit for 1989 down 13 percent 
from 1988 the best year in company history in 1981 smiths first 
year as chairman gm made 3334 million 
thats a turnaround of which any accountant including smith 
would be proud 
in 1981 gms share of the us car market stood at about 46 
percent at the end of last year it was 351 percent smith the 
third longestserving gm chairman since 1912 dismisses that when 
looking at the big picture of the corporation 
you cant pay dividends out of market share he says 
that doesnt fly with herb adcox a chevrolet dealer in 
chattanooga tenn adcox has been a dealer for 38 years three 
fewer than smith has been with gm 
i know the shareholders have got to make money but if the 
market share begins slipping you lose adcox says 
plenty of people think gm lost during smiths watch 
books critical of him and his policies are in book stores h 
ross perot quit the gm board in late 1986 in a highly publicized 
fight with smith over the way the company was managed gm spent 
about 700 million to quiet perot that move generated harsh 
criticism especially from gms main union the united auto workers 
most recently the movie roger and me takes smith to task 
for gms cutbacks in the companys birthplace of flint mich smith 
says he hasnt seen the film and doesnt plan to 
i feel good about the situation the company is in with its 
products quality and future he says it makes my going a lot 
easier 
smith claims the 1984 corporate reorganization which combined 
engineering manufacturing and marketing of each of its car 
divisions into two groups as his greatest accomplishment 
the execution of that reorganization was another matter 
especially in communications smith said he regrets that 
the acquisitions of electronic data systems corp in 1984 from 
perot and hughes aircraft co in 1986 are proud moments 
if eds never did a thing for us in terms of working together 
just look at the financial aspects he says last wednesday eds 
reported its secondquarter earnings rose to 1253 million up 
195 percent from a year ago 
look at hughes 15000 engineers we picked up there he 
said we havent caught up with that yet the automobile isnt 
quite ready for what theyve got when it gets there its going to 
be wonderful 
for all the criticism leveled at smith the beancounter his 
final official act will come from behind the wheel of a car he 
will drive the first saturn off the line at spring hill tenn 
in 1983 smith announced the project gm so wanted saturn to be 
separate from the corporation that it set up a subsidiary to 
coordinate all activities 
a new 19 billion manufacturing complex was built in spring 
hill 
such a ceremony at gm typically is rife with publicity but 
saturn isnt the typical gm manufacturing plant smiths turn at 
the wheel would be a private affair 
there had been speculation that saturn officials were worried 
that pictures of smith mugging for cameras from the drivers seat 
may conjure up thoughts that saturn isnt really that distinctive 
from other gm cars 
all during the 1980s gm heard criticism that all its cars 
looked essentially the same oldsmobuicks and chevymobiles 
were among the nicknames 
industry observers say that should fade under new chairman 
robert stempel who takes over wednesday smith rose through gms 
financial ranks stempel gms president for nearly three years 
came up through its engineering and marketing organizations the 
two have had adjoining offices and have worked closely 
the switch in gms leadership has received rave reviews 
i will never sell gm short says auto analyst mary anne 
sudol of fitch investors service inc in new york when that 
elephant learns to dance and its learning some of the steps you 
have a very formidable powerhouse in there 
smith may or may not be missed but he will miss gm 
ive been running the thing for 10 years said smith the 
third of four children born to a columbus ohio banker and his 
wife im going to miss that ill tell you for sure 
smith plans to dabble in commercial real estate 
theres a guy where i keep my boat up north who wants to build 
a boat storage building that doesnt have the capital i can help 
him said smith who will pull in about 12 million in pension a 
year he also will be paid to remain on gms board 
smith said stempel can have the physical demands of the 
chairmanship 
theres a lot of nights that you get home at 2 oclock in the 
morning and you come in here at 6 he says im not going to 
miss that

eight months after suspending publication ms 
magazine is headed back to the newsstand without advertising but 
with an avowed mission of unashamed feminism 
the magazine also has a slightly new name ms the world of 
women which its backers say better reflects its worldwide scope 
the first issue of the redesigned magazine goes on sale monday 
for 450 a copy at newstands and through the waldenbooks and b 
dalton bookstore chains 
subscriptions are priced at 40 a year for six issues that will 
appear every other month 
the cover of the first issue shows a tiny globe nestled between 
two womens hands collectors edition it says across the top 
no advertising editorially free ms lives 
but it is not entirely accurate to say it has no advertising 
there are six ads displayed on the inside cover under the heading 
no comment a feature that ms editors formerly used to 
showcase examples of bad or sexist ads 
this time four of the ads were culled from the pages of the old 
ms magazine while two others are ads in which ms touted itself to 
advertisers in trade publications 
one of the trade ads showed a woman wearing a dress made of 10 
bills below the heading what do you call a woman with serious 
money to invest ms 
the other trade ad shows several photos tracing the evolution of 
a young woman from someone with straighthair and a headband to a 
glamourpuss were not the ms we used to be the ad said 
the 17yearold ms suspended publication after the november 
1989 issue its new owner dale lang said the magazine was losing 
substantial sums of money and he was persuaded to reshape it 
banning paid ads and trying to survive on circulation revenue alone 
lang who also publishes working woman working mother sassy 
and success magazines more than doubled the previous 16 a year 
subscription rate and reduced the number of issues from 10 a year 
but he felt there was enough interest in serious examination of 
feminist issues and writing that the magazine could break even on 
circulation alone 
lang spokeswoman andrea kaplan said the magazine can get by with 
less than 100000 circulation it had been guaranteeing advertisers 
550000 circulation 
industry analysts have expressed doubts about the magazines 
chances for survival without advertising they say the relatively 
high price will discourage some readers and that the topics ms 
made its reputation on are now covered adequately in other mass 
magazines 
robin morgan a novelist journalist and feminist activist who 
has been hired as the editor of ms said there is an audience for 
the magazine 
because the world is shrinking and the womens movement is 
growing this ms will be international and unabashedly feminist 
she wrote in a letter to readers 
the magazine has a report by ms cofounder gloria steinem on 
advertising and magazines called sex lies amp advertising 
also in the issue is a report on women of eastern europe an 
essay from former rep bella abzug on widowhood and a conversation 
between country singer kd lang and pop singer lesley gore 
it also contains poetry by toni morrison and adrienne rich an 
essay by marilyn french book music and film reviews and regular 
sections on international news stories a photo essay and 
ecofeminism
