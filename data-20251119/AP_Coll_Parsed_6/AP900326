after months of appearing paralyzed by 
president bushs high poll ratings the democrats have shifted into 
a campaign mode and begun to sound like a party ready to challenge 
bush in the 1992 election 
during weekend meetings in new orleans and indianapolis the 
democrats took on the popular republican president on a range of 
domestic issues including social security the environment 
abortion and education 
the partys newly aggressive stance was not arrived at easily 
it exposed the differing approaches of state party officials hungry 
for effective campaign issues and the congressional wing whose 
members must often search for compromises with their republican 
colleagues and the white house 
regardless of their differences on specific issues the 
democrats clearly agreed with party chairman ronald h browns 
assessment that the president has been getting a free ride and 
that it was time to challenge him 
the party officials gathered in indianapolis for a meeting of 
the democratic national committee while the elected democrats were 
in new orleans for a session convened by the democratic leadership 
council 
brown attended both meetings and was instrumental in pushing his 
party to endorse sen daniel patrick moynihans proposal to cut the 
social security payroll tax a plan some of moynihans fellow 
democrats flatly oppose 
im not concerned there is going to be a debate brown told 
a news conference on the closing day of the dnc meeting there 
ought to be a debate 
the chairman was asked if he would feel a litle uncomfortable 
with the stand of his party if he were an elected official say 
sen lloyd bentsen of texas who is decidedly unethusiastic about 
the proposal by his new york colleague 
i think id feel good that my national party was committed to 
winning elections brown replied 
that response reflected the dominant view in indianapolis to 
win elections the democrats must make clear to voters what they 
stand for 
it was with that in mind that brown also stepped up his attacks 
on the administrations record on the environment and education 
issues the president threatens to steal from the democrats 
bush convened the governors for an education summit last fall 
and rarely misses an opportunity to proclaim himself the 
education president 
he recently pleased environmentalists by endorsing legislation 
to upgrade the environmental protection agency to a cabinet 
department 
were not satisfied with sound bites and press conferences 
about education when children in eastern europe are outscoring 
american kids on standardized science exams and 60 million 
americans cant read at an eighthgrade level brown told the dnc 
he was equally scornful of the administration record on the 
environment he recalled the bush campaign commercials on pollution 
in boston harbor and chided the president for failing to clean it 
up 
party officials recognized the risk of endorsing strong action 
on social security 
i think its a little bit of a dangerous issue said jim 
ruvolo ohio democratic party chairman and president of the 
association of democratic state chairs 
ruvolo said the democrats must be careful not to allow the 
republicans to frame the debate as the democrats are threatening 
social security we know what kind of issue that is 
throughout the 1980s even at the height of ronald reagans 
popularity social security was an issue that won votes for the 
democrats because some elderly voters were convinced that reagan 
wanted to freeze benefits 
the cornerstone of the moynihan proposal is to say this fund 
ought to be sacrosanct said brown the proposal however has 
not received strong support from groups representing the elderly 
the democrats are hoping they can calm the fears of the elderly 
that moynihans plan would lead to a freeze or cutback in benefits 
at the same time the democrats are banking on the appeal of 
cutting the payroll tax which has risen steadily for several years 
brown had another weekend victory when he got his party to act 
quickly and quietly to set the rules for the 1992 campaign for the 
democratic presidential nomination 
this is the most peaceful accord on rules we have had in the 
past two decades he said with obvious satisfaction 
what made the democrats so willing to adopt their chairmans 
strategy 
the answer might lie in the underlying unease felt by many at 
the dnc meeting 
despite election successes in 1989 races democrats cant escape 
the reality of their national election losses 
we are not the majority party in this country said rep 
sander levin of michigan challenging a basic democratic tenet 
the party that loses five of six presidential elections is not 
the majority party

veteran northwest airlines pilot robert ralph 
johnson was so drunk leaving a racquet club that he fell on his way 
to his car a judge would later say it was amazing he could walk at 
all 
but the judge sealed police and court records to keep northwest 
and the federal aviation administration from learning of the case 
in exchange for a guilty plea to driving while intoxicated in july 
1988 
the reasons to save johnsons job and to get him into a 
treatment program johnson continued to fly for northwest as he 
had for almost 30 years the star tribune reported sunday 
the issue of pilot drunkenness gained new attention with the 
arrest march 8 of three other northwest airmen they were accused 
of drinking before a flight that day and of flying a plane with 91 
passengers aboard while intoxicated 
northwest fired captain norman prouse first officer robert 
kirchner and second officer joseph balzer who allegedly had 
bloodalcohol levels above 04 percent the legal limit for pilots 
officials said 
the star tribune said at least 41 pilots of passenger aircraft 
including 28 employed by northwest have lost their minnesota 
drivers licenses in the past seven years because of alcohol abuse 
in johnsons case if eaganbased northwest had learned of the 
incident he could have been grounded for at least two years under 
a strict alcohol policy that since has been relaxed 
if convicted of an alcoholrelated traffic offense johnson 
would have been required by the faa to report it on his medical 
exam raising the possibility that his fitness to fly would be 
examined 
but following johnsons guilty plea hennepin county district 
court judge david duffy decided not to accept it timothy ostroot 
johnsons lawyer told the associated press as part of the deal 
the judge ordered johnson to complete alcohol treatment and stay in 
contact with a probation officer 
if johnson upholds his part of the agreement the judge will 
dismiss the case in july without ever convicting johnson of drunken 
driving ostroot said 
northwest and faa officials declined to comment on the report 
as did a national spokesman for the air line pilots association 
eden prairie police had stopped johnson from driving his car out 
of the racquet clubs parking lot a breath test showed he had a 
33 percent bloodalcohol content 
nothing is to be disclosed to anybody regarding this duffy 
said during a hearing according to the newspaper and that would 
include the faa and that does not go on the driving record it 
goes nowhere but here 
when duffy asked what the faa could do johnson answered if 
it doesnt get out of this room they would never know 
duffy opened the file last week to a star tribune reporter who 
challenged the legality of sealing the records 
while johnson avoided faa scrutiny through that unusual court 
ruling other pilots do so in a more routine way the star tribune 
said 
in reviewing northwest pilots driving records the newspaper 
found seven cases in which alcoholrelated charges were reduced to 
nonalcohol offenses such as careless driving one was reduced to 
a charge of running a red light 
with alcohol removed from the convictions the pilots were under 
no obligation to tell the faa they were involved in a 
drunkendriving case thus avoiding evaluation of their alcohol use 
should such an evaluation show them to be alcoholic they could 
be suspended from flying until they could prove they could overcome 
alcoholism and abstained from drinking for two years the star 
tribune said 
duffy said last week he sealed johnsons records because it was 
the only way to get him to plead guilty and go into treatment 
without costing him his job 
under the old northwest policy duffy said if a pilot pled 
guilty to drunk driving he lost his job or if he went into 
treatment he lost his job under those circumstances nobody was 
going to plead guilty 
by this july if johnson has met the conditions set by the 
judge his case will be dismissed and his record will be clear 
since he was sentenced johnson has completed treatment and 
remained sober duffy said 
johnsons attorney timothy ostroot said duffys decision was 
proper under the circumstances 
this the drinking incident was completely unrelated to his 
job he said there was never any allegation he was going to 
fly the next day to me the price of losing his job which he 
worked very hard at and he was very good at for an alcoholrelated 
incident would be a heavy price to pay

gerald bull a canadianborn arms 
dealer and weapons designer was killed in his home authorities 
say he was 62 
bull was shot to death thursday night in his apartpment in a 
fashionable suburb of brussels police said they have ruled out 
robbery as a motive because more than 20000 was found in bulls 
pockets 
bull was convicted in vermont in 1980 on charges of smuggling 
arms to south africa 
the canadian news agency southam news based in ottawa reported 
sunday that he had been working more recently with iraq to help it 
develop advanced weapons systems that were used in the iraniraq 
war 
he also had extensive business dealings with communist china 
southam reported 
the belgian newspaper derniere heure said bull had helped south 
africa develop the g5 longrange artillery gun the howitzertype 
guns were said to be more sophisticated than anything in either the 
nato or warsaw pact arsenals 
but in a statement issued to the belgian news agency bulls son 
stephen strongly denied that space research corp bulls company 
or its foreign affiliates were involved in arms dealing 
the space research corp has never been involved in 
activities breaking the arms embargo with south africa the 
statement said 
it said bull for several years had been involved in aeronautic 
and defense research 
bull was born in north bay ontario but gave up his canadian 
citizenship for a us passport sometime before 1977 the canadian 
embassy in brussels said 
once tabbed by macleans magazine as canadas boy genius of 
rocket science bull became in 1951 the youngest person to graduate 
from the university of toronto with a doctorate he was 22 
he first appeared on the vermont scene in 1967 when as a 
professor at mcgill university in montreal he established an 
aerospace science program at norwich university in northfield 
in 1970 bull began trying to perfect his plans to orbit nuclear 
warheads in space 
although he was canadian bull won access to highly classified 
american military files when the impropriety was discovered a 
special act of congress sponsored by sen barry goldwater rariz 
backdated his us citizenship application 
only two other aliens the marquis de lafayette and winston 
churchill have had such honorary citizenship bestowed upon them 
space research ran into trouble in the mid1970s when it failed 
to win the major military contracts it was seeking and lost a 12 
million contract to build 28 simulators for the federal aviation 
administration 
the companys demise came after us and canadian authorities 
and news media investigations found that it had struck a deal to 
sell advanced howitzer technology to the south african government 
in violation of us munitions laws and a united nations arms 
embargo against the white minorityruled country 
reports at the time indicated that the deal was accomplished 
through shipments through ports in antigua and spain commercial 
jet flights from new york and montreal and visits by space research 
engineers to a remote test range in south africa

six months after tropical storm hugos powerful 
winds cut a swath of destruction through north carolina the big 
threat now is forest fires 
mother nature lashed out against us not once but twice said 
state forester harry layman first we got the hurricane and now 
weve got to face the threat of forest fires 
layman estimated that hugo destroyed or damaged 27 million 
acres of trees worth about 250 million thats more timber than 
was destroyed by the mount st helens volcano the fires in 
yellowstone national park and hurricane camille combined he said 
as the springtime temperatures begin to rise tons of downed and 
shattered pines oaks hickorys and other trees continue to pile up 
and dry out on the floors of western north carolinas mountains 
its the worst fire threat the state has ever faced say layman 
and other experts authorities in south carolina also are concerned 
its real bad this year and its going to get worse in the 
second and third years layman said right now the twigs and 
branches are falling providing lots of kindling later the big 
trees are all going to be down its going to be a big bonfire 
any fire larger than five acres will soon be out of control 
and turn into a holocaust layman said 
charlotte was in the direct path of the eye of the storm after 
it came ashore 200 miles south near charleston sc in the 
predawn hours of sept 22 
while hugo was officially downgraded from a hurricane to a 
tropical storm just before it hit charlotte winds were clocked at 
90 mph and higher when the eye of the storm passed just over the 
western outskirts of the city 
piles of debris including tree stumps are still a common sight 
on some streets at some city parks youngsters play baseball and 
soccer games in open areas between large uprooted trees 
the city has carted away an estimated 100000 truckloads of hugo 
debris 
seven emergency landfills were opened to take the debris and 
four are already full 
were still getting 250 to 300 calls a day from people who 
want us to come to their homes and take away their debris said 
larry johnson assistant director of transportation whos in 
charge of the remaining cleanup 
back in the forests officials are preparing for a dry spring 
using a 33 million grant from the federal emergency managment 
administration 65 additional firefighters were hired abandoned 
fire towers were reactivated and new equipment including 
helicopters and bulldozers were brought in 
the state leased a tanker plane from the quebec government 
south carolina has leased two of the planes 
the north carolina forestry division has two planes combing the 
path of the storm looking for any signs of fire 
were working our hearts out to open up as many fire trails 
as we can layman said but we need 500 miles of trails in 
burke county alone and our crew can only do two miles a day 
the state may use prisoners to help clear paths into the forests 
that were blocked by downed trees 
timber companies are only able to clear about 7 percent of the 
damaged trees 
layman is considering imposing a strict burning ban beginning 
next month the worst time is april and may he said were 
hoping mother nature will cooperate but sooner or later were 
going to face it

if one state includes 5 million us citizens 
and another has 4 million citizens and 1 million illegal aliens 
which gets more seats in the house of representatives 
the answer they both get the same 
thats not fair say politicians from states that dont have 
many undocumented residents but thats what the constitution 
requires respond their counterparts in states with large numbers 
of them 
the dispute has provoked battles in federal court and congress 
as the census bureau prepares to go forth and count americans once 
again the national head count taken every 10 years got under way 
last week 
the results will be used to redistribute seats in the house in 
1992 and officials in states that have few illegal aliens fear 
losing political influence to states with many undocumented 
residents 
the number of house seats assigned to each state depends only on 
the total population of that state whether composed of citizens 
legal resident aliens or the undocumented 
the question is simple are people who have entered our 
country illegally entitled to representation in the united states 
congress i say no rep tom ridge rpa said recently in 
remarks echoed by rep tim valentine dnc and others 
rep william f goodling rpa contended that including 
illegal aliens gives undue influence to the citizens who live near 
them because noncitizens cannot vote it would take fewer 
citizens to elect a congressman in a district with a lot of aliens 
than in one with few goodling said 
ridge fought a losing battle in the house to require the census 
bureau to ask people if they are here legally and then to leave 
who arent out of the numbers used for apportionment 
a lawsuit filed by ridge and 41 other house members seeking the 
same result also was dismissed by a federal judge in pittsburgh 
despite the defeats he hasnt given up said aide mark 
campbell its too late to have changes made in the 1990 census 
but ridge is now aiming at the next count in the year 2000 
congress cannot by legislative action make persons into 
nonpersons for its political purposes rep esteban e torres 
dcalif argued for those who want an allinclusive count 
he stressed that while the constitution requires citizenship for 
certain public offices it specifically calls for the counting of 
all persons in the census 
a proposal to base house apportionment only on citizens was 
rejected a century ago when northern states included many new 
immigrants noted arturo vargas of the mexican american legal 
defense and education fund 
excluding undocumented residents from census counts would 
compel the census bureau to adopt untested techniques to 
determine the citizenship and immigration status of every person 
counted in the census vargas said 
this he said could have a chilling effect on the hispanic 
community discouraging participation of many legal residents 
trying to count legal and illegal residents separately will 
only lead to misrepresentation and inaccuracy both in the count 
numbers and in the reapportionment process said jaime b fuster 
puerto ricos resident commissioner in washington 
undersecretary of commerce michael r darby whose department 
includes the census bureau said we believe there are compelling 
legal and public policy grounds for counting all persons 
irrespective of their citizenship 
changing the policy of counting everyone would undermine efforts 
to get a complete census would discourage participation of 
minorities and could damage public perception of census 
confidentiality said darby 
in addition he said there is no effective way to know who is 
legal and who isnt of all the questions on the long and short 
forms none asks people if they reside in the country legally 
however estimates developed in 1985 indicated that excluding 
illegal aliens from the 1980 national head count would have 
affected two house seats 
thencensus director john g keane told a senate subcommittee 
that the bureau estimated that it had counted 2 million illegal 
residents in 1980 
had those people not been counted he said new york and 
california would each have lost one house seat with those seats 
going to georgia and indiana keane stressed however that his 
estimates were not accurate enough to use in actual 
reapportionments 
to the census bureau it doesnt really matter the constitution 
simply directs them to count all the people residing in the country 
a lot of illegal aliens will probably try to avoid the census 
anyway officials acknowledge wary of government efforts to return 
them to their homelands these people are often reluctant to deal 
with officials despite promises than any answers they give will be 
kept confidential

that the cia declined

with nicaragua and panama added to the 
democratic column us policy in central america is focusing anew 
on the hottest remaining trouble spot tiny wartorn el salvador 
a shadow version of el salvadors conflict is being played out 
in washington between supporters of the current government who 
argue for more time to resolve the countrys decadeold civil war 
and opponents who want to immediately cut or attach strings to us 
military aid 
the issue has been taken to the streets as well as the halls of 
government 
about 10000 people calling for a halt to military aid marched 
in front of the white house on saturday and 5000 participated in a 
similar demonstration in san francisco police arrested 83 
protesters at the washington march for demonstrating without a 
permit and blocking traffic 
the clash over aid is occurring at a particularly delicate time 
in el salvador the two warring sides have agreed to come together 
for peace talks under united nations auspices and as a scheduled 
trial approaches for the military officers accused of murdering six 
jesuit priests 
in addition the leftist fmln rebels are under pressure as never 
before to make concessions the electoral defeat last month of the 
sandinista government in neighboring nicaragua is expected to close 
off their most reliable military supply line 
i honestly believe conditions have never been better in the 
history of this conflict than they are right now bernard 
aronson assistant secretary of state for interamerican affairs 
said last week i think we can end this war this year 
but aronson added if it becomes politicized we will once 
again screw it up 
liberals on capitol hill claim broad support for an effort to 
impose strict new conditions on us aid to el salvador which is 
among the largest percapita recipients of american largesse 
military economic development and food aid total 3154 million 
this year to the nation of 5 million and president bush has asked 
for about 375 million next year 
opponents contend that nearly 4 billion in aid over the past 
decade has not bought an end to the war that has claimed some 
70000 lives and that the salvadoran military remains beyond the 
control of the civilian government and prone to human rights abuses 
and deathsquad activity 
house supporters of aid restrictions are drafting legal language 
that would withhold half of the money that goes to the salvadoran 
military 846 million this year an expected 90 million next 
year and make its release dependent on both sides behavior 
the provision a variation of legislation introduced in the 
senate by sen christopher dodd dconn is aimed at adding 
pressure to keep both sides at the bargaining table and to minimize 
hostilities in the field 
those who would restrict the military aid see the potential for 
strong leverage with bush if they succeed in adding their proposal 
to an 870 million supplemental appropriations bill the president 
is seeking to reward new democracies in panama and nicaragua 
the administration believes that the new governments of 
president guillermo endara in panama and presidentelect violeta 
chamorro in nicaragua could falter unless they are able to quickly 
demonstrate tangible benefits of democracy to their people the aid 
would go to revitalize panamas private sector and to plant spring 
crops and create jobs in nicaraguas devastated economy 
but with the backing of house speaker thomas foley dwash the 
administration is hoping to defer any fight over us policy toward 
el salvador 
when the panamanicaragua bill came before the house foreign 
affairs committee last week chairman dante fascell dfla 
pleaded with liberals to attach their restrictive language to an 
aid measure for fiscal year 1991 rather than the emergency funding 
bill 
rep william broomfield of michigan the panels senior 
republican promised that secretary of state james a baker iii 
would come to capitol hill this week to hear the liberals 
concerns fascell vowed that the fiscal 1991 aid bill would not 
become sidetracked as a similar measure did last year 
the billdrafting session broke up without agreement and is 
scheduled to resume on tuesday but regardless of the outcome 
there the same issues are virtually certain to arise when the 
panamanicaragua bill goes to the senate sometime in the next two 
weeks

ever since thomas foley took over as its 
speaker last june the house of representatives has enjoyed 
uncommon cooperation and goodwill between the majority democrats 
and minority republicans 
it appears this unnatural state of affairs is finally coming to 
an end 
to the casual observer the house chamber always seems a civil 
place and thats not going to change lawmakers address each other 
as the gentleman from kentucky or the distinguished 
gentlewoman from california they can pile on the politeness 
especially when angry 
but there is a natural partisan tension behind the smiling 
facades it isnt often the stuff of headlines just a 
parliamentary bully match in which each side puts a finger on the 
chest of the other 
this sort of partisanship peaked during former speaker jim 
wrights reign toward the end wright was barely on speaking terms 
with minority leader robert michel rill nearmonolithic 
republican contempt for wright helped hasten his resignation after 
the house ethics committee hit him with a list of charges 
the evercourteous foley dwash was greeted by the 
republicans in the house the way mikhail gorbachev has been 
received by western europe 
the natural enemies began speaking warmly of each other they 
held frequent summits on the issues of the day 
oh there were some ideological battles such as the fight over 
president bushs capital gains tax but the hallmark of the 
postwright house has been collaboration culminating with 
bipartisan passage last fall of the big pay raise for house members 
the gops leading democratbasher newt gingrich of georgia 
capped the year with a resolution honoring foley 
the warm snugly feeling lasted through congress long winter 
recess and almost into the spring 
then last week it began to crack 
foley under electionyear pressure to finish work on child care 
legislation put the democratic bill on last weeks schedule the 
measure wasnt ready but he wanted to pressure his own democrats 
to settle differences that had been delaying action since last year 
everyone from the speaker down to the doorkeepers recognized 
that the schedule was just a parliamentary ploy nevertheless 
house republicans who had gone too long without a good spat took 
offense that they werent consulted about the schedule change 
i think up until now that we thought we had been treated 
fairly as partners in the legislative process said rep 
robert walker of pennsylvania a member of the gop leadership 
that partnership seems to have been unilaterally dissolved 
the republicans soon got revenge 
without fanfare and without telling the republicans the house 
counsel asked the supreme court to delay until fall its 
consideration of the federal antiflag burning statute that 
congress passed last year two lower courts have ruled it 
unconstitutional 
in the logic of politics republicans are hoping that the 
flagprotection law is thrown out the flag left unprotected 
before the fall elections they then could force a house vote on a 
flagprotection constitutional amendment supported by president 
bush 
many democrats last year were willing to approve a 
flagprotection statute but didnt want to alter the constitution 
and especially the bill of rights if the court throws out the law 
republicans then could attack them as unpatriotic unless they vote 
for the amendment 
michel angry that he wasnt consulted before the counsel asked 
for a court delay saw a political opportunity and introduced a 
resolution ordering the brief withdrawn 
democratic leaders tried to fight it but their parliamentary 
maneuvering backfired a series of house votes culminated in a 
309101 victory for michel and a trouncing for foley 
the embarrassment brought the speaker to the house floor to 
defend his motives 
i emphatically state that there was no political and is no 
political motive in the filing of this brief other than to 
undertake the fullest defense of a statute of this house foley 
said he quickly met with the republican leaders and a new brief 
was sent minus the section on delaying court review 
michel meeting with reporters after the vote conceded the 
issue could have been handled much more simply 
but then the republicans would have been denied a chance to make 
the democrats squirm a moralebooster in short supply for the gop 
minority 
and foleys democrats wouldnt have learned something about the 
limits of their majority and party loyalty in the face of political 
threat 
theres little threat that the house will soon return to the 
animosity of the days of jim wright but perhaps the natural 
tension that keeps lawmakers sharp and the house an interesting 
place to watch has returned

gov william a oneills decision not to 
run for reelection is tempting various wouldbe democratic 
successors and strengthening the hand of lowell p weicker jr the 
former republican senator 
weicker running as an independent is leading in the polls for 
what promises to be a tough threeway gubernatorial race 
us rep bruce a morrison a fourterm liberal congressman 
has been campaigning against oneill for several months on the 
democratic side 
oneills moderateto conservatives backers have been touting 
rep barbara b kennelly a popular fourterm congresswoman who is 
the daughter of the late national democratic chairman john m 
bailey but kennelly has refused to run against morrison 
preferring to stay in washington where she is viewed as a rising 
star 
none of the democrats drawn into the race since oneills 
announcement have significant statewide recognition 
they include state rep william j cibes jr of new london who 
announced two hours after oneill withdrew his platform includes a 
proposal for a state income tax that has proved politically 
unfeasible in the past 
oneill became governor on dec 31 1980 when gov ella t 
grasso resigned because of poor health he was elected to fouryear 
terms in 1982 and 1986 
in withdrawing oneill said he wanted to avoid the nasty 
campaign he assumed would be directed at him chiefly for the way 
he has handled the states crumbling finances 
oneill and the democrats who control the general assembly 
raised taxes last year by almost 1 billion big deficit problems 
remain this year 
the republicans who have won the governors office only once 
since 1954 had dreams of victory with the vulnerable oneill as 
the democratic candidate 
but that was before weicker who lost a 1988 senate reelection 
bid announced his candidacy on march 2 
during 18 years as a liberal republican senator weicker pulled 
votes from among the states 700000 democrats 485000 
republicans and 600000 unaffiliated voters 
other demococrats mentioned as possible candidates include 
former west hartford mayor christopher droney brother of state 
democratic chairman john f droney jr senate president pro tem 
john b larson of east hartford and state treasurer francisco l 
borges 
any candidate receiving the support of 20 percent of the 
delegates to the democrats summer convention can qualify for 
septembers primary 
things are far quieter on the republican front where us rep 
john g rowland a threeterm congressman has been leading the 
race for months 
his campaign has been based entirely on the oneill record now 
hell have to look elsewhere for issues 
two are ready made for him morrisons perceived liberal record 
in congress and the tax increases of the past year in hartford 
shaped by some of the other democrats thinking about running 
including cibes and larson 
trailing far behind rowland for the gop nomination are state 
senate minority leader reginald j smith of new hartford joel 
schiavone a millionaire developer from new haven and joseph 
mcgee a bank vice president from fairfield 
financial matters dominate the campaign abortion has not become 
much of an issue in this strong prochoice state

california was the top farm export state in 
1989 for the fifth consecutive year leading nebraska iowa 
kansas texas and illinois according to agriculture department 
estimates 
analysts in the departments economic research service listed 
california at the top of the export chart for the first time in 
1985 replacing perennial winners iowa and illinois 
california has many highvalue crops such as fruits nuts 
vegetables and seeds thus as foreign demand builds for those 
items so do their export values 
the ratings included the top 15 states during the fiscal year 
that ended last sept 30 when export values totaled nearly 397 
billion up from 354 billion in 1988 
in all the 15 states accounted for more than 71 percent of the 
total us export value last year about the same proportion as in 
1988 
only minnesota showed a decline last year with the states 
export value dropping 2 percent to about 176 billion from 
slightly more than 18 billion in 1988 
the drop in minnesota was mainly because of the emphasis the 
state puts on soybeans and soybean export dropped tremendously 
said analyst steve milmoe of the usda agency 
milmoe in a telephone interview said total us soybean export 
values dropped 12 billion last year from about 7 billion in 
1988 thus minnesotas share declined accordingly 
illinois another huge soybean producer was reported at 263 
billion virtually unchanged from 1988 
the annual rankings are not meant to be absolute since usda 
does not monitor state origins as products move into export 
channels mostly the estimates are based on an assumption that 
each states contribution to exports is equal to its share of 
production and marketing 
according to the report last years top 15 export states in 
order in millions of dollars and their percentage increase a 
decrease for minnesota from 1988 included 
1 california 3561 5 percent 
2 nebraska 2984 41 
3 iowa 2978 5 
4 kansas 2845 22 
5 texas 2640 17 
6 illinois 2638 unchanged 
7 minnesota 1763 2 
8 indiana 1424 3

the agriculture department is amending federal 
regulations this week to allow the identification of swine shipped 
across state lines at the first point of concentration after 
leaving the farm 
james w glosser administrator of the departments animal and 
plant health inspection service said a final rule allowing the 
change will be published on tuesday 
previously he said hog producers were responsible in many 
cases for identifying swine before the animals moved into 
interstate commerce 
but the changes are necessary to provide for effective 
traceback of diseased or adulterated swine without unnecessarily 
disrupting standard marketing procedures glosser said 
federal rules requiring the interstate identification of swine 
took effect in november 1988 to help the agency locate hogs 
infected with disease an exception was made for hogs moving 
directly to slaughter plants from farrowtofinish operations 
the regulations define first points of concentration where 
identification may be performed 
for example glosser said that could include the point of first 
gathering or commingling of swine from more than one source such 
as a truck picking up hogs from different farms for delivery to 
market swine identified at this point could be traced directly 
back to herds of origin 
glosser said the rules also clarify the agencys list of 
approved devices used to identify swine in interstate commerce the 
devices used to identify hogs being shipped to slaughter plants 
include tattoos and usda backtags

elderlyrights advocates are battling a 
longstanding postal service policy they say treats nursing home 
residents like prisoners by denying them the right to have their 
mail automatically forwarded when they move 
while other people may submit changeofaddress cards to the 
local post office nursing home residents like inmates must 
rely on the institution to write their new address on individual 
letters 
the policy is being questioned by activists in florida and 
pennsylvania and by members of a senate panel 
it would be much better if the post office could treat the 
nursing home residents like any other citizens said daniel 
greenawalt a stateemployed ombudsman for the elderly in 
pennsylvania 
since residents of a nursing home are at the same address the 
postal service says the home should be the agent of their mail 
the mail is delivered in bulk like at a prison and then 
distributed 
allowing nursing home residents to file address forwarding cards 
would mean the person doing the sorting in the postal facility 
has to have a record of each person in the nursing home where 
there may be quite a deal of turnover not so much in moving but 
in departing this earth postal service spokesman lou eberhardt 
said last week 
when a resident moves eberhardt said the nursing home need 
only write the new address on letters and the postal service will 
redeliver the mail for free 
i think it represents a minuscule problem for everyone 
concerned eberhardt said if we didnt forward mail free of 
charge it would then be an additional irritant its probably a 
very short period of time before correspondents are advised that 
the person has moved from one institution to another 
eberhardt said the service wanted to be flexible about the 
policy and could envision helping out for example in the event of 
a nursing home bankruptcy 
but sister mary gregoria rush of the roman catholic diocese of 
st petersburg fla has been writing to the postmaster general 
and members of congress to try to get the policy changed 
she recalled the case of virginia killilae a 96yearold former 
circus publicist whose mail did not all follow her when she 
transferred from one florida nursing home to another some of the 
letters were returned to sender because the post office did not 
accept a forwarding address card and the institution was not always 
cooperative sister rush said 
this lady had traveled all over the united states and she had 
all her mail stacked up and the date she received it and answered 
it but she spent many hours crying because she was so lonely 
sister rush said if i were a friend writing to a 96yearold and 
i got return to sender id assume she was dead 
republican staff members of the senate special committee on 
aging recently prepared a memorandum concluding that the postal 
service policy cannot be justified by arguments for the 
convenience or efficiency of the institution or the post office 
as a result sen john heinz rpa the panels ranking 
republican told postmaster general anthony frank in a letter last 
week 
mail service provides nursing home and mental health facility 
residents with important links to the outside world i question 
whether these individuals should be classified with inmates who 
have lost important civil rights or with shortterm hospital 
patients and other persons who maintain permanent addresses in the 
community 
heinz asked frank to determine the cost of changing the policy 
heinzs letter is being considered by officials in the rates and 
forwarding section of the postal service spokesman eberhardt said

a teenager who challenged the nations 
first law taking driving privileges from school dropouts becomes 
eligible to get his license back today but hell keep fighting the 
law 
the west virginia law which has been copied by a number of 
states including arkansas florida louisiana and texas suspends 
the drivers license of minors who continually cut class 
its effectiveness ends when the dropout turns 18 as michael 
means does today 
if i have to work monday ill work but one of the main 
things on the list is going to get the license means said as his 
birthday approached i think im just going to ride around the 
courthouse several hundred times 
means who does odd jobs to support his family expressed some 
remorse for leaving school early 
i know i lost something i can never regain but they think 
they can keep you in school by taking your license away and thats 
not very bright means said you cant train kids like you can 
dogs by taking something away 
the law was passed by the legislature in 1988 to help curb the 
states 17 percent dropout rate it revokes students licenses 
until they are 18 if they miss more than 10 consecutive days of 
school or have more than 15 unexcused absences 
means a married father who gave up on a formal education at age 
16 was among the first to become entangled in the law after he 
lost his license and applied for a new one 
the department of motor vehicles citing the dropout law 
refused to issue another license without the consent of the kanawha 
county board of education and the school board rejected means 
hardship argument that he was unable to support his family without 
driving 
means took the officials to court but he lost in circuit court 
in august he has appealed to the state supreme court which is 
likely to hear the case in september 
means attorney chris butch argues it is illogical to take a 
shotgun approach to force teenagers to return to school while 
at the same allowing them to drop out at age 16 butch also argued 
the policy is discriminatory because rural youths unlike city 
dwellers lack access to public transportation means lives on the 
outskirts of charleston 
despite the controversy education officials say the law has 
helped trim the dropout rate to 16 percent 
its not the answer its another strategy were using to help 
deal with the dropout program said therese wilson of the state 
department of education 
if we look at the number of kids who came back because of the 
law when over 300 come back thats 300 kids we would not have 
gotten if it had not been for the law she said 
the law resulted in 687 suspensions for the 198889 school year 
said tom madden general counsel for the motor vehicle division by 
the end of the year nearly 250 of those teenagers had their 
licenses reinstated by returning to school or enrolling in a high 
school equivalency degree program hardship exemptions were given 
to 43 and 157 dropouts got their licenses back when they turned 18 
madden said 376 suspensions have been issued during the current 
school year and 74 young people got their licenses back by 
returning to school or enrolling in an equivalencydegree program 
means who lives in his parents home with his 17yearold wife 
also a dropout and his 7monthold son said he would continue his 
fight even though he now is old enough to get a license 
i guess the only thing i really want is my license back but i 
just want to give other people a chance that dont have one he 
said

a social worker paid 3000 for the 
large wooden crate that was used to ship charles lindberghs plane 
back to the united states after his historic flight to europe in 
1927 
larry ross 38 of canaan maine the executive director of a 
social service agency said he is convinced the crate is 
historically significant he wants to renovate it as a summer 
cottage 
the crate has lain for years in woods near contoocook and has 
been used by passersby in search of free housing it has windows 
and a door and at one time had electricity and a phone but it has 
fallen into disrepair in recent years 
its not an awful lot to look at said ross who plans to 
load up the crate early this week 
ross bought the crate from david price sr who took possession 
of it five years ago when he bought the land from the grandson of 
admiral guy burrage 
burrages ship brought lindbergh and the crate back to the 
united states they became friends the aviator gave him the crate 
and burrage turned it into a summer cottage 
lindbergh made the first solo flight across the atlantic ocean 
from the united states to france in the spirit of st louis 
it struck me as a unique piece of americana that has a certain 
new england eccentricity to it ross said some people look at 
me like are you crazy other people get a real charge out of 
it

defense secretary dick cheney says a soviet 
military crackdown in lithuania would undermine a lot of the good 
work done in recent years in improving ussoviet relations 
cheney said sunday that a move to crush the independence 
movement in the baltic republic would have significant negative 
consequences in terms of ussoviet relations on arms control 
and other issues 
and he said it obviously would undermine a lot of the good 
work thats been done in recent years 
wed like to see the lithuanians granted the same 
prerogative that the east germans were selfdetermination 
cheney said on cbstvs face the nation program 
president bushs national security adviser brent scowcroft 
said saturday that any soviet use of force would be 
counterproductive and that the united states would not ignore 
it 
bush himself had no comment sunday on the situation in lithuania 
as he returned from a weekend at camp david his mountain retreat 
in maryland 
soviet troops occupied two communist schools in vilnius capital 
of the baltic state on sunday one day after tanks rolled through 
the streets in the middle of the night 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev and other kremlin 
officials have been pressuring lithuanias newly elected leaders to 
back off attempts to secede 
bush said friday that any soviet attempt to intimidate or 
forcibly intervene against the lithuanian people is bound to 
backfire 
the united states and the western world have never recognized 
the soviet unions forcible annexation of lithuania and its sister 
baltic states estonia and latvia in 1940 as war swept over europe 
but the united states now says it will not grant formal 
recognition until the breakaway republic establishes control over 
its territory and bush has urged the lithuanians to recognize 
certain realities about its relationship to moscow 
asked if the united states had lured lithuania into rebelling 
cheney said we have not been out actively soliciting revolution 
if you will on the other hand weve made it clear that we share 
the aspirations of the lithuanian people for selfdetermination

the trial of an aidsinfected inmate accused 
of trying to spread the deadly disease by biting a guard marks a 
disturbing trend in criminal justice according to some aids 
litigation experts 
jury selection was to begin today in superior court in the case 
of gregory smith 26 who faces an attempted murder charge 
theres never been a case of hiv being transmitted through a 
bite or saliva said larry gostin executive director of the 
american society of law and medicine which recently completed a 
nationwide aids litigation project for the us public health 
service 
as a result its not a realistic attempted murder charge 
he said 
gostin and others fear smiths case will fuel hysterical fears 
of acquired immune deficiency syndrome 
smith is one of 10 prisoners around the country charged last 
year with trying to kill or injure law enforcement officers by 
infecting them with aids according to judy greenspan information 
director for the american civil liberties unions national prison 
project in washington dc 
most unfortunately this is an alarming trend in the criminal 
justice system said ms greenspan who tracks aidsrelated cases 
for the aclu 
the whole fact that prisoners who are hivinfected are being 
treated differently in the courts is a very serious problem 
aids an affliction that attacks the bodys immune system is 
most often transmitted through sexual contact and among people who 
share needles while abusing drugs its spread in this country began 
among gay men 
it also can be transmitted through transfusions of blood or 
blood products medical experts say it is unlikely that the virus 
can be transmitted by biting 
smith was indicted last summer by a county grand jury on 
attempted murder charges after he allegedly bit a guard three times 
on the hand on june 11 the guard was trying to put smith into a 
patrol car to transport him back to the jail after he underwent 
treatment for a back injury at cooper medical center 
smith who was serving a fiveyear sentence for a robbery 
conviction allegedly yelled now die you pig prosecutors 
said 
the officer was not wearing protective gear or gloves although 
smith was known to have tested positive for the aids virus 
smith has denied biting the guard shortly after the incident 
he was transferred to trenton state prison 
assistant camden county prosecutor harold kasselman who is 
handling the case declined to be interviewed last week citing 
concern over pretrial publicity smiths attorney did not return 
telephone calls seeking comment 
over 100 lawsuits have been filed against aidsinfected 
individuals charging them with attempting to spread the disease 
through biting spitting throwing feces or splattering blood 
according to gostin 
other cases include 
an infected minnesota inmate was convicted of assault with a 
deadly weapon after biting a guard a federal appeals court upheld 
the conviction 
a centre county pa inmate was convicted of assault after 
throwing feces on a state prison guard the conviction has been 
appealed 
an attempted suicide victim in indiana who threw blood at 
emergency personnel was convicted of three counts of attempted 
murder and sentenced to 120 years imprisonment the verdict was set 
aside by the trial judge but reinstated at the appellate level 
the case is pending before the indiana supreme court 
in some ways its almost akin to sticking a pin in a voodoo

the first american novel known to be 
written by a black person described racism in the north just before 
the civil war an unwelcome message that may have helped keep the 
1859 book obscure researchers said 
i think its the kind of statement that white new hampshire 
resents in 1990 said barbara white an associate professor of 
womens studies at the university of new hampshire think of what 
people would have thought in 1859 
harriet e wilsons our nig also depicts hypocrisy among 
white abolitionists and for the first time in american literature 
a successful interracial marriage 
the book was published again in 1983 and more recently has 
attracted attention from researchers like white who are trying to 
find out more about the author white plans to make her research 
public sometime this summer 
published in boston under a pseudonym identical to the title 
the books lengthy subtitle doesnt mince words sketches from 
the life of a free black in a twostory white house north 
showing that slaverys shadows fall even there 
the title itself undoubtedly ruffled feathers at the time white 
said 
people who ordinarily wouldve been sympathetic to a black 
woman writing a narrative werent going to be sympathetic to 
that she said 
cornell university professor henry louis gates has written that 
wilson dared to entitle her text with the most feared and hated 
epithet by which the very humanity of black people had been 
demeaned 
gates discovered an original edition of our nig in a 
manhattan book store when he was a graduate student he traced it 
to wilson with the help of several locals including amherst 
librarian erna johnson and milford town clerks nancy schooley and 
helen draper 
milford where wilson lived in the 1840s was known to have had 
an active abolitionist community gates said our nig not only 
would have offended whites but also blacks who feared it would 
hurt the antislavery movement 
that such a significant novel the very first written by a 
black woman would remain unnoticed in boston in 1859 a veritable 
center of abolitionist reform and passion and by a growing black 
press eager to celebrate all black achievement in the arts and 
sciences remains one of the troubling enigmas of afroamerican 
literary history gates wrote 
but melvin dixon a professor of afroamerican literature at 
queens college in new york said he believes the relative obscurity 
of black authors in general not the books views played a major 
role in keeping the book little known 
white readers were not taking seriously the writing of 
afroamerican scholars dixon said 
white said she is still establishing basic facts about wilson 
like her birth and death dates she also is trying to determine 
whether a real family was the white family depicted in our nig 
our nig is the story of frado daughter of a white woman and 
a black man raised as a servant by a white family in the 
fictitious community of singleton nh 
abandoned by her impoverished mother at a young age frado grows 
up working for the bellmont family and suffering verbal abuse and 
beatings at mrs bellmonts hands 
wilson wrote that frado was maltreated by professed 
abolitionists who didnt want slaves in the south nor niggers in 
their own houses north and could not bear to lodge one to eat 
with one to admit one through the front door to sit next one 
awful 
later frado all but abandons her faith and decides that if 
mrs bellmont is going to heaven shed rather go to hell 
elsewhere frado asks the kindly james bellmont who made me 
so james answers god 
who made your mother frado persists 
god 
did the same god that made her make me 
yes 
well then i dont like him 
why not 
because he made her white and me black why didnt he make us 
both white

crowding increased at local jails between 1983 
and 1988 as new construction failed to keep pace with a 54 percent 
jump in the number of prisoners the justice department says 
the amount of space for each inmate shrunk 6 percent from 543 
square feet in 1983 to 509 square feet in 1988 despite a 437 
percent increase in total jail space according to a study released 
sunday by the departments bureau of justice statistics 
a census of the nations 3316 jails found that on june 30 
1988 there were 341636 prisoners living in 174 million square 
feet of space five years earlier 223272 inmates occupied 121 
million square feet 
the bureaus study found that 28 percent of the nations jails 
in 1988 housed more than 40 percent of their inmates in cells 
smaller than the standard of 60 square feet recommended by the 
american correctional association 
in 1983 only 23 percent of the jails housed inmates in cells 
smaller than the standard 
the proportion of jails placing five or more people in a 
housing unit increased from 24 percent in 1983 to 28 percent in 
1988 the study said and the average occupancy rose from 24 
inmates per unit to 25 inmates 
in 1988 61 percent of all jail inmates lived in the most 
crowded facilities

a study expected to be released this week will 
help determine officially whether vietnam veterans who were exposed 
to the herbicide agent orange suffered cancers and other ailments 
as a result 
the study by the federal centers for disease control which the 
veterans affairs department says will be released thursday 
examines the incidence of five kinds of cancer among vietnam vets 
it is another step in a 12year battle to gain benefits for 
veterans who blame the powerful foliage killer for cancers skin 
disease and miscarriages in their spouses 
va secretary edward j derwinski last novemer said he would 
postpone a determination on whether to award benefits until after 
the study was completed following its release the study must be 
reviewed by a va advisory committee of outside scientists 
derwinski will make a determination at the end of may after the 
committee meets va spokesman don smith said last week final rules 
should be in place in october the decision also could influence 
legislation in congress requiring compensation to veterans 
nearly 35000 claims have been filed citing agent orange which 
was sprayed to remove foliage and kill crops as a cause of 
disabilities an additional 230000 veterans have told va they were 
exposed to the herbicide which contained highly toxic dioxin and 
other suspected harmful ingredients 
the new selected cancers study by the cdc in atlanta does not 
look at whether veterans were exposed to agent orange 
according to the va the new study will determine whether 
vietnam veterans are at higher risk of developing softtissue 
sarcoma lymphoma and nasal nasopharyngeal and liver cancer the 
study began in 1985

people with one or more of six 
characteristics run higher than normal risks of getting the 
deadliest form of skin cancer a new study suggests 
because of its high curability in early stages and the ease in 
identifying likely susceptible people no one should die from 
melanoma said researcher darrell rigel of new york university 
melanoma is expected to kill 6300 americans this year 
according to the american cancer society some 27600 new cases of 
melanoma caused chiefly by excessive exposure to the sun are 
expected this year 
rigel described the new study sunday at a science writers 
conference sponsored by the cancer society the work included data 
from 200 people with or without melanoma and considered 43 
possible factors that might have been found to contribute to the 
disease 
six factors appeared to raise the risk of melanoma blond or red 
hair marked freckling of the upper back the presence of rough red 
bumps on the skin called actinic keratoses that come from sun 
exposure a history of other family members with melanoma a 
history of three or more blistering sunburns during the teenage 
years and having spent three or more years at an outdoor summer 
job as a teenager 
having any one or two of these factors gives a person a three to 
four times increased chance of developing melanoma the study 
suggested the combination of three or more factors gave an 
increase of 20 to 25 times rigel said 
the overall risk of getting melanoma for americans is estimated 
to be about one in 120 rigel said 
it was one in 250 in 1980 and is forecast to be one in 90 in the 
year 2000 he said scientists blame much of the trend on increases 
in the time people spend on the beach and skimpier swimsuits 
because melanoma takes 10 to 20 years to appear after damage 
from the sun rigel said the behavior of people in the 1960s and 
1970s has only recently begun to show up in melanoma rates 
lawrence garfinkel the cancer societys vice president for 
epidemiology and statistics said previous research gives good 
evidence to support the conclusions of rigels study of risk 
factors 
rigel said people at high risk of melanoma should learn the 
socalled abcd method of identifying melanoma early 
the a refers to the asymmetry of melanomas molelike 
growth in which one half does not match the other b stands 
for border irregularity because the edges of the growth are 
ragged notched or blurred 
c refers to color which varies within the growth and d 
stands for the growths diameter of greater than six millimeters 
about the size of a pencil eraser 
rigel said research suggests that if melanoma is detected while 
the lesions are still thinner than about one thirtysecond of an 
inch the 15year survival rate is about 98 percent in contrast 
if lesions are more than about oneeighth of an inch thick when the 
cancer is discovered the survival rate is about 53 percent he 
said 
melanoma spreads to other parts of the body more quickly than 
many other cancers he said a melanoma growth that is the size of 
a dime has probably already spread cancer cells elsewhere he said 
in a separate presentation another researcher said experimental 
treatments that use the bodys diseasefighting immune system show 
some promise against melanoma in early studies 
one approach uses a theraccine an abbreviation of 
therapeutic vaccine sonamed because it aims to fight cancer 
rather than prevent disease said malcolm mitchell of the 
university of southern california school of medicine in los angeles

a threeyearold program under which youngsters go 
to school where mom or dad works is going strong in miami helping 
employers attract and keep working parents 
i think the way society is going right now its almost a 
necessity in very many situations said joseph reynolds a pan am 
worker who each day drives his son brian home from first grade at 
the satellite learning center at miami international airport his 
wife linda another pan am employee takes brian to school in the 
morning 
dade county operates the satellite schools which are built by 
major employers for employees children at the airport a suburban 
insurance company and a community college 
three other florida cities have schools in place or in the 
works and inquiries have come from as far as japan and australia 
new york city schools chancellor joe fernandez the former 
superintendent of dade county schools earlier this month proposed 
setting up satellite schools in manhattan office buildings 
the miami program designed for kindergarten to second grade 
has gotten some rave reviews 
the three satellite schools with 160 children enrolled in six 
classes help the district with overcrowding capital outlays and 
transportation costs because parents are responsible for driving 
their children say school officials 
employers say turnover absenteeism and tardiness are down 
while productivity and morale are up 
it changes the attitudes of the workers their attention at 
the job site changes because they dont have to worry about where 
their children are said dade county school board chairman 
william turner 
about the only drawback some say is that the minischool 
students are not exposed to the big school assemblies big 
libraries and other benefits that come with size there is only one 
class per grade at each satellite school 
at american bankers insurance group absenteeism is 25 percent 
less for employees with children in the companys day care and 
satellite school said philip j sharkey senior vice president of 
human resources companywide turnover was 145 percent last year 
but only 5 percent for parents with children in the programs 
recruitment is easy 
tardiness among those employees has almost become 
nonexistent he said that all translates to better 
productivity within the organization 
under the program in miami the 280000student district 
provides the staff and teaching materials the employer can spend 
up to 350000 on the school building and is responsible for 
maintenance and utilities 
the next satellite schools are expected to open in september at 
a suburban hospital and a downtown government office tower 
anywhere you have a skilled female work force youve got to 
have it said joe tekerman executive assistant to the 
superintendent in dade schools 
he sees hospitals as a natural site saying in years to come 
thatll be a perk they wont be able to get nurses if they dont 
have child care or a satellite learning center 
the question of student performance is still an unknown 
secondgraders take the first formal standarized tests used for 
comparison and the inaugural secondgrade class at american 
bankers will be tested this spring 
but satellite schoolteachers boast that their parentteacher 
meetings often draw perfect attendance compared to a teachers 
estimate of 30 percent at her previous suburban school 
academically they will have achieved more than most 
elementary school kindergartners have achieved and i attribute 
that to parental involvement said thomasine morris kindergarten 
teacher and administrator at the airport school 
at american bankers where everyone from a vice president to a 
maintenance worker has a child enrolled sharkey sees pluses all 
around 
the program is outstanding he said there really are no 
negatives the school district likes it the corporation likes it 
the parents like it and most importantly the children like it it 
really has been a phenomenal success far more than anyone 
realized

dr boshigt this month became 
mongolias first communist party member to hand in his membership 
card ending a lifetime of waiting to speak out against political 
repression 
i had to wait for favorable conditions the 49yearold 
physician said in an interview speaking fluent english 
he had waited for decades 
boshigt joined the ruling mongolian peoples revolutionary party 
even though it had purged his physician father he worked for the 
semiofficial peace and friendship association acting as 
mongolias liaison to socialist international groups such as the 
africanasian solidarity committee 
for the scholarly softspoken boshigt as for many mongolians 
the time to speak came last fall 
with all this democratic change in east european countries and 
the perestroika policy this was the time to do something he 
said referring to the reform policies of soviet president mikhail 
s gorbachev 
boshigt who uses just one name said he met likeminded 
supporters of reform in this longtime soviet client state wedged 
between china and the soviet union he and the young intellectuals 
organized their first rally days later on international human 
rights day dec 10 
thus was born the mongolian democratic association the nations 
first opposition group in nearly seven decades 
always before there were people who wanted to do 
something the physician said it was impossible 
his father gongorjav was jailed for several years then 
banished to the countryside when he objected to replacing 
mongolias ancient script with the cyrillic letters used in the 
soviet union 
but voices of protest remained few and unorganized mongolia 
never developed a dissident community with its own literature and 
mutual support network 
that is why the speedy and effective organization of the 
democratic association came as such a surprise to mongolians by 
midmarch it claimed 70000 members in 17 branches nationwide and 
tens of thousands more supporters for its program of democratic 
reforms 
there is a scientific base a logic to the associations 
program said boshigt who became one of the groups chief 
strategists that is why we are going on so smoothly 
the only thing we accept from marxismleninism is its 
scientific methodology 
mongolias economic and political problems must be solved 
pragmatically he said resorting not to isms but a careful 
study of the countrys past much of which was labeled feudal and 
blotted out of history books by the communists 
mongolia had a basis for building a society we had political 
cultural religious traditions why should we cancel all that by 
building socialism 
determined to let young intellectuals take the lead boshigt 
stepped out of his mentor role only twice when he joined younger 
activists in a threeday hunger strike this month and when he 
turned in his party card 
they strongly criticized me in unen the party newspaper he 
said when the communists staged their own rally march 11 some 
carried a banner that read boshigt a traitor 
a second intellectual of boshigts generation economist p 
nerguye later followed suit many other ruling party members have 
kept their cards even while joining or helping the democratic 
association or other new opposition groups 
but the physician said he has not been harassed by authorities 
he dismissed younger association members dire predictions the 
government may still use force to crush the opposition 
the communists and the government they have long controlled have 
shuffled their top ranks in response to the opposition pressure 
but have yet to provide legal guarantees of political freedom 
boshigt said the communists remain strong with their control of 
the media and bureaucracy perhaps strong enough to win hopedfor 
multiparty elections this year 
but he said you cannot stop the young people because they 
really hate this stalinist regime there was no one i had to 
convince all were ready to give anything to end it

tom hanks brought his kids dan aykroyd wore 
shorts and paula abdul couldnt stop giggling 
tonights 62nd annual academy awards were a day away and the 
pressure was mounting yet the final rehearsal sunday for the oscar 
ceremony had all the gravity of a frogjumping contest 
with overcast skies in the forecast and overanxious fans 
settling in the bleachers outside oscar presenters hanks aykroyd 
abdul tom selleck gregory peck jane fonda jeff bridges and 
jessica tandy playfully practiced their corny award introductions 
about 500 family friends and related hangerson settled into 
the dorothy chandler pavilion to hear the patter 
chevy chase joked with a rotund aykroyd that chase should have 
been nominated for his work in national lampoons christmas 
vacation 
and so it went one camera operator was so bored by the 
proceedings that he spent the better part of an hour scanning the 
sunday comics other technicians collapsed on a couch to watch ncaa 
tournament basketball 
the producer of this years oscar show is gilbert cates he has 
been asked to avenge the legacy of last years las vegaslike 
celebration of oscar glitz 
this years show will feature muted tones and conservative 
production numbers in one of the most daring departures from 
tradition bugs bunny will present the oscar for best animated 
short film 
i hope the outfits people wear are more spectacular than the 
sets said rehearsal watcher linda alexander 
an estimated 1 billion viewers in 90 countries will tune into 
the abc telecast to see if born on the fourth of july can 
triumph over its own hype and four other acclaimed films 
the world will be watching too to see if fourth of july 
star tom cruise is more popular than daniel daylewis from my 
left foot 
all of the advertising primping and interviewing is over the 
only drama that remains outside of what cher will wear is whose 
names are hiding in the envelopes 
the academy awards are wrapped in fancy clothes ornate parties 
and elaborate production numbers but the glitz only obscures a 
common rather artless pursuit winning 
in an industry where good accounting often is more important 
than good acting the oscars now represent the ultimate marketing 
tool the motion picture studios spend combined millions on academy 
award vote campaigns and not because acceptance speeches are fun 
to watch oscar trophies mean money 
after winning last years best picture prize rain man went 
on to make 36 million more in theaters in four of the last seven 
years the best picture winner has been one of the top five 
highestgrossing films of the year according to entertainment data 
inc 
best picture nominee born on the fourth of july one of the 
oscar favorites is wilting at the box office an oscar would 
certainly brighten its future 
already oscar nominations have given new life to two 
independent films my left foot and henry v still playing 
strongly months after their debut 
videocassettes for dead poets society and field of 
dreams also up for best picture have been shipped to stores an 
oscar triumph would give each a kick in the pants 
prognosticators are split over predictions for the top five 
categories 
the favorites for best picture according to critics and 
oddsmakers are born on the fourth of july and driving miss 
daisy if aykroyd wins for best supporting actor it could be 
driving miss daisys night 
if brenda fricker takes the early award for best supporting 
actress the ceremony may belong to my left foot

gay activists claimed victory after an 
international exhibit about the holocaust opened with references to 
homosexual victims of nazi persecution that some utah education 
officials had wanted removed 
about 200 homosexuals and civil libertarians rallied outside the 
exhibit sunday then walked to a nearby episcopal cathedral for a 
holocaust memorial many wore on their lapels the pink triangle 
which the nazis used to tag homosexuals and the gay rights movement 
has appropriated as its symbol 
no one is allowed to rewrite history said robert austin 
who said he represented a looseknit coalition of utah gay and 
human rights organizations i want you to know that not one word 
has been deleted we won 
utah office of education officials earlier this month told 
orembased geneva steel co the corporate sponsor of the world 
of anne frank 19281945 that references to homosexual holocaust 
victims in materials given to teachers and guides might violate a 
state law prohibiting promotion of homosexuality in schools 
the company in turn deleted two pages dealing with the 
treatment of homosexuals after adolf hitlers rise to power in 
1933 thousands of homosexuals were rounded up and sent to 
concentration camps where they were often castrated exterminated 
or worked to death 
a third page showed the pink triangle surrounded by the words 
gays against facism and a brief history of how the symbol was 
adopted by the gay liberation movement in the 1970s 
school officials worried the reference might be construed as 
promulgating homosexuality and asked that it be removed 
protests from homosexuals utahs jewish community and others 
resulted in the materials being restored school board and geneva 
officials called the incident a misunderstanding 
the exhibit contains more than 600 photographs depicting the 
life and times of the young jewish girl whose diaries have been 
read by millions since she perished in a concentration camp in 1945 
only a single caption refers to the persecution of homosexuals 
under nazi rule officials said nobody wanted that reference 
removed 
cornelius suijk international director of the anne frank 
exhibit said he found the incident unfortunate but understood 
how it occurred 
you have to remember that it took 20 years before homosexuals 
in holland were allowed to take part in the annual holocaust 
remembrance he said but they were victims of hitler and 
should be memorialized 
suijk who was accompanying the exhibit throughout its 38city 
tour said geneva officials have made every effort to maintain the 
exhibits integrity 
the exhibit opened at noon sunday at the citycounty building 
and in the evening homosexuals and others held a ceremony to honor 
homosexual holocaust victims outside 
michele a parishpixler executive director of the utah chapter 
of the american civil liberties union congratulated utah 
homosexuals for risking their anonymity and in some cases their 
livelihoods in protesting the deletions 
if the fear is not allowed to grow we wont find ourselves 
being hauled off to concentration camps she said we cannot 
let past oppressions be smothered under a blanket of silence 
the gathering marched to the nearby episcopal cathedral church 
of st mark for a holocaust memorial where bishop michael coburn 
asked for prayers not just for those who died in the death camps 
but for victims of discrimination worldwide 
geneva president joseph a cannon who was critical of the 
deletions when he learned of them said prior to the opening of the 
exhibit that his company was committed to an accurate portrayal of 
history including the nazi persecution of homosexuals 
all in all its been a good experience he said basically 
im just president of a steel company but ive had a lot of nice 
letters from the gay community

maneuvering to select a new leader of the worlds 
70 million anglicans began today after the archbishop of 
canterbury robert runcie announced he was resigning 
one newspaper said today the battle for succession which 
involves the prime minister church leaders and the monarch was 
likely to be the most divisive this century the process was 
expected to take six months or more 
it is widely expected prime minister margaret thatcher will want 
to appoint someone more in step with her conservative views than 
the liberal prelate who said he would retire in january 
runcie made his announcement after morning service at canterbury 
cathedral on sunday the 10th anniversary of his enthronement as 
the 102nd archbishop since st augustine in 597 
i am resigning now because it is 10 years and i think it is 
time to leave and hand over to somebody else he saidthat 
takes a bit of time in the church of england so i judged that the 
beginning of next year was the best time to go 
under church rules bishops must retire by their 70th birthday 
but runcie who will be 70 on oct 2 1991 is giving up the post 
eight months early 
the church recommends who should occupy the throne of augustine 
as spiritual head of the state church of england and leader of all 
anglicans including 25 million american episcopalians 
the crown appointments commission set up by the churchs 
governing general synod consults the anglican communions 27 
selfgoverning churches worldwide then submits two names to the 
prime minister 
the prime minister is expected to choose the commissions first 
choice but may choose either candidate or suggest her own queen 
elizabeth ii the head of the church of england will make the 
formal appointment 
in theory any anglican bishop can be appointed but the church 
of england is more likely to choose an english bishop who church 
leaders feel would be more in touch with the faiths internal 
workings and personalities 
speculation about possible successors touched on richard harries 
of oxford david sheppard of liverpool michael baughen of chester 
john taylor of st albans and colin james of winchester 
relations between the archbishop and mrs thatchers governing 
conservative party have been strained runcie and many other 42 
diocesan bishops have been critical of the governments 
conservative economic and social policies 
runcie preached forgiveness at the end of the falklands war with 
argentina in 1982 offered support to striking miners during a 
yearlong strike and appealed for the conservatives to do more for 
the homeless 
he has been credited with holding together the anglican church 
during bitter disputes over allowing women priests and church 
tolerance of homosexuality 
the church of england refuses to admit women to the priesthood 
but other anglican churches including the united states canada and 
new zealand support womens ordination runcie also has said he 
supports ordaining women 
in addition evangelicals within the church argue against the 
tolerance of homosexuality shown by the anglocatholic high 
churchmen 
the times of london said today runcies announcement launched 
the church into a period of intense infighting and uncertainty 
the paper said the battle for succession is likely to be the 
most divisive this century and the prime minister will find herself 
having to arbitrate between factions who regard the possession of 
the churchs leadership by their camp as vital 
runcies spokeswoman eve keatley said the prelate and his 
wife rosalind a concert pianist would retire to st albans 
where they recently bought a home

gov tommy thompson planned to sign a 
firstofitskind bill that would let 1000 lowincome milwaukee 
students use public education funds to enroll in private schools 
under the plan the state would pay up to 2500 the 
percapita state education allotment for full tuition in 
nonsectarian private schools for each student who chooses to leave 
the publicschool system next fall 
the amount spent would be subtracted from the budget for the 
citys public schools which have nearly 100000 students 
the legislature sent the bill to the governor on thursday 
at the bush administrations invitation the bills sponsor 
state rep annette polly williams dmilwaukee has spent the 
past few months traveling around the country to tout the plan as a 
model for school choice 
money talks ms williams said for the first time poor 
people will get respect because they can take their 2500 to a 
school of their choice and say i want my children educated 
thompson a republican has hailed the schoolchoice bill and 
said he plans to sign it soon 
we as a state have acknowledged that private schools play an 
important role and provide an effective option in the education of 
our children thompson said thursday 
but robert peterkin superintendent of milwaukee schools and 
supporter of some kinds of school choice said the bill the 
legislature passed is a threat to education 
the bill he said could upset the city schools racial 
desegregation plan he also complained it would drain resources 
from innercity schools and do nothing to improve schools that lose 
students 
the concept that the competitive marketplace will magically 
make the publicschool system improve is simplistic peterkin 
said he had no immediate plans to challenge it in court however 
the states largest teachers union the wisconsin education 
association council initially also opposed the proposal but the 
union changed its position when the governor promised not to use 
his partial veto power to expand the program said thomas fonfara 
thompsons education advisor 
fonfara said the unions decision was the key to winning 
legislative support for the plan

the happy land social club might better have 
been called the disaster waiting to happen according to city 
officials 
it was a fire trap said anthony de vita the fire 
departments command chief 
a fire that spread rapidly through the twostory brick building 
early sunday killed 87 people a vengeful former boyfriend of the 
clubs ticket seller allegedly set the fire with gasoline 
city inspectors had ordered the illegal club closed 16 months 
ago 
we close them today they open them tomorrow deputy fire 
commissioner robert ungar said 
the club was riddled with safety faults inspectors said they 
included 
not enough exits there were only two doors on the front of the 
building one of which was shuttered at the time of the fire the 
other was in flames 
bars on the sole window which was in the coatcheck room 
a staircase so narrow that only one person could use it at a 
time it was so steep at 60 degrees that fire spokesman john 
mulligan said he was reminded of the stairs on a ship 
employees who were unequipped and untrained to deal with fires 
no sprinkler system on the first floor 
a lack of proper emergency lighting or signs to show patrons 
the way to safety 
no certification the structure was flameproof 
the fire was apparently set at the front door where julio 
gonzalez 36 allegedly sprinkled gasoline from a plastic jug only 
three people were able to escape 
to save themselves they would have had to pass through the 
fire to get to the exit said fire department chief of operations 
william feehan 
the club had no liquor or cabaret license its patrons paid a 5 
entrance fee to enjoy alcohol dance on a large upstairs dance 
floor or a small one downstairs and mingle with a clientele that 
included hondurans and more recently other hispanics 
many of its most loyal customers were from trujillo honduras 
the disk jockey played music ranging from salsa and reggae to the 
calypso popular on honduras atlantic coast patrons would knock on 
the front door to be admitted before the door was closed and locked 
again it usually was open until 6 am 
on nov 21 1988 the city ordered it vacated 
it was unclear if the club remained open or reopened later but 
on july 24 1989 its manager was arrested by police and charged 
with selling liquor illegally said buildings commissioner charles 
smith 
it was ordered vacated again on nov 1 but it didnt stay that 
way 
mayor david dinkins said he didnt know the buildings current 
owner residents said the manager of the club was elias colon 
one former patron arthur mcintyre said he convinced his 
girlfriend not to go to happy land saturday night 
it was a dangerous building from the beginning but it was a 
lot of fun he said but a few months ago it got bad people 
started bringing guns and drugs and wearing knives i figured 
something was about to explode 
denice garcia another area resident called the club sleazy 
and said the building did not seem sturdy and the large dance floor 
sometimes moved

the communist party newspaper pravda lashed out 
today at growing numbers of demonstrations and protests in the 
soviet union saying they amounted to legalization of extremism 
the newspaper said this winter was one of the most alarming 
and tense periods in our contemporary history 
thousands and thousands of honest people take to the streets 
to say da to the processes of accelerating the perestroika to 
the development of democracy pravda said in a frontpage 
editorial 
but we cannot help seeing the other side of it protests 
and demonstrations increasingly become one of the forms of 
legalizing extremism of further undermining the situation which is 
complex in itself 
describing the situation as critical the newspaper assaulted 
radical reformists as well as fundamentalists saying they are 
trying to form organized opposition to the existing structures of 
state authority and to seize the power by nonconstitutional 
methods 
pravda was especially critical of activists and parliament 
members who were behind destabilizing rallies of feb 25 when 
about 1 million people took to the streets in moscow and a dozen 
other cities demanding swift democratic change 
under president mikhail s gorbachev soviet citizens have 
become much freer to express opinions in rallies print and 
politics 
but gorbachev has appealed to his countrymen to move past what 
he has called a period of demonstrations to work hard to improve 
their country 
pravda said that between jan 1 and feb 23 some 64 million 
people took part in more than 1500 rallies throughout the country 
it said almost 500 demonstrations with a total of more than a 
million participants took place on feb 24 and feb 25 alone during 
the rallies to press for for reform 
seventythree protests with more than 12 million participants 
occurred for three days ending march 10 the newspaper said 
in 1989 pravda counted more than 5000 rallies in which 124 
million people took part

the head of polands new government is offering 
to help soviet jews get to israel now that their main route has 
been lost because of terrorist threats 
last week hungarys airline said it was ending charter flights 
to israel for the emigrants because of threats from arab extremists 
prime minister tadeusz mazowiecki of poland told leaders of the 
american jewish congress on sunday night that his country was 
prepared to step in and provide assistance 
just as in the middle ages poles gave refuge to jews fleeing 
persecution poland will not evade humanitarian assistance to jews 
emigrating from the soviet union he said bringing cheers from a 
crowd of about 300 people 
mazowieckis spokeswoman malgorzata niezabitowska said there 
was no formal plan but that if asked polands lot national 
airline would be willing to provide charter flights for soviet jews 
the polish leaders offer is a decision of great moral and 
political significance that will be welcomed by jews all over the 
world said henry siegman the congress executive director 
in israel on sunday a lot official said both the polish flag 
carrier and israels el al airlines would add a weekly flight 
between warsaw and tel aviv doubling each carriers weekly flights 
on the route 
mazowiecki 62 received the congress freedom award for his 
efforts in helping end more than four decades of communist rule in 
his country and for speaking out against antisemitism 
on friday israeli foreign minister moshe arens said hungarys 
staterun malev airline was surrendering to terror by deciding 
to stop flying soviet jews to tel aviv via budapest because of the 
threat of terrorist attacks 
budapest the romanian capital of bucharest and several other 
european cities had become transit points for soviet jews arriving 
on the soviet airline aeroflot which has deferred to arab allies 
in refusing to fly the emigres directly to israel 
palestinian and arab leaders view the immigration of soviet jews 
to israel as a grave threat and have launched an unprecedented 
antiimmigration campaign 
they became concerned after prime minister yitzhak shamir of 
israel suggested his country needs to keep the occupied territories 
to settle soviet jews 
according to official israeli figures about 16700 soviet jews 
emigrated to israel in january and february already higher than 
the 12900 for 1989 israeli officials say they expect 750000 
soviet jews to arrive in the next decade because of the soviet 
unions more liberal emigration policies and stricter us entrance 
requirements 
mazowiecki said in his speech that now that the poles have cast 
off totalitarian rule the time has come to make a breakthrough in 
relations between poles and jews 
predominantly roman catholic poland was a thriving seat of 
jewish culture until the holocaust in which 3 million of the 
countrys 35 million jews were killed by the nazis many poles 
risked their lives by sheltering jews from the nazis but others 
turned jews over to the germans three million other poles also 
died world war ii 
most polish jews who survived left poland immediately after the 
war even more fled after a governmentled antisemitic purge in 
1968 leaving polands mostly elderly jewish population at less 
than 10000 
mazowiecki a former solidarity newspaper editor has offered to 
reinstate citizenship for any jews forced out in 1968 and 
reiterated the offer sunday 
the prime minister today winds up a sixday us trip that began 
in washington where he met with president bush and included a 
stop in chicago on tuesday he flies to canada

the interior minister resigned the same 
day an assassinated presidential candidate was buried and reports 
said he accused the government of no longer being interested in 
fighting drug traffickers 
president virgilio barco said in a communique late sunday that 
contrary to the insinuations of interior minister carlos lemos 
simmonds the government had no intention of easing its 7monthold 
campaign against cocaine barons 
to succeed lemos barco named sen horacio serpa uribe of his 
governing liberal party saying serpa uribe had demonstrated a 
clear and upright position against drug trafficking 
the radio networks rcn and caracol said they obtained a copy of 
lemos resignation letter in which he accuses the government of no 
longer being committed to fighting drugs the networks did not 
elaborate 
the government announced its usbacked offensive in august 
after traffickers shot and killed the leading presidential 
candidate since then 14 accused traffickers have been extradited 
to the united states 
lemos resigned amid a dispute over responsibility for the 
assassination by suspected traffickers of a second candidate 
bernardo jaramillo of the leftist patriotic union 
jaramillo was buried sunday in manizales after thousands of 
patriotic union supporters marched through the citys streets 
the patriotic unions president diego montana demanded lemos 
step down saying the interior minister made comments that probably 
led traffickers to kill jaramillo lemos had said the patriotic 
union was the political arm of the countrys largest guerrilla 
group the colombian revolutionary armed forces 
the colombian attorney generals office said two years ago that 
many of the rightwing death squads that kill leftists have been 
organized by drug traffickers but the patriotic union has said 
army and security forces participate in the death squads which are 
blamed for killing 1044 members of the party in six years 
meanwhile the liberal party held its convention in bogota and 
formally nominaed cesar gaviria 43 for president 
gaviria who won a march 11 primary with 51 percent of the vote 
will face rodrigo lloreda the candidate for the opposition 
conservative party in general elections scheduled for may 27 
the convention delegates observed a minute of silence for 
jaramillo and luis carlos galan the liberal party candidate 
assassinated in august gaviria had served as galans campaign 
manager 
jaramillo 36 was fatally wounded at bogotas airport on 
thursday authorities said the gunman was hired by traffickers 
his death prompted the conservatives and the patriotic union to 
call for a postponement of the elections while the government takes 
additional measures to protect candidates 
but gaviria heavily favored to win said the vote should be 
held on schedule the only antidote for violence is more 
democracy he said in his acceptance speech sunday 
the candidate repeated his pledge to fight traffickers he said 
an effective battle requires reforming the judicial system so it 
can bring cocaine traffickers to justice 
in the past drug barons have been able to evade justice by 
bribing threatening and killing judges in colombia

birthday celebrations for the city a treasure hunt followed on 
lincoln road a onceglamorous avenue of shops now being 
revitalized as an art center after years of neglect 
the prize a diamond was fitting for a 75th anniversary and a 
subtropical resort known for glitz hokey maybe but this towns 
fame grew from tropical visions and corny promotional schemes 
in the 1920s indiana auto parts magnate carl fisher spent 
millions developing the island 
he also hired rosie the elephant to do the heavy lifting 
there was a whole lot of smokeandmirrors type of publicity 
now the beach obviously has substance to it said ruben aguilar 
president of the nonprofit corporation organizing the anniversary 
officially miami beach was founded on march 26 1915 on that 
date 33 of the islands 300 residents voted to incorporate a 
failing coconut plantation and what was left of the swamp into the 
city limits 
publicists then sent pictures of bathing beauties to the 
nations newspapers and the first droves of northern tourists soon 
began arriving 
in 1926 a hurricane wiped out the golf courses polo grounds 
and early hotels it also cleared the way for hundreds of colorful 
art deco hotels and apartment buildings built in the 1930s 
today most of those buildings remain distinguishing miami 
beach from the concrete canyons along beaches in so many other 
florida cities their timely protection came in 1979 when 
preservationists got the citys south beach district listed on the 
national register of historic places 
in the 1980s the successful miami vice television show and 
millions of dollars in public and private investment led to the 
refurbishment or replacement of the chic hotels where arthur 
godfrey and his band taught america to dance and jackie gleason 
made the nation smile 
nowadays europeans often choose the citys broad white beach 
over the packed french riviera artists yuppies and families now 
are settling down here driving up rents the citys population is 
98000 
one result of all the attention is that members of the chamber 
of commerce now admit the outspoken artdeco protectors helped 
rekindle outside investors interest in the city 
youve got to give the art deco and preservation people a 
great deal of credit for whats happening now aguilar said if 
nothing else they brought people back here and once they got back 
here they saw what the beach was all about

following the lithuanians lead communist leaders 
in neighboring estonia have voted overwhelmingly to break with the 
moscowbased national party 
to soften the blow for soviet authorities however the estonian 
partys central committee agreed to wait six months before voting 
to finalize the split 
sundays move by estonias ruling party follows a similar vote 
in december by its sister party in its fellow baltic republic of 
lithuania whose communist party broke with moscow in december 
on march 11 lithuanian declared itself independent touching 
off a war of nerves with moscow which called the secession illegal 
and invalid 
but shows of military strength and decrees asserting soviet 
sovereignty over the republic have not deterred the lithuanians 
whose republic was forcibly annexed by the soviet union in 1940 
along with estonia and the third baltic state latvia 
most latvians and estonians appear determined to follow 
lithuania though move at a slower pace in the drive for 
independence 
sundays vote to establish an independent communist party in 
estonia was 4323 with seven abstensions said lembo taning an 
adviser on economic affairs to the partys central committee 
but the official soviet news agency tass said 228 delegates 
including many ethnic russians boycotted the polling 
estonias 106000member communist party has been far more 
cautious than its lithuanian sister party it voted to wait for a 
party congress scheduled for october before finalizing its split 
with moscow 
the party also cautiously backed appeals for independence 
at sundays meeting communist party deputies agreed to support 
the independence of the estonian people on the basis of the free 
expression of the peoples will but they described the road 
toward independence as an arduous and controversial process that 
requires legal foundation and the establishment of a solid 
economic and social basis 
tass said the party would hold its october congress to make a 
final decision on its relationship with moscow 
russians poles and other ethnic groups make up 40 percent of 
estonias 16 million people and strongly oppose secession in 
lithuania by contrast ethnic minorities make up 20 percent of the 
38 million people 
in estonia 55 out of the 105 lawmakers elected earlier this 
month to parliament are members of the communist party where there 
is deeply division among supporters of independence and ethnic 
russian groups that oppose it 
the proindependence peoples front political movement holds 46 
seats and is supported by some small parties russian groups have 
27 seats and the free estonia group holds 13 seats 
these divisions would make it difficult for the estonian 
independence movement to obtain the necessary twothirds majority 
and push through a vote on secession 
tass said ethnic russian lawmakers may join with free estonia to 
block such a vote but estonian activists said they expect free 
estonia to support the independence drive

raymond walter goulding half of the bob 
and ray comedy team whose lowkey humor and gentle satire delighted 
radio and tv audiences for more than four decades died after a 
long battle with kidney failure he was 68 
he died at about 6 am saturday said his son bryant goulding 
goulding and bob elliott created their comedy team in boston in 
the late 1940s and performed together until about two years ago 
when goulding became ill 
i have a terrible feeling of loss elliott said sunday i 
think the main reason we worked well together was that we really 
appreciated each other as opposed to some comedy teams 
we had no rivalry just great mutual respect 
the two brought their act to new york city in the early 1950s 
creating a stable of improbable yet totally recognizable characters 
among the most memorable were wally ballou the bumbling 
interviewer cooking authority mary mcgoon the piel brothers and a 
writer named o leo leahy 
they did commercials for bogus businesses as well as real ones 
among them were height watchers international offering six ample 
servings of low vitamins and nutrients in artificial colorings 
and einbinder flypaper the brand youve gradually grown to trust 
over the course of three generations 
goulding a native of lowell mass and elliott made separate 
starts in boston radio around 1940 then entered military during 
world war ii they met in 1946 at radio station whdh where elliott 
was a disc jockey and goulding was a newscaster their 
earlymorning quips soon put them in demand as a team 
we never said lets be a comedy team but the chemistry was 
there and nobody told us to stop elliott told the new york 
times 
they also appeared in numerous radio and television productions 
and motion pictures 
elliott recently appeared on garrison keillors american radio 
company of the air the new show performed live in new york and 
broadcast on public radio stations 
gouldings films include cold turkey in 1969 and author 
author in 1982 he also acted in the 19701971 broadway play 
the two and only 
he cowrote a book with elliott entitled from approximately 
coast to coast its the bob and ray show it was published in 
1983 
goulding is survived by elizabeth his wife of 45 years six 
children and six grandchildren 
funeral services were scheduled for wednesday at st marys

prime minister bob hawke and his labor 
party appeared likely to win a record fourth consecutive term 
despite a strong challenge from their conservative opponents media 
reports said today 
the reports said a victory could hinge on outback voters 
stranded by floodwaters who were unable to get to the polls on 
saturday 
hawke who has governed for seven years appeared to have an 
edge over the conservative coalition led by andrew peacock in the 
148seat house of representatives 
latest returns indicated labor had won 73 seats the coalition 
70 and the independents two labor which had 85 seats in the 
previous lower house needs 75 seats for a working majority 
hawke said in a worst case scenario his party would win 73 
votes against 73 for the liberal and national coalition the 
remaining two seats would go to independents 
peacock 51 making his second bid for the prime ministership 
refused to concede defeat but acknowledged labor might have the 
numbers to win a fourth term the house of representatives chooses 
the government 
the vote seemed to hinge on several thousand voters in the 
outback town of kennedy who were unable to get to polling stations 
because of flooding newspapers said 
by today some were still prevented from casting ballots 
representatives from both parties were sent to kennedy to try to 
influence the vote 
votes still were being counted in the state of western australia 
final results were not expected until thursday when mailin 
ballots are counted 
hawke on sunday estimated his party would return with a majority 
of at least one seat 
newspapers said hawke 60 seemed likely to lead his party to 
victory despite dissastisfaction over high interest rates and a 
100 billion foreign debt economic issues were central in the 
campaign 
the sydney morning herald today predicted labor would win by at 
least two seats the daily australian said labor appeared to have a 
slim lead 
the daily mirror in an editorial today said at this stage it 
looks as though labor will be returned with a small majority 
although the possibility of a hung parliament or a liberal party 
victory still cannot be discounted 
the paper said australia might benefit from the close result 
both sides have effectively been given notice that their 
performances must vastly improve and that they cannot distance 
themselves from the concerns of the electorate the editorial 
said 
hawke came to power in 1983 was reelected the following year 
and again in 1987 he has said that if reelected in this race he 
will seek a fifth term before retiring

tar balls that washed up on a 
beach may be remnants of last months 394000gallon spill or oil 
stirred from the ocean bottom by offshore earthquakes coast guard

serious health threat to swimmers officials said 
there is a moderate amount of tar balls from the huntington 
pier south to huntington street about a halfmile stretch of 
beach said lt jg donna davis of the coast guards marine safety

for cleaning up 20 miles of orange county coast costs have totaled

serbian police in kosovo province 
began rounding up ethnic albanians blamed for attacks on minority 
slavs following a mysterious illness that affected hundreds of 
teenagers a newspaper said today 
slavs were accused of poisoning the youths last week but the 
government has charged that the illness was faked and was an 
action of albanian separatists intended to stir more unrest in 
the troubled province 
the yugoslav republic of serbia which administers the southern 
province bordering albania took control of local police over the 
weekend after the attacks that media reports said injured 30 slavs 
radmilo bogdanovic serbias chief of internal affairs in a 
statement to the newspaper politika said the largest yugoslav 
republic sent special units of police in all municipalities and 
settlements in kosovo and that the the province is now fully 
secured by forces of public order and peace 
bogdanovic said serbian police were involved in identifying the 
executors of indignant attacks on serbs and montenegrins and of 
the organizers of the allegedly sham poisoning 
an undisclosed number of ethnic albanian policemen were 
suspended after allegations that they watched impassively as serbs 
were beaten by albanians in apparent retaliation for the alleged 
poisoning of albanian children 
nearly 1000 schoolchildren most of them members of kosovos 
ethnic albanian majority were hospitalized last week complaining 
of lung and skin problems and alleging they were poisoned by a 
mysterious gas 
federal health officials and the belgradebased military medical 
academy said no traces of poisoning could be established in more 
than 100 blood and urine samples analyzed 
more than 60 people have died in ethnic violence in the past 
year in the province where 90 percent of the population consists 
of ethnic albanians albanian nationalists seek to regain autonomy 
lost last year when serbia assumed direct control of kosovos 
judiciary and schooling

the supreme court today refused to revive a 
lawsuit stemming from one of the nations most publicized cases of 
alleged child abuse at the nowdefunct mcmartin preschool in 
manhattan beach calif 
the court without comment let stand a ruling that threw out 
the suit against a private child welfare group and one of its 
therapists by two of the preschools former teachers 
seven people connected to the preschool were indicted in 1984 on 
childmolesting charges but charges against five later were 
dropped 
the two remaining defendants raymond buckey and his mother 
peggy mcmartin buckey were acquitted of most of the charges jan 
18 after a threeyear trial 
jurors deadlocked on some of the charges and prosecutors in los 
angeles plan to retry buckey on some of those counts 
the appeal acted on today stems from a lawsuit by buckeys 
grandmother virginia mcmartin and his sister peggy ann buckey 
the women were among the defendants against whom criminal charges 
were dropped 
they said their rights were violated by the childrens institute 
international and kathleen macfarlane head of that organizations 
diagnostic unit 
the institute was hired by los angeles county and manhattan 
beach officials to help investigate the childabuse allegations 
the child welfare organization concluded that numerous acts of 
child abuse had occurred at the school 
in their suit the two former teachers alleged that ms 
mcfarlane leaked confidential information about the case to a 
television news reporter with whom she was involved romantically 
the teachers also said the institute manipulated children attending 
the preschool to support the abuse charges 
a california appeals court last year threw out the suit saying 
the institute and its employees cannot be sued because california 
law requires child care custodians and others to report to 
authorities any known or suspected instance of child abuse 
those subject to this mandatory reporting requirement are 
absolutely immune from civil or criminal liability for making such 
a report the state court said 
lawyers for the two teachers said such protection unfairly goes 
beyond even that accorded prosecutors 
if the prosecutor ballyhooing his prosecution before the media 
is not absolutely immune for that performance how can one say that 
kathleen macfarlanes pillowtalk leaks of inside information 
is entitled to absolute protection they asked 
the case is mcmartin vs childrens institute international

the supreme court today agreed to consider 
giving federal regulators more authority to lower electricity 
rates setting the stage for a decision that could affect more than 
49 million homes 
the court said it will review a ruling that barred the federal 
energy regulatory commission from slashing rate increases to 
customers in 15 ohio communities 
a decision is expected sometime in 1991 
at stake is the commissions power to prevent public utilities 
from passing on to consumers allegedly inflated costs of buying 
coal and possibly other goods and services from utility 
subsidiaries 
the bush administration joined the ohio communities in urging 
the court to study the case 
the dispute stems from rate hikes first proposed by ohio power 
co in 1982 the utility asked the commission to approve higher 
rates to cover the cost of buying coal from its subsidiary the 
southern ohio coal co 
the commission concluded that ohio power from 1982 to 1986 paid 
its subsidiary between 25 percent and 33 percent more for coal than 
the prevailing market prices 
the commission ordered the utility to refund 134 million to 
its wholesale customers for that period 
but a us circuit court of appeals here which has authority 
over such actions by federal regulators overturned the 
commissions decision last year 
the appeals court interpreted a 1935 federal law to give the 
securities and exchange commission primary authority to regulate 
sales contracts between holding companies and their subsidiaries 
the sec is charged by the statute with regulating the terms of 
affiliate contracts in the interest of consumers as well as 
investors and the public and has not exempted the contract

the supreme court today agreed to review a 
ruling that if upheld could reinstate forced busing for the 
racial desegregation of oklahoma city okla elementary schools 
the court must decide whether the city school board acted 
lawfully when in 1985 it returned to a neighborhood schools plan 
for children in kindergarten through fourth grade 
at issue is the effect of a federal judges ruling in 1977 that 
oklahoma citys public schools had become fully integrated and no 
longer had to be under court supervision 
the issue gained national attention when the reagan 
administration helped bring about a halt to courtordered busing of 
elementary school pupils in norfolk va 
the norfolk school district was allowed to return to a 
neighborhood schools plan in 1986 
william bradford reynolds head of the justice departments 
civil rights division when it entered the norfolk case in 1984 
said the same legal principles could apply to many many other 
school districts around the country 
hundreds of school districts including those in most major 
cities operate courtordered busing plans for racial 
desegregation but only a few have persuaded courts as did those 
in norfolk and oklahoma city to declare their oncesegregated 
systems fully integrated 
in the oklahoma city case a federal appeals court last oct 6 
disapproved the neighborhood schools plan 
oklahoma city public schools once were racially segregated by 
law black parents sued in 1961 to end the lasting effects of such 
segregation and in 1972 forced busing was begun as part of a 
courtordered desegregation plan 
us district judge luther bohanon ruled in 1977 that the school 
district had become fully integrated and ended court supervision 
school officials continued the crosstown busing however until 
1985 when children in kindergarten through fourth grade were 
allowed to attend the school nearest their home 
by 1986 33 of the school districts 64 elementary schools were 
90 percent black or white 
some black parents challenged the neighborhood schools plan 
calling it a tool of resegregation other black parents had 
criticized the busing program 
judge bohanon refused to reopen the case ruling that school 
officials did not intend to discriminate on the basis of race when 
they adopted the neighborhood plan 
the 10th us circuit court of appeals however ordered bohanon 
to give the challengers a chance to prove that adopting the 
neighborhood plan was unconstitutional the supreme court in late 
1986 refused to disturb the appeals courts ruling 
after conducting a trial bohanon ruled that the 1972 
desegregation plan no longer had to be enforced because federal 
court supervision ended with his 1977 declaration that the school 
district was fully integrated 
but the 10th circuit courts october ruling said federal court 
supervision in such cases extends beyond the termination of the 
wrongdoing 
the appeals court said the oklahoma city school board has a 
continuing duty to refrain from any action that could weaken racial 
balance in the public schools it ordered bohanon to study 
alternatives to maintain racially balanced elementary schools 
in the appeal acted on today school board lawyer ronald l day 
said the 10th circuit courts ruling directly conflicts with 
federal appeals court rulings in the norfolk case and one from 
austin texas 
in each of those the appeals courts ruled that court 
supervision ends when a previously segregated school district is 
found to be fully integrated or unitary 
in a friendofthecourt brief the national school boards 
association urged the justices to use the oklahoma city case to 
resolve what constitutes a unitary school system and determine the 
effect of a declaration of unitary 
the case is oklahoma city board of education vs dowell 891080

the supreme court today refused to extend a 
key civil rights law to protect noncitizens from private as well 
as governmental bias 
the court over two dissenting votes let stand a ruling that 
the first national bank of commerce in new orleans did not 
discriminate illegally against jeetendra bhandari when it denied 
his application for a bank credit card because he is not a us 
citizen 
justices byron r white and sandra day oconnor voted to hear 
arguments in the case but four votes are needed to grant such 
review 
todays action does not set a national precedent but merely 
leaves intact a federal appeals court ruling that has become 
binding law in three states louisiana mississippi and texas 
the 5th us circuit court of appeals by a 76 vote ruled that 
federal law does not protect aliens from such discriminatory 
treatment 
bhandari a native of india is a permanent legal resident of 
this country he worked as an accountant in new orleans before 
recently moving to dallas 
in 1983 he applied for a visa card with first national but was 
denied one he was told his application had been denied because he 
is not a us citizen 
bhandari sued the bank in 1984 invoking a civil war era law 
most often used these days to battle private bias against racial 
minorities it says that all persons within the jurisdiction of 
the united states shall have the same right to the full and 
equal benefits of all laws 
the supreme court previously has ruled that the law the civil 
rights act of 1866 protects racial minorities from private and 
governmental bias 
the court also has ruled that the law protects aliens from 
governmental bias but the justices never have ruled specifically 
on whether the law may be used to fight private nongovernmental 
discrimination against aliens 
the 5th circuit court ruling in 1987 drew a distinction 
between private discrimination based on race and nationality 
racial and citizenship distinctions are things of a different 
kind the former is for the individual immutable the latter is 
not the appeals court said while the alien guest is not 
without his own special claims upon us arising from our moral 
tradition they are of a different quality from those grounded in 
our common humanity 
the justices last june 26 set aside the ruling in bhandaris 
case and ordered the appeals court to restudy it in light of their 
decision reaffirming that the 1866 law protects racial minorities 
from private bias 
after undertaking that restudy the appeals court last nov 2 
reached the same conclusion and reinstated its 1987 ruling 
the case is bhandari vs first national bank of commerce

east germany today dropped plans to try 
disgraced former communist leader erich honecker and three other 
ousted officials for high treason saying there was no legal basis 
for the charges 
however the chief prosecutors office said the ailing honecker 
and two of the officials remain under investigation on suspicion of 
massive corruption and abuse of power 
also today efforts to form a noncommunist governing coalition 
remained bogged down over allegations that leading politicians in 
the weekold democracy had links to the disbanded secret police 
honecker 77 and the three other top communist officials were 
members of the ruling hardline politburo toppled in last falls 
peaceful revolt 
prosecutors had said earlier that honecker former state 
security chief erich mielke former economics czar guenther mittag 
and expropaganda chief joachim herrmann would be indicted and put 
on trial this month on charges of high treason which carries a 
maximum sentence of life in prison east germany abolished the 
death penalty last summer before the communists were swept from 
power 
chief prosecutor hansjuergen joseph said there were no legal 
grounds for a treason indictment and also cleared honecker mielke 
and mittag of conspiracy charges 
joseph in a statement carried by the governmentrun news agency 
adn accused honecker and his lieutenants of persistent breaches 
of the constitution 
but he said these were part of a stalinist system of oneparty 
communist rule and suggested that individuals could not be charged 
for abuses 
honecker and mielke currently are not imprisoned because of 
their bad state of health which prosecutors say is also hampering 
the investigation honecker was arrested jan 29 but officials 
released him a day later because he is suffering from kidney cancer 
joseph today ordered herrmann released mittag remains in jail 
remaining allegations against honecker and mittag include 
embezzlement of state funds for a privileged lifestyle such as 
construction of private vacation homes 
mielke 84 faces a range of accusations stemming from his 
control of the former allpowerful state security apparatus 
indictments against the former officials are not expected before 
may or june joseph told the associated press 
the past also continued to haunt the new political forces in 
east germany 
the leader of the social democratic party denying allegations 
he had been an informer for the communist secret police said today 
he was temporarily leaving his post until the suspicions have been 
dispelled 
ibrahim boehme told a news conference he would also not assume 
his seat in the 400seat new parliament until the allegations had 
been investigated 
boehme said sunday talks between leading parties to form a 
coaliiton government should be suspended until the allegations had 
been investigated and cleared up 
he said he was temporarily leaving the chairmanship of the party 
to his deputy markus meckel 
boehme whose party finished a distant second in east germanys 
first free election on march 18 was the latest noncommunist 
politician to come under suspicion of having collaborated with the 
stasi secret police 
lothar de maiziere the likely new premier whose christian 
democratic union won the election is fighting similar allegations 
de maiziere has strongly denied reports that he was a longtime 
stasi informer 
the swirl of allegations is stalling efforts to form east 
germanys first democratically elected government and has 
overshadowed the countrys first week as a democracy 
boehmes deputy meckel said anonymous allegations by former 
stasi agents were designed to destabilize the country disturb the 
population and discredit the newly elected parliament

the survivors most from washington state began returning home 
during the weekend they told stories of a panicky dash to get off 
the sinking ship followed by an agonizing wait for rescue in 
nearfreezing water 
several said no alarm sounded to warn them as the 162foot boat 
heeled and began to sink in calm seas they also said they had 
little or no training in the use of survival suits that were 
designed to save them 
price 19 said in a telephone interview from his aberdeen home 
that he was asleep when his friend harvey dale philpot 20 of 
hoquiam woke him up the boat started to capsize 30 seconds to a 
minute later he said 
i ran up and climbed up the ladder and by that time it was 
almost on its side price said 
clad only in pants and a shirt price tried to locate a survival 
suit but couldnt i looked for it but i just didnt have enough 
time to dig through all the material in a locker he said 
another crew membere derrik santy said i just went on 
instinct the people all around me were screaming help me help 
me 
santy interviewed by the anchorage daily news before leaving 
alaska on saturday said he was below deck when the ship began to 
roll scrambling to the deck santy jumped into the water and 
grabbed anything that floated 
price recalled gear tumbling across the deck i was out on the 
railing then it tipped nearly all the way over and i just jumped 
out as far as i could jump he said 
i just swam and swam and there was a round buoy and i grabbed 
onto that he said he said he then swam another 50100 yards to 
a life raft where he was dragged aboard 
the 195ton cod fishing and processing factory trawler sank 
about 250 miles northwest of dutch harbor alaska the day before 
it was to return to port after fishing for three weeks

it suddenly heeled rolled and went under in a matter of minutes 
the cause of the sinking has not been determined in addition to 
the state of alaska the coast guard and national transportation 
safety board are investigating the accident 
alaska state trooper robert stevenson said several survivors 
told him the ships alarm system had not worked for months the 
ships are supposed to be equipped with general alarms some of

the supreme court today rejected an appeal by 
a major conglomerate found to have fraudulently obtained a 75 
million bank loan to develop natural gas fields in mississippi 
the court without comment left intact a ruling that could 
subject wr grace amp co to substantial punitive damages in a 
lawsuit by the federal deposit insurance corp 
continental illinois national bank made the loan to grace in 
1980 to finance the companys acquisition of three mississippi gas 
fields 
grace discovered before the loan was approved that one of the 
fields apparently was worthless but it did not reveal that 
development to the bank for three years 
the bank then sued the conglomerate for fraud in 1984 the bank 
soon assigned the grace loan to the fdic since the government 
agency was helping bail out the failing bank 
a federal jury awarded the fdic 100 million in damages 
including 25 million to compensate the agency for its losses and 
75 million to punish grace a federal judge reduced the 75 
milllion portion of the award to 25 million 
the 7th us circuit court of appeals last year upheld the 
jurys finding of fraud but ordered a new trial on damages 
the appeals court said there was sufficient evidence the company 
practiced fraud to obtain the loan concealment was the essence 
of graces fraud the appeals court said only after grace 
thought it was home free in fact three years after it thought it 
was home free did it reveal the fraud 
but the 7th circuit court said it was troubled by the way the 
jury decided the fdic suffered 25 million in actual damages 
the jury was allowed to pick a figure out of the air the 
appeals court said the amount of punitive damages related as 
they are to compensatory damages will have to be redetermined as 
well in the new trial 
graces lawyers urged the supreme court to use the case to 
decide whether a government agency may be awarded punitive damages 
in fraud lawsuits 
the grace appeal also said it is unfair to limit the new trial 
ordered by the appeals court to the size of damages 
justice department lawyers in asking the high court to reject 
graces appeal said it borders on brazenness for the 
conglomerate to argue that the fdic is not entitled to major 
damages when grace has failed to repay a 75 million loan 
the case is wr grace vs fdic 89902

for the maine state music theatres upcoming season 
a former concert pianist miss crandall in 1959 founded the 
brunswick summer playhouse which later became the brunswick music 
theater the name was changed again two years ago to the maine 
state music theatre with miss crandall serving as executive 
director and artistic director 
the theater located on the bowdoin college campus rejected 
packaged shows in favor of originally designed productions over 
the past three decades miss crandall staged 186 productions seen 
by more than 15 million people

an evansville ind business convicted and 
fined 5000 for showing and selling movies harmful to minors 
lost a supreme court appeal today 
the court without comment refused to hear arguments that the 
conviction and fine infringe the freespeech rights of the studio 
art theatres owners and violate the required separation of 
government and religion 
the business was indicted in 1986 on charges of violating the 
indiana criminal racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act 
rico by selling and displaying movies in violation of state law 
the underlying state law bars a business from selling or 
displaying materials that are deemed harmful to minors within 500 
feet of the nearest property line of any church or school 
the studio art theatre is located within 500 feet of a church 
at a nonjury trial lawyers for the business agreed to let four 
sexually explicit movies be considered harmful for children under 
18 but noted it was never alleged that any youngster actually saw 
or bought those movies there 
a state judge found the studio art theatre guilty of the rico 
violations and a state appeals court upheld the conviction in 1988 
without addressing the constitutional challenge raised 
the appeal acted on today attacked the 500foot law saying it 
violates freespeech rights because the offending materials do not 
even have to be judged obscene and therefore unworthy of 
constitutional protection 
the appeal also said the studio art theatre owners right to be 
fair treatment under equalprotection guarantees is violated 
because exceptions to the 500foot ban are made for materials 
available at certain libraries museums and schools 
and the appeal said the challenged law impermissibly delegates 
to a church the ability to criminalize conduct that otherwise was 
constitutionally protected simply because it locates within 500 
feet 
lawyers for the studio art theatre said the law has the 
constitutionally impermissible effect of advancing or promoting 
religion 
the justices last year used an indiana case to rule that states 
may use antiracketeering laws to crack down on adult bookstores 
and other sexually oriented businesses 
but the court said in that decision that prosecutors may not use 
state rico laws to close down such businesses before trials are 
held to determine whether any of the material displayed or sold is 
obscene 
the case acted on today is studio art theatre vs indiana

town officials reacted angrily to 
news that state regulators knew but didnt warn anyone about 
safety violations at a propane gas company that has been implicated 
in a fatal bank explosion 
propane leaks are the suspected source of the blast at the 
crested butte state bank on march 6 three people died and 14 were 
injured in the explosion 
salgas inc of crested butte owns the underground propane lines 
that service the towns business district 
the denver post reported saturday that state public utilities 
commission documents show that inspectors have found a host of 
violations at salgas crested butte operation 
the documents showed that the company had no record of required 
leak surveys in the business district where the bank exploded nor 
a record of leak repairs to the pipeline installed in 1972 
i think it is inexcusable that the puc wouldnt notify 
jurisdictions of these violations by the gas company said mike 
miller district manager for the crested butte fire protection 
district its pretty tough to take action on things you dont 
know about 
town manager william crank said he learned of the report the 
week of march 11 he said he requested copies from the public 
utilities commission and after failing to recieve it eventually 
obtained the reports from a denver television reporter 
mayor wes light said he also was upset when he learned of 
salgas safety record i would hope they would notify 
municipalities in the future he said 
salgas executives say leaks found near the bank were not a cause 
of the powerful explosion but resulted from it

the supreme court today agreed to hear an 
appeal challenging the authority of states to house convicted 
murderers on death rows and keep them apart from other inmates 
the justices said they will review the appeal of nebraska death 
row inmate john rust who says such segregation is without 
penological justification and grossly disproportionate 
punishment 
rusts unusual appeal which he authored himself does not 
challenge his death sentence but only the conditions of his death 
row confinement 
the appeal in essence says segregating inmates who are to be 
executed violates their dueprocess and equalprotection rights 
rust was convicted of murder and sentenced to death in 1975 
from the time of his imprisonment until 1978 he was allowed to 
remain with inmates who were serving prison terms but were not 
under death sentences 
but in 1978 nebraska chose to segregate all inmates under death 
sentences on one death row at the nebraska state penitentiary a 
kind of administrative segregation 
most states with death penalty laws also feature a death row 
where inmates under death sentences are kept removed from other 
inmates 
death row inmates generally do not have all the privileges of 
other prison inmates 
rust was convicted of killing michael kellogg who had come to 
the aid of police officers during a supermarket robbery in omaha 
rust is the longestserving death row inmate in a state that has 
not executed anyone for three decades 
his appeal also argued that switching the conditions of his 
confinement in 1978 represented a constitutionally impermissible 
ex post facto punishment 
the case is rust vs gunter 895900

increased sales as rates decline in the months ahead he said the 
trade group expects existinghome sales to total 344 million units 
this year down just 01 percent from 1989

us coast guard officials and chemical 
companies were working to reopen the intracoastal waterway today 
after a barge struck a shipwreck and leaked nearly 35000 gallons 
of light crude oil 
most of the cleanup has been completed in the intracoastal 
canal but there is still a lot in the adjacent waters that have 
been boomed off said coast guard lt mike debettencourt 
he said officials had hoped to have the intracoastal waterway 
reopened by 1 pm today 
the spill occurred near environmentally sensitive wetlands and 
marshes as well as a marina and an industrial area 
the 190foot barge owned by koch fuel oil was en route from 
mobile ala to corpus christi when it struck a submerged vessel 
about 615 pm sunday 
the barge spewed 830 barrels holding 35000 gallons of light 
crude into the waterway debettencourt said crews stopped the leak 
by 10 pm 
its not as bad as we might have feared debettencourt 
added it seems to be not too bad considering 
most of the damaged barges cargo was safely stored within its 
hull and later pumped into an empty barge he said the barge was 
carrying a light grade of crude oil called condensate which is 
extracted from natural gas wells 
wilsey dupree vice president of traffic for lebeouf said 
sunday night the cleanup was going well 
i got all the people i can get out there going that way to 
clean up he said im not looking at any complications right 
now he would not give details 
shortly after the leak was reported coast guard units moved 
into place to put two sets of containment booms around the barge 
called the mb 2 absorbent pads were also used 
local contractors were hired to start cleaning up the spilled 
oil which was carried onto the coastline by strong incoming tides 
an environmental protection agency team was dispatched to the spill 
site 
the leaking barge was about onequarter mile west of the 
surfside bridge in freeport a town of about 12000 people 40 miles 
south of houston 
the gulf intracoastal waterway parallels the texas coast for 432 
miles from sabine pass to brownsville 
although the coast guard had no immediate report on the 
environmental impact of the spill shrimpers said they were worried

fustian house in wiltshire is the dullest 
stately home in england nothing interesting has happened there for 
the last 400 years so what is a poor tour guide to do 
make up an interesting history for the old place says lettice 
douffet a lady as eccentric and exotic as her first and last 
names her embellishments set in motion lettice and lovage 
peter shaffers enormously entertaining comedy about the unlikely 
friendship between two very different women 
and when the women are played by such accomplished actresses as 
maggie smith as the overimaginative tour guide and margaret 
tyzack as her frustrated boss it makes for a very merry evening 
indeed 
lettice and lovage a big london hit opened sunday night at 
broadways ethel barrymore theater where the play should run for 
as long as smith wants to do it the comedy directed with a sure 
steady hand by michael blakemore is what used to be a called a 
star turn a chance for theatergoers to see an actor or actress 
do what they do best 
and shaffer author of such diverse and weightier plays as 
equus and amadeus certainly gives smith a lot of 
opportunities the play opens with several hilarious short scenes 
as lettice describes the history of fustian house in increasingly 
inaccurate detail to a group of gullible tourists 
smith her hair a striking mop of red curls doesnt just recite 
this bogus history she sweeps into it arms flailing like a dying 
swan her voice a mixture of murmurs coos and trills earns 
applause from her enthusiastic pupils and the audience 
unfortunately one member of the tour turns out to be lotte schoen 
her supervisor who then fires the woman for falsifying history 
for much of the play shaffer contrasts the two middleaged 
spinsters and their different philosophies of life enlarge 
enliven enlighten exhorts lettice who learned the three words 
from her mother a free spirit who performed shakespeares plays in 
french her own translations lettice proudly announces 
lotte is a bitter woman unhappy about her life but she feels 
sorry for lettice and tries to get her another job this time as a 
tour guide on a boat traveling the thames gradually their 
friendship builds 
their love for the england and particularly london of 
yesterday is what unites them they lament the destruction of great 
old buildings and castigate the modern monstrosities that have gone 
up in their place 
the plot falters a bit at the end of the second act and its 
odd that one of the plays major events occurs off stage between 
the second and third acts everyone talks about the incident 
particularly a lawyer crisply played by the wonderful paxton 
whitehead 
tyzack is a worthy foil for the extravagant smith bette 
henritze scores as lottes dithering secretary and there is a 
scenestealing bit by a large blinking gray cat christened by 
lettice with typical theatricality as felina queen of sorrows 
but theres no doubt that lettice and lovage really belongs 
to smith and she revels in its glorious excesses its a perfect 
marriage of star and story 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
what other critics said 
frank rich the new york times this is idiosyncratic theater 
acting of a high and endangered order not to be confused with the 
actress tightly minimalistic film work if lettice and lovage 
is but a modest excuse for it what theater lover needs any excuse 
whatsoever to have a rare reunion with maggie smith 
howard kissel the daily news at heart the play is a 
celebration of the imagination a celebration of the art of 
theater with these celebrants theres great cause for rejoicing 
clive barnes new york post this is no mere onewoman triumph 
playwright peter shaffer and his director michael blakemore have 
conspired with actresses the ebulliently bewitching smith and a 
queen of more stately necromancy margaret tyzack to produce an 
evening of enchantment and delight

the white house today called the soviet 
occupation of two buildings in lithuania a significant event in 
the escalation of tensions and reiterated a call for restraint on 
both sides 
presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater also said that the 
united states had received new private assurances from the soviet 
union backing up public ones that the kremlin would not use 
force to block lithuanian independence 
but fitzwater said that moscows action over the weekend in 
seizing two communist party buildings in vilnius the capital of 
the rebellious baltic state amounted to a kind of force and 
were opposed to any kind of use of force 
tensions in lithuania seem to have escalated on a daily basis 
for the last week or so were hopeful thats not continuing 
building occupation is a significant event in this sense 
further actions will not lead to a lessening of the tensions 
and could have adverse international repercussions and could be 
counterproductive for ussoviet relations fitzwater said 
those comments echoed sundays claim by defense secretary dick 
cheney that a soviet military crackdown would have significant 
negative consequences on ussoviet relations 
the presidents spokesman reading from a prepared statement 
said the soviets themselves have publicly and privately assured 
us that they have no intentions of using military force to resolve 
the issue 
asked about recent private assurances fitzwater cited a meeting 
at the state department on friday between deputy secretary of state 
lawrence eagleburger and soviet ambassador yuri v dubinin 
those are in addition to remarks last week between secretary of 
state james a baker iii and soviet foreign minister eduard 
shevardnadze and other private discussions on a diplomatic 
level fitzwater said 
fitzwater said there is now reason to expect that the situation 
in lithuania will disrupt president bushs summit with soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachev in late june were prepared to 
have the summit at this time fitzwater said were still 
hopeful this can all be resolved 
cheney interviewed sunday on cbstvs face the nation said 
that the united states would like to see the lithuanians granted 
the same prerogative that the east germans were self 
determination he said a military crackdown would undermine a 
lot of the good work done in recent years in improving 
ussoviet relations 
president bushs national security adviser brent scowcroft 
said saturday that any soviet use of force would be 
counterproductive and that the united states would not ignore 
it 
bush himself had no comment sunday on the situation in lithuania 
as he returned from a weekend at camp david his mountain retreat 
in maryland 
soviet troops occupied two communist schools in vilnius capital 
of the baltic state on sunday one day after tanks rolled through 
the streets in the middle of the night 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev and other kremlin 
officials have been pressuring lithuanias newly elected leaders to 
back off attempts to secede 
bush said friday that any soviet attempt to intimidate or 
forcibly intervene against the lithuanian people is bound to 
backfire 
the united states and the western world have never recognized 
the soviet unions forcible annexation of lithuania and its sister 
baltic states estonia and latvia in 1940 as war swept over europe 
but the united states now says it will not grant formal 
recognition until the breakaway republic establishes control over 
its territory and bush has urged the lithuanians to recognize 
certain realities about its relationship to moscow 
asked if the united states had lured lithuania into rebelling 
cheney said we have not been out actively soliciting revolution 
if you will on the other hand weve made it clear that we share 
the aspirations of the lithuanian people for selfdetermination

lithuanian officials met with soviet 
military officers today and said tensions had eased after their 
talks about the armys occupation of three communist party 
buildings 
the move sunday which the army said was at the request of local 
communist officials was moscows latest action in a war of nerves 
with the baltic republic that declared independence two weeks ago 
after coming out of this meeting i can say the mood has 
changed said deputy premier romualdas ozolas it is evident 
the conflict will not be escalated 
in moscow soviet president mikhail s gorbachev reiterated that 
he has no plans to use force to bring lithuania back into the 
soviet fold said sen edward m kennedy who met with gorbachev 
for 1 hours 
president gorbachev indicated to me that the position of the 
soviet union was that there would be no use of force unless the 
lives of others were threatened and that he was committed to a 
peaceful resolution kennedy told reporters 
kennedy said gorbachev did not specify whose lives might be 
threatened in lithuania or whether he thought such threats 
imminent 
ozolas and lithuanian interior minister marijonas misiukonis met 
with col viktor smokarev deputy chief of the vilnius military 
garrison and col vladimir trikoz of the interior ministry 
they agreed not to take any steps affecting security without 
first informing the other side ozolas told reporters 
ozolas said the military officers alleged that a soldier was 
beaten and that shots were fired at soldiers from a passing car 
though no one was hurt in that incident 
ozolas said lithuanians complained about the convoy of 100 
military vehicles sent through downtown vilnius early saturday 
military flights over the capital and other cities and the 
occupation of the party buildings in vilnius 
ozolas said while the meeting did not mean negotiations had 
begun with soviet officials about the republics march 11 
declaration of independence it seems that these are leading to 
talks with moscow 
earlier premier kazimiera prunskeine said the first meeting 
between military officers and lithuanian president vytautas 
landsbergis late sunday had begun to clear the air 
we began to get relief last night with the beginning of 
negotiations with representatives of the army she told the 
supreme council parliament 
on sunday landsbergis spoke twice by telephone with gen 
valentin i varennikov commander of soviet ground forces who in a 
newspaper interview sunday accused independence leaders of plotting 
to arrest communists and send them to prison 
soldiers appeared sunday at the higher party school and the 
institute of marxismleninism lithuanian officials said there also 
were soldiers at the vilnius communist party headquarters 
franciskas benucius a director of the higher party school said 
30 soldiers who arrived there told him they were sent to guard the 
building 
i asked what are you protecting it from and they didnt 
know he said 
in response to the soviet move the lithuanian leadership passed 
a resolution calling for prosecution of troops who illegally 
occupied the buildings the resolution was published today but 
there was no indication the lithuanians would attempt to arrest the 
soldiers 
the military officers told landsbergis during the meeting that 
they had moved into the buildings at the request of lithuanian 
communists who remain loyal to moscow the majority of the party 
split with moscow in december to found an independent communist 
party 
the two opposing parties had been sharing the buildings but 
some space recently had been turned over to nonpolitical 
organizations 
we expressed surprise and astonishment that the military can 
occupy buildings at the request of a political organization and we 
asked if such requests come from other organizations whether they 
will fulfill them landsbergis told reporters sunday 
we did not receive a concrete answer he said 
in washington white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said that 
building seizures amounted to a kind of force and were opposed 
to any kind of use of force 
tensions in lithuania seem to have escalated on a daily basis 
for the last week or so were hopeful thats not continuing 
building occupation is a significant event in this sense 
for days gorbachev and other moscow officials have squeezed the 
defiant baltic state with displays of military strength and demands 
of fealty 
gorbachev ordered lithuanians to surrender all firearms and told 
them not to sign up for volunteer units under the republics 
government state media sought to portray lithuania as in a state 
of anarchy 
at the same time soviet leaders said they will not use force in 
their bid to prevent lithuanians from trying to restore the 
independence they lost in 1940 when their republic was forcibly 
annexed along with the two other baltic states latvia and estonia

the supreme court today agreed to decide 
whether railroads can ignore union contracts to complete mergers 
approved by the interstate commerce commission 
the court said it will review a ruling that restrains the 
railroads and the icc from overriding collective bargaining 
agreements 
the us circuit court of appeals here ruled for the unions last 
july in two separate cases 
the first case stems from icc approval in 1980 of acquisition by 
csx corp of the chessie system and seaboard coast line industries 
cxs decided in 1986 to close its freight car repair shop at 
waycross ga and to transfer work done there to a chessie system 
shop in raceland ky 
the transfer meant eliminating jobs and transferring some 
waycross workers to raceland transferred workers were told they no 
longer could count on lifetime income guaranteed by the contract 
signed by csx and the brotherhood of railway carmen 
in the second case norfolk and western railway co and the 
southern railway co announced in 1986 plans to merge operations 
centers in roanoke va and atlanta the consolidation eliminated 
some supervisors jobs at roanoke 
the american train dispatchers association said the plans 
violated the unions contract with norfolk and western 
the icc in both cases said the railroads were exempt from the 
union contracts 
but the appeals court here said congress has not given the icc 
such broad power with so much potential to destablize the 
railroad industry 
we can not impute to congress the intention to make the 
bargainedfor provisions of a collective bargaining agreement 
contingent upon their not later becoming inconvenient to the full 
realization of operating economies that a merger might make 
possible the appeals court said 
it ordered further review by the icc in both cases 
the bush administration urged the supreme court not to disturb 
the appeals court ruling 
the cases are norfolk and western vs american train 
dispatchers 891027 csx transportation vs brotherhood of railway

hungarians voting in their nations 
first free elections in more than 40 years ousted the communists 
from power and may have even denied them any seats in parliament 
according to results today 
if were represented in parliament we will have achieved the 
aim we set for ourselves said party leader gyula thuermer who 
finished a distant fifth in his own district in sundays election 
but still predicted communist seats in the lawmaking body 
with 38 percent of the vote counted however the communists 
were in eighth place with 356 percent 
the results however also gave no opposition party a clear 
victory 
the conservative hungarian democratic forum led with 2459 
percent and the centerleft league of free democrats was second 
with 1992 percent the government news agency mti said 
the independent smallholders a revived preworld war ii party 
popular in hungarys villages had 1269 percent with the 
socialists the main successors to the communists trailing in 
fourth place with 103 percent mti said 
rezsoe nyers the socialist chairman said he had no illusions 
about his partys future we will be an opposition party 
since election law mandates runoff elections for each seat not 
won by an absolute majority it was clear most seats would have to 
be contested again in a second round likely on april 8 
even a second round was not expected to determine a clear 
winner making a coalition government the most likely outcome 
the forum embodies traditional hungarian populism and draws most 
of its support from the provinces the more urbane free democrats 
have a core of former dissidents the independent smallholders 
advocate returning land confiscated by the communists after their 
takeover 
the hungarian peoples rejection of heirs to longruling 
communists followed similar moves in other former soviet satellites 
east germany held eastern europes first completely free 
elections in decades on march 18 and the reformed communists were 
rejected there in june prosolidarity candidates won 
parliamentary seats in all but one of the races they were allowed 
to contest 
czechoslovaks are to vote in june in their first free 
parliamentary elections in decades and nationwide balloting is 
expected in bulgaria and romania in may 
premier miklos nemeth a communist reformer and key engineer of 
the nations twoyear reform course was one of just five 
candidates reported to have won a simple majority in sundays vote 
he was running as an independent 
foreign minister gyula horn another key reformer was also 
leading in his race interim president matyas szueros also led in 
his constituency but like horn failed to secure more than 50 
percent of votes to win outright 
another prominent reformer imre pozsgay was trailing in 
another race 
election results trickled in at election commission headquarters 
in the gothic parliament building and at the election studio of 
state television and final results were not expected until late 
today at the earliest 
about 78 million people were eligible to vote and election 
officials said preliminary figures showed turnout was more than 70 
percent 
under a complex distribution system devised by the communists 
and opposition in talks last year 176 of the 394 seats in 
parliament will go to individual winners most of the rest will be 
distributed on a proportional basis with eight seats reserved for 
national minorities 
hungarys last elections were in 1947 when the communists won a 
relative majority largely through fraud a year later they 
consolidated power and forced all other parties out of existence 
in october communists reformers dissolved the old ruling party 
and renamed themselves socialists they said they were committed to 
westernstyle parliamentary democracy but most hungarians still 
associated them with the autocrats who dominated hungarian life for 
decades

the produce industry today bestowed on barbara 
bush a broccoli bouquet and three cases of the vegetable and urged 
the first lady to try some new recipes to entice her husband into 
the wonderful world of fresh produce 
it was actually just the tip of a 10000pound iceberg of 
broccoli that california growers are donating to soup kitchens and 
shelters in a goodnatured riposte to president bushs refusal to 
eat his broccoli 
mrs bush who chairs the nationwide second harvest drive to 
donate food to the hungry called it wonderful and joked im 
going to overlook the fact you think my cooking is not up to par 
im going to tell you the honest truth the president is never 
going to eat broccoli mrs bush told a gaggle of 
broccoliindustry boosters all wearing broccoli boutonnieres on 
the white house lawn before more than 200 reporters photographers 
and television camera crews 
the industry had said beforehand it was shipping 10 tons of 
broccoli from california at the event they halved the estimate 
george dunlop president of the united fresh fruit and vegetable 
association boasted that 10000 pounds of broccoli was enough to 
serve 80000 hungry people 
we appreciate the fact that the president himself does not 
like broccoli personally said dunlop 
refusing to give up the fight he added that along with the 
three cases for the white house kitchens he had brought along 
some very good new recipes which you might use and just might 
intrigue the president to take the plunge into the wonderful world 
of fresh broccoli 
millie and i thank you for the broccoli well eat it said 
the first lady whose pet dog stretched out on the lawn beside the 
three cases of irish spring broccoli spilling over a small table 
but just as george bush has vowed never to bite another sprig of 
broccoli she assured her guests i am never going to eat pork 
rinds ever 
she indicated bush was adamant in his stance against broccoli 
if his own blessed mother cant make him eat broccoli she 
said then i give up 
she said that without the broccoli brouhaha the media would 
never have turned out in such numbers to cover a donation of food 
to the capitol area community food bank 
bush set the wheels in motion for the protest when it became 
known that he ordered stewards aboard air force one to stop serving 
him broccoli 
he stood his ground at a news conference last thursday with 
words a recalcitrant child could only envy i do not like 
broccoli and i havent liked it since i was a little kid and my 
mother made me eat it and im president of the united states and 
im not going to eat any more broccoli

a us official today accused burmas 
government of colluding with drug traffickers but said washington 
had no plans for military action there to stem the massive outflow 
of heroin 
the united states has identified burma as the biggest single 
producer of heroin in the world it recently indicted opium warlord 
khun sa who operates in northeastern burma saying he was probably 
the largest heroin pusher in the world 
washington is highly skeptical about the burmese governments 
commitment to combating the drug trade assistant secretary of 
state melvin levitsky said at a news conference in bangkok but 
even if rangoon was committed he said it would have difficulty 
catching khun sa because it did not control the area of the country 
in which he operated 
rangoon dropped efforts to eradicate opium growing after its 
military crushed a mass movement for democracy and seized power in 
september 1988 levitsky said 
evidence indicates that the government of burma has a 
collusive relationship with some of the traffickers and is allowing 
them to bargain their way to go ahead unfettered he said 
it was not clear if levitsky was referring directly to khun sa 
an elusive trafficker who has operated in the socalled golden 
triangle of burma thailand and laos since the 1960s 
after initially emphasizing crack cocaine in its antidrug 
drive the bush administration is addressing the problem of heroin 
which is likely to remain a longer term problem in the united 
states levitsky said 
but asked what washington was prepared to do to bring khun sa to 
trial and whether it was considering military force levitsky said 
we have no plans for any kind of military action to get khun sa 
it would violate another countrys borders 
obviously if khun sa falls into another governments hands or 
if another government arrests him we would like to have him to try 
in the united states he said 
thailand as well as other countries could exert a positive 
influence on burma to toughen its stand on drugs he said most 
heroin from burma is smuggled through thailand

eight members of congress are trying to prove 
this year that you can go home again as governor 
potomac fever rarely goes into remission but among those 
politicians who have had enough of capitol hill an increasingly 
popular career path leads to places like little rock tallahassee 
hartford and montgomery 
seven members of congress won governorships from 1982 to 1989 
about a third of those who tried those odds are hardly comparable 
to the 98 percent return rate for members of congress who seek 
reelection but the higher risk hasnt discouraged a crop of eight 
new gubernatorial aspirants this year 
you can do more in an afternoon as governor than you can in a 
career in congress said one gubernatorial hopeful republican 
rep john rowland of connecticut attributing the quip to former 
delaware gov pete du pont 
it is theme sounded often among those hoping to return home 
many say they want to take on greater challenges test their 
executive skills set their own agendas and leave their marks on 
education drug abuse budgets the business climate and the 
environment 
ive spent the last seven years pushing and pulling trying to 
get the federal government to deal with its deficit its a very 
difficult process said democratic rep bruce morrison another 
connecticut gubernatorial hopeful the federal government has 
lost its capacity to really be the source of solutions to many 
problems 
larry sabato a university of virginia political scientist who 
wrote a book about the american governorship calls congress an 
increasingly depressing place to work 
the budget deficit is a permanent excuse for inaction 
democrats and many republicans are frustrated the money isnt 
there to do what they want to do and the will to raise taxes isnt 
there sabato said 
in contrast he said the states have both the resources and 
the will to innovate being in a state capitol is much more 
invigorating than it was 25 years ago 
the desire to head home to the statehouse may run even deeper in 
congress than what is apparent on the surface 
for everyone that runs for governor out of congress there is 
generally a substantial number greater than that who are thinking 
about it particularly in the offyears said rep joseph 
brennan a maine democrat who is trying to reclaim his old job as 
governor many people here if they had a choice would prefer to 
be the chief executive of a state 
members of congress cite career advancement and personal 
fulfullment as primary reasons to return to the statehouse but 
they also see the move as a chance to escape the pressures they 
face in congress from constant travel continuous fundraising and 
little time for family 
the pace and the back and forth and the commitments are a 
hardship on any family but its even worse on a young family 
said rowland who has children aged 5 3 and 1 who live in 
connecticut 
roots are another element of the pull towards home rowland for 
instance said his family has lived in connecticut for 150 years 
democratic rep ronnie flippo hoping to become governor of 
alabama tells home state audiences he cant get used to a place 
that serves their tea hot and their green beans cold 
other members of congress running for governor this year are 
republican sen pete wilson of california and reps bill nelson 
dfla tommy robinson rark and wes watkins dokla 
at least two more members are eyeing other state jobs as 
potential stepping stones 
republican sen gordon humphrey of new hampshire is retiring

the government monday denied allegations by 
amnesty international of human rights abuses in kuwait but said it 
was establishing a special panel to deal with the organizations 
queries 
at least two statements from amnesty international over the past 
six weeks have accused the kuwaiti government of detaining without 
trial a number of shiite moslems in connection with bombings at 
mecca last summer 
kuwait is a predominantly sunni moslem country 
a spokesman for the special justice ministry panel denied the 
shiites were the victims of discrimination he said the government 
was adhering to articles in its constitution that provide for 
equal treatment of citizens and expatriates on human rights 
considerations to the exclusion of any discrimination due to sex 
origin language or religion 
the allegations compiled in a recent press release about 
illegal practices towards human rights by kuwaiti authorities are 
completely baseless the spokesman added he spoke on condition 
of anonymity 
out of kuwaits interest in the humanitarian role of amnesty 
international the government has set up an ad hoc panel to answer 
all its messages and queries the spokesman said

the trial of imelda marcos in new 
york has spared the manila government a political dilemma but it 
also has raised questions about whether she should have been 
prosecuted first on foreign soil 
mrs marcos widow of former president ferdinand marcos went on 
trial last week in a manhattan federal court on racketeering 
charges in connection with the alleged looting of the philippine 
treasury during her husbands 20year rule 
president corazon aquinos administration claims marcos his 
family and associates embezzled up to 10 billion before he was 
ousted four years ago 
despite the allegations neither marcos nor his widow was ever 
charged in the philippines with a criminal offense although they 
have been named in more than 30 civil suits 
the philippine constitution forbids trials in absentia and 
officials feared the marcoses would invoke their right to return 
from exile if criminal charges were filed marcos died in hawaii in 
september 
the absence of criminal charges has impeded efforts to recover 
the fortune marcos allegedly transferred abroad authorities in 
switzerland where much of the wealth is believed deposited 
stalled on lifting banking secrecy laws pending criminal charges 
officials hope that a conviction by an american court will speed 
the transfer of marcos assets it would also make it unlikely that 
mrs marcos could return to the philippines before mrs aquinos 
term expires in 1992 
when the trial began many filipino commentators expressed 
satisfaction that mrs marcos would finally have to answer in court 
to allegations of profligacy and corruption 
even though the opening days have been devoted to the mundane 
problems of jury selection the trial has been frontpage news in 
the philippines 
she went on fabulous shopping sprees and gave lavish 
parties wrote the manila standard now she faces charges 
which suggest that these were made possible in large part by the 
money she has embezzled 
others however questioned the wisdom of allowing the americans 
the former colonial power to determine her guilt or innocence 
the united states had the right to do so because the alleged 
offenses violated us law 
this means the loss of the nations supreme legal authority to 
give and enforce the law within its own territory said francisco 
tatad a former marcos spokesman who later broke with the late 
president the state lost its most important attribute and became 
much less than a state 
predictably marcos supporters have been at the forefront of 
those who feel the trial infringes on sovereignty 
it is an insult to the countrys sovereignty because a former 
first lady deserves the dignity to defend herself in her own 
country said rep salvador escudero a member of marcos new 
society movement party whatever crime she has committed it 
should be defensible within the context of philippine laws 
but the trial also reminded other filipinos of the limitations 
of their own judicial system where proceedings are often 
influenced by money and political power the retrial of 40 
defendants in the 1983 assassination of mrs aquinos own husband 
benigno aquino jr has been dragging on since april 1987 
could it really be an affront to our national dignity not 
because an erstwhile leader is being tried by a foreign government 
but because it only highlights our own failure in serving the ends 
of justice asked the independent daily malaya

his neighbors say julio gonzalez was a quiet man 
who sometimes helped them with their chores 
but police said the cuban immigrant angered by the rejection of 
a former girlfriend set fire to the happy land social club in the 
bronx and killed 87 people 
i right now im stuttering i cant im still in 
shock to have somebody with a demented mind do that and living 
here said yvonne torres 29 who lived two rooms away from 
gonzalez 
the 36yearold man moved into the rooming house about three 
months ago after he and his girlfriend stopped living together 
police said 
gonzalez lived in a sparse room with a bed a clothes closet and 
a picture of jesus on one wall 
many of his neighbors said gonzalez often offered to help them 
carry groceries or do other chores 
hes neat tidy and wellmannered said the buildings 
manager ray davis hes not loud or the type of guy you would 
notice in a crowd 
a police spokesman lt raymond odonnell said gonzalez who 
was arrested at home 12 hours after the fire started at 340 am 
sunday used to work in a warehouse but had been unemployed for the 
past six months 
when questioned by police he broke down and cried and was 
remorseful odonnell said 
early sunday police said gonzalez went to the club and argued 
with his 45yearold former girlfriend before he was kicked out by 
a bouncer 
hes drinking at the club he wants to get back with her she 
says leave me alone leave me alone the bouncer ejects him he 
comes back and sets the place on fire odonnell said 
he was charged sunday with arson and murder odonnell said he 
was led out of the stationhouse sunday night wearing a bulletproof 
vest which police asked him to wear as a precaution gonzalez said 
nothing as reporters bombarded him with questions 
at the boarding house neighbor celia lopez 37 described 
gonzalez as someone who did not seem to have many friends 
not many people came to visit him he never caused any 
problems or arguments she said 
gonzalez came to the united states in 1980 as part of the mariel 
boatlift that brought 125000 cubans to the united states 
odonnell said 
gonzalez was detained by us immigration officials at camp 
mccoy wis and fort chaffee ark until his release on feb 21 
1981 said verne jervis of the immigration and naturalization 
service in washington 
jervis said gonzalez was granted parolee status and sent to live 
with a sponsor family in new york city adding weve had no 
contact from him since 
gonzalez never applied for permanent residency which he could 
have sought in 1982 and therefore could be deported if ever 
convicted of a crime 
us officials have long accused cuba of including hardened 
criminals among those traveling on the boatlift but jervis said 
gonzalezs only criminal record in cuba was serving some time 
in prison for desertion from the cuban army 
luis rolan 30 lived next door to gonzalezs 10foot by 12foot 
room which has a small balcony and rented for less than 100 a 
week 
the two would drink beer together but gonzalez never mentioned 
problems with his girlfriend that was just too personal we 
didnt get into things like that he said 
hes a nice guy he didnt talk to nobody he wasnt the kind 
who would do this rolan said 
but you know what they say davis said its the quiet guy 
you have to watch for

fbi agents arrested two top members of new 
englands organized crime families this morning as part of a 
threestate dragnet targeting 21 suspected mobsters on a total of 
113 criminal counts 
paul cavanaugh a spokesman for the fbis field office in 
boston said alleged mob figures in massachusetts rhode island and 
connecticut were being arrested on unsealed indictments alleging a 
variety of crimes including murder racketeering kidnapping drug 
trafficking gambling obstruction of justice and witness 
intimidation 
at least six people were already under arrest this morning after 
agents began zeroing in on alleged mobsters about 6 am cavanaugh 
said 
dozens of agents are out making arrests all over the 
threestate area he said its one of the biggest strikes 
against organized crime in law enforcement history 
raymond patriarca jr reputed boss of the patriarca crime 
family that formerly was headed by his late father was arrested at 
about 630 am today at his home in lincoln ri 
patriarca appeared this morning before a us magistrate in 
providence who ordered him transferred to boston for arraignment 
on tuesday at the earliest 
attorney john f cicilline had argued his 45yearold client 
should be given three days to determine whether he was medically 
fit to make the 50mile trip to massachusetts cicilline said his 
client suffers from cancer and cataracts 
alleged underboss nicholas bianco was also arrested along with 
a lowerlevel figure alleged mafia captain matthew gugliemetti 
according to lincoln almond the us attorney in providence the 
names of the other three people arrested by late morning were not 
immediately released 
attorney general dick thornburgh was en route to boston where 
he and fbi director william sessions were scheduled to detail the 
indictments at an afternoon news conference 
this is definitely a megacase cavanaugh said its a real 
blow to the leadership and activities of all the alleged criminal 
organizations 
almond said the unsealed indictments cover four of five alleged 
captains of the patriarca crime family and the legal adviser 
it involves the whole hierarchy of the family he said 
weve broken the family 
patriarca sr who died in 1984 was identified as head of the 
new england cosa nostra during 1969 senate committee hearings an 
eighthgrade dropout he shined shoes and worked as a bellhop in 
the biltmore plaza hotel in providence before allegedly working his 
way into smalltime rum running and armed robbery 
the alleged mob kingpin was arrested more than 40 times and 
convicted of 18 crimes ranging from playing dice on sunday to 
armed robbery and conspiracy to murder he served seven years in 
prison 
the ailing patriarca was indicted in september 1981 on charges 
of taking part in a scheme to skim 11 million from the laborers 
international union but a federal magistrate found him too ill to 
stand trial on the racketeering charges in florida 
law enforcement officials generally believe that patriarcas son 
inherited control of the new england mob on his fathers death

president virgilio barco came under 
attack monday after his top cabinet minister resigned and suggested 
the governments resolve has weakened against drug traffickers 
interior minister carlos lemos simmonds stepped down sunday 
night his replacement former attorney general horacio serpa said 
the governments position against drug traffickers has not changed 
since barco launched his crackdown against them aug 18 
however lemos who was in charge of internal security and led 
the fight against traffickers disagreed he said he tried to block 
special deals sought by the traffickers but that the liberal party 
government was less firm in its resolve to fight the cartels 
on monday the presidential candidate of the opposition 
conservative party rodrigo lloreda accused the barco government 
of being ambiguous and insincere in its stated effort to fight the 
traffickers 
in his resignation letter lemos said that in the last three 
months there has been an almost imperceptible change in some 
parts of the government as to the position on drug trafficking and 
now it is not as decisive instransigent and firm 
referring to the traffickers lemos wrote that he fought to 
block special deals and arrangements through which they look for 
less rigorous and more flexible treatment for their crimes he 
did not elaborate 
the presidents press office sent copies of the resignation 
letter to the news media after radio stations obtained copies and 
broadcast portions of it 
lemos did not mention it specifically but the government has 
not extradited any trafficking suspects since jan 21 between aug 
18 and jan 21 14 suspects were extradited to the united states 
there are currently 17 people in colombian custody who are 
wanted on drugrelated charges in the united states 
barco has not explained why the extraditions ended they ground 
to a halt just three days after the medellin drug cartel appealed 
for a negotiated settlement in the crackdown and asked for an end 
to extraditions 
lemos resignation apparently was demanded by barco after a 
leftist party alleged that a statement lemos made led to the 
assassination of the partys presidential candidate 
lemos said two weeks ago that the leftist patriotic union party 
was the political arm of the countrys biggest leftist guerrilla 
group the colombian revolutionary armed forces 
the patriotic unions candidate for the may 26 presidential 
elections bernardo jaramillo was assassinated thursday in bogota 
the party said lemos statement had drawn the attention of 
rightwing death squads the death squads have killed 1044 members 
of the patriotic union since the party was organized in 1984 
gen miguel maza of colombias secret police said the killer 
who was wounded and captured had been hired by drug traffickers 
the government said two years ago that many of the dozens of 
rightwing death squads in colombia had been organized by drug 
traffickers 
the new interior minister serpa was an attorney general under 
barco for one year serpa resigned last year to run for the senate 
he will surrender the senate seat he won in elections two weeks ago

john poindexter told president reagan the us 
government had no connection to a contra resupply plane that 
crashed in nicaragua a former national security council employee 
testified today at poindexters irancontra trial 
poindexter made the statement to reagan on oct 7 1986 two 
days after the plane carrying ammunition was shot down and one of 
its crewmen eugene hasenfus was captured rodney mcdaniel 
testified 
actually the hasenfus flight was part of the network overseen 
by oliver north to keep the contras armed during a congressional 
ban on us military aid to the rebel force 
poindexter told congress in 1987 that obviously there was 
knowledge and coordination by the nsc staff of norths network that 
handled the hasenfus flight 
appearing as a defense witness mcdaniel then the nscs 
executive secretary took notes during poindexters briefing of the 
president 
the president had either watched tv or read the newspapers and 
started out by asking what is this all about testified 
mcdaniel 
admiral poindexter reported that he didnt have all the facts 
but he understood it was not a us government operation said 
mcdaniel 
poindexter told reagan the flight was not connected to the 
us government and that poindexter does not know who hasenfus 
is involved with said irancontra prosecutor dan webb webb was 
referring to mcdaniels notes 
did poindexter ever tell the president that hasenfus was 
connected to norths contra resupply network asked webb 
not in my presence said mcdaniel 
the day after being briefed by poindexter reagan replied 
absolutely none when asked by reporters whether the hasenfus 
plane had any link to the us government 
poindexter is charged with five felony counts of obstructing 
congress conspiracy and making false statements to congressional 
committees in the irancontra affair

delete computer messages 
more than 5000 messages in poindexters computer file were 
killed out in the days before he resigned according to previous 
testimony the former national security adviser is accused of 
deleting them to cover up from congress the us role in a 1985 
hawk missile shipment to iran 
under crossexamination mcdaniel acknowledged it was unusual to 
delete an entire computer file 
mcdaniel also said that north tended to exaggerate his own role 
in events 
north testified he saw poindexter tear up a presidential 
document that depicted the us government as being involved in an 
armsforhostages deal with iran north also testified that 
poindexter send his aide to a meeting with congressmen where north 
lied by denying he was assisting the contras militarily

a group including the parents of a 
pan am bombing victim sued the airline today contending it 
collected a 5perticket surcharge for security on international 
flights but never spent the money to protect passengers 
among those filing suit against pan american world airways were 
peter and aphrodite tsairis parents of alexia tsairis who died 
when pan am flight 103 exploded over lockerbie scotland dec 21 
1988 
richard a grossman an attorney handling the case said the 
lawsuit was intended to be a class action for customers who 
purchased pan am tickets from 1986 until 1989 
damages could amount to over 100 million with more than a 
million passengers in line for refunds plus punitive damages he 
said the truth is that these passengers paid for something they 
did not get that something was effective security 
the crash of the boeing 747 killed 259 passengers and crew and 
11 people on the ground 
besides the tsairises of franklin lakes also part of filing 
suit was t jennifer vail of wilmington del and miss tsairis 
estate named as defendants were pan am corp pan american world 
airways inc pan american world services inc alert management 
systems inc c edward acker a former president and chief 
executive officer of the corporation and martin e shugrue jr a 
former vice chairman of the corporation and chief executive officer 
of pan am world airways grossman said 
ms vail is a customer of pan am seeking reimbursement of the 
surcharges 
shes a representative of the group in effect said 
grossman 
elizabeth manners a pan am spokeswoman said the company has 
not seen the lawsuit and would have no immediate comment 
generally however she said pan am takes the position that its 
flight security is sufficient 
american carriers do have quite stringent requirements and we 
cetainly do abide by them she said 
grossman said other targets of the suit were former board 
members and officers of the corporation there names were not 
available before the suit was filed he said 
grossman said pan am has acknowledged collecting 18 million in 
surcharges 
he said the airlines own security expert isaac yeffet told 
pan am officials almost two years before the flight 103 crash that 
the carriers security was almost totally ineffectual and that 
leveling a surcharge could be regarded as fraud 
the lawsuit said pan am ignored yeffets call for sweeping 
changes in the airlines security system yet continued to impose 
the 5 surcharge yeffet was previously head of security at el al 
airlines in israel the lawyer said

fans across america might eagerly be 
awaiting the start of the oina season if an american here had not 
changed a few rules and renamed it baseball according to a 
romanian sports official 
adding his voice to the decadesold debate over the origin of 
baseball cristian costescu said the american pastime derived from 
the ancient game of oina which was introduced to the united states 
by a pair of transylvanians 
costescu president of the new romanian baseball federation 
says the two immigrants from the romanian village of alba iulia 
joined the us army and taught the game to their comrades 
among their comrades was a young officer named abner doubleday 
who changed a few rules and created baseball in 1839 cotescu said 
in an interview 
we are not saying that romania invented baseball we would not 
like someone else to tell us oina was invented by others said 
costescu but we are saying this some little inspiration for 
baseball was from oina baseball is more sophisticated than oina 
but the structure is the same 
romanians claim oina was invented by shepherds in the first 
century and say documents from 1310 describe a variation of the 
game called hoina being played in southern romania 
oina has 11 men per side with one team batting and the other in 
the field each side is allowed one atbat in which all 11 players 
take the plate 
a pitcher is provided by the team at bat and he serves up a lazy 
underhand toss the batter tries to hit the ball as far as 
possible then has to run 120 yards through nine bases 
but if the batter is tagged by a fielder or hit by a thrown 
ball the fielders can score points so teams can score even while 
not at bat 
oina uses a ball almost the same size as a baseball but filled 
with horse hair the bat is similar to a cricket bat and fielders 
do not wear gloves 
oina still is a romanian national sport with forms of the game 
being played in various regions of the balkan country though there 
are 1675 teams around romania as opposed to about 15 baseball 
teams in the country its popularity has slumped in recent years 
fifty years ago everybody was playing oina all the high 
schools and elementary schools costescu said through a 
translator but handball basketball and volleyball appeared and 
oina started disappearing 
it has been a quartercentury since the heyday of eugen cocut 
the babe ruth of oina whose height and huge hands allowed him to 
hit powerful shots and fire the ball with terrifying speed 
if costescu is successful in his post with the 2monthold 
baseball federation he may assure that the next cocut plays 
baseball instead of oina 
costescu used to head the romanian oina federation back in the 
days when baseball was banned as a capitalist sport 
that stigma was removed after the december revolution that 
overthrew dictator nicolae ceausescu and the baseball federation 
was formed 
baseball will be more popular than oina in cities but in the 
villages oina will remain costescu said even though i am the 
head of the baseball federation now oina is always in my heart

soybean products may help prevent 
breast cancer and a new laboratory test may enable doctors to 
better choose therapy for breast cancer patients according to two 
preliminary studies released monday 
rats fed a soybeancontaining diet showed lower breastcancer 
rates in a laboratory experiment said stephen barnes an associate 
professor of pharmacology and biochemistry at the university of 
alabama at birmingham 
he tried the experiment after noting that soybeans are prominent 
in diets of asian countries that have lower breastcancer rates 
than the united states he said 
but he stressed that his work only studied rats and his 
hypothesis is not ready for experiments in people 
dont get too excited yet barnes told science writers at a 
seminar sponsored by the american cancer society 
i think what weve got here is a possibility that needs to be 
pursued people shouldnt be encouraged to rush into this 
samuel broder director of the national cancer institute said 
he found the soybean idea fascinating but agreed that it is 
not clear whether it applies to people 
this is just a hypothesis he said please do not write 
headlines that soybeans are good for preventing breast cancer 
he also cautioned that many factors other than soybeans could 
explain the low breastcancer rates in asian countries 
in barnes study 300 rats animals were fed diets in which 
amounts of total protein and carbohydrates were kept constant but 
the amount of soybean protein and carbohydrates varied 
after the animals ate the diets for four weeks they were given 
a cancercausing substance tumors began to show up after another 
four weeks or so 
animals that ate soybean diets showed only about half as many 
tumors on average as those on the soybeanfree diet barnes said 
barnes said his work was financed largely by the cancer society 
with no funding from soybean companies 
he said it is not clear what component of soybeans may suppress 
breast cancer but he said molecules of one component called 
isoflavones bear a structural resemblance to tamoxifen a 
substance used in treating some breastcancer patients 
tamoxifen works by blocking a cancer cells ability to absorb 
and use estrogen which some cells use to fuel growth perhaps 
isoflavones do the same thing thus suppressing breast cancer he 
said 
the other study presented also dealt with the use of estrogen by 
breastcancer cells 
cells take up estrogen by snaring it with proteins on cell 
surfaces called estrogen receptors doctors routinely check 
breastcancer tumors to see if they have these receptors if they 
do doctors prescribe an estrogenblocking agent such as tamoxifen 
to be used after surgery 
if the breastcancer tumors do not show estrogen receptors 
doctors prescribe chemotherapy instead as a followup to surgery 
however a woman whose tumor contains estrogen receptors may 
have only a 40 percent to 80 percent chance of being helped by 
antiestrogen therapy said christopher benz of the university of 
california san francisco 
other tests can identify women with higher chances of 
responding but most community doctors decide on therapy after just 
checking for presence of the estrogen receptor benz said 
his study suggests that a new lab test may be able to identify 
women who have estrogen receptors but who would not respond to 
antiestrogen therapy 
the problem with the current test is that it fails to determine 
whether the estrogen receptors it finds will work normally he 
said receptors are supposed to bind to a cells genetic material 
after they snare estrogen 
in a study of 40 human tumors that had estrogen receptors benz 
found that 40 percent contained only abnormal receptors that failed 
to bind to genetic material 
such tumors might behave as if they lacked the receptors 
altogether and so not respond to antiestrogen therapy benz said 
to test that idea the women from whom the tumors were taken 
will have to be followed for several years he said if it turns 
out to be true the new test might help doctors make better 
decisions about what kind of therapy to prescribe after surgery he 
said 
broder said the work raises an exciting question for future 
research and that we have to keep an open mind on whether the 
test would be useful in treatment decisions

a hardline palestinian faction on monday 
openly challenged the plobacked leadership of the uprising and 
staged a wildcat strike widening a rift over tactics in the 
antiisraeli revolt 
the strike marked the anniversary of the egyptianisraeli peace 
treaty it was the latest act of defiance by the syrianbacked 
popular front for the liberation of palestine 
in two recent leaflets the group accused the three other 
factions in the leadership coalition of softening in their struggle 
against israeli occupation of the west bank and gaza strip 
palestinian activists who insisted on anonymity said contacts 
were under way to try to resolve the feud within the leadership of 
the 27monthold rebellion the leadership groups the popular front 
with yasser arafats fatah faction the palestine communist party 
and the democratic front for the liberation of palestine 
this is not the first time there have been differences and we 
were able in the past to surmount them one fatah activist said 
rising concern about the popular fronts tactics prompted a rare 
rebuke from the other palestinian leadership groups recently 
including the dominant fatah faction 
a twopage letter made available to the associated press 
criticized the group for actions that help nobody but the 
enemies 
it also charged that allowing disputes to break into the open 
will not help solve the problem but will lead to a civil war 
the popular front strike closed stores and offices in the west 
bank town of bethlehem and the neighboring villages of beit jala 
and beit sahour 
slogans on walls signed by the popular front and the 
fundamentalist islamic jihad group called for burying the camp 
david accords the accords led to the israelegypt peace treaty 
signed march 26 1979 
past disputes on goals and tactics already have splintered the 
uprising leadership 
the moslem fundamentalist movement hamas which rejects any 
compromise with israel has for more than a year set its own strike 
agenda it often is at odds with the main underground coalitions 
schedule of strikes 
the other factions largely have acted together since a 
fivepoint pact last july pledged cooperation and ended a rash of 
torchings of rivals cars 
the latest rift was sparked by the decision of the united 
leadership to allow merchants to open their stores for five hours a 
day starting march 20 earlier merchants were restricted to a 
threehour work day 
the popular front in its leaflets said the longer hours were a 
sign of weakness they said palestinians should increase civil 
disobedience by lengthening strikes intensifying the boycott of 
israelimade goods staging larger demonstrations and throwing more 
firebombs 
the groups militancy has had repercussions 
last week in the west bank village of jadideh supporters of 
the popular front badgered speakers from the democratic front until 
their joint rally broke down into a brawl arab reports said 
ten days earlier popular front activists ransacked and set 
afire a shop owned by a fatah supporter 
the palestinian uprising began in december 1987 a total of 669 
palestinians have been killed by israelis in the revolt an 
additional 199 palestinians have been killed by fellow arabs most 
on suspicion of collaborating with israel fortythree israelis 
have died in the violence

a bomb exploded in the dutch 
justice ministry early monday and police said a group protesting 
the death almost a decade ago of a hunger striker claimed 
responsibility 
the bomb went off at about 4 am it caused no injuries but 
damage was estimated at 175000 according to police spokeswoman 
bernadette maclean 
later monday a group identifying itself as the revolutionary 
antiracist action claimed responsibility for the incident in 
letters sent to an amsterdam newspaper and the dutch national news 
agency according to ms maclean 
she quoted the letter as saying that the bomb attack was to 
protest the death in 1982 of a spanish hunger striker identified as 
crespo galendo the circumstances of galendos death could not 
immediately be established 
the same organization claimed responsibility earlier this month 
for arson attacks on two dutch military police stations 
in december spanish government buildings here were targeted in 
bomb attacks that were believed to have been staged by eta the

the supreme court was urged monday to wait 
until its next term before reviewing a new federal law banning 
desecration of the american flag 
protesters who burned flags here and in seattle said the court 
should reject a bush administration request that two cases be 
decided in the current court term due to end by early july the new 
term begins in october 
the administration is appealing two rulings that said the law 
violates freedom of speech and is unconstitutional under a high 
court ruling last year that struck down a texas law against flag 
desecration 
lawyers for the protesters said it might be appropriate for the 
justices to uphold the lower court rulings summarily without 
hearing orgal arguments the attorneys said they dont oppose 
fullscale review of the law by the court because the issue is so 
important 
scheduling oral arguments next month as the administration 
requests would not allow the challengers enough time to prepare 
their case the lawyers said 
the case is us vs eichman 891433 us v haggerty 891434

prosecutors said monday there were no legal 
grounds for charging erich honecker with high treason but the 
deposed communist leader still was under investigation for 
corruption and abuse of power 
efforts to form a new governing coalition continued to be 
disrupted monday by allegations that leading politicians had links 
to the former communist secret police 
the office of chief prosecutor hansjuergen joseph said two 
members of honeckers politburo state security chief erich mielke 
and guenther mittag the economics minister also would escape 
treason charges but like honecker were suspected of corruption 
and misusing their power 
treason proceedings were dropped against joachim herrmann 
honeckers propaganda chief the former politburo member was 
ordered released 
honecker 77 was arrested in january after undergoing surgery 
for kidney cancer but was freed the next day and mielke also has 
been released for health reasons mittag remains in custoday 
prosecutors had said earlier that honecker mielke and mittag 
would be indicted and put on trial this month for high treason 
which carries a maximum sentence of life in prison 
joseph said in a statement monday however that treason 
indictments were not warranted and the three men also had been 
cleared of conspiracy charges 
his statement carried by the staterun news agency adn accused 
honecker and his lieutenants of persistent breaches of the 
constitution it added however that the actions were part of a 
oneparty stalinist system and suggested treason charges against 
individuals would not be appropriate 
honecker and mittag 64 are accused of embezzling state funds 
to build vacation homes and provide other personal comforts a 
range of accusations against mielke 84 stem from his control of 
the formerly allpowerful state security apparatus 
indictments are not expected before may or june joseph told the 
associated press his spokeswoman elke jurkutat said trials 
probably would not begin before summer because poor health was 
slowing interrogation of all three men 
angry citizens forced honecker and his wife margot a former 
education minister to abandon their new home saturday after only 
one day 
on friday the honeckers moved from a tworoom apartment in a 
parish home outside east berlin to a betterequipped government 
residence they returned to the church refuge after one night 
because several hundred angry citizens protested in front of the 
new residence 
the past also continued to haunt winners of east germanys first 
free elections held march 18 
ibrahim boehme leader of the social democratic party denied 
allegations that he had been a secret police informer but said he 
would leave the post until the suspicions were dispelled he also 
told reporters he would not take his place in the new 400seat 
parliament until then 
boehme said he hoped an independent commission would examine the 
files of the secret police known as stasi within a week and 
dispose of the allegations 
his social democrats finished a distant second march 18 
other noncommunist politicians also have come under suspicion 
of collaboration with the secret police 
lothar de maiziere of the victorious christian democratic union 
the probable new prime minister has denied allegations similar to 
those about boehme de maiziere said monday he believed he could 
form a government within two weeks 
markus meckel who took over the social democrats temporarily as 
boehmes deputy said anonymous allegations by former stasi agents 
were intended to undermine the country cause turmoil and and 
discredit the new parliament 
under honecker who ruled for 17 years the stasi was used to 
suppress dissent and keep tight control on all walks of life it 
had 85000 agents and more than 100000 informers and kept files 
on 6 million of east germanys 16 million citizens 
dismantling of the secret police began after honeckers downfall 
in october on monday the mayor of rostock resigned after 50 
people occupied the city hall to protest plans for 44 former stasi 
agents to become local teachers 
gregor gysi chairman of the party of democratic socialism the 
communist partys new name urged all 66 of its parliamentary 
deputies to acknowledge any links with stasi 
he also proposed that departing premier hans modrow a 
communist be made speaker of the new parliament

the supreme court said monday it will study 
the power of employers to exclude females of childbearing age from 
hazardous jobs a case that could affect millions of working women 
the court agreed to review a ruling that let a milwaukeebased 
manufacturer of automobile batteries ban women who cannot prove 
they are infertile from jobs that expose them to lead 
the fetal protection policy is being challenged as a form of 
illegal sex discrimination because it bans women from highpaying 
if hazardous jobs 
exposure to lead the principal material used in making 
batteries can be a health risk to workers and to the fetuses of 
pregnant workers 
but one judge who dissented from an appeals court decision last 
year that upheld the fetal protection policy said the ruling also 
could be applied to a broad range of employment including 
traditional office jobs 
the high courts decision is expected sometime in 1991 
in other action the court 
agreed to decide in an oklahoma city case whether some school 
districts may abandon forced busing after achieving racial balance 
voted to study an appeal from nebraska challenging the 
authority of states to house convicted murderers on death rows 
and keep them apart from other inmates 
said it will consider giving federal regulators more authority 
to lower electricity rates setting the stage for a ruling that 
could affect more than 49 million homes 
refused to extend a key civil rights law to protect 
noncitizens from private as well as governmental bias the 
justices let stand a ruling that a new orleans bank did not 
discriminate illegally against a man when it denied him a credit 
card because he is not a citizen 
let stand the conviction of an indiana business for showing and 
selling movies harmful to minors rejecting arguments that the 
conviction and 5000 fine infringe freespeech rights 
in the fetal protection case the court must interpret a federal 
law that bans sexual bias in employment 
since 1982 the battery division of johnson controls inc has 
barred women at its factories in several states from jobs involving 
exposure to lead 
eight employees and the united auto workers union challenged the 
policy in court among the women who sued was one who had submitted 
to sterilization to preserve her job and another who was a 
50yearold divorcee 
the suit alleged that the policy violated a part of the civil 
rights act of 1964 called title vii 
a federal judge ruled for johnson controls based on both sides 
pretrial arguments no trial was held 
the 7th us circuit court of appeals upheld that ruling by a 
74 vote last sept 26 
judge john l coffey wrote for the appeals court that the 
differing treatment of female employees was based on a business 
necessity and added we are also convinced that johnson 
controls fetal protection policy could be upheld under the bona 
fide occupational qualification defense 
the appeals court concluded that the policy is reasonably 
necessary to industrial safety 
three of the appeals courts four dissenting judges wrote 
opinions the most scathing by judge frank easterbrook an 
appointee of president ronald reagan 
calling it likely the most important sexdiscrimination case 
in any court since congress enacted title vii easterbrook 
said if the majority is right then by one estimate 20 million 
industrial jobs would be closed to women for many substances in 
addition to lead pose fetal risks 
the law would allow employers to consign more women to 
womens work while reserving betterpaying but more hazardous 
jobs for men easterbrook said 
cases show that many additional women are affected by 
restrictions placed on other jobs such as the xray technician 
jobs that exposed embryos to radiation concern about emissions 
from computers and their terminals has led to proposals that could 
restrict access even to traditional office jobs he said 
a california appeals court recently ruled that johnson controls 
fetal protection policy is illegal sex discrimination under that 
states law 
judith lichtman president of the womens legal defense fund 
said she was pleased that the court agreed to hear the case 
employers have used women as the scapegoat of their failure to 
properly evaluate the harm caused by workplace hazards on both men 
and women she said they choose to avoid cleaning up the 
workplace by excluding virtually all women from the jobs in 
question literally avoiding their responsibility by shifting the 
burden onto the backs of women workers

inspectors this morning visited more than 200 
social clubs in a crackdown ordered by mayor david dinkins 
following the deadliest city fire in 79 years only a fraction of 
them were found to be open but 52 safety violations were cited 
authorities said 
i will tell you it will not be an endless battle dinkins 
said sunday after touring the charred happy land social club in the 
bronx anybody that had an opportunity to view those 87 bodies 
knows that were not going to tolerate this 
previous mayors have waged a long and unsuccessful battle to 
close clubs that are operating illegally the dancing and drinking 
nightspots are popular among immigrants because they are cheap 
a task force put together by thenmayor edward koch after a 1988 
bronx social club fire that killed seven people will be beefed up 
dinkins said before sundays fire only one team remained from the 
10team task force 
a sweep of social clubs was conducted between midnight and 7 
am police said 
officers and task force inspectors went to 241 suspected illegal 
clubs citywide and posted vacate orders at 187 of them said sgt 
dick vreeland a police spokesman in most cases the orders were 
posted on closed doors because just 23 of the clubs were found to 
be open for business fiftytwo safety violations and 30 summonses 
were issued 
during the sweep five people were arrested for weapons 
possession 11 loaded firearms recovered cars were towed and 
parking tickets issued 
sunday morning in raids unrelated to the fire a police task 
force raided several social clubs in brooklyn and arrested five 
people for weapons possession said sgt tina mohrmann a police 
spokeswoman 
albert scardino the mayors press secretary said police list 
about 1220 clubs without liquor licenses with about 1000 
considered inactive the happy land was considered inactive 
they range from a group of elderly men who get together to 
play cards and watch a ballgame on a sunday afternoon to 
fullfledged nightclub operations said richard chernela a state 
liquor authority spokesman 
the number of clubs citywide is hard to pin down since they can 
spring up overnight often in a dank basement or abandoned building 
a review of city records sunday turned up 173 social clubs that 
had been ordered vacated inspectors were told to make sure the 173 
are closed there was no immediate explanation of how other clubs 
visited today were selected 
if the illegal clubs are not shut immediately dinkins had said 
well see to it that they certainly arent open come the next 
weekend 
sundays fire occurred 79 years to the day after a blaze at the 
triangle shirtwaist co in new york city that claimed 145 lives 
many of them immigrant garment workers that blaze led to reforms 
around the nation in workplace safety 
just about anyone can go to a social club despite the terms 
implication of exclusivity the happy land charged 5 for admission 
despite periodic campaigns to close them many of the clubs have 
become centers of urban problems from noise and doubleparking to 
gambling prostitution and drug dealing 
the clubs often are rife with building health and fire code 
violations that can lead to tragedy five people died in a brooklyn 
club fire in 1985 and 25 people were killed in a bronx fire in 
1976 
people are literally taking their lives in their hands at 
these clubs bronx borough president fernando ferrer said 
dinkins said a vacate order was issued in november 1988 against 
the happy land because the club did not have a proper sprinkler 
system exits emergency lighting and signs 
city records show an arrest was made there on july 24 and the 
club was closed again on nov 1 he said 
city officials said the building was sold last year to karl 
rubman but dinkins said it was unclear who owns the property now 
residents said the manager of the club was elias colon the daily 
news reported that colons wife elena was one of the survivors of 
the fire 
some said it may be impossible to close the social clubs 
completely 
our experience in the city in the last 20 years demonstrates 
that clearly said william kornblum director of the center for 
social research at the city university of new york graduate school 
many people especially those from poor neighborhoods where 
affordable alternatives are scarce go to the clubs looking for a 
place to socialize where they feel welcome 
some clubs are closed under the citys 1984 padlock law which 
allows police to shutter a location for a year if two crimes are 
committed on the site within a 12month period 
but the owners if they can be located are rarely convicted 
even when the clubs are shuttered an owner may reopen around 
the corner or down the street attracting the same crowd

the supreme court said monday it will decide 
whether school districts may abandon forced busing of students 
after once achieving racial balance in their schools 
the justices will review a ruling that if upheld could 
reinstate forced busing for the racial desegregation of elementary 
schools in oklahoma city 
at issue is the effect of a federal judges ruling in 1977 that 
the citys public schools had become fully integrated and no longer 
had to be under court supervision 
the city in 1985 returned to a neighborhood schools plan for 
children in kindergarten through fourth grade ending the racial 
balance achieved by crosstown busing of elementary school pupils 
by 1986 33 of the school districts 64 elementary schools were 
90 percent black or white and some parents called the neighborhood 
schools plan a tool of resegregation 
hundreds of school districts including those in most major 
cities operate courtordered busing plans for racial 
desegregation only a few have persuaded courts to declare their 
oncesegregated systems fully integrated 
nevertheless the potential impact of the high courts decision 
expected sometime in 1991 is enormous 
the issue gained national attention when the reagan 
administration helped bring about a halt to courtordered busing of 
elementary school pupils in norfolk va 
the norfolk school district was allowed to return to a 
neighborhood schools plan in 1986 
william bradford reynolds head of the justice departments 
civil rights division when it entered the norfolk case in 1984 
said the same legal principles could apply to many many other 
school districts around the country 
in the oklahoma city case a federal appeals court last oct 6 
disapproved the neighborhood schools plan 
oklahoma city public schools once were racially segregated by 
law black parents sued in 1961 to end the lasting effects of such 
segregation and in 1972 forced busing was begun as part of a 
courtordered desegregation plan 
us district judge luther bohanon ruled in 1977 that the school 
district had become fully integrated and ended court supervision 
school officials continued the crosstown busing however until 
1985 when children in kindergarten through fourth grade were 
allowed to attend the school nearest their home 
some black parents challenged the neighborhood schools plan 
although other black parents had criticized the busing program 
bohanon ruled that the 1972 desegregation plan no longer had to 
be enforced because federal court supervision ended with his 1977 
declaration 
but the 10th us circuit court of appeals ruled in october that 
federal court supervision in such cases extends beyond the 
termination of the wrongdoing 
the appeals court said the oklahoma city school board has a 
continuing duty to refrain from any action that could weaken racial 
balance in the public schools it ordered bohanon to study 
alternatives to maintain racially balanced elementary schools 
the 10th circuit courts ruling appears to conflict with federal 
appeals court rulings in the norfolk case and one from austin 
texas 
in each of those an appeals court ruled that judicial 
supervision ends when a previously segregated school district is 
found to be fully integrated or unitary 
in a friendofthecourt brief the national school boards 
association urged the justices to use the oklahoma city case to 
resolve what constitutes a unitary school system and determine the 
effect of a declaration of unitary

a pair of peregrine falcons whose 
highrise hijinks captivated cable television viewers last summer 
return to the airwaves monday 
the allday broadcast of two birds who dont do much more than 
putter about on a 21ststory ledge proved more popular than 
expected 
it amazes me that someone can sit and watch the birds hour 
after hour said brian lambert general manager of continental 
cablevision i am one of them it stays on in the office all day 
long we just kind of wait to see the bird move or the eggs or 
whatever its mesmerizing 
the 43000subscriber cable company mounted a camera near the 
falcons nest on a ledge of the 23story monarch place office 
building last year and televised the video on a channel devoted to 
educational programming 
tom french director of the states endangered species program 
said the show is more than an entertaining glimpse of nature 
its an incredible opportunity he said its absolutely 
incredible that theyre so visible we can look at the egg tooth 
thats minute 
among last seasons highlights were the first hatchings of young 
peregrine falcons in western massachusetts in 40 years and a 
thriller episode in june when french rappelled down the side of the 
building to rescue a baby falcon that was choking on a piece of 
meat alert viewers had noticed the chicks distress and jammed the 
companys switchboard 
this season the first egg is expected to appear in early april 
the first hatching in midmay and the first fledgling flights near 
the end of june

a man convicted of raping and sexually 
mutilating a 7yearold boy was sentenced today to more than 130 
years in prison three times the standard term for the crime 
in sentencing earl shriner pierce county superior court judge 
thomas r sauriol said the case left him more troubled and outraged 
than any in his 37year legal career 
i dont think that i have ever heard of a case that borders on 
extreme cruelty more than this one sauriol said the reality 
is mr shriner you present a danger to the defenseless 
shriner 40 has a long history of violence toward young people 
he was convicted feb 7 of first degree attempted murder two 
counts of firstdegree rape and firstdegree assault the child was 
choked and his penis was cut off in the attack may 20 in a wooded 
area near his south tacoma home 
the victims mother helen harlow dabbing her eyes and 
comforted by numerous friends said she was satisfied with the 
sentence because it would in effect be a life sentence 
the attack created an uproar in the state about sex predators 
and was one of the cases cited as being instrumental in passage of 
legislation to deal more strictly with them including longer 
sentences civil commitment and registration of sex offenders 
under state law the standard range for the offenses with 
someone of shriners record is 34 years to 43 years eight months 
the approximately 131year sentence was three times the high end of 
the standard range 
in reaching his sentence which the defense said would be 
appealed sauriol accepted almost all the 13 aggravating factors 
cited by prosecutors as reasons to go above the standard sentence 
but he rejected the states proposal for a sentence of more than 
250 years six times the maximum under standard sentencing 
guidelines 
the boys mother has said her son continues with his recovery 
including reconstructive surgery a trust fund of hundreds of 
thousands of dollars that poured in after the attack on the boy is 
paying for the surgery 
shriner has a 24year history of violent attacks on young 
people he has been confined at rainier school for the retarded 
western state hospital a mental institution and the washington 
corrections center 
the 7yearold boy was found by neighbors after the attack 
bloody naked covered with mud and practically incoherent a 
fellow jail inmate testified during the trial that shriner admitted 
mutilating the boy

the chairman of a senate panel on military 
construction said monday that a bush administration request for 
11 billion to renovate the pentagon is out of the question 
sen james sasser dtenn acknowledged that the 47yearold 
building is in need of repair but said the administrations call 
for 11 billion over seven years would be difficult to heed in a 
time of shrinking budgets 
the military construction bill is going to get smaller not 
larger sasser told pentagon officials at a senate hearing 
theres simply no room for such an undertaking 
the chairman of the senate appropriations subcommittee on 
military construction faulted past defense secretaries for failing 
to get the general services administration to provide sufficient 
funds for the buildings upkeep 
the gsa owns the pentagon building with transfer of control to 
the defense department expected some time this year 
im not persuaded that we ought to ask the taxpayers to come 
up with another billion dollars to provide new office space for 
those who work in the pentagon and to expand it sasser said 
perhaps its time to take a hard look at scaling back some of 
the pentagon staff 
david j berteau the pentagons principal deputy assistant 
secretary for production and logistics said that if he cut his 
staff in half he would not leave a dent in the pentagon because 
those people are not located in the pentagon as it is now 
sasser who also chairs the senate budget committee said 
spending a billion dollars or more to buy new offices for the 
pentagon is just out of the question in the budgetary climate 
that i see coming 
the pentagon the largest office building in the world has 175 
miles of corridors 131 stairways 19 escalators and 13 elevators 
and covers 29 acres in northern virginia

hungarians applied the wests rules of 
fair play to their first free election in 43 years but not its 
efficient tabulation of results 
only 69 percent of the votes cast in sundays election were 
counted by late monday 
the state news agency mti said the conservative hungarian 
democratic forum led with about onequarter of the votes the 
centerleft league of free democrats had roughly 20 percent and the 
socialists the new name adopted by the communists were a distant 
fourth after the independent smallholders party 
with no party given a chance of winning a majority in 
parliament a coalition government is likely after runoff elections 
next month 
hungarians like to consider themselves closer to the modern west 
than to the east which they derisively call the balkans or 
asia but the election provides little evidence of western 
technical efficiency 
international monitors expressed satisfaction with the votes 
fairness but the reporting of results has been an agonizing 
process 
east germany held the first free election among former soviet 
satellites on march 18 and provided projections of the outcome 
soon after polls closed provisional final results were available 
five hours after the last vote was cast and official results were 
announced the next morning 
the east germans had west german computers and knew how to use 
them the hungarians had modern computers but appeared incapable 
of using them 
gleaming banks of computer terminals were on prominent display 
at election committee headquarters in the parliament building and 
in state televisions election studio 
shortly after the polls closed the television began a scheduled 
24hour broadcast complete with an inspiring musical theme and 
elaborate graphics 
the computer screens remained blank election officials decided 
at the last minute not explaining why to tally the more than 5 
million ballots by hand and use computers only for a final check 
that also crippled state televisions computer system which 
depended partially on feeds from the election committee network 
commentators mumbled excuses and read handwritten partial results 
some attempts to draw on the computers were embarrassing 
commentators presented an analysis of early partial results from a 
rural election district only to find that it was a test graphic 
with imaginary candidates and percentages 
members of a television panel trying to explain inconclusive and 
sometimes misleading data gave up before dawn monday 
what do you expect this is hungary philosopy professor 
mihaly vajda said to the other panelists i would suggest we try 
to analyze what we have we could only be wrong for all we know 
we may be the only people up 
panel member peter kende a hungarian who teaches political 
science at the sorbonne in paris said its a little hard to 
believe that weve been sitting around for seven hours and we still 
dont know anything 
television reporters across the country were reporting local 
results of less than 10 percent hours after the pollis colsed 
hostesses at the international press center tried to placate 
hundreds of journalists with a trickle of results from mti the 
state news agency but the large television screen that was 
supposed to carry quick results and projections remained blank 
attempts to obtain substantive comment from party leaders were 
frustrated because it was impossible to be certain who was ahead 
at dawn more than 12 hours after the voting ended mti made its 
initial report of a trend

the bush administration monday hailed initial 
results of hungarys first free parliamentary elections in more 
than four decades 
we are encouraged by the elections as an indication of further 
movement along the path of democratic development for the hungarian 
people said white house spokesman marlin fitzwater 
partial results of the weekend election indicated voters 
overwhelmingly chose opposition candidates over communist 
reformers and that it appeared likely that a coalition of 
opposition parties would run hungary 
fitzwater noted that there was a tight contest between two 
noncommunist factions the conservative hungarian democratic 
forum and the liberal league of free democrats the socialists the 
successor to the communists who once ruled the warsaw pact nation 
were trailing badly 
eastern europe is undergoing dramatic economic and political 
changes fitzwater said hungary has been one of the countries 
in the forefront of these changes

the judge ordered the sheriff to remove tents if the group 
refused to take them down nichols said monday his office was 
just carrying out the court order

supporters of the demonstration have been disappointed that the 
negotiations have gone on so long and they may have run out of 
patience

lawyers for ivana trump filed papers monday 
demanding that their client receive half of her estranged husbands 
fortune which they estimated at 5 billion 
the lawyers said they had filed papers in state court in 
manhattan in which they said mrs trump had no intention of seeking 
a divorce and had never waived the right to an equitable share 
of the money trump made during their 13year marriage 
marital property is property gained by the husband and wife 
during marriage regardless of in whose name it is held said 
michael kennedy lawyer for mrs trump 
trump did not have any immediate response 
the papers were filed in response to an attempt by trumps 
lawyers to enforce a postmarital contract signed christmas eve 
1987 that contact kennedy said does not waive or release mrs 
trumps right to such marital property 
this contract was unfair at the time it was made and is 
unconscionable now that mr trump is trying to enforce it he 
said 
kennedy denied reports that the contract called for mrs trump 
to receive 25 million in the event that their marriage broke up 
in fact he said under the contract mrs trump is to receive 
10 million in cash the couples house in greenwich conn and an 
additional 4 million if she and the couples three children move 
out of trump tower 
this kennedy said was less than 1 percent of trumps assets 
the trumps marital problems came to light last month when the 
developer left his wife setting off much speculation about trumps 
relationships with other women

moslems across the world scanned the 
skies after twilight monday in hopes of sighting the luminous 
crescent moon that heralds the festive but arduous dawntodusk 
fasting month of ramadan 
first to announce the sighting from the arabian peninsula was 
north yemen where a panel of islamic judges declared ramadan will 
start tuesday sightings also were reported in south yemen and 
saudi arabia who declared tuesday the start of the moslem holy 
month 
many of the worlds islamic nations automatically follow the 
saudi decision because the kingdom harbors islams holiest shrines 
ramadan is venerated by the worlds estimated 1 billion moslems 
as the month during which the archangel gabriel imparted the verses 
of the koran to mohammed the prophet of islam more than 14 
centuries ago it is the 9th month in the moslem lunar calendar 
for the 30 days of ramadan moslems must abstain from eating 
drinking and smoking from dawn to sunset they are to avoid 
pleasures of the flesh even an innocent kiss can be a violation 
the more devout will even avoid swallowing their own saliva 
only moslems who are traveling ill or pregnant during ramadan 
are exempt from the fast according to the koran but they must 
make up for this in subsequent months 
for weeks moslem countries stockpiled food in preparation for 
the nighttime feasts that follow the days of deprivation some 
scholars accuse moslems of turning ramadan into a month of feasting 
rather than fasting especially since many people actually gain 
weight 
moslems however say they achieve boundless spiritual gains 
during ramadan purifying their souls and giving themselves peace 
of mind 
tradition has it that the fast starts each day when a black 
thread can be distinguished from a white one and it ends when the 
two cannot be distinguished large cities often fire off a cannon 
to tell citizens when to stop and start eating 
the koran the holy book of islam prescribed fasting as one of 
the five pillars of the faith the others are to recognize the 
unitarian nature of allah and that mohammed is his prophet pray 
five times a day give alms and make the pilgrimage to mecca at 
least once 
the pillars are supposedly the primary factor that unite 
moslems but the fast has been manipulated by dissident factions 
and secular states to demonstrate divergent brands and practices of 
the same religion 
it is generally said that when the crescent is sighted in one 
moslem country with the naked eye other moslems everywhere in the 
world are required to observe the start of the fast 
however shiite moslem iran along with shiite communities in 
countries ruled by sunni moslems mark the start and end of ramadan 
ahead or behind the sunnis never on the same day 
turkey with a secular constitution has announced that ramadan 
commences wednesday under simple calendar count 
interior ministries along the persian gulf told nonmoslem 
citizens and expatriate workers to avoid eating drinking and 
smoking in public during ramadan 
moslems who eat drink or smoke publicly will be fine flogged 
and imprisoned the ministries warned 
liquor is strictly banned during ramadan and hotels are 
instructed to keep their restaurants shut between sunrise and 
sundown room service for foreigners however is permitted in most 
countries

rising mortgage interest rates last month 
curbed demand for existing homes causing sales to drop 23 percent 
to their slowest pace in seven months a real estate trade group 
said monday 
the national association of realtors said resales of 
singlefamily homes dipped to 344 million units at a seasonally 
adjusted annual rate as mortgage interest rates remained in the 
double digits 
john a tuccillo the realtors chief economist said 
wednesdays commerce department report on sales of new homes in 
february also will show a decline 
but tuccillo predicted rates will begin to drop in the months 
ahead and renew buyer interest 
fixedrate mortgages had risen from 1017 percent to 1031 
percent last month according to national surveys by the federal 
home loan mortgage corp but slipped to 1026 percent by last 
friday 
the february sales rate was the lowest since a 338 millionunit 
pace last july and matched a 344 million rate in august existing 
homes which represent about 80 percent of home sales posted a 
sales rate of 352 million units in january 
norman d flynn the realtors president said the february pace 
shows considerable market strength and sets the tone for a 
healthy sales year tuccillo agreed saying the trade group 
expects existinghome sales to total 344 million units this year 
down 01 percent from 1989 
as a result of higher mortgage rates flynn said many buyers 
selected less expensive homes as their purchasing power slipped 
resulting in a 900 drop from the january median price of a home to 
95400 in february 
the median means half of the homes cost more half less 
sales declined 11 percent to 930000 units in the midwest 
where the median price for a home was 73800 sales also fell in 
the south down 64 percent to 13 million units where the median 
price totaled 85600 
sales were up 14 percent to 650000 units in the west and were 
unchanged at 560000 units in the northeast the median price for a 
home in the west was 143000 and in the northwest 143400

democratic sen john glenn on monday accused 
the bush administration of failing to provide any estimate of the 
number of uniformed men and women who will comprise the nations 
future armed forces 
none of the defense officials who have testified before us 
thus far have been able to give us any definitive manpower strength 
figures beyond fiscal 1991 said glenn the chairman of the 
senate armed services subcommittee on manpower and personnel in a 
speech on the senate floor 
the ohio democrat also stressed the need for a review of the 
armed forces saying he believes that the allocation of roles and 
missions between active and reserve units has deteriorated 
the sad fact is that the army cannot sustain a conventional 
war for any length of time because the combat support and combat 
service support forces that must roll in as early as 10 to 30 days 
after a shooting war starts are not rated as combat ready glenn 
said 
war games make this very point 
the ohio senator said that with the collapse of the warsaw pact 
as a military alliance there is a greater need for more 
definition of our required level of combat capability 
but the administratons decisions appear to be driven by fiscal 
concerns rather than force structure decisions he said

aides to millionaire charles h keating jr 
ordered lincoln savings and loan association to advance its holding 
company 142 million for taxes in 1986 a federal judge was told 
monday 
however the government alleges that the money requested a 
month before it was due never was paid to the internal revenue 
service 
the contention came in the 13th day of a hearing in us 
district court on keatings lawsuit which alleges that the 
government takeover of the irvine calif sampl was capricious and 
arbitrary he wants the thrift returned to him 
a june 30 1986 memo containing the instructions was introduced 
to support government allegations that keating was illegally 
siphoning federally insured deposits from the thrift 
regulators say the subsequent collapse of the 55 billion 
thrift could cost taxpayers as much as 2 billion making it the 
most expensive sampl failure in history 
in the memo lincolns chief financial officer was instructed by 
her counterpart at the thrifts holding company keatings 
american continental corp of phoenix to make the 14186000 
payment a month earlier than it was due 
government lawyer james murphy said the memo bolsters 
regulators contention that lincoln was using complicated real 
estate stock and junk bond transactions to book phony profits to 
bolster keatings faltering real estate empire 
in its april takeover of the thrift the government contended 
that american continental looted lincoln of 94 million through the 
taxsharing arrangement under the agreement the holding company 
collected taxes due on the phony profits but never paid them to the 
irs the government contends 
although an outline of the taxsharing arrangement had been 
approved by regulators on the west coast government attorneys 
contend it was illegal 
meanwhile andre niebling lincolns chairman from mid1985 
through mid1987 has refused to testify citing a fifth amendment 
protection against selfincrimination 
niebling said in an affidavit that a federal grand jury in los 
angeles is weighing possible criminal charges against keating and 
other american continental and lincoln officials 
mark sauter lincolns general counsel refused earlier to 
testify 
government lawyers alleged monday that during a july 1986 
meeting with federal regulators keating cited an upcoming meeting 
with rep john dingell dmich the powerful chairman of the house 
energy and commerce committee 
keatings top aide american continental president judith 
wischer testified that she could not recall keating making that 
remark or referring to dingell 
keating would not comment to reporters on what he said at the 
meeting he said he did meet with dingel later to voice complaints 
about regulators but did not discuss lincolns particular problems 
keating said he had met with about 50 members of congress since 
1984 to complain about the way thenchairmen edwin gray and grays 
successor m danny wall were running the federal home loan bank 
board the thrift industrys chief regulator 
dennis fitzgibbons a spokesman for dingell confirmed that 
dingell and keating met in late july 1986 
he keating wanted dingell to go after gray and dingell 
refused fitzgibbons said 
the senate ethics committee is investigating five senators 
intervention with bank board officials in 1987 on lincolns behalf 
the senators who together received 13 million in political funds 
from keating have denied any ethics violations 
they are alan cranston dcalif dennis deconcini dariz 
john mccain rariz john glenn dohio and donald w riegle jr

gunbattles flared in beiruts christian 
sector monday after nightlong artillery and tank fire duels in the 
hinterland northeast of the capital police said four people were 
killed and 14 wounded 
that raised the overall toll to 772 killed and 2143 wounded 
since jan 30 when army gen michel aoun moved to crush christian 
warlord samir geageas lebanese forces militia 
it was the third straight day of violations of a march 3 
ceasefire sharpening fears of a new round of fullscale fighting 
to resolve the inconclusive power struggle for control of lebanons 
christian enclave 
police reported aouns troops and geageas militiamen were 
engaged in battles on the streets of east beiruts residential 
district of sin elfil the industrial dora neighborhood and a 
cluster of abandoned government compounds in badaro 
they are shooting at each other with machine guns and 
rocketpropelled grenades but neither side seems trying to push 
for territorial gains thus far said a police spokesman at 
midday he cannot be named under standing rules 
both sides also traded sniper fire across the coastal highway 
tunnel on the dog river boundary between aouns positions in the 
metn province and geageas lines in kesrouan region the spokesman 
said 
ten of the wounded were hit by sniper fire on the dog river 
crossing 
he said lebanons main powergenerating plant in 
militiacontrolled zouk just north of the river took several direct 
hits in the nighttime shelling 
the plant has been out of order since the first day of the 
confrontation the worst intrachristian fighting since the civil 
war with moslems broke out 15 years ago 
that left the lebanese capital and its environs without city 
power or water for nearly two months officials of the staterun 
electricity authority have said repair works on the zouk plant 
would take at least five months 
the police spokesman said lebanese forces gunners retaliated for 
the zouk bombardment by shelling a makeshift harbor that aouns 
troops reportedly set up in antelias five miles north of beirut 
geageas militia captured beirut port in the early days of the 
showdown stripping aoun of the only facility to get replenishments 
of arms and ammunition for his army by sea the general has no 
airport and all overland inlets to his enclave are blocked by 
hostile syrian troops 
military sources close to aoun speaking on condition of 
anmonymity said his engineering corps turned the golden beach 
hotel in antelias into a tiny shipping harbor three weeks ago 
ships have since unloaded consignments of 155mm howitzer shells 
and 120mm mortar rounds from iraq and france for aouns army the 
sources said 
police said they could verify neither the reports 
aoun set up his command at the bunker of the baabda palace after 
he declared a war of liberation to drive out syrian 
peacekeeping troops from lebanon on march 14 1989 charging they 
had become an occupation army 
the general has refused to turn over the traditional seat of 
power to syrianbacked president elias hrawi who was elected by 
parliament nov 24 to fill a 13month presidential vacuum 
hrawi promptly fired aoun as army commander and prime minister 
of an interim threeman military cabinet appointed by former 
president amin gemayel when his term expired sept 22 1988 with 
parliament unable to elect a successor 
hrawis defense minister albert mansour said in a statement 
published monday that 1090 troops and 76 officers of various ranks 
have defected from aouns 20000strong army to hrawis government 
in moslem west beirut aouns command declined to comment

there was broccoli broccoli everywhere monday 
at the white house broccoli on the lawn broccoli in the 
boutonnieres broccoli in the bouquet in barbara bushs hand 
everywhere that is except on president bushs plate 
and that apparently is how it will stand given the presidents 
adamancy against the vegetable his wife and mother forced him to 
eat for decades 
the broccoli lobby rode the wave of publicity right onto the 
white house lawn where hundreds of reporters turned out to watch 
the broccoliboosting first lady accept three boxes of the 
vegetable and a bouquet 
that was just the edge of a 10000pound avalanche of broccoli 
california growers shipped east to donate to soup kitchens and 
shelters in the nations capital in a riposte to the presidents 
predilections 
we appreciate the fact that the president himself does not 
like broccoli personally said george dunlop president of the 
united fresh fruit and vegetable association 
but dunlop sporting a broccoli boutonniere offered mrs bush 
some very good new recipes that just might intrigue the 
president to take the plunge into the wonderful world of fresh 
broccoli 
im going to overlook the fact you think my cooking is not up 
to par cracked mrs bush but im going to tell you the honest 
truth the president is never going to eat broccoli 
but i am never going to eat pork rinds ever she promised 
in a viveladifference aside she added thats why you 
stayed married 45 years 
later at a separate white house reception for florists mrs 
bush confided that her daughter and four daughtersinlaw have 
all checked in and said mother what are we going to say to the 
kids now 
but as she told the broccoli growers if his own blessed 
mother cant make him eat broccoli then i give up 
millie and i thank you for the broccoli well eat it said 
mrs bush whose dog stretched beside the three cases of irish 
spring broccoli bursting over a small table 
mrs bush also said it was marvelous the needy in the 
nations capital were getting tons of free broccoli 
trying to evoke guilt in the media horde she said you 
probably wouldnt have come if wed come out to talk about the food 
bank 
the industry had said earlier it was bringing 10 tons of 
broccoli at the event they halved the estimate 
bush set the wheels in motion for the protest when it became 
known that he had ordered stewards aboard air force one to stop 
serving him broccoli 
the president in words a picky child could only envy told a 
news conference last thursday i do not like broccoli and i 
havent liked it since i was a little kid and my mother made me eat 
it and im president of the united states and im not going to eat 
any more broccoli

jesse jackson threatened to take the case for 
district of columbia statehood to the united nations but in the 
meantime monday urged the city council to provide for electing 
shadow members of congress 
it would be a last resort jackson said of appealing to the 
un 
if the citizens of prague or warsaw or managua or moscow were 
excluded from participation in national government and denied 
selfdetermination we would understand that basic human rights 
were being violated jackson said the political occupation 
of the people living in the district of columbia is a cause for 
global concern and action 
the city council which was scheduled to vote tuesday on a bill 
that would set terms of office of the shadow delegation has 
three times postponed a similar vote in the past 
the first step for statehood is to get the election on the 
ballot for this year jackson said at a district building news 
conference we are the cradle of democracy but have no voting 
rights in congress it is immoral and unjust 
city voters approved the shadow plan in a 1980 referendum 
the scheme first used by the tennessee territory in 1796 creates 
the position of two shadow senators and a shadow 
congressman to lobby national lawmakers for statehood the 
nonvoting representatives would have no other official duties 
jackson predicted that the council will approve the measure 
although the version of the legislation that will be voted on 
tomorrow contains no funding for the posts 
an initial draft of the bill included 13 million to staff the 
positions and rent office space but the measure was dismissed as 
too costly and impractical for a time when the council is 
struggling to avoid a deficit

government doctors and medical 
workers went on strike monday to protest pay cuts following of an 
eightyear wage freeze and riot police arrested about 100 
university teachers who threatened to join the work stoppage 
armed troops patrolled the capital and other potential trouble 
spots where demonstrators protested violently last month against 
this west african nations austerity measures which include 
reducing salaries by up to 17 percent 
the austerity measures were brought on by a sharp drop in the 
prices of cocoa the ivory coasts top export 
only emergency services were available at abidjans main 
hospital in suburban treichville in addition to doctors the 
strikers included pharmacists dentists and veterinarians 
the university lecturers were arrested when they tried to hold a 
union meeting at abidjan university despite a new ban on meetings 
and protests union leader marcel ette said they were to decide 
whether they would join striking health workers 
more than 360 members of the national union of senior health 
officers met in treichville on monday in defiance of the ban 
the medical union had called for its 750 members across the 
country to strike monday and tuesday to protest the cuts imposed 
this month in a government bid to avoid bankruptcy in this 
financially strapped nation 
dr assoa adou the medical unions secretarygeneral said any 
pay cut on top of a wage freeze already in effect was 
insupportable and unjust 
a union letter blamed the government of president felix 
houphouetboigny for the economic crisis brought on by the 
slumping cocoa prices overseas 
the economic situation actually is the result of bad 
management of public finances embezzlement etc the letter 
said 
last month the economic problems prompted widespread protests 
led by university students who accused government leaders of 
siphoning money from state coffers 
protesters set cars aflame looted stores and stoned cars and 
buses they demanded the resignation of houphouetboigny who has 
ruled ivory coast as a oneparty state since its independence from 
france in 1960 
the government then closed the nations only university and all 
schools leaving protest leaders without a meeting place 
in response to the medical workers strike state radio monday 
said all demonstrations in and around hospital premises are 
forbidden as are all demonstrations and any meetings anywhere in 
the country security forces have been given orders to enforce 
this 
interior minister leon konan koffi tried to uphold the ban he 
went to treichville university hospital center which was guarded 
by three truckloads of armed troops and ordered striking health 
officers to leave the building 
we told him they would have to use force to move us and that 
if they did the strike will continue beyond tuesday adou said 
in an interview 
he said the strikers planned to meet again at the hospital 
tuesday 
the union letter warned the work stoppage will be total and 
unlimited if a health professional is the objective of measures of 
oppression arrest or suppression of salary 
adou sent a letter to houphouetboigny complaining about 
conditions in illequipped hospitals where patients have to buy 
everything even gloves for the surgeon 
many die because it takes a day or two to get together money 
for the medical prescriptions doctors stand by powerless and 
watch innocent and unjustified deaths his letter said

protests from animal activists led 
the seminole tribe to cancel its planned biggame hunt at a 3mile 
preserve so tourists will now shoot deer and antelope with cameras 
instead of guns 
seminole officials have decided to offer safaristyle excursions 
for photographers on the fenced preserve they had stocked with the 
animals sheep and had planned to open for hunters 
the tribe dropped the hunting plan after animalrights groups 
complained and threatened a boycott of the seminolerun bingo games 
and cigarette shops that help finance education and social programs 
for the tribe 
we decided it would be more fun to watch them instead of 
shooting them on the preserve on the big cypress reservation 65 
miles west of fort lauderdale said david holloway exoticgame 
manager for the seminole tribe the tribe paid 30000 for 68 deer 
antelope and sheep and planned to either raise them for food or 
game on the preserve 
in about two months seminole guides will begin leading groups 
of shutterbugs in search of the black buck antelope axis deer 
corsican sheep and an african antelope called the scimitarhorned 
oryx holloway said 
plans call for using buses motorized buggies or other vehicles 
to transport photo enthusiasts the more hardy may set out on foot 
through the brush in search of their quarry 
im glad they have taken a more human approach to the animals 
we feel thats the best thing to do with the animals now that they 
are here said marian lentz animal rights foundation cofounder 
they may as well let them live out the rest of their days in as 
peaceful a way as possible 
the foundation based in pembroke pines was among the groups 
opposed to plans for hunting parties 
its ridiculous to have hunters converge on the animals in a 
small area its like shooting fish in a barrel lentz said 
about 800 feet of fence was cut at the preserve in january but 
none of the animals escaped holloway said the animals have 
established their own territories inside the preserve and would be 
reluctant to leave one sheep wandered outside the fence but was 
led back in by workers at the preserve holloway said 
members of a group calling itself the animal liberation front 
claimed responsibility for cutting the fence and promised to strike 
again 
holloway said the tribe was surprised at the intensity of 
opposition especially since he said there are about 80 such game 
preserves in florida 
the indians have great respect for animals he said 
everyone made them to be the bad guys but its ok for the whites 
to have game farms 
holloway said he was uncertain how much the tribe will charge 
for the excursions

a conservative party and a centerleft 
rival emerged monday as the frontrunners in hungarys first 
democratic parliamentary elections in 43 years 
the socialist party which ruled as the communist party until it 
changed its name last year initiated the dramatic reforms that led 
to sundays balloting but got little credit from voters it trailed 
in fourth place 
as election results trickled in monday the conservative 
hungarian democratic forum had an edge over the centerleft league 
of free democrats 
but neither garnered anything close to the absolute majority 
needed for decisive victory making a coalition government likely 
after runoff elections are held next month 
election officials said only five of the 394 parliamentary seats 
had been decided by monday and three were hungarian democratic 
forum winners 
more than 70 percent of hungarys 785 million eligible voters 
cast ballots 
with 3608000 69 percent of the votes counted late monday 
the conservative hungarian democratic forum led with 2422 percent 
and the centerleft league of free democrats was second with 2084 
percent state radio said 
the independent smallholders a revived preworld war ii party 
popular in rural areas had 1262 percent the socialists 1054 
percent the radical liberal league of young democrats 857 percent 
and the christian democratic peoples party 643 percent 
the rest of the 29 parties that fielded candidates appeared to 
fall short of winning 4 percent of the vote nationwide and 
therefore would not be entitled to any parliament seats 
up to 14 candidates competed in most races and the vote was so 
split that many seats will have to be contested again election 
officials said in the second round of voting a simple majority 
will suffice provided 25 percent of eligible voters turn out 
the democratic forum and the free democrats have said they do 
not want to govern together so the smallholders may be the key to 
forming a coalition 
smallholder leader vince voeroes said monday his party is 
ideologically closer to the forum which like the smallholders is 
based on traditional christian values and in the prewar populism 
of rural hungary but he said no decision had been made on whether 
to ally with the forum 
democratic forum chairman joszef antall said voeroes party 
would be his first choice as a coalition partner and like the free 
democrats dismissed any idea of working with the socialists 
there will be no place whatsoever in the new government for 
members of the old government ministers of state and deputy 
ministers he said 
premier miklos nemeth a founder of the socialist party and one 
of the chief supporters of full democracy said his outgoing 
government should get credit for leading the nation to sundays 
historic vote under extremely complex conditions 
nemeth running as an independent in his home village of 
szerencs 70 miles northeast of budapest was one of the few 
candidates to win outright 
the socialists and their communist predecessors played a role 
unique in the soviet bloc by initiating reform rather than being 
forced into it 
but most voters apparently associated the socialists with the 
repression of hungarys communist rule and rejected the partys 
candidates

a federal magistrate monday ordered 
psychiatric tests for a man accused of stealing 10 million to 20 
million in rare books from collections across the country 
an fbi agent meanwhile said investigators have begun to match 
books found in the ottumwa home of stephen carrie blumberg with 
books that libraries reported missing or stolen 
we believe well be able to help out several of these 
libraries said special agent dennis aiken of the omaha neb 
bureau 
blumberg 41 of st paul minn was arrested last week at a 
home he owns in ottumwa the fbi said it found 11000 rare books as 
well as antiques in the 14room house

during a hearing before magistrate ronald longstaff the hearing 
originally was set to determine conditions blumberg would have to 
meet in order to be freed before trial no trial date has been set 
blumberg did not speak during the appearance he was returned to 
the polk county jail 
blumberg will be sent later this week to the springfield medical 
center for federal prisoners at springfield mo the examination is 
to last a month 
blumbergs lawyer don nickerson of des moines said the 
agreement for psychiatric evaluation does not necessarily mean 
blumberg will use mental condition as a defense 
nickerson said he would have little trouble arranging a pretrial 
bond after the examination if hes released whats the danger 
that hell throw books at passing cars nickerson argued 
government lawyer linda read declined to comment on what the 
government has found saying prosecutors were examining the 
collection 
many of the identifying marks or labels were removed from the 
books but aiken said finding the owners shouldnt be difficult 
because the books are rare some of the books may have to be held 
as evidence 
aiken would not say how investigators closed in on blumberg

john poindexters lawyers lost efforts monday 
to get the testimony of former hostage david jacobsen and a house 
staff member who made political comments about a possible contra 
investigation 
us district court judge harold greene said testimony at 
poindexters trial by jacobsen who was held in west beirut from 
may 1985 to nov 2 1986 would inflame the jury with the 
emotional hostage issue 
greene also granted a house motion to quash poindexters 
subpoena for house staff member victor johnson who had said in a 
1986 memo that inquiring into oliver norths contrarelated 
activities would make a good political issue 
meanwhile poindexters lawyers disclosed that they plan to call 
sen john chafee rri as a character witness for poindexter 
poindexter a retired rear admiral served under chafee when the 
senator was secretary of the navy in the nixon administration 
chafee will testify tuesday his office confirmed 
poindexter is accused of concealing from congress the us role 
in a 1985 shipment of hawk missiles to iran and norths military 
assistance to the contras 
defense attorney richard beckler said he wanted jacobsen to 
testify about a conversation with poindexter which occurred on 
nov 21 1986 that is the day poindexter is accused of obstructing 
congress and making false statements about the iran initiative 
beckler said jacobsen could testify about conveying to 
poindexter serious concern that any inaccurate information about 
the iran initiative could result in harm to the hostages 
as for the house staff member johnson had said in a memo to 
rep ronald coleman dtexas that delving into norths contra 
activities places the administration in a coverup posture 
coleman introduced a resolution of inquiry into norths activities 
greene said whether there was political motivation for the 
resolution of inquiry is irrelevant to the criminal case against 
the former national security adviser 
in testimony earlier monday a former national security council 
employee said poindexter told thenpresident reagan the us 
government had no connection to a contra resupply plane that 
crashed in nicaragua 
poindexter made the statement to reagan on oct 7 1986 two 
days after the plane carrying ammunition was shot down and one of 
its crewmen eugene hasenfus was captured rodney mcdaniel 
testified 
actually the hasenfus flight was part of the network overseen 
by north to keep the contras armed during a congressional ban on 
us military aid to the rebel force 
the iran initiative resulted in the release of three hostages 
jacobsen the rev benjamin weir and the rev lawrence martin jenco 
though three other us citizens were seized in lebanon during 
the period of the releases in 1985 and 1986

a distributor of sexually oriented videotapes 
accused the justice department on monday of abusing its powers by 
trying to force the company to choose between prosecution or going 
out of business 
phe inc which does business as adam amp eve contends that the 
justice department was trying to force it to stop distributing 
sexually oriented expressive material that officials have 
acknowledged is not legally obscene 
justice department officials have abused their prosecutorial 
powers in a deliberate effort to coerce plaintiffs to cease 
distribution of expressive materials defendants could not and 
would not prosecute as obscene said the complaint filed in us 
district court here 
the officials have varied the threats and pressures they have 
brought to bear on plaintiffs in order to coerce the 
selfcensorship of as broad a range of nonobscene expressive 
materials as plaintiffs can be coerced to forego 
the lawsuit seeks an injunction to bar the governments national 
obscenity enforcement unit from bringing federal charges for 
distributing books and videotapes 
the suit also seeks a court order barring the justice department 
from threatening to bring simultaneous multiple prosecutions 
around the country unless the company agrees to stop distributing 
the books and videotapes 
the lawsuit notes that in 1987 a statecourt jury in north 
carolina acquitted the company and owner philip d harvey of felony 
obscenity charges 
the company has been threatened with federal prosecution in 
north carolina utah and kentucky 
harvey said in a statement that the government is clearly 
targeting us as part of a political persecution campaign intended 
to pacify a tiny minority of intolerant rightwing extremists 
justice department spokesman doug tillett declined to comment on 
the lawsuit 
the action was filed a day before karl brussel and his pak 
ventures inc were set to go to trial in nearby alexandria va on 
federal obscenity distribution charges 
brussel faces similar federal charges in north carolina and in 
two different federal jurisdictions in alabama 
the charges have drawn criticism from freespeech advocates who 
have accused the justice department of trying to bludgeon 
mailorder companies into going out of business rather than pay 
high legal bills 
in 1988 a federal judge barred the justice department from 
prosecuting mailorder operator avram freedburg in more than one 
federal jurisdiction 
us district judge thomas penfield jackson held that such 
multiple prosecutions cannot possibly be consistent with due 
process 
to settle the dispute freedbergs company consumers marketing 
group ltd of stamford conn agreed to plead guilty to mailing 
obscene matter pay a 600000 fine and stop distributing sexually 
oriented material

army tanks pulled back and schools 
reopened monday in this northern translyvanian city which has been 
the scene of deadly street battles between ethnic hungarians and 
romanians

the two groups were reported in the region monday no casualties 
were reported 
in addition several hundred troops and policemen remained 
around tirgu mures a picturesque transylvanian town of 170000 
people

battles last week between extremists from both communities at 
least six people were killed and about 300 were injured according

peace here will last a romanian high school student told the 
associated press 
in a statement monday however the provisional committee of the 
democratic union of hungarians in romania an ethnic hungarian 
political party accused romanians of splashing paint on the statue 
of a 19th century hungarian hero 
the statue hero stands in the transylvanian town of zalau where 
occupying hungarian troops killed a group of romanians in 1940 
the hungarian statement described the purported attack on the 
statue as a profanity 
romanians who make up nearly 70 percent of transylvanias 75 
million people accuse ethnic hungarians of seeking to secede from 
romania and rejoin neighboring hungary 
hungary had ruled transylvania for centuries although romanians 
were in the majority however the region was ceded to romania in 
1918 at the close of world war i 
ethnic hungarians deny they want to secede they say they only 
want more cultural autonomy 
the conflict has come to the surface in recent weeks in the 
atmosphere of freer expression that has prevailed since the 
december revolution ousted hardline communist dictator nicolae

townships and at least two blacks were killed witnesses said

association said two to eight were killed those stations did not 
cite their sources and police said a more detailed statement

congress for attacks the night before on town offices in soweto and 
a power station in johannesburg the attacks came less than three 
weeks before the antiapartheid anc is scheduled to begin 
negotiations with the whiteminority government 
police said they used birdshot rubber bullets and tear gas to 
disperse several thousand demonstrators in sharpeville and 
sebokeng townships about six miles apart 
in sebokeng the protesters stoned a police station and set fire 
to the municipal buildings police said 
police are coming on constant attack mainly by

fire raced through a bronx social club snuffing 
out lives in a rush of flame and toxic smoke the mayor horrified 
at the carnage formed a task force to close down the citys 
illegal nightspots 
that was a year and a half ago 
sunday the nightmare returned in an even crueler incarnation 
instead of six people 87 were now dead in a crowded club the 
citys crackdown had failed and given continued failure experts 
said monday many more may die 
these places are fire traps theyre supermarkets of crime 
theyre in violation of every code imaginable said state sen 
jeremy weinstein a brooklyn democrat who led an investigation of 
illegal social clubs in 1981 
its not just the city of new york its true for every city 
in the country he said in an interview its something every 
urban area has had to deal with in the last decade and none has 
been dealing with it 
indeed despite a renewed crackdown announced monday it 
wouldnt shock me if this happened again said charles ryan an 
exfire captain and now fire science department chairman at john 
jay college of criminal justice these places reopen as fast as 
they shut em down 
the problem is not a new one in 1942 491 people lost their 
lives at bostons cocoanut grove club in the nations worst fire 
ever like the happy land social club site of sundays fire the 
cocoanut grove was overcrowded at the time of the blaze and lacked 
adequate exits for patrons 
that fire led to new national fire codes for emergency exits 
lighting and other factors that could contribute to a blaze 
ryan and others said the simple problem is in enforcing such 
laws but it also is more complex than that they said a 
combination of the citys enormous problems shrinking budget and 
paralyzing bureaucracy 
and there is another equally daunting factor tremendous demand 
for the illegal but inexpensive clubs particularly in poor 
immigrant communities where life is difficult diversions are 
scarce and danger is a commonplace 
people who are living in tough conditions of life are going to 
look for opportunities to blow off some steam said prof william 
kornblum director of the social research center at the city 
university of new yorks graduate school theyre going to pay 
less attention to the dangers around them 
the hazards can be legion at the happy land club authorities 
say there was no open fire exit no firstfloor sprinkler system 
no proper emergency lights and bars on the sole window 
the only way out was through the front door it was blocked by 
flames allegedly ignited by an arsonist sixtyone men and 26 
women died 
the deaths are all the more tragic for the citys failed effort 
to shut down the happy land the task force formed by mayor edward 
i koch in 1988 won an order that year that it be closed 
apparently it was for a time and at some point unknown to the 
authorities it reopened 
most horrifying is that this should never have happened 
said mayor david dinkins that club had been inspected it had 
been cited and it had been ordered closed he immediately 
launched another crackdown with police posting vacate orders on 
187 social clubs sunday night 
but those orders dont solve the problem said ryan issuing a 
piece of paper and saying youre closed doesnt mean anything 
unless you come around and whack the guy on the head 
with 2031 inspections by the task force last year 
identification of illegal clubs has been adequate ryan said 
its the followup thats weak he said thats the nut of 
the problem inadequate enforcement 
fuller enforcement would require substantial manpower the 
police estimate there are 1220 social clubs in the city with 
about 1000 listed as inactive but happy land was one of those 
inactive clubs 
kornblum guessed the city in fact has 500 to 600 operating 
social clubs some legal many not with more in nearby suburbs 
it is true that complete enforcement is futile the clubs are 
always moving to new locations always trying to stay a step or two 
ahead of the authorities kornblum said but he said aggressive 
followup could save lives if the city provided the resources 
there are other approaches as well with a view of social clubs 
as cultural centers kornblum suggested lowinterest city loans for 
legally operated clubs that could take the place of illegal dives 
ryan for his part suggested cracking down on the liquor 
merchants who keep the clubs supplied and possibly placing a legal 
limit on retail liquor sales weinstein said he would investigate 
the idea 
yet weinstein noted that little of this is new in 1981 his 
panels report on illegal social clubs included this warning the 
potential fire hazard alone is of such proportion that numerous 
lives could be lost at any time no matter how minor the fire was at 
the outset 
how ironic that after so many years were still back where we 
started he said now a lot of people are going to be up in 
arms over this and then eventually its going to fade until it 
happens again

hondurans jammed phone lines monday 
seeking news of relatives in new york city following a weekend fire 
that killed 87 people at a bronx social club 
the government expressed regret over the death of the victims 
most of them hondurans and dominicans and instructed its 
ambassador to gather information for relatives 
gov dylia chirinos de diaz said most of the hondurans were from 
coastal towns in colon province 
the majority of them traveled to the united states in search 
of a better way of life said edith fajardo a honduran consular 
official in new york 
foreign ministry spokesman eugenio castro said the government 
was studying the possibility of sending a honduran air force plane 
to bring back the bodies of the victims of the fire at the happy 
land social club 
julio cesar castro of the northwestern city of san pedro sula 
said his 17yearold daughter janeta mercedes castro died in the 
early morning blaze 
my daughter traveled to new york in search of better horizons 
to save money and then return to her home in honduras but she only 
found death he said 
she had been in new york for two years and was a maid for an 
american family castro said he said she leaves a 2yearold son 
who lives with him 
a cuban man thrown out of the club after quarreling with his 
exgirlfriend was arraigned monday on arson and murder charges 
hondurans seeking information on victims and the welfare of 
relatives crowded into telephone offices in colon province 
radio stations broadcast almost continual news of the fire and

womens groups and political opponents continued 
to heap criticism monday on republican gubernatorial candidate 
clayton williams who joked at a weekend campfire that women should 
relax and enjoy rape 
i dont care if it was made around the campfire a living room 
or a formal speech state treasurer ann richards said it 
indicates a level of thinking that is an embarrassment 
richards could face williams in the november election if she 
wins a democratic runoff against attorney general jim mattox on 
april 10 
williams who has since apologized told reporters on a cattle 
roundup at his alpine ranch saturday that the bad weather they were 
experiencing was a lot like rape 
if its inevitable just relax and enjoy it he said 
he said he had been joking but conceded later that the remark 
was inappropriate 
i feel just terrible about this i had no intention in my 
heart to hurt anyone especially those women who have been 
traumatized by rape said williams in a statement released by the 
staff sunday 
looking back i realize it was insensitive and had no place at 
the campfire or in any setting 
the texas chapter of the national organization for women issued 
a statement monday calling the remark degrading and not 
acceptable for someone who wishes to govern a society where all 
human beings can live and function in safety 
williams campaign spokesman bill kenyon said damage to the 
williams campaign may be shortlived 
we had probably 30 or so calls yesterday that were most of 
them rather harsh in tone kenyon said after the apology that 
clayton put out yesterday most of the calls today have been more 
sympathetic or not the same kind of tone 
he said williams apology will work in his favor because 
people know that clayton williams doesnt have a mean bone in his 
body 
earlier however mattox called the remark in character for 
williams 
it is within his character and it is within the way he 
normally deals with people and traditions and institutions 
mattox said sunday 
state gop leaders said the controversy would be a lesson to 
williams a millionaire rancher and businessman making his first 
political race 
he should not have joked about it that way said state sen 
cyndi krier of san antonio 
claytie is new to public life and hes learning some lessons 
along the way said beverly kaufman first vice president of the 
texas federation of republican women 
he used an archaic expression to say lets make the best of 
an unpleasant situation she said adding she could understand 
why some people would take offense

some law enforcement officials have long 
doubted that raymond j junior patriarca was a strong enough 
leader to take the helm of the crime family his father had ruled 
with an iron fist since prohibition 
but others say his lowkey demeanor was deceptive 
patriarca 45 inherited control of the new england mob on the 
death of his father raymond patriarca sr from a heart attack in 
1984 authorities say 
a fiveyear fbi investigation culminated monday in a 113page 
indictment naming patriarca and 20 alleged mobsters on charges 
ranging from murder and racketeering to kidnapping drug 
trafficking and gambling 
he was so much different than his father said providence 
police cmdr richard s tamburini who formerly headed the citys 
intelligence bureau he was so lowkey and very difficult to 
locate his father on the other hand was out in the open 
a lot of people would not accept that junior was running the 
mob he said i think that should put this to rest 
but north kingstowns police chief john leyden who also tracked 
the mob as a providence detective said he suspects much of the 
respect is for the no 2 person nicky bianco 
patriarca and his alleged underboss nicholas bianco were among 
15 of the 21 brought into custody monday afternoon 
at a hearing before a us magistrate in providence lawyer john 
cicilline said patriarca was suffering from cataracts and cancer 
patriarca was ordered transferred to boston where he was detained 
pending an april 6 hearing 
the patriarca familys alleged involvement in organizedcrime 
activities remains strong but its influence waned as its 
membership dwindled over the last decade both tamburini and leyden 
said 
the elder patriarca became the citys public enemy number 
one during prohibition in the 1920s and early 1930s by the 
1970s he had been arrested more than 40 times convicted of 18 
crimes ranging from armed robbery and conspiracy to murder and had 
served seven years in prison 
he was identified as head of the new england la cosa nostra 
during 1969 us senate committee hearings according to 
transcripts of conversations picked up by an illegally hidden fbi 
microphone he recruited bianco in the early 1960s to be an 
enforcer and mediator between new york gangs 
the family operated from a vending machine company and a 
cleaning business in the predominantly italian federal hill 
neighborhood one resident who attended his funeral said patriarca 
protected the hill there never was any trouble on the hill 
now there will be trouble 
the fbi transcripts also revealed a father who wanted his only 
son to be a lawyer or successful businessman but who was 
frustrated that the boy twice had flunked out of the university of 
rhode island 
tamburini said the younger patriarca has been deeply involved in 
his fathers business since at least 1980 when the crime boss ran 
into serious legal and health problems 
the ailing patriarca was indicted in september 1981 on charges 
of taking part in a scheme to skim 11 million from the laborers 
international union but a federal magistrate found him too ill to 
stand trial on the racketeering charges in florida 
aside from investing in a delicatessen that displayed 
photographs of gangsters on the walls raymond junior stayed in the 
background authorities said 
when his father was alive you wouldnt see him very much 
leyden said it was only during his fathers trial that you saw 
him 
his chief rival for control of the new england mob was gennaro 
j angiulo of boston who once was heard on an fbi tape saying of 
the then 40yearold patriarca i cant see the kid stepping into 
the picture for the simple reason he is too young 
but law enforcement officials said patriarcas hold was 
strengthened when angiulo was arrested on racketeering charges 
patriarca was arrested only once in 1971 on charges of 
receiving stolen bundles of fiberglass and the charges were 
dropped when two witnesses refused to testify 
he grew up on providences affluent east side but in recent 
years retreated to his home in lincoln ri where he spent much 
of his time working on realestate developments authorities said 
patriarca retreated further into the background after reputed 
underboss william p grasso was found shot last june near hartford 
conn said law enforcement officials who speculated an internal 
power tussle 
theyre in chaos now because of a lack of trust tamburini 
said

families of murder victims from across 
massachusetts gathered monday to open the headquarters of a victims 
support group named for a high school student who was stabbed to 
death by willie horton in 1974 
the ordeal my family has endured has brought us together with 
other families of murder victims donna fournier cuomo said in 
opening the joey fournier victim services office across from the 
statehouse 
the group provides free counseling to relatives of murder 
victims and plans to lobby for legislation to change the criminal 
justice system 
cuomo the groups founder and executive director was 
fourniers sister fournier a 17yearold vocational high school 
student was stabbed stuffed in a trash can and left to die by 
horton 
the case of horton who escaped while on furlough from prison 
and attacked a maryland couple became a highly publicized issue 
during the 1988 presidential campaign thencandidate george bush 
used it to criticize gov michael s dukakis record on crime 
joey fournier victim services already offers counseling in 
lawrence in the northeastern section of the state where fournier 
grew up and wants to open centers in other sections of 
massachusetts 
about 20 to 30 people attended mondays opening including duane 
and phyllis hotchkiss of saugus whose 19yearold son brian was 
slain in 1989 in lynn 
im determined that our sons death is not going to be in 
vain said hotchkiss who donated 100 to the group the group 
needs to raise another 100000 said cuomo who would not say how 
much has been raised 
counseling ordinarily costs about 100 a session but not 
everybody can afford it and not all health insurance plans cover 
it said cuomo 
cuomos voice wavered as she read the names of victims whose 
families were present 
one tragic result of violent crime is the lasting effect it 
has on the victims family i know my family will never be the 
same said cuomo who is no relation to new york gov mario cuomo 
in addition to offering counseling the headquarters will serve 
as the center for a coalition of victim support groups including 
parents of murdered children the young adult sibling group and 
victims for victims 
the joey fournier group has already introduced bills to repeal 
the states criminal records law which shields criminal records 
from public scrutiny 
the organization also has submitted legislation to limit the 
governors powers to commute sentences and another measure to 
require truth in sentencing so that convicted criminals will 
actually serve the time of their sentence

the agriculture department is proposing a 
federal milk marketing order to include north carolina and south 
carolina officials said monday 
daniel d haley administrator of the departments agricultural 
marketing service said the recommendation was based on hearings 
held last year he said order would require the approval of milk 
producers before it could take effect 
haley said the marketing order which would set minimum prices 
bottlers would have to pay dairy farmers for their milk is 
necessary to ensure an adequate supply of milk for consumers in the 
two states 
the primary milk consumption areas include charlotte 
greensboro winstonsalem raleigh durham asheville and 
fayetteville in north carolina and columbia charleston and 
greenville in south carolina 
haley said the federal marketing order would resolve milk supply 
problems in these states north carolina regulates its milk 
production under a state marketing order and south carolina has no 
milk marketing regulations he said 
a federal order will match supply and demand for the entire 
area with special circumstances spelled out to deal with the uses 
of milk in oversupply and to encourage delivery of milk to 
bottling plants in undersupply haley said 
federal milk marketing orders do not set retail prices paid by 
consumers for milk he said however the orders do affect 
consumers by assuring a balance between supply and demand for milk 
and by setting minimum prices that bottlers much pay farmers 
public comments on the proposal can be sent by april 27 to 
hearing clerk room 1083s usda washington dc 20250

albania has opened direct telephone service with the 
west lifting some of the restrictions that have made it one of the 
worlds most isolated countries 
an employee of the albanian telegraph agency in tirana 
albanias capital said direct telephone service between albania 
and some western countries began march 20 the operator was reached 
by directdial call from rome on monday 
the employee who did not give his name said 56 countries have 
directdial links with albania including the united states 
canada britain and france 
the operator said it was possible to call albania directly from 
france canada and britain and vice versa the operator said 
albanians may call the united states when asked if calls could be 
placed to albania from the united states the operator said i 
think so 
but attempts to do so monday were unsuccessful and rich 
wallerstein of american telephone amp telegraph co said the service 
was not yet in place 
beginning this past weekend it became possible for albanians 
to direct dial into the united states but we do not as yet have 
service from the united states to albania he said 
wallerstein said the albanian telegraph agency and atampt had been 
discussing establishing service for some time 
the way it came to our attention was albanians were phoning 
relatives in the united states and people in the united states 
tried to phone back and couldnt get through he said 
albania a country of 32 million people is europes last 
bastion of stalinist isolation it has pursued orthodox 
marxistleninist policies since the communists took over in 1944 
but there have been increased signs of openings to the west 
under president ramiz alia who took over after the death of enver 
hoxha in 1985 
some western journalists have been allowed into albania in 
recent months they reported seeing apartment houses with homemade 
antennas to receive tv broadcasts from italy greece and yugoslavia 
alitalia italys flag airline started a weekly flight to 
albania last year olympic airways the greek airline also flies 
to albania 
the italian government signed a wideranging economic 
cooperation agreement with albania last year that will also involve 
the country in regional efforts to clean up the adriatic sea 
before americans can call albania financial and technical 
hurdles must be cleared wallerstein said us telephone companies 
must get paid a share for the calls placed to and from albania and 
a directdial system must be established 
albania currently places calls to western countries though 
relays in either greece or italy wallerstein said

a judge imposed a 131year prison sentence 
on a man convicted of raping sexually mutiliating and trying to 
kill a 7yearold boy a crime that triggered a statewide uproar 
over sex predators 
pierce county superior court judge thomas r sauriol gave earl 
shriner 40 three times the maximum standard term for the crime 
under state law 
the judge said shriner who has a 25year record of violence 
against young people should remain locked up until he dies he 
said that if shriner won time off for good behavior he would still 
have to serve more than 88 years there is no possibility of parole 
sauriol said the case left him more outraged and troubled than 
any in his 37year legal career 
i dont think that i have ever heard of a case that borders on 
extreme cruelty more than this one he told shriner the 
reality is mr shriner you present a danger to the defenseless 
shriner who is slightly retarded stood silent and motionless 
leaning forward slightly at the bar 
the victims mother helen harlow dabbing her eyes and 
comforted by friends said she was satisfied with the sentence 
shriner was convicted feb 7 of firstdegree attempted murder 
firstdegree assault and two counts of firstdegree rape in the may 
20 attack in woods near his and the boys homes 
the boy was raped and choked and his penis was cut off 
neighbors found the youngster naked bloody covered with mud 
and practically incoherent 
following sentencing defense attorney dino sepe gave notice he 
would appeal the penalty and the verdict 
defense attorneys said shriners sentence should have been 
within the standard range of 34 years to 43 years and 10 months 
sauriol gave shriner half the sentence prosecutors requested 
but deputy prosecutor barbara coreyboulet said the penalty 
served the purpose 
the judge also ordered shriner to pay 2500 toward the cost of 
his courtappointed attorneys and 1500 to a pierce county project 
to help child abuse victims 
the uproar that followed the attack led to legislative adoption 
of tougher penalties and controls on sexual predators including 
longer sentences civil commitment and registration of sex 
offenders harlow served on the goverors task force that drafted 
the law 
in sentencing shriner sauriol criticized other legislation that 
would have permitted a 75 percent reduction in prison terms for sex 
offenders who voluntarily submit to surgical castration 
the measure died in the state house of representatives after 
clearing the senate this year 
the judge said any legislator who votes for such a measure in 
the future would be defeated the following time he runs for 
office and he would deserve it 
harlow her voice breaking and fighting back tears told the 
judge the attack had shattered her and her sons lives and had 
continued to cause pain as the case came up repeatedly in news 
reports she said her son continues with his recovery which 
includes reconstructive surgery 
the boy who identified shriner in court as his attacker was 
not present 
shriner did not speak on his behalf but his brother john and 
mother dolores said his guilt had not been established and that 
mitigating or extenuating circumstances had been disregarded 
shriner was declared a defective delinquent in 1965 after 
choking a 7yearold girl the term now abandoned referred to 
violenceprone juveniles with emotional or mental problems 
he subsequently was confined at rainier school for the retarded 
western state hospital a mental institution and the washington 
corrections center where he served 10 years for assaulting two 
16yearold hitchhikers

the 87 people who died in a social club fire 
were martyrs to the quest for a better life just like 146 people 
killed exactly 79 years earlier in a fire in a city garment 
factory mayor david dinkins said monday 
dinkins told about 700 people at a memorial service for victims 
of the 1911 fire at the triangle shirtwaist co that both tragedies 
killed immigrants looking for improved living conditions in america 
with vicious irony yesterday on the 79th anniversary of the 
triangle shirtwaist fire history repeated itself the mayor said 
at the site of the earlier blaze 
on sunday the bodies of trapped revelers were found packed into 
the happy land social club in the bronx a cuban immigrant was 
charged with setting fire to the clubs only exit after he was 
thrown out 
authorities said the clubs patrons never had a chance to escape 
the blaze because the building did not follow fire codes it was 
the same lack of concern for people that caused such devastation at 
the triangle factory in greenwich village dinkins said 
so the lessons of the triangle shirtwaist fire are not 
something we commemorate today they are lessons that have been 
driven home for us all to learn once again dinkins said 
now the martyrs of march 25 1911 and the martyrs of march 
25 1990 are joined forever he said like the victims at the 
happy land social club most of those who died on this killing 
ground were immigrants to our shores 
they too came to america to find a dream instead they 
found misery exploitation and an agonizing death he said 
these 146 workers didnt have to die neither did the 87 people 
in the bronx 
later a fire truck ladder was raised up to the 10story 
buildings sixth floor the highest a fire ladder would go in those 
days as a fire bell was rung to mark the deaths a wreath of white 
roses was placed above pictures of the fire 
they died at this building because they were seen as surplus 
labor they died because they didnt speak english very well 
because they werent organized because no one spoke up for them or 
represented their interests and because their employer didnt care 
about them dinkins said 
in fact that very day in 1911 their boss went out late in 
the afternoon and locked all the workers of the triangle shirtwaist 
co inside just to make sure none of them tried to leave early 
while he did some shopping he said 
all 146 of them died painfully horribly just like the 87 who 
died yesterday the mayor added and all of them died 
unnecessarily just like the 87 who died yesterday 
he recalled though that the workers deaths inspired the labor 
movement and brought about lasting changes in laws to protect 
workers sweatshops have reemerged in recent years and it is 
necessary again to battle exploitation dinkins said 
and again there are those operating in the shadows running 
sweatshops and illegal social clubs and pursuing other schemes 
turning the lure and promise of america into a nightmare for those 
who seek to redeem the promise he said

a spiritual leader of two religious 
parties monday appeared to hurt the labor partys chances of 
forming a coalition government by saying labor had failed to keep 
israel on the path of judaism 
labor leaders had hoped rabbi eliezar menachem schach the 
spiritual mentor of the ultraorthodox degel hatorah and shas 
parties would in his televised speech break a deadlock in efforts 
by the leftleaning labor party to form a government 
but his speech at a meeting of degel hatorah members was largely 
a sermon on israels failures to stay on what he called the true 
path of the bible 
the labor party was the one who detached the jew from 
tradition schach 92 said but all of the others have also 
forgotten about their fathers we should not be drawn after bodies 
that have no link to judaism about 10000 men dressed in the 
traditional black garb of the ultraorthodox packed a basketball 
stadium in tel aviv to hear the lithuanianborn rabbi speak 
women were barred from the event but were able to follow on 
closedcircut broadcasts in the bnei brak religious suburb of tel 
aviv and jerusalem 
peres who claims to have the support of 60 of the 120 members 
of parliament needs the backing of one of the religious parties to 
rule the degel hatorah party has two seats and the shas party six 
before schach spoke the crowd sang hymns and swayed in religous 
prayer when he entered the stadium the crowd sang out may god 
add days to the life of the king 
schach criticized israel for holding onto the occupied 
territories 
territory doesnt guarantee existence he said 
schach known for his dovish views said he believed the left 
has historically distanced itself from judaism 
this paradoxically gives a boost to the rightwing likud bloc 
led by caretaker prime minister yitzhak shamir whose partys 
founding principles included keeping the occupied west bank and 
gaza strip 
degel hatorah legislator avraham ravitz echoed schachs 
criticism of labor and said he believed the spiritual leader backs 
likud 
we have to identify ourselves with those who identify more 
with us that means that for now we will probably support the likud 
and push them to support a national unity government ravitz told 
reporters 
a shas spiritual leader rabbi ovaida yosef also spoke at the 
degel hatorah meeting in a show of solidarity 
both our movements take the advice of rabbi schach our two 
movements go hand in hand god forbid if there should ever be 
conflict between us he said 
the comments by the religious leaders made the situation bleak 
for labor but moshe shahal a labor parliament member told israel 
television there was still room for political maneuvering 
president chaim herzog gave peres the task of forming a new 
coalition government on march 20 after labor brought down the 
likudled government with a noconfidence motion in parliament over 
shamirs refusal to accept us mideast peace proposals 
peres has 42 days left to form a government shamir monday 
repeated his belief that the labor leader would fail and said he 
would assemble a government when peres time runs out 
labor negotiators have been involved in a horsetrading with 
leftwing parties and religious parties and monday reached an 
agreement with the ultraorthodox agudat israel party to join a 
laborled coaltion israel radio said 
agudat israel with five seats in parliament still must receive 
the approval of its council of torah sages before it can sign the 
agreement the radio said 
agugat israel legislator moshe feldman said the council could 
decide to make approval conditional on another religious party 
joining a laborled government

the bush administration on monday opposed 
soviet military occupation of three buildings in the capital of 
lithuania but said moscows actions so far dont threaten junes 
ussoviet summit 
the occupation of communist party buildings in vilnius is a 
kind of force and were opposed to any kind of use of force said 
presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
he said that tensions in the secessionist republic seem to 
have escalated on a daily basis building occupation is a 
significant event in this sense 
nonetheless fitzwater said the soviets themselves have 
publicly and privately assured us that they have no intentions of 
using military force to resolve the issue 
addressing the summit planned in june between president bush and 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev fitzwater said 
were prepared to have the summit at that time were still 
hopeful this can be resolved 
on the subject of recent soviet noforce assurances fitzwater 
said that moscows promises were reiterated on friday during a 
state department meeting between deputy secretary of state lawrence 
eagleburger and soviet ambassador yuri v dubinin 
dubinin earlier in the week had offered similar assurances to 
national security adviser brent scowcroft the white house said 
state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler said secretary of 
state james a baker iii sent a private message to soviet foreign 
minister eduard a shevardnadze over the weekend regarding the 
situation in lithuania 
tutwiler said a meeting on tap next week between baker and 
shevardnadze was still planned 
sen edward m kennedy the massachusetts democrat visiting the 
soviet union said monday that gorbachev had told him there are no 
plans to use force to bring lithuania back into the soviet fold 
after meeting with gorbachev for 1 hours kennedy said the 
soviet leader indicated to me that the position of the soviet 
union was that there would be no use of force unless the lives of 
others were threatened and that he was committed to a peaceful 
resolution 
in an interview with national public radio lithuanian president 
vytautas landsbergis said the situation had become very 
dangerous in the light of gorbachevs reported remarks to kennedy 
before he always said that he would not use force in 
lithuania but now we have a situation where hes qualifying that 
statement and setting a condition under which he could use force 
the only danger to the lives and health of the residents of 
lithuania is the presence of soviet army troops themselves 
landsbergis said 
soviet soldiers took over two schools in vilnius on sunday the 
higher party school and the institute of marxismleninism 
lithuanian officials said there also were soldiers at the vilnius 
communist party headquarters 
lithuanian officials on monday said tensions had eased somewhat 
after they met with soviet military officers on the action 
fitzwater said the negotiations between the military and 
lithuanian authorities were a good sign 
but thats far from resolving the total issue he added 
we believe its important to continue to maintain our position 
and forcefully state our interest in this matter on a continuing 
basis 
he said the building occupations were under the general 
framework of the pattern of intimidation that we have objected to 
in the past 
we object to a pattern of intimidation he added 
it is incumbent that both sides maintain open communication 
and not take any actions that can be misinterpreted fitzwater 
said reading a statement at the beginning of mondays daily news 
briefing 
further actions will not lead to a lessening of the tensions 
and could have adverse international repercussions and could be 
counterproductive for ussoviet relations he said 
the soviet union considers lithuanias march 11 declaration of 
independence illegal the united states has never recognized the 
baltic states incorporation into the soviet union in 1940 
while urging support for the selfdetermination rights of 
lithuanians the administration has not opened formal diplomatic 
relations with vilnius citing lithuanians inability to exercise 
any real control over its borders or its destiny

the nations most influential shiite 
moslem cleric believes elements of a solution exist in the 
dispute over western hostages in lebanon a newspaper reported 
monday 
sheik mohammed hussein fadlallah spiritual guide for the 
iranianbacked hezbollah said there was no truth to reports he was 
asked to help resolve the hostage crisis 
most of the 18 western hostages in lebanon are believed held by 
groups linked to hezbollah or party of god 
there are positive elements within the context of what we 
detect through media reports in more than one place that suggest 
elements of a solution exist in the hostage crisis fadlallah 
said in an interview with the prosyrian ashsharq newspaper 
asked whether he was contacted about the hostages by jimmy 
carter during the former us presidents recent middle east peace 
mission fadlallah said 
there is no connection at all because i am not involved 
directly or indirectly in the core of the problem 
but i always try to raise responsible words with which i 
address those concerned with this issue in order that this case be 
closed once and for all he said 
fadlallah traveled to damascus during carters visit to the 
syrian capital earlier this month but diplomatic sources said the 
two did not meet 
fadlallahs remarks came four days after his press office quoted 
the cleric as saying in a radio interview when asked about the 
possibility of a hostage release 
a new situation has emerged but i dont know when how or 
where the statement did not elaborate 
fadlallahs remarks heightened speculation there was movement in 
efforts to secure the release of the eight americans four britons 
two west germans two swiss an irishman and an italian held 
hostage 
longest held is terry anderson chief middle east correspondent 
for the associated press kidnapped in beirut on march 16 1985 
several other captives have been held almost as long 
repeated statements from iranian and lebanese officials as well 
as recent editorials in tehran newspapers have fueled speculation a 
release was near 
in an editorial sunday the englishlanguage tehran times said 
iran will of course use its good offices with the lebanese groups 
to facilitate the release of western hostages 
the tehran times which often reflects the thinking of iranian 
president hashemi rafsanjani sparked speculation about a possible 
release when it said last month 1990 can and will be the last 
year of captivity for these hostages 
moderates led by rafsanjani have said the issue is moving toward 
a solution but his hardline opponents contradict that irans 
former hardline interior minister ali akbar mohtashemi argued 
against the hostages release in a signed editorial in a tehran 
newspaper this month 
mohtashemi helped found hezbollah in 1983 and is believed to 
have more clout with the kidnappers than rafsanjani

the man accused of setting fire to the happy 
land social club was arraigned monday on charges of murdering 87 
people and police said he told them the devil got into me 
authorities began shutting other illegal clubs in response to 
new york citys worst fire in 79 years 
the families of the 87 victims most of whom were honduran or 
dominican immigrants sought solace in their grief and a 
government task force was set up to counsel them and help make 
funeral arrangements 
julio gonzalez 36 was accused of setting the fire early sunday 
with 1 worth of gasoline after arguing with a former girlfriend 
who worked at the illegal club he is said to have threatened to 
shut this place down 
i got angry the devil got into me and i set the place on 
fire gonzalez told authorities according to a police source who 
spoke to the associated press on condition of anonymity 
during a hearing at bronx county criminal court gonzalez was 
charged with 87 counts of murder committed during the course of 
arson 87 counts of murder by depraved indifference to human life 
one count of attempted murder and two counts of arson 
the case was turned over to a grand jury and gonzalez will not 
be asked to enter a plea unless an indictment is issued he was 
held under a suicide watch at the rikers island jail and later 
admitted to kings county hospital psychiatric ward where he will 
be held indefinitely said ruby ryles a city jails spokeswoman 
the deaths were believed to be the most ever charged to a single 
suspect in the continental united states 
he is a double animal said rene j mena 63 whose son 
rene jr 30 died here theyre going to have good food for 
him a book a movie in central america we dont do it that way 
district attorney robert t johnson said he hoped that if 
gonzalez is convicted he would get consecutive prison sentences 
amounting to 2000 years 
an equally angry mayor david dinkins ordered a sweep of other 
suspected unlicensed social clubs police and a special task force 
visited 241 clubs citywide from midnight to 7 am monday and 
posted vacate orders on 187 
only 23 of the clubs were open most are closed on sunday 
nights there were 52 safety violations and 30 summonses issued 
said sgt dick vreeland a police spokesman 
in the east tremont section of the bronx families drifted in 
and out of public school 67 across from the fireblackened club a 
task force of state city and private agencies there helped them 
make funeral arrangements and offered counseling and financial 
assistance 
its orderly but its not emotionally orderly said ken 
curtin a local red cross disaster relief director its highly 
charged there are a lot of outbursts of grief 
in honduras a foreign ministry spokesman said the government 
is deeply moved by the deaths of many countrymen in new york 
the honduran telephone company said it was swamped with calls from 
people seeking word about loved ones 
the fire broke out at 340 am sunday and those inside the 
club suffocated burned or were trampled to death in a matter of 
minutes 
they had to choose between a wall of fire or retreating and 
dying of asphyxiation johnson said 
police believe five people escaped from the fire three patrons 
gonzalezs former girlfriend lydia feliciano and the club disc 
jockey 
the disc jockey identified in published reports as ruben 
valladares was listed as stable at jacobi hospital with burns over 
30 percent of his body said hospital spokeswoman vicki ciampa 
ms feliciano and the others whose names were withheld escaped 
serious injury ms feliciano is in protective custody 
johnson said gonzalez had been ejected from the club after 
arguing with ms feliciano and threatening to shut this place 
down 
he allegedly bought 1 worth of gasoline at a nearby service 
station then returned and faked making a telephone call when he 
saw a possible witness when that person left he allegedly poured 
gasoline between the street and an inside door of the club and 
ignited it 
after that johnson said he watched it burn for a while making 
statements to at least two witnesses about his role in the fire he 
then went home where police found him a few hours later he made a 
videotaped admission to police authorities said 
johnson said gonzalez knew the twostory club lacked windows 
rear exits and adequate staircases he also knew how crowded it 
was authorities said 
gonzalez who came to the united states from cuba on the 1980 
mariel boatlift had no arrest record here johnson said 
johnson said he has the name of a possible club owner but will 
not release it until its confirmed a vacate order was issued in 
november 1988 and again a year later because happy land lacked a 
proper sprinkler system exits emergency lighting and signs it 
also had no liquor or cabaret license the mayor said 
the fire struck on the 79th anniversary of the triangle 
shirtwaist co fire that 1911 tragedy claimed 146 lives many of 
them immigrant garment workers leading to nationwide reforms in 
workplace safety 
dinkins discussed night club tragedy while addressing 700 
garment workers and other union members who gathered monday in 
lower manhattan to commemorate the triangle fire 
they came to america in search of a better life early 
yesterday morning their american dream became a fatal nightmare 
said dinkins who inspected the scene of sundays fire 
the sight of those bodies lined along the walls like so many 
wax figures and the realization of the panic and the pain they 
must have suffered in their last moments will remain with me for 
the rest of my life said dinkins most horrifying is that this 
should never have happened 
roman catholic cardinal john j oconnor officiated at an 
hourlong english and spanish prayer service outside the club on 
monday afternoon a thousand mourners began the service by walking 
a few blocks from st thomas aquinas church the parish of many of 
the victims 
we pray for those who died said oconnor we pray in a 
special way for those who survived we need to pray for the dead 
and for the survivors our best is never good enough in 
circumstances of this sort

a court monday began trying 25 
residents of a south pacific atoll who are accused of torturing to 
death six islanders in a hunt for demons and sorcerers 
testimony in the trial described as the largest ever in french 
polynesia is expected to focus on how a small number of people 
could terrorize a larger group in the name of religion 
archbishop michel coppenrath the roman catholic leader in 
french polynesia said the case involves simply a religious 
perversion due to an abuse of trust and a lack of authority on the 
island 
the defendants representing about an eighth of the population 
of the south pacific atoll of faaite are accused of murder 
inciting violence and other offenses during two horrorfilled days 
in 1987 
according to investigators three women came to the atoll in 
august 1987 from tahiti 310 miles to the west the trio claimed to 
be faithhealers connected to the roman catholicaffiliated 
movement charismatic renewal founded in the united states in 1967 
and active throughout much of polynesia 
however coppenrath who spent 15 days on faaite counseling 
families after the killings said the women were not authentic 
representatives of charismatic renewal 
the women were regarded as priestesses by the islanders and 
gained enormous influence investigators said faaites mayor was 
away and there were no police or religious authorities posted 
there 
at one point the women ordered a crippled man to get up and 
walk when he failed they said demons were interfering with their 
work investigators said 
the women instructed the islanders to repent of their sins and 
departed within a few weeks 
however they left behind a dozen youthful disciples who divined 
on sept 2 that the assistant mayor iaone harris was possessed by 
demons 
the disciples held hallucinatory seances in the tiny church and 
repeatedly dunked the official in sea water to purify him 
investigators say they say he died allegedly after severe 
beatings and the disciples burned his body at the church 
his death set off a twoday hunt for sorcerers conducted by half 
the islanders against the others investigators said three more 
men and two women were burned alive included a mentally disturbed 
man and a mother who pleaded for the life of her son 
ten children of the atoll were orphaned by the violence 
four more executions planned for sept 4 were thwarted when 
frightened islanders established telephone contact with officials 
in papeete the french polynesia capital 
the mayor a priest and a police unit arrived and suppressed the 
witch hunt many of the suspects interrogated by police professed 
to be upholding the christian faith 
the proceeding before the tribunal in papeete will feature 15 
islanders testifying against 25 neighbors the jury is expected to 
have a verdict after two weeks testimony

cigarette prices would rise to 5 a 
pack tobacco advertising would be banned and minors would be 
barred from buying cigarettes under a proposal submitted to the 
government monday 
everyone should have the right to a smokefree environment said 
an accompanying report the first government study on smoking since 
1973 
its recommendations would give sweden along with norway and 
finland one of the worlds toughest antismoking laws 
the swedish tobacco industry said it would suffer from an 
advertising ban and lose out to foreign brands 
a bunch of wellpaid tobaccohating bureaucrats spent a year 
on nice trips and came up with nothing sensible klaus unger 
chairman of swedish tobacco co was quoted as saying by the 
expressen newspaper 
smokepeace a lobby against laws that would further limit 
smokers rights said the recommendations would give hardpressed 
supermarket cashiers the duties of policemen 
some of the proposals already adopted by other countries 
proved ineffective in stopping youngsters from smoking the lobby 
said 
the report submitted to social affairs minister ingela thalen 
is the first stage of the legislative process that could take 
several months it must be submitted for comment to various 
interested parties including the tobacco industry and may undergo 
major revisions before it becomes law 
the report recommended a 15milligram limit on tar in 
cigarettes that would effectively ban 36 popular brands now on 
sale in sweden including 26 imported brands finland already has a 
similar ban and the report said the european community will adopt 
the limit in 1993 
roland perlstrom speaking for the industry said the proposal 
was unnecessary because smokers are switching to lowtar 
cigarettes which already have 60 percent of the market 
under the proposal cigarette prices would rise 50 percent to 5 
hotels would be required to forbid smoking in half their rooms 
and restaurants with more than 50 seats would have to have 
nonsmoking areas at work places smoking would be allowed in 
designated areas or in offices only if the smoke did not spread to 
smokefree zones 
after what we know about the damaging effects of tobacco the 
use of tobacco cannot be regarded and treated as a harmless habit 
or a private matter any more the report said

bodies that was about a month after illiano learned of the threat 
he said outside court

solution he said i just couldnt support them anymore and i 
didnt want them to go into poverty also at this time i know that 
they would all be christians i couldnt be sure of that in the 
future as the children grow up 
he signed it with my sincere sympathies john e list 
superior court judge william le wertheimer is expected to

group member out of concern for patricia list 
with one fluid movement i opened the window and entered the

friends of patricia list 
it was at that time i saw what appeared to be four bodies

the home

the pilot of avianca flight 52 was aware 
that he was low on gas but appeared inattentive to the problem 
and seemed to take little action in communicating it to air 
controllers a source told the associated press monday 
the flights copilot and flight engineer also took no bold 
steps to alert the captain or controllers to the fuel emergency a 
source close to the investigation said he spoke on the condition 
of anonymity 
the findings were based on conversations recorded in the cockpit 
of the colombian flight during the 30 minutes before it crashed 
into a hillside in cove neck long island jan 25 killing 73 of 
the 159 aboard 
the transcripts which were to be released tuesday by the 
national transportation safety board indicated that the lack of 
communication among the cockpit crew contributed to the crash 
the boeing 707 from bogota and medellin colombia crashed in 
fog and rain on final approach just northeast of john f kennedy 
international airport 
investigators believe the plane crashed because it ran out of 
fuel 
they are not certain why the crew members failed to make it 
clear to air traffic controllers how urgent their fuel shortage had 
become 
the recorded conversations indicate that the crew mostly in 
spanish discussed the dwindling fuel supply among themselves 
the transcripts appear to show a pilot who did not seem to be in 
full charge of the situation the source said and who did not give 
specific essential direction to the copilot to declare an 
emergency 
they also showed a copilot who had just 2 years of experience 
flying into jfk and appeared reluctant to assert himself the 
source said 
the flight engineer had several years experience but also 
seemed to be hesitant to speak up although he appeared to be 
subtly trying to remind the pilot of the fuel shortage the source 
said 
all three crew members died in the crash 
after aborting his first approach the captain a 17year 
veteran pilot asked the copilot if he had told air traffic 
controllers that they had an emergency 
the copilot who handled most of the communications with 
controllers did answered i told them were low on fuel 
the captain according to the transcripts did not respond to 
the copilot nor did he followup by instructing the copilot to 
tell air traffic control that they had an emergency 
after the aborted approach the crew accepted without 
challenge a new route for a second approach that looped over the 
long island sound 
at that point investigators have said the pilot and crew made 
a deadly mistake 
they should have made it clear to controllers that they needed 
to come straight in for a landing even a straight in landing 
where the plane would have needed to make a tight loop would have 
used six or seven minutes of fuel 
from the misapproach to fuel burnout the plane took a little 
over eight minutes 
the avianca crash seems to be strikingly similar to the crash of 
united airlines dc8 in portland oregon in december 1978 both 
were due to fuel exhaustion 
the ntsb determined that the probable cause of the united 
airlines accident was the failure of the captain to monitor 
properly the aircrafts fuel state and to properly respond to the 
low fuel state according to a ntsb report on the accident 
the board found that the united pilots inattention resulted 
from preoccupation with a landing gear malfunction 
contributing to the portland accident the report stated was 
the failure of the other two flight crew members either to fully 
comprehend the criticality of the fuel state or to successfully 
communicate their concern to the pilot 
the ntsb investigation of the avianca accident is said to be 
focusing on the coordination and communications among the pilot 
copilot and flight engineer 
a report on the probable cause of the avianca accident is 
expected in about 10 months 
mike benson a spokesman for the ntsb and fred farrar a 
spokesman for the federal aviation administration were not in 
their offices when phoned late monday afternoon and did not 
immediately return calls for comment

pan am customers including a couple 
whose daughter died in the bombing of flight 103 sued the airline 
monday claiming it collected surcharges for a security system that 
was never developed 
the lawsuit charged that millions of pan am passengers between 
1986 and 1989 were defrauded by the 5aticket security surcharge 
on transatlantic flights and an advertising campaign on the 
development of the security system 
after enticing the traveling public into purchasing tickets on 
pan am flights and subsidizing a supposedly efficient security 
system defendants made conscious decisions not to create that 
system the lawsuit alleged 
the lawsuit filed in superior court was intended as a class 
action for customers who purchased tickets affected by the case 
said richard a grossman the attorney handling the case 
the lawsuit also alleges that a private consultant hired by pan 
am in 1986 to review security warned the airline was vulnerable to 
terrorist attack the consultant warned that the advertising 
campaign touting beefedup flight security could be considered 
fraudulent unless changes were made grossman said 
the plaintiffs included peter and aphrodite tsairis of franklin 
lakes and the estate of their daughter alexia tsairis a syracuse 
university undergraduate killed when pan am flight 103 exploded 
over lockerbie scotland on dec 21 1988 the downing of the 
boeing 747 killed all 259 passengers and crew and 11 people on the 
ground 
damages could amount to over 100 million with more than a 
million passengers in line for refunds plus punitive damages 
grossman said 
pan am said in a statement issued by its legal department that 
the lawsuits attempt to recover damages for the death of ms 
tsairis would be handled like all other such claims 
but the company said there was absolutely no merit to the 
lawsuits classaction claims company spokeswoman elizabeth 
manners said pan am would make a motion to dismiss that aspect of 
the lawsuit 
ms manners said about 18 million was collected in 1989 through 
the security surcharges but could not provide amounts for earlier 
years the spokeswoman said the airline spent nearly 47 million on 
security last year 
another plaintiff was t jennifer vail a 20yearold law 
student from wilmington del with no connection to the crash ms 
vail is a pan am customer seeking reimbursement of the surcharges 
and represents others like her grossman said 
the lawsuit alleges the airlines own security expert isaac 
yeffet former head of security for el al airlines in israel told 
pan am officials almost two years before the flight 103 crash that 
the carriers security was almost totally ineffectual 
named as defendants were pan am corp and its subsidiaries pan 
american world airways inc and pan american world services inc 
also named were alert management systems inc a pan am security 
subcontractor c edward acker a former pan am president and chief 
executive officer of pan am and martin e shugrue jr a former 
vice chairman of the corporation and chief executive officer of pan 
am world airways as well as the directors of each company 
james stengel a new york attorney who has defended aircraft 
manufacturers in similar litigation said class actions against 
airlines are not unusual but connecting the surcharge with a fraud 
allegation is a novel approach 
most claims filed against pan am by relatives of flight 103 
victims have been wrongful death and personal injury cases and 
have been combined into a single case he said 
pan am was fined 630000 for security and other violations 
discovered by the federal aviation administration following the 
crash the company has challenged much of the fine which is 
pending said ms manners

up to 70000 prisoners may 
have died in soviet internment camps on german soil after world war 
ii a government official who is an expert on stalinera atrocities 
said monday 
the remark by gerhard finn followed reports of the discovery of 
mass graves containing the bodies of thousands of prisoners from a 
former soviet internment camp in east germany 
east germanys berliner zeitung newspaper reported saturday that 
some nazi prisoners of war such as ss members police officers 
nazi party officials and former soldiers in adolf hitlers army 
died at the former fuenfeichen internment camp near neubrandenburg 
but the newspaper said the victims also included many innocent 
people and teenagers it said the youngest victim was 12 years 
old 
finn a department chief in the west german intergerman 
ministry said monday he expected that even more mass graves will 
be found 
we estimate that from 65000 to 70000 people died in the 
internment camps of the soviet occupying powers after world war 
ii finn told saarlandischer rundfunk radio in saarbruecken 
finn is the author of a book on the subject titled political 
prisoners in the soviet zone 
he said it would be impossible to give an exact figure because 
all death certificates of the camps were destroyed 
finn said that between 1945 and 1950 up to 200000 people were 
detained in 13 soviet army camps in east germany 
brutality during the soviet occupation was kept secret in east 
germany until last falls popular uprising swept the hardline 
communist leadership out of power

an environmental protection agency regional 
official said monday he will recommend that denvers proposed two 
forks dam be vetoed because of the damage it would cause to the 
environment 
the 615foothigh dam to be built near the confluence of the 
south platte river and its north fork would flood 30 miles of 
scenic river valley and canyon and the town of deckers to provide 
drinking water for up to 360000 new denverarea residents 
opponents including several environmental groups have called 
the project the biggest ecological disaster in colorado history 
it appears the godzilla of water projects has met its match 
said dan luecke director of the boulderbased environmental 
defense fund 
lee dehihns the epa deputy regional administrator from atlanta 
who reviewed the project said he would recommend that it be vetoed 
because its adverse impact on fishery wildlife and recreation 
areas would be so significant that these resources would be lost 
forever 
the final decision will be made at epa headquarters in 
washington dc but dehihns has said vetoes are rarely overturned 
epa administrator william reillys designee lujuana wilcher the 
agencys assistant administrator for water has 60 days to affirm 
deny or modify dehihns decision unless an extension is granted 
asked at a news conference if the project is now effectively 
dead dehihns replied nothing is dead until the fat lady sings 
as they say lujuana is not fat but she will make the final 
decision 
dehihns said in his recommendation he is convinced the project 
would cause unacceptable environmental damage including the 
flooding of a trout stream and the loss of highquality habitat 
that is home to deer elk and bighorn sheep 
the epa says there were several alternatives for providing water 
to denvers metropolitan area without causing as much environmental 
damage those include smaller dams water exchanges conservation 
measures and increased use of groundwater 
bill miller manager of the denver water department described 
dehihns recommendation as no surprise and said water officials 
planned to seek consultation at the washington level with the 
decisionmaker back there 
the dam estimated to cost between 500 million and 1 billion 
was proposed by the denver water board and about 42 metropolitan 
water suppliers as the solution to the areas future water needs 
last march reilly announced his intention to veto the project 
and appointed dehihns to oversee the final review of the project 
and to make a final recommendation on its fate 
sen bob kerry dneb said dehihns decision means we will 
have to conserve as well as develop in the future 
with the epas decision to continue the veto process two 
forks is about to return to the obscurity it so richly deserves 
said luecke

thousands of nigerians signed up monday to 
become members of two political parties created by the military 
government to return africas most populous nation to civilian rule 
popular response during the 40day party registration that began 
monday will show the feelings of nigerians many were shocked when 
president ibrahim babangida in october rejected nominations from 13 
groups seeking to register as political parties 
instead the generals government itself created two political 
parties the centerright national republican convention and 
leftleaning social democratic party the government is also 
writing their platforms 
babangida said all 13 rejected organizations were tainted by the 
corruption and ethnic and religious factionalism that he blames for 
the failure of previous civilian governments 
soldiers have governed nigeria by force for all but nine years 
of the west african nations 29 years of independence from britain 
babangidas 6yearold government has promised to return the nation 
to civilian rule through elections by 1992 
government critics say people are uninterested in voting for 
parties created by the military 
the government countered those charges monday by publishing 
results of a survey saying nigerians are enthusiastic about their 
evolving political system and keen to register as party members 
thousands lined up to register monday but no exact figures were 
available immediately 
all former politicians and leading government members are banned 
from seeking office in this country of 115 million 
but information minister tony momoh said monday that some are 
plotting to ensure their hold on power for example through 
surrogates on their payroll newspapers have been filled with 
advertisements from politicians announcing which party they support

chancellor helmut kohl on monday 
denied a claim by british prime minister margaret thatcher that he 
recently said he does not recognize polands western border 
thatchers contention made in an interview with the hamburg 
magazine der spiegel apparently has created tension in relations 
between the two nato allies just days before their summit in 
cambridge england 
the latest edition of der spiegel quoted mrs thatcher as 
saying i have heard helmut say no i wont guarantee anything 
i dont recognize the current borders 
mrs thatcher said kohl made the remark at a recent meeting of 
european economic community leaders in strasbourg 
but kohls spokesman hans klein said mrs thatchers 
interpretation of the chancellors remarks is correct neither 
literally nor in a general way 
klein did not disclose what kohl actually said but pointed out 
that the chancellor in countless statements has said germans 
have no designs on lands ceded to poland after the third reichs 
defeat in 1945 
it wasnt the first time kohl has come under fire for his 
statements about polands western border 
last month he angered poland and raised concerns around the 
world by declining to give assurances that a united germany would 
not lay claim to any polish territory 
kohl under pressure from archconservative voters with federal 
elections coming up in december said at the time that only the 
government of a united germany could address that issue 
he has since reversed himself however on march 1 parliament 
passed a resolution proposed by kohls party saying a united 
germany must sign a border treaty with warsaw 
poland however contends that is still not an ironclad 
guarantee of its western border 
mrs thatcher has been among those who have openly voiced 
concern about german unification 
in the der spiegel interview she was quoted as saying we 
just have to get used to the idea that there will be a country in 
europe in the future that will be more powerful than all the 
others 
despite the public tiff between kohl and thatcher klein said 
plans have not been changed for their friday meeting in cambridge

the government of prime minister margaret 
thatcher in trouble with voters over an unpopular new tax ran 
into new problems early tuesday when four tories defected on a vote 
over subsidies to cushion the levy 
an estimated 35 other conservatives abstained 
the house of commons vote followed a latenight debate on the 
subsidies the motion drawn up by the socialist opposition labor 
party was defeated by 305 votes to 233 
it was the second revolt by tory rebels in two weeks on march 
13 33 conservatives voted with labor on an opposition motion 
later defeated on a second vote that called for more government 
help for people in retirement homes 
the motion tuesday called for rejection of government plans to 
spend 13 billion over the next three years to help 7 million 
lowincome people pay the new tax 
labor legislators said the subsidies are too low they said they 
are based on what mrs thatchers government considers local 
authorities should charge under the new tax not what they are 
actually charging 
critics say the new tax is unfair because it takes no account of 
peoples ability to pay 
recent opinion polls show the conservatives trailing labor by up 
to 28 percentage points with the next general election due by 
mid1992 voters say the new tax is their main complaint with the 
conservatives

two pipe bombs exploded early monday at 
the university of alaska at fairbanks and three others were 
detonated by a military bomb squad in what the campus security 
director called a a dangerous prank 
no one was injured and no major damages reported police said 
the pipe bombs were fairly powerful said director of campus 
security dale florian they were certainly dangerous 
the bombs exploded at 4 am and sent a metal end cap rocketing 
about 150 feet through a window of the fine arts building about 40 
feet above the ground florian said other shrapnel was found 
several hundred feet away he said 
the bombs went off at an ice arch in front of rasmuson library 
where they had been placed in holes in the arch florian said 
there is absolutely no doubt in my mind that it was a prank 
that went awry he said 
officials said the ice structure built by members of the 
student chapter of the american society of civil engineers each 
year becomes the target of saboteurs who try to destroy or damage 
it but kevin curtis an engineering professor called mondays act 
a foolish extreme 
florian said his office had received some leads in the case but 
had no firm suspects 
in addition to the two exploded bombs three undetonated bombs 
were found by campus security officers a bomb squad from eielson 
air force base was called in to blow up the devices florian said 
he described them as metal pipes filled with gunpowder set with 
fuses 
the explosive ordnance disposal team from eielson blew up the 
bombs about 9 am after campus police and alaska state troopers 
evacuated about 200 people from the library and three other 
buildings in the center of campus he said

nearly 59000 us airline flights were canceled 
last year a 42 percent increase over 1988 according to a report 
published monday 
the cancellations by 12 major carriers for nonmechanical 
reasons left passengers stranded on 58879 domestic flights in the 
year ending jan 31 up from 41448 for the year ending jan 31 
1989 the saint paul pioneer press reported 
us transportation department officials declined to discuss the 
figures which the newspaper said it obtained through a freedom of 
information act request 
of the six largest carriers usair had the worst record with 
both the largest number of cancellations 15849 and the 
greatest increase from the year ending jan 31 1989 its number 
rose by 8758 as it struggled through a merger last fall with 
piedmont airlines 
next was american airlines with an increase of 5033 
cancellations to 10001 and united airlines with an increase of 
3330 to 9190 
northwest airlines had a better record than usair united and 
american canceling only 11 percent of all flights its number of 
cancellations dropped to 5081 last year from 5504 the year before 
officials say weather is a greater problem than it once was 
because airlines are increasingly reliant on hubandspoke systems 
that dispatch many flights from a single city 
bad weather at one hub can mean hundreds of added cancellations 
a day said united spokeswoman sara dornacker she said uniteds 
increased cancellations were due largely to weather but she said 
some of uniteds trouble stems from mechanical problems that delay 
the timely arrival of crews which means canceling more flights 
others said uniteds performance during three months last summer 
may have been affected by laborcontract tensions that kept crews 
from reporting for duty and resulted in crew shortages 
american airlines did not respond to an inquiry on the matter

three days after the usbacked 
contras signed an agreement to disband by midapril rebels were 
streaming into nicaragua monday and there were reports of 
intensified fighting 
international observers and witnesses said contra bases across 
the border from nicaragua in yamales honduras were practically 
empty 
they have become ghost camps theres just a few of them left 
there said one international observer who spoke on condition of 
anonmity 
journalists who visited the camps last week had similar reports 
the contra leader who negotiated the demobilization pact oscar 
sovalbarro said 2000 rebel fighters have returned since the 
accord was signed friday 
he said a 2000person insurgent military contingent is 
already back in nicaragua and its numbers could increase at any 
moment 
the movement of rebel fighters into nicaragua could undermine 
hopes raised by the accord which establishes a demobilization 
deadline only for the contras in honduras 
in miami the top contra military commander israel galeano 
insisted the fighters in nicaragua would not disarm until the 
sandinista army does 
we are speaking of total demobilization that includes both 
ourselves and the sandinistas he said 
sandinista leaders have said their party will not turn over 
control of the army to the new government unless the usbacked 
contras demobilize 
galeano who did not sign the accord said it was unrealistic to 
expect the contras to demobilize immediately an eightyear 
process cannot be decided by the dismantlement of an organization 
in 15 days he said 
the defense ministry says there have been at least two clashes 
between the army and the contras since friday in which 16 people 
died 
the ministry also said about 100 contras seized a truck sunday 
night robbed the passengers of cash and jewelry and made the owner 
pay a 500 ransom to get the vehicle back 
all the incidents took place near the provincial capital of 
jinotega 100 miles northeast of managua on the honduran border 
international observers say there appears to be a split among 
the contras over the pact but sovalbarro and galeano denied any 
rift 
at the moment we are a very solid organization we mutually 
support each other galeano said 
sovalbarro and a spokesman for galeano alejandro acevdeo 
denied there had been an increase in fighting and said the 
sandinistas were lying 
it is the sandinistas who are trying to undermine the peace 
process we think the sandinistas are disguising themselves and 
staging attacks to discredit us acevedo said 
the demobilization agreement signed friday in the honduran 
capital of tegucigalpa between representatives of the rebels and of 
the incoming government of the united national opposition alliance 
or uno calls for an immediate ceasefire 
it says the contras in honduras will demobilize by april 20 
five days before presidentelect violeta barrios de chamorro takes 
office 
most of the 12000man contra army that holed up in honduras 
after us military aid ended in 1988 began returning to nicaragua 
in september as many as 4000 were believed to be in nicaragua by 
the feb 25 election 
the demobilization pact says the contras inside nicaragua will 
move into secure zones monitored by the united nations and 
cardinal miguel obando y bravo the archbishop of managua 
the accord was signed by sovalbarro but not by galeano one 
foreign observer interpreted this as a loophole should galeano 
also known as commander franklyn decide not to adhere to the pact 
the agreement reached with the new government of nicaragua 
surprised our combatants at first sovalbarro acknowledged but 
now we are all happy over what happened 
the observer speaking on condition of anonymity said there 
appeared to be a split between contra forces loyal to franklyn 
galeano and followers of sovalbarro ruben 
we have estimated that franklyn controls about 40 percent of 
the contras and ruben about 60 percent and that franklyn is the 
toughest of the two said the observer maybe ruben wants to 
demobilize but not franklyn 
president daniel ortega has also said he was concerned that 
galeano had not signed the accord 
franklyns brother osvaldo galeano commander negro told the 
associated press last week that his forces would not demobilize 
unless the sandinista army and interior ministry did the same 
in the first reported clash after the pact was signed about 100 
contras friday ambushed an undisclosed number of sandinistas in la 
pavona 33 miles northeast of jinotega the defense ministry said 
12 sandinista soldiers and four contras were killed and eight 
sandinista soldiers and civilians were wounded in a 90minute 
firefight 
the defense ministry also reported a 30minute firefight sunday 
evening between about 30 contras and sandinista troops no 
casualities were reported 
jinotega province is the northern tip of a corridor used by the 
contras to infiltrate nicaragua the contras are supported by 
peasants in the corridor a strip extending south through the 
middle of nicaragua to the costa rican border

the man charged with killing 87 people in one of 
the nations deadliest fires was a cuban army deserter who arrived 
during the 1980 mariel boatlift and had no arrest record in new 
york authorities said monday 
julio gonzalez 36 was reported to have been nonchalant when he 
was arrested at his home sunday but later cried and blamed his 
actions on the devil police said 
i got angry the devil got into me and i set the place on 
fire gonzalez told authorities according to a police source who 
spoke to the associated press on condition of anonymity 
gonzalez described by police as a street person who hustled 
money washing cars or peddling was arraigned monday on charges of 
murdering 87 people by setting fire to the happy land social club 
early sunday 
police said gonzalez set the fire after getting into an argument 
with his 45yearold former girlfriend lydia feliciano who worked 
at the club 
he was moved monday from the prison at rikers island where he 
had been under a suicide watch to maximum security protective 
custody at the brooklyn house of detention said prisons 
spokeswoman ruby ryles 
from there he was taken to kings county hospital for a 
psychiatric evaluation he was being held in a prison ward of the 
hospital ryles said 
district attorney robert johnson said gonzalez has no arrest 
record in new york he offered little other information about his 
background saying he didnt know how gonzalez made a living or 
what he has done since entering the country 10 years ago 
his background is not a priority johnson said 
gonzalez reportedly had a job in a lamp factory in the long 
island city section of queens but is believed to have been out of 
work for about six months 
according to immigration records he arrived in the united 
states at key west fla on may 31 1980 as part of the mariel 
boatlift about 125000 cubans entered the united states during 
that flotilla including many convicted criminals and other 
undesirables 
verne jervis a spokesman for the immigration and naturalization 
service said gonzalez had served some time in prison in cuba 
for deserting from the army 
however he said in our interviews we uncovered nothing to 
indicate he was criminal in nature 
gonzalez however said at the time of his arrival that he had 
told cuban authorities he had trafficked in drugs in order to 
qualify for the boatlift duke austin an ins spokesman told the 
new york times 
after arriving in the united states gonzalez was detained at 
camp mccoy wis then ft chaffee ark until feb 21 1981 when 
he was granted parole status according to jervis 
from arkansas he was sent to live with a sponsor family in new 
york weve had no contact from him since jervis said 
he said gonzalez has never applied for permanent residence 
which makes him deportable after serving time for a criminal 
conviction 
for the past three months gonzalez has lived in an 80aweek

the american society of newspaper editors on march 
20 criticized defense secretary dick cheneys delay in alerting the 
16member press pool of the us invasion of panama last december 
cheneys decision to delay calling the pool until after the 
close of office hours and the broadcast of the evening news made 
assembling the pool difficult and actually increased the security 
problem said jean otto chairman of the asnes pressbarpublic 
affairs committee 
it also assured that the pool would not arrive until hours 
after the invasion was launched on dec 20 otto associate 
editor of the rocky mountain news said in a news release 
the asne statement came as a pentagonsponsored report was 
released saying us reporters missed the start of the invasion 
because cheney decided secrecy was more important than ensuring 
news coverage 
the report also criticized cheneys press secretary pete 
williams for not trying to convince the secretary to send a group 
of reporters and photographers to panama in time to cover the 
critical opening battles 
i take the blame for what happened in panama williams said 
in response to the report 
he said the defense department was fully committed to the idea 
of allowing the news media to cover military operations and that 
steps already were being taken to correct problems described in the 
latest study 
a pool system was established by representatives of the pentagon 
and the news media after the 1983 invasion of grenada it is 
designed to have objective observers inform american citizens from 
the start of military actions involving us personnel

expected a higher purchase price to result from any negotiations

gov mario cuomo expanded new yorks 
shield law on march 24 to protect the news media from having to 
surrender to the courts most information collected by reporters and 
television crews 
enactment of the bill is particularly appropriate this year as 
we celebrate the bicentennial of the first amendment cuomo said 
in signing the legislation since 1735 when peter zenger was 
acquitted of libel charges new york has led the way in the 
protection of freedom of the press 
the democratic governor announced his action just before 
speaking at a meeting of the new york state society of newspaper 
editors 
although new yorks shield law adopted in 1970 had protected 
information gathered on a confidential basis from sources recent 
state court rulings had said there was no such protection for 
information gathered without a promise of confidentiality 
under the expanded law unpublished information or that supplied 
without a pledge of confidentiality doesnt have to be given up by 
news organizations in most circumstances a court could still order 
the information divulged if it determined the material was critical 
to a case and not obtainable from any alternative source 
the legislation was passed 475 on march 21 by the 
republicancontrolled state senate in january the 
democratcontrolled assembly had approved it 11911 
the legislation gives new york one of the strictest protections 
for journalists of any state in the nation according to lawyers 
for several news organizations

the citys requirement that news 
agencies sign an embargo agreement before obtaining an advance copy 
of material for a news conference could set a dangerous precedent 
a media law specialist said 
the mayors office would not release an internal police report 
on the custody of mob informant peter gilbert before the march 22 
news conference unless reporters signed a lengthy embargo agreement 
material commonly is embargoed but reporters are not required 
to sign such contracts 
to my knowledge its unprecedented said thomas a schwartz 
a media law specialist at ohio state university 
historically there has been a matter of trust between media 
sources and the media he said but im sure that many media 
sources have been burned in recent times and have become more 
cautious in protecting the release of such material 
the contract acknowledged the 280page report would be 
considered to be a governmental record covered under rhode 
islands public records law 
city spokesman tad devine said the arrangement was needed 
because some of those affected by the report would not have a 
chance to review it before the news conference 
the providence journalbulletin signed the agreement but then 
issued a statement saying it regretted the decision james v 
wyman vice president of the newspaper said his company would not 
sign such documents in the future

that printed only the ap story be removed from the hunt case hood

some of the biggest players in west german 
journalism have begun selling magazines and newspapers in east 
germany 
eastern publishers knew when the government of erich honecker

early this month west german publishers put street vendors to 
work in a major east berlin plaza selling such journals as the 
masscirculation bild zeitung conservative daily die welt news 
magazines der spiegel and stern and a wide range of fashion and 
sports magazines 
the western publications can be expensive under a typical 
pricing formula der spiegel would cost 1350 east marks the 
equivalent of 765 
schlegel said there may be a spate of takeovers by west german 
press barons jockeying for market position and that small regional 
or local papers might be targets 
other changes the east german news agency adn which surprised 
western journalists with its rapid change to fast reliable 
reporting is said to be planning a merger with the west german 
agency dpa and tageszeitung a west german tabloid has set up in

a hollywood studio representative and nbctv 
exchanged verbal brickbats march 23 over a network program dealing 
with a new hollywood where small producers are likely to get 
squashed by large competitors 
jack valenti president of the motion picture association of 
america said he was outraged over nbcs the new hollywood 
broadcast march 21 
valenti said nbc failed to disclose its own efforts in 
washington to wrest back control of its programs from hollywood 
producers 
tom brokaw who anchored the program called valentis attack an 
insult to his journalistic integrity 
valenti in a letter to nbc president robert wright demanded a 
opportunity in television prime time to present a rebuttal to 
nbcs lack of disclosure 
nbc spokesman joe rutledge said valentis demand was idiotic 
that means no 
hollywood producers including the major studios that make up 
the mpaa have been involved in negotiations for seven years over 
federal rules that prevent abc nbc and cbs from having a financial 
interest in the programs they broadcast or from selling those 
programs in the lucrative us rerun market 
valenti emphasized that he was not questioning brokaws 
integrity 
he said his quarrel with nbc was its failure to disclose that it

after months of appearing paralyzed by 
president bushs high poll ratings the democrats have shifted into 
a campaign mode and begun to sound like a party ready to challenge 
bush in the 1992 election 
during weekend meetings in new orleans and indianapolis the 
democrats took on the popular republican president on a range of 
domestic issues including social security the environment 
abortion and education 
the partys newly aggressive stance was not arrived at easily 
it exposed the differing approaches of state party officials hungry 
for effective campaign issues and the congressional wing whose 
members must often search for compromises with their republican 
colleagues and the white house 
regardless of their differences on specific issues the 
democrats clearly agreed with party chairman ronald h browns 
assessment that the president has been getting a free ride and 
that it was time to challenge him

the setting is a tiny pittsburgh 
restaurant a month after the death of martin luther king jr but 
august wilsons latest work in his cycle of plays about black 
america is not about the turbulent 1960s 
people have written so much about the 60s so i didnt need 
to do that i went at it obliquely said wilson whose play 
two trains running premieres march 30 at the yale repertory 
theater 
in his fifth collaboration with director lloyd richards the 
acclaimed playwright returns to a dominant theme in all his works 
to have a future blacks in america must first define who they are 
by reclaiming their past 
unless you reconnect to your past make some accommodation to 
your past fully understand your history in the world you cant 
have a future said the 44yearold wilson 
two trains running its title taken from a blues song of the 
same name is filled with references to death one of the 
restaurants patrons is an undertaker whose funeral parlor is 
across the street as the characters talk about the conditions of 
their lives wilson said what you find is people are dying 
infant mortality rates are high police are shooting people drugs 
are killing people everyone is dying young 
quickly what you discover is that the real problem is the 
economic problem there simply are not any jobs for any of these 
people in pittsburgh in 1968 you could have written the same thing 
for the 1980s things havent changed at all they have actually 
got worse 
wilson was born in pittsburgh but has lived in st paul minn 
since 1978 
in the play everything seems to be working against memphis the 
restaurant owner and the other characters memphis is a former 
sharecropper who was run out of mississippi in 1931 and whose 
restaurant is about to be torn down 
but in the middle of all this loss and death is that which does 
not die tradition the main characters tap into that by going to 
see aunt esther a woman who claims to be 322 years old 
aunt esther an offstage character will make you right with 
your self said wilson who with his raspy smokers voice 
frequently draws from the plays dialogue to illustrate a point 
aunt esther tells memphis if he drops the ball there is no 
need to continue to run because if you get to the end zone there is 
not going to be a touchdown youve got to go back and pick up the 
ball each of the characters gets the same message youve got to 
go back and claim what is yours before you can go forward 
at a meat market next to the funeral home a man walks in and 
tells the owner i want my ham he says take a chicken for 
the past nine years every morning this guy has been showing up for 
me that represents black america standing patiently outside the 
door of american society in 1968 and prior to that i want my ham 
i want my ham wilson said 
while two trains running is set in the 60s wilsons other 
major works have addressed issues facing american blacks during 
other decades of this century all have premiered at yale with 
richards directing the theatrical partnership began in 1984 with 
ma raineys black bottom 1920s and continued with fences 
1950s joe turners come and gone 191020 and the piano 
lesson 1930s which opens on broadway on april 16 
wilson won a tony and the pulitzer prize for fences 
richards received a tony for best director for the play wilson 
also won the new york drama critics circle award for three of his 
plays 
with richards tenure as dean of the yale school of drama and 
artistic director at the yale rep ending in june 1991 two 
trains could be the last of wilsons plays to have its premiere 
at yale but wilson said it definitely will not be their last 
collaboration wherever he goes thats where im going 
the collaboration has made his string of plays seem seamless he 
said they are all the same in the sense you have the same 
artistic sensibilities working on the play 
weve developed over the course of the years a kind of 
shorthand way of working there is not a lot of talking that goes 
on 
wilson believes he is getting better with each play he writes 
he said myth and ritual are also growing to be larger elements 
citing the tall tale of the 3centuryold woman as an example 
ive learned a lot about building characters i know what is 
important now he said

opposition political leaders like opposition 
vegetables often are known by the enemies they keep 
broccoli and rep richard a gephardt of missouri share the 
perfect critic president bush doesnt care for either of them 
there is no better way to raise a profile than to have the 
president of the united states slap it broccoli was something most 
people didnt think about let alone talk about until bush 
disclosed his distaste now a truckload of the stuff has come to 
washington and talk of broccoli is part of the fare on latenight 
television 
gephardt the house majority leader has become a prime 
democratic debater against bushs policies and one reason is the 
presidents sharp personal rebuttal gephardt seems to irk bush 
more than other democrats do even when the messages are similar 
while the president said gephardt doesnt get under his skin he 
complained after a tax debate last year that the missouri 
congressman had made it all too personal the administration 
mounted a public counterattack when gephardt gave a speech 
criticizing bush as lacking in vision and leadership at a time of 
crucial change in eastern europe 
but i dont want to knock the man maybe hell come up with a 
good idea one of these days bush said 
gephardt said he doesnt know why his speeches seem to rankle 
bush i have no idea he said i have tried not to make 
personal attacks i like him personally i hope hes a good 
president 
i didnt do this to get into a fight or a namecalling 
contest gephardt said in an interview but he said there needs 
to be debate about bushs visionless foreign policy and 
economic issues at home gephardt said only a president can provide 
national leadership and bush isnt doing it 
gephardt said he doubted the dispute with the white house had 
done much to raise his personal visibility level he wryly recalled 
his early exit from candidacy for the 1988 democratic presidential 
nomination and said not many people recognize him yet he said on 
the rare occasions when people know his face in airports or 
restaurants they think he is jack kemp or dan quayle 
that may be but a presidential rebuke can be a political merit 
badge that boosts a congressional figure or a candidate in the 
opposition party 
the classic case came in 1966 when richard m nixon was trying 
to make his way back to republican leadership after his losing 
campaigns for the white house and for governor of california he 
went on the road for republican congressional candidates 
criticizing the policies of democratic president lyndon b johnson 
nixons quest got a major boost after he criticized johnsons 
vietnam war policy drawing a bitter counterattack johnson said he 
didnt want to debate a chronic campaigner like mr nixon he 
called nixon a loser a man willing to confuse americans about 
vietnam policy even risk soldiers lives to pick up a few votes 
nixon replied with wounded patriotism other republican figures 
including dwight d eisenhower came to his defense and the 
presidential diatribe made him the designated hitter for the gop 
opposition the party made him its spokesman in a halfhour network 
television speech and he was a major beneficiary in the sweeping 
republican comeback that year it was one of the landmark points in 
nixons own comeback to the presidential election victory of 1968 
the bushgephardt dispute is far tamer then again it isnt 
over yet there are those who say that gephardt nettles the white 
house by arguing economic issues on a class basis rich against 
middle class and poorer americans 
he means to keep up the debate i think thats whats supposed 
to happen ina democracy the majority leader said 
incidentally gephardt likes broccoli

in panama women piloted strategic air command tankers that 
refueled the planes flying troops and supplies from the united 
states 
they dodged bullets and artillery fire as they ferried troops 
into battle aboard blackhawk helicopters with two female pilots 
nominated for the prestigious air medal with a bronze v for valor 
the first women to be so honored 
despite these advances the confusion that struck the fivestar 
soviet general when he faced lt lipphardt seems to afflict many 
military and political leaders in this country as well when it 
comes to the idea of women as warriors 
but theres no doubt in lipphardts mind shes allowed to fly 
planes to and from aircraft carriers with mail people and 
supplies but cant be based on the warships as a jet pilot because 
that would be combat duty 
now without a chance to go after the toughest piloting job she 
thinks the navy could hand her coupled with other problems such 
as lengthy separations from her submariner husband lipphardt says 
shes thinking of leaving the service 
if the ban against combat flying were dropped maybe id feel 
differently she says 
in a report last fall to defense secretary dick cheney the 
pentagons defense advisory committee on women in the services 
said the services can ill afford to continue to limit these 
women and their experiences in the face of the anticipated manpower 
shortages of the 1990s 
by comparing sheer statistics women seem to fare best in the 
air force 
the services hightech longdistance weaponry allows for 97 
percent of its specialities to be open to women with 136 percent 
of its force being female 
women are barred from serving in fighters bombers tactical 
airlift cargo planes and some helicopters but they are allowed to 
fly in some transport aircraft in commandpost aircraft on 
reconnaisance aircraft and on support missions 
the air force recently lifted the restrictions against women 
flying on c130 and c141 transports that drop paratroopers into 
battle zones 
the army is 114 percent female the advertising directed at 
recruiting women boasts that more than 93 percent of its 
specialities are open to women given the services high combat 
needs however this translates to about half of its job slots 
being closed to women 
the army after more than a year of indecision still hasnt 
decided what to do with some 345 women whove been trained as field 
artillery officers but whove been pulled from their jobs amid 
worries that the positions would be too exposed to enemy fire 
the navy at a 99 percent female level bars women from serving 
on all aircraft carriers except one the uss lexington a training 
ship while combat vessels such as destroyers and cruisers are also 
offlimits women do serve at sea on support ships such as oilers 
and tenders that supply aircraft carriers submarines and other 
fighting vessels 
the marine corps has the smallest percentage of slots open to 
women 48 percent marine corps officials point out that because 
the service relies on the navy for medical care the marines dont 
have a large number of nurses a traditionally female specialty in 
the armed services 
questions about the future role of women in the military have 
grown sharper not only because of the attention focused on the 
hundreds of women who participated in the panama invasion but also 
because of the extensive personnel cuts the pentagon faces in light 
of the nations budget woes and the end of the cold war 
two congresswomen say they want to ensure that military women 
dont suffer disproportionately under the manpower cuts that seem 
virtually certain with the easing of eastwest tension 
rep patricia schroeder dcolo has introduced legislation 
that would allow army women to apply for all positions including 
combatrelated slots 
polls show seven out of 10 americans think women should have a 
chance to serve in combat units if they want to ms schroeder 
says its a really touchy issue but weve had women die in 
combat and i think the american people are aware of what that 
means 
rep beverly bryon dmd chairman of the house armed services 
subcommittee on military personnel says that while more job 
categories should be open to women she opposes the idea of them 
entering combat units 
were moving along at a pace im comfortable with mrs 
byron says 
the service academies west point annapolis and the air force 
academy began graduating women only 10 years ago so few have had 
time to reach the higher decisionmaking ranks of the military 
at the end of last year only seven women held the rank of 
general or admiral 
were still in the process of aging the officer corps says 
foote its going to take us a while to get women where they can 
make more than just token changes in the way the military is run

i couldnt tote a 100pound rucksack and walk for miles but i 
can fly says army capt alice reinwald of columbus ga on duty 
near the demilitarized zone between north and south korea 
the 28yearold woman pilots a blackhawk helicopter and is in 
charge of administration at camp laguardia an army outpost 14 
miles from the dmz the post is home to the 250 soldiers who make 
up the attack helicopter battalions based there 
if we have to take off and go to war today id have to be a 
pilot wed fly support wed be right in there going to the front 
lines with whatever is needed food fuel supplies reinwald 
says 
she says she knows there are limitations to what a woman can 
do 
its because of such limitations that her husband an infantry 
officer doesnt want women fighting alongside his men in the 
trenches and gullies of south korea 
i know he just wouldnt feel comfortable with the idea she

the worlds two most powerful economies have 
become inextricably wedded but too often the relationship between 
the united states and japan seems like a bad marriage characterized 
by frequent spats what do the two have in common apart from money

never mind trade tensions at sam kusumotos 
company a recent office party was enough to put a crimp in 
usjapan relations 
there wasnt an argument or even a minor contretemps at the 
affair many of the american employees just didnt show up it 
seems they didnt know about it in time explains kusumoto 
president of minolta usa in suburban ramsey nj 
at japanese companies we have very nice horizontal 
communication he says everybody listens to what the other guy 
is talking about over the phone after office hours we associate 
so plans for just about everything spread chattily through the 
ranks in japanese of course formal notice americanstyle is 
almost an afterthought 
the americans didnt hear about the party kusumoto says 
and when they discovered the date was decided months ago they got 
upset 
a simple miscue but behind it lay a gulf of misunderstanding 
that somehow has defied nearly 50 years of usjapan amity and 
more than a century of cultural exchange since 19th century japan 
under american prodding cast off its feudal kosode robes 
today more than ever the worlds two most powerful economies 
have become inextricably wedded but too often the relationship 
seems like a bad marriage characterized by frequent squabbles and 
little in common apart from money 
the tensions have appeared in numerous forms despite the best 
efforts of both sides to avoid them in charges of discrimination 
by american employees of japanese companies in a hardhearted new 
appraisal by washington of its onetime protege and vice versa 
and not least in an undercurrent of racism 
the racism often surfaces subtly when japanese companies 
purchasedsuch american corporate icons as columbia pictures and new 
yorks rockefeller center last year the headlines often read the 
japanese buy as if the entire nation were bent 
samurailike on the takeover 
in contrast other major foreign purchasers british canadian 
dutch have been described more accurately as individual companies 
part of it is the sheer cultural impact of japans new wealth 
an economic sea change that made japan the worlds largest creditor 
by the end of the 1980s and its former patron the united states 
the largest debtor 
its the japanese rate of buying thats frightening says 
marlene rossman a new yorkbased consultant to new york companies 
japan is now second only to great britain in us investments 
from may 1987 to last may the number of us factories with at 
least partial japanese ownership nearly doubled from 550 to 1043 
according to the japan external trade organization 
japans total investment in us real estate corporations and 
subsidiaries soared from 47 billion in 1980 to 534 billion in 
1988 according to the most recent commerce department figures 
japanese companies now hold about 50 percent of the commercial real 
estate in downtown los angeles more than 20 prime properties in 
manhattan including tiffanys and substantial holdings in 
washington 
it is not over the issue of washington real estate however but 
closer to the heart of the nations capital that usjapanese 
tensions have perhaps cut deepest 
particularly irksome were the 1989 trade figures released in 
february the united states enjoyed a 15 billion surplus with the 
12nation european community a sharp turnaround from a 92 
billion deficit in 1988 but with japan despite a sharp decline in 
the dollar engineered to help us exports the deficit was a 
stubborn 49 billion 
that was no appreciable improvement from the previous years 
518 billion deficit with japan even with an 18 percent increase 
in us export sales says j michael farren undersecretary for 
international trade in the commerce department 
the trade frictions are aggravated by what many in congress and 
the bush administration see as the japanese governments xenophobic 
resistance to open markets and cultural disposition to treat trade 
as economic warfare 
the fallacy in asking the japanese to open their markets is 
they havent got the foggiest idea what an open market is says 
clyde prestowitz a former commerce department negotiator whose 
influential 1988 book trading places portrayed japan as 
having carefully planned its exportfueled ascendancy 
in tokyo foreign ministry spokesman taizo watanabe said us 
analysts were wrong in arguing that japans culture was an 
unchangeable barrier to concepts like an open market on march 22 
us and japanese trade negotiators reported a breakthrough over 
the key issue of opening supercomputer exports to japan 
in addition experts point out japan has been moving from an 
exportbased to a domestic marketbased economy 
japan has a long history of adapting foreign ideas watanabe 
said and there is no reason why we cannot continue to do so 
one reason however is that the japanese are not as keen on 
foreign ideas these days an attitude born of japans pride in its 
postwar miracle and a growing contempt for the united states 
persistent problems

according to a business week poll released dec 7 pearl harbor 
day more than half of the japanese dont have much or any 
admiration for the united states its economic success or its 
people 
a recent book published in japanese a japan that can say 
no stunned washington when word trickled back of its harsh view 
of the united states but in japan it has ruffled few feathers 
because much of its content has been expressed privately by 
japanese journalists and businessmen who deal with america 
taro kimura a former anchorman for japan broadcasting corp 
commented in a newspaper column 
one of the books authors shintaro ishihara a rightwing 
former cabinet minister went beyond the usual criticisms of us 
corporate shortsightedness and product quality he wrote that 
racial prejudice is at the base of usjapan frictions american 
whites realizing their culture is declining fear losing 
leadership to the yellowrace japanese he said 
but ishiharas outspokenness still represents an extreme the 
irony of usjapan frictions is that both sides the japanese in 
particular seem to try so hard to avoid misunderstanding 
many americans even president bush say they welcome japanese 
investment here and no one denies that many japanese are still 
more mad for the west than mad at it japanese companies still pay 
out monstrous fees for endorsements by such american celebrities as 
michael jackson who are rarely if ever seen in us ads most 
japanese cigarettes and many other products bear english names like 
peace and seven stars giving them the kind of cachet that 
frenchsounding brands once had for americans earlier in the 
century 
in february japanese foreign minister taro nakayama in an 
apparent reference to recent polls worried that some americans 
are expressing the view that the economic threat from japan is more 
serious than the military threat from the soviet union 
the big problem underlying such a fear he said is that 
it is impossible to guess where japans huge economic power is 
headed and under what philosophy or principles 
what we need is to make further efforts to convey our views 
and way of thinking clearly to americans 
accordingly kokusaika or internationalization has become 
the official rage in japan the government for example has 
proposed tax breaks for companies that increase imports to japan or 
make donations in the united states 
most japanese companies have rooted themselves in america as 
successfully as their products and more successfully than their 
european competitors according to a survey released last year by 
columbia universitys school of business 
the study found that on average japanese firms in the united 
states have outperformed european competitors in terms of low 
absentee rates low manager turnover and high product quality 
among other criteria 
in addition recent polls have found that while mistrust is on 
the rise a majority of americans still have favorable feelings 
toward japan 
so trade frictions aside whats wrong 
for one thing many japan observers contend that at the level of 
top management at least americanization of japaneseowned 
firms in the united states is just window dressing a commercial 
ploy like the marketing of christmas in tokyo department stores 
where few shoppers are christian 
while japans famed workerparticipation techniques such as 
quality circles may work on the factory floor american managers 
of japanese subsidiaries are still under the yoke of a shadow 
system of command from tokyo some experts say 
according to the first systematic survey of american managers in 
japanese corporations released last fall by the university of 
michigan most are excluded from planning and decisionmaking 
inside the companies and have little access to strategic 
information 
under the twotiered japanese employment system japanese 
managers do a three to fiveyear rotation abroad when they return 
to japan they are typically replaced by another japanese executive 
from overseas rather than the americans who have worked alongside 
them this has led to resentment among many american managers 
in addition the michigan study found that women and minorities 
still suffer widespread discrimination by japanese companies 
minoltas kusumoto who has been in the united states more than 
20 years and recently published a book on his experiences my 
bridge to america asks that americans be patient and recognize 
that japans tightly knit society can unravel itself only so fast 
many japanese are hesitant to disclose secrets to americans 
he says we came from companies with socalled lifetime 
employment we have complete trust in an employee because we know 
hes going to stay but here many people come and go and we think 
maybe hell give secrets to a competitor 
kusumoto says that only recently have he and other japanese 
executives felt strongly enough of the loyalty of longstanding 
american employees to promote them to top positions 
its not racial he says its a matter of trust

anger over the us trade deficit is fed by a 
growing belief in washington that japan once seen as a junior 
partner recreated in our image after world war ii has been playing 
by its own rules 
in his muchdiscussed 1988 book trading places clyde 
prestowitz ad former commerce department trade 
negotiator contends the japanese have always identified national 
security with economic security 
while america has been preoccupied fighting the cold war to 
the japan expert anbenefit of allies such as japan japan has taken our 
trusting 
freetraders for a ride prestowitz says 
unlike us policymakers hostile to direct government support 
of business japans powerful bureaucracy has generously subsidized 
its key industries in an exportatallcosts drive for global 
supremacy in consumer electronics automobiles and other important 
industries 
unlike us policymakers concerned mostly about keeping 
consumer prices low and thus markets open resourcepoor japan 
has subtly but effectively closed many of its markets to foreign 
imports how else but through waves of unanswered exports could the 
japanese pay for their raw materials 
the familiar pattern the prestowitz schoobut farren concedes that 
other countries are looking to japans 
model 
japan is running the risk of spreading the contagion of closed 
markets to the rest of world he says

a recent census bureau report showed that the 
proportion of blacks living in the south is growing for the first 
time in more than a century reversing a long trend of migration to 
the north heres the story of one black family that fled 
oppressive segregation in georgia only to return years later to a 
friendlier climate 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
it was 1964 the year of freedom 
summer that jerry hardee and his wife left georgia for the 
promise of the north 
it was the year that young blacks and whites from the north 
poured into the southeast with dreams of vanquishing deeply 
entrenched segregation 
hardee a teacher in a segregated high school where his students 
wore handmedown football jerseys from the nearby white school 
had had enough he and his family headed for chicago 
now hardee is back part of a migratory trend that has reversed 
the centurylong exodus of blacks seeking freedom from segregation 
and opportunity in the north 
we talked about it prayed about it and decided our youngsters 
were at the age where they needed to be closer to the areas where 
we grew up to get to know their relatives and be around black 
people says hardee an assistant to the president of valdosta 
state college 
i wanted to be closer to my family adds his wife wyonnie 
i was tired of the hustle and bustle i just wanted a different 
environment especially for the boys 
both of them took pay cuts to make the move but they were not 
alone in making the decision 
a census bureau report released in january said the share of 
blacks living in the south is growing for the first time in more 
than a century the proportion of american blacks living in 
southern states was 559 percent as of march 1988 up from 522 
percent in 1980 and the first increase in at least 100 years 
those numbers do not include hardees younger son a new york 
financial analyst and his elder son plans to return to the north 
for him the scene of happier days 
but the parents are glad to be home 
many blacks used to be ashamed to be from southern states 
hardee says now theyre proud there used to be nothing in the 
south for a black person except to work and go to church blacks 
now own businesses and the south generally is a better place for 
black people to live 
hardee grew up in the coastal georgia city of brunswick his 
father cs hardee was a baptist minister his mother macedonia 
earned 18 a week as a school cafeteria worker and 2 an evening as 
a maid 
the couple emphasized education and all of hardees seven 
brothers and sisters earned at least some college credits 
hardee earned a teaching degree at clark college in atlanta 
where he met his wife an atlanta native 
when he started teaching math at center high in waycross he 
found black students using handmedown books and football jerseys 
that were no longer needed in the white schools he earned extra 
money as a waiter in a white club and as a laborer in tobacco 
warehouses 
it was very disgusting to me to have a college degree and have 
to wait on tables to make ends meet he recalls the people i 
waited on had far less education but they treated me like nobody 
in order to get a tip i had to say yes sir and no sir i 
played the game 
his wife earned 50 cents an hour working in a pecan shelling 
plant she said blacks had to stand beside a conveyor belt in a 
noisy part of the plant and remove shells while whites worked as 
foremen or operated bagging machines in a room equipped with stools 
there were two of everything hardee recalls two public 
schools two sets of drinking fountains 
blacks had to sit in the balconies of movie theaters blacks 
were not allowed in downtown restaurants blacks had to sit in the 
back of buses and were expected to be off the streets by sundown 
if blacks were traveling you had to carry a box with your 
lunch hardee recalls if you had to go to the bathroom you 
had to stop and use the woods most service stations didnt have a 
restroom for blacks theyd have a big sign on the door saying 
whites only 
frustrated with his low teaching salary and lack of opportunity 
hardee accepted a grant to work on his masters degree at fisk 
university in nashville tenn he earned his advanced degree in 
1963 and accepted a teaching job at a predominantly white school in 
the chicago suburb of maywood 
his new job paid 10000 a year four times his salary in 
georgia he eventually was promoted to a 26000ayear job as the 
principal of a mostly white elementary school 
mrs hardee meantime took a job as a telephone operator for 
commonwealth edison co an electric utility she later became a 
customer service representative a job that increased her earnings 
to about 23000 a year

we had a nice house with a small mortgage hardee says a 
lot of people couldnt understand why we would give all that up to 
move back to the south 
but even in the north racism had continued to haunt them 
hardee recalls that he was turned down for an apartment in a white 
neighborhood he says banks and real estate agents discriminated 
against blacks by rejecting loan applications and refusing to sell 
them homes in certain neighborhoods 
there were incidents in various sections of the north that 
were as racist as what had gone on in the south he says there 
was always the matter of some unions that were opposed to having 
blacks as members 
hardee says he believes desegregation went smoother in the south 
than the north you didnt have the violent confrontations in 
most areas of the south as you did in the north even regarding 
busing 
hardee decided he should get a doctorate before returning to 
georgia so he commuted 120 miles twice a week for two years to 
earn the degree at northern illinois university the hardees 
arrived back in georgia in 1976 
in georgia hardee took a 17000ayear job as an administrator 
and math teacher at fort valley state college a historically black 
school near macon his wife became a secretary at the college 
the couples two teenage sons gerald and sidney had attended 
a mostly white lutheran school in illinois but at fort valley 
enrolled in peach county high school which will end a tradition of 
holding separate black and white proms this year 
gerald hardee now 29 says he plans to move back to illinois 
when he earns a degree at valdosta state college an avid wrestler 
he had to give up the sport because his new school didnt have a 
wrestling program 
going to school in georgia he says was a lot different 
people made fun of the way we talked i think i became quieter down 
here up there i was a star in football wrestling and had more 
friends 
sidney hardee 24 who found that some of those suburbs of 
chicago are more racist than the south graduated from yale in 
1988 and works as a financial analyst for solomon brothers inc in 
new york 
their father transferred to valdosta state in 1984 as an 
associate professor the next year he was appointed assistant to 
the president responsible for affirmative action programs and for 
helping black students succeed at a predominantly white college 
by the time i got back most schools were desegregated the 
civil rights act had been passed i think whites had made up 
their minds that they had to include blacks in the economic growth 
that was taking place in the south hardee says the whole 
attitude especially around the larger cities in the south had 
changed dramatically in the treatment of blacks in terms of jobs 
living conditions and in terms of services in the black community 
hardees wife concerned that too many black students are 
illprepared for college earned a degree in fort valley and began 
teaching in 1986 at the lomaxpinevale elementary school a mostly 
black school in a poor section of valdosta she stays late to work 
with students and often drives them home 
her dedication has not been overlooked she was selected 
valdostas teacher of the year for 198990 
when i left georgia i didnt have any white friends it was 
strictly segregated mrs hardee recalls when i came back we 
lived in a black community in fort valley but here in valdosta you 
live where your money will take you i have black and white 
friends 
hardee also is active in civic affairs he covers a 41county 
area making speeches on behalf of the college and teaches sunday 
school classes occasionally at bethel cme church 
the hardees live in a brick ranchstyle home surrounded by 
pines palms and a eucalyptus tree in a white middleclass 
neighborhood their carpeted living room has a piano a fireplace 
and a cabinet full of photo albums many of the pictures some 
faded and out of focus were taken during sightseeing trips to the 
grand canyon niagara falls and other attractions with their sons 
i couldnt have written a better script for my life hardee 
says although in the north i was financially all right there 
were other areas that were missing and there were things money 
cant buy 
people were closer in the south you passed people in the 
street white or black and they would speak those were the kind 
of things i could feel good about coming back to

moriarty is manager of the kilauea point national wildlife 
refuge in the northernmost inhabited part of the hawaiian islands 
a 45minute flight from honolulu 
crowning the crest of kauai islands sheer lava cliffs the 
refuge is dominated by a nowdark lighthouse listed on the national 
register of historic places 
with its dramatic coastline pounding surf jagged precipices 
and jadegreen rain forests the refuge once attracted few visitors 
because it was so hard to reach now nearly 300000 tourists a year 
come to visit 
they can train their binoculars on thousands of birds including 
four endangered species and a few elusive aviators nicknamed 
gooney birds albatrosses that mysteriously have been coming 
all the way from midway island to nest since 1976 
if the ocean is not too rough the visitors may also catch 
glimpses of pacific green turtles humpback whales that swim from

growing corps of volunteers moriarty must stretch his 400000 
annual budget to groom protect and enhance the three sanctuaries 
this is a very busy refuge were running all the time but 
its such a beautiful place it stimulates you to try and do the 
right thing says moriarty 49 who joined the fish and wildlife 
service in 1976 in 1989 his efforts were recognized by the 
national audubon society with its annual conservation award 
thanks to nearly a century of protection there are now more 
than 14 million birds of 18 species living in the hawaiian and 
pacific islands national wildlife refuges 
moriarty believes many birds stayed at kilauea because the 
lighthouse keepers protected them and their habitat since 1913 
when the lighthouse was built dogs and cats have been banned from 
the area 
there are 50 generations of feral cats out there just ready to 
destroy the only sea bird colony left in the state moriarty 
says rats are also a very big problem here the rats got into 
the sugar cane and ate it and over the years they threw cats out 
into the cane to control the rats and mice one of our biggest jobs 
is to make sure the fences surrounding this whole place are not 
breached or broken 
the grounded albatross in moriartys bathtub was probably 
attacked by a dog or cat that had managed to sneak beyond the wire 
barrier because seabirds have no natural predators on the outer 
islands they have no fear of other creatures or man and are 
easily killed

as for the sea turtle which had been decapitated moriarity 
speculated it too fell victim to an alien predator 
in the past 10 years all our populations are up because of 
the fencing but its a neverending battle he says 
before capt james cook discovered the islands in 1778 hawaiian 
natives also probably ate the birds dogs cats and mongooses 
imported to kill rats also decimated the flocks nearly every 
threatened bird population except the one at kilauea withdrew to 
the central pacific 
today there are five wetland refuges on the main hawaiian 
islands and six remote island sanctuaries that stretch all the way 
to french frigate shoals and howland island a mere dot in the 
ocean 1700 miles southwest of honolulu 
kilaueas original 31 acres were transferred from the coast 
guard to the fish and wildlife service in 1976 when the old 
lighthouse was deactivated for 63 years it had served as the main 
hawaiian landfall light for ships passing from the orient to the 
west coast 
the refuges acreage multipled in 1988 when a land developer 
donated 101 acres and sold an additional 38 for 16 million the 
addition extended the refuge 1 miles east along the coast to 
include the magnificent crater hill home of a major redfooted 
booby rookery and mokolea point it also encompasses the remains 
of kauai a volcano that has been dormant for more than a million 
years 
last year a new 1 million environmental education center opened 
just a few hundred feet from the old lighthouse it offers a 
180degree view of crater hill and the nearby meadow where the 
laysan albatrosses canter and tumble downhill until they gather 
speed for a graceful launch into flight above the roaring ocean 
the huge birds which have a mature wingspan of 7 feet are 
native to the northwestern hawaiian archipelago but were rarely 
seen until they showed up near kilauea in 1976 
since then very few chicks have survived because of predators 
or immature mating last year on the refuge grounds there were 18 
albatross nests but only nine chicks hatched and all of them were 
killed by wild cats 
this year we had 46 eggs but only 16 hatched moriarty 
said in late february so far cats have killed half of those 
chicks but we have trapped 21 cats including a very big tomcat we 
just caught which we think was doing most of the damage so 
hopefully were gaining on it and some of this years chicks will 
survive 
moriarty who earns about 31000 a year now lives alone in the 
small stone house alloted to the chief ranger his wife and three 
children have moved to an apartment in honolulu until the children 
graduate from high school the oldest is a freshman the youngest 
is in third grade sometimes they come home on weekends or he 
flies over to oahu to see them when he can get a weekend off 
to chase away the silence moriarty recently bought his first 
television set 
but the stuff is awful he says so most of the time i 
turn it off and just come back to the office to work 
id rather be with the birds any day than listen to most of 
that tv stuff

remembrances of the holocaust still shape 
israeli attitudes but with the emergence of a new generation there 
is less sensitivity about old taboos thus german composers and 
thinkers once considered anathemas are beginning to find audiences 
in the jewish state 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
slowly one step at a time israelis appear to 
be changing their feelings toward german artists and intellectuals 
tainted by nazism and are beginning to accept them into the 
nations cultural mainstream 
such as composer richard wagner philosopher martin heidegger 
and conductor herbert von karajan 
but their names and their works still arouse strong emotions in 
this jewish state which served as a refuge for hundreds of 
thousands of survivors of the nazi holocaust 
the changing attitudes were recently reflected in the visit to 
israel of wagners greatgrandson gottfried 42 who came here in 
an effort to erase or at least change the image of the composer 
as a symbol of the nazi regime 
he said he found wide support for lifting the jewish states ban 
on wagners music 
it was more than i had hoped for again and again people told 
me come back you are on the right way we are on your side 
wagner said 
antiwagner feelings still abound however 
holocaust survivor ben zion leitner said hearing wagner was like 
being back in the nazi labor camp where he was held as a teenager 
and where a sadistic commandant played wagners operas when guards 
whipped inmates 
nine years ago leitner stopped an attempt by the israel 
philharmonic orchestra to break the wagner ban and play the 
overture to tristan and isolde leitner an usher at tel avivs 
mann auditorium rushed to the stage pulled up his shirt to show 
naziinflicted scars and shouted play wagner over my body 
as long as survivors are still alive we must not play wagner 
in public leitner 65 said in a recent interview 
but gottfried wagner said he did not encounter protests aimed at 
him or his ancestor during his 12day visit which included four 
university lectures talks with israeli music lovers and 
intellectuals media interviews and an appearance on state 
television 
he told israelis that the 19th century composer did not deserve 
to be shunned arguing wagner was exploited by the nazis and 
members of the wagner clan close to hitler 
the younger wagner said his greatgrandfather had an ambiguous 
attitude toward jews 
on the one hand the composer expressed antisemitic views 
sparked by jealousy of successful jewish composers but on the 
other hand several of his close collaborators were jews in his 
stagework the composer did not express antisemitism gottfried 
wagner argued 
however he said it was up to the israelis to decide whether to 
end the ban 
israelis of all generations have the right to be skeptical 
toward wagner he said in a telephone interview from his home in 
cerro maggiore italy but a serious debate about wagner should 
finally make it possible to rediscover his international importance 
as an avant garde music drama man and prevent future political 
abuse of his work 
much of israels music establishment including most musicians 
of the israel philharmonic orchestra favors an end to the wagner 
ban 
you have to distinguish between the composing genius and the 
somewhat tainted human being said alfred frankenstein 84 a tel 
aviv music critic who fled berlin in 1935 we are the ones who 
are losing by not playing wagner 
the wagner case indicates that while the holocaust still shapes 
israeli attitudes there is less sensitivity about old taboos 
because of the passage of time and the emergence of a new 
generation that has no direct experience of nazi rule 
many people belonging to the generation concerned have died 
out there is still high awareness but its maybe less raw less 
emotional than in the 1950s and 60s said daniel shek a 
government official in his 30s whose czech parents survived the 
theresienstadt death camp

<TEXT>
greater historical and emotional distance to the holocaust also 
has sparked a reevaluation of other artists and thinkers 
associated with the nazis 
one example is german composer and conductor richard strauss 
18641949 who had been boycotted in israel because he served as 
head of musical affairs under the nazis in 1933 and 1934 
two recent recitals included strauss lieder and passed without 
protest on march 18 the symphony orchestra of rishon lezion a 
tel aviv suburb played for the first time a major strauss work 
the metamorphosen for string instruments 
it was received by the audience with shouts of bravo 
we cannot escape richard strauss it is a must for the israeli 
music lover to hear this work said noam sheriff the orchestras 
musical director 
sheriff recently asked his musicians to play wagner in 
rehearsal arguing that they would not become polished musicians 
without mastering wagner the musicians most in their 20s and 30s 
practiced die meistersinger without protest he said 
another example is german philospher martin heidegger a fervent 
hitler follower who denounced colleagues at freiburg university to 
the gestapo the nazi secret police 
the works of heidegger whose ideas influenced existentialists 
such as jean paul sartre have been taught at the hebrew university 
of jerusalem since 1982 
lecturer gabriel motzkin said that he included heidegger in his 
course on german philosphers because his work is too important to 
ignore but that he made students aware of heideggers political 
beliefs 
the dilemma faced by israeli music lovers or philosphy students 
is not present in the world of publishing 
totalitarianism by nature does not produce good books that are 
worth translating said beth elon editorial director of the 
domino publishing house in jerusalem 
she said her company refused to publish a hebrew version of 
hitlers manifesto mein kampf my struggle but said the 
considerations were purely commercial 
it was a dull unwieldy book real heavy going even the shock 
value wasnt shocking ms elon said 
these developments suggest that while certain barriers have 
fallen the trauma of the holocaust remains a central part of 
israeli life 
the berlin philharmonic orchestra for example never set foot 
in israel because its conductor herbert von karajan had been a 
member of the nazi party only karajans death last year paved the 
way for a tour of israel by the orchestra scheduled for this month 
this ambivalence also finds expression in other fields 
on the one hand germanmade cars and electrical appliances are 
proudly displayed as status symbols and elderly germanborn jews 
are no longer reluctant to speak their mother tongue in public 
on the other hand israeli leaders are cautious in approaching 
the question of establishing ties with east germany which refused 
for years to accept any official responsibility for the holocaust 
this ambivalence still shows up on the concert stage in israel 
playing wagner is not the same as playing other composers 
but gottfried wagner expressed optimisim the debate sparked 
by my visit gives reason to hope that wagner one day will emerge 
from under hitlers shadow he said

trucks are to fultonville what baseball is to 
cooperstown something that keeps the village out of red ink folks 
here talk about traffic on the new york thruway like farmers talk 
about the weather but when one truck stop operator hoisted an 
18wheeler atop a 30foot water tower as a beacon to truckers some 
officials thought he had gone too far 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
trucks dont outnumber people here but 
its close 
an average of more than 600 trucks a day rumble off the new york 
state thruway and cruise down riverside drive fultonvilles 
milelong midway of truck stops hotels and restaurants 
on any evening this tiny mohawk valley village of 777 people 
welcomes the 18wheelers spilling in to fill up on diesel fuel or 
get finetuned as their drivers shower chow down or bunk for the 
night 
after three oclock the trucks just cant find a place to 
park says wayne hazzard the villages fire chief 
trucks are everywhere theres even one in the sky that rig 
an 18wheeler painted red white and blue sits atop a 30foot 
water tower advertising the towns claim to fame 
welcome to fultonville 3 truck stops 4 motels 7 
restaurants 
trucks are to fultonville what baseball is to cooperstown 
something that keeps the village from both rural anonymity and red 
ink 
the average truck can hold 300 gallons of diesel fuel and the 
average trucker can hold a bit more than a sandwich and coffee 
after eight hours on the road with more than 13 million commercial 
vehicles including commercially registered vans and pickups 
riding the thruway yearly those figures mean dollar signs to 
fultonville 
the biggest thing to me is the sales tax money says mayor 
george wadsworth who estimates business generated from passing 
truckers enriches the villages tax coffers by about 50000 a year 
and it keeps going up and up 
the new york state thruway authority counted 244457 commercial 
vehicles using exit 28 at fultonville last year up from 235237 in 
1988 
thats heavy traffic for a town so small it doesnt even have 
its own doctor 
beyond riverside drive fultonville reveals itself to be not all 
that much a general store post office a few other businesses and 
a couple of blocks of aging houses 
but fultonville has shrewdly taken advantage of its location and 
small size to attract trucks navigating the trade route between new 
england and the upper midwest 
i kind of like it here says bob thompson a trucker passing 
through from new haven mich its a friendly little place and 
its halfway to anywhere you want to go 
fultonville has capitalized on throughtraffic before the town 
once sustained itself on the comings and goings of muledrawn ships 
along the erie canal which cut through the town in the 19th 
century 
that section of the erie canal was filled in by the beginning of 
this century but ironically enough it was the longgone canal 
that gave impetus to fultonvilles current heyday 
in the early 1950s state planners drew the route for the 
proposed new york state thruway right over the old path of the erie 
canal and right through the heart of fultonville 
many here thought it would be the towns death knell 
everyone was skeptical former mayor george snyder recalls 
but i knew there was nothing we could do to stop them we 
decided to make the best of it 
guessing the superhighways economic potential snyder wheedled 
and cajoled politicians in albany including gov thomas e dewey 
himself until fultonville got its own thruway exit 
under snyder the town also became one of the few in upstate new 
york to allow tandem trailers double barrels as truckers call 
them to exit to their roads 
snyder started fultonville truck center in 1954 with four diesel 
pumps and 12 rooms with a little diner downstairs when he sold the 
business in 1973 it had 37 pumps 
that same stop today is the roadway motor plaza the largest of 
the towns three stops offering 14 motel rooms and dispensing an 
average of 5 million gallons of gasoline a year next biggest is 
glen travel plaza followed by countryside fuel stop 
having multiple truck stops in small towns is not unusual says 
don lofstrom a vice president of the rochester nybased roadway 
motor plaza co which owns the largest stop 
its not uncommon for truck stops to be placed in the middle 
of no place on interstates lofstrom says it can be more 
convenient for trucks to stop in small towns like fultonville or 
buda texas than big cities like chicago or houston he says 
if its not unusual then its certainly laudable says 
roger king a spokesman for the national association of truck stop 
operators a virginiabased trade group its an example of what 
truck stops can be to a community 
people here talk about the thruway like farmers talk about the 
weather 
theres enough for all of us as long as we can get them off 
the thruway says vincent gramuglia countrysides owner 
gramuglia is the man who parked a retired semi 45 feet above the 
thruways roadside flora as a way of attracting business 
like a lighthouse is to boats this is to trucks gramuglia 
says 
the thruway authority thinks differently 
the authority considers the device to be the most 
hazardous gaudiest most novel and most distracting advertising 
device on the thruway system and a flagrant violation of its 
regulations says a complaint issued by the agency 
the authority says the truck must go because it does not honor a 
660foot right of way for advertising next to the road 
while the issue wends its way through state court the cause of 
the truck has spread beyond the confines of fultonville 
gramuglia has started peddling the save the truck tshirts 
to spread word of his troubles hes also generated a lot of 
support 
both fultonville and the montgomery county officials have come 
out with resolutions supporting gramuglia a bill has just been 
introduced before the state assembly 
theyre overreacting says state sen hugh farley a 
supporter of gramuglia i think they need a sense of humor about 
this

movie director david lynch known for his 
dark and surreal portraits of contemporary america is making his 
first venture into television with twin peaks a new wave 
gothic soap opera 
the twohour pilot for twin peaks will be televised by abc 
on sunday and the onehour drama series begins its regular run on 
thursday 
lynch who has his own little shop of horrors with such films as 
eraserhead blue velvet and the upcoming wild at heart 
says my partner mark frost and i were fishing for ideas for 
television and we hit on making it a soap opera with a murder 
mystery 
when we talked about television the main pull for me was being 
able to do a continuing story one where you can really get to know 
the people 
the two main characters are the murder investigators fbi agent 
dale cooper played by kyle maclachlan of lynchs blue velvet 
and dune and sheriff harry s truman played by michael 
ontkean laura palmer is the murder victim 
it opens with the murder laura palmer is like the center of a 
little universe of people what was she up to when she was 
murdered her death is a great way to get into the lives of the 
other characters itll take quite a while to resolve 
the series has a large ensemble cast including joan chen piper 
laurie madchen amick dana ashbrook richard beymer lara flynn 
boyle sherilyn fenn warren frost james marshall everett mcgill 
jack nance ray wise russ tamblyn and peggy lipton who is in her 
first series since the mod squad 
set in a pacific northwest lumber mill town twin peaks is 
ripping good fun 
fbi agent cooper whos fascinated by the tall trees dictates 
his every thought into a small tape recorder joan chen as the 
mill owner is an exotic but determined dragon lady everybody in 
town has a nasty little secret and the lid keeps popping off at 
inappropriate times its all done with a straight face but the 
impression is that lynch is laughing up his sleeve 
lynch says he often puts comedy into his work and in the future 
he hopes to do a comedy called one saliva bubble frost is a 
former writer for hill street blues which mixed black comedy 
with gritty drama 
i like light and dark lynch says i like a film that has 
contrast so you can feel both sides i believe people tend to 
remember my films as darker than they really are i think people 
identify with a struggle we like the idea of overcoming obstacles 
in our path im kind of interested in that 
i believe in a strong story and one that is easily followed 
once the audience is pulled in by the story you can throw in a few 
curves as long as you dont throw them off the track i like curve 
balls 
despite his fascination with such stories lynch looks 
relentlessly ordinary his dark brown hair is combed straight back 
and he wears a black coat over a white shirt that is buttoned to 
the top he has a slight facial resemblance to john larroquette of 
night court 
twin peaks reflects his small town upbringing he was born 
in montana and grew up in the pacific northwest and virginia his 
father moved often as a research scientist for the department of 
agriculture 
lynch is a man of strong habits he frequents the same places 
and orders the same food day after day with a preference for junk 
food he also tends to use the same actors in his films 
maclachlan starred in dune and blue velvet jack nance 
the man who finds laura palmers body in twin peaks has been 
in every lynch film except the elephant man laura dern and 
isabella rossellini lynchs current romantic interest were in 
blue velvet and the new wild at heart 
lynch says he got into television at the urging of his agent 
tony krantz we kept telling him to go away but one day we 
started getting some ideas he says the ideas were perfect for 
television 
i really liked working on television its very fast the cast 
and the crew and everyone helped make it a great experience i 
learned a lot about working fast i like the momentum and the 
feeling of having to go more quickly as long as you dont go so 
fast you hurt the picture 
lynch acknowledges that film critics have analyzed his work but 
says he operates by a simple credo 
be true to the story and the ideas in translating them to the 
screen he says if youre true to that you will have an honest 
picture the rest is up to the audience they have the final say

from cats to nicholas nickleby to 
aspects of love trevor nunn is among the worlds most 
successful and soughtafter directors of both plays and musicals 
but blockbuster shows constitute only one aspect of his eclectic 
career shakespeares plays ts eliots verse a musical about 
chess an obscure english novel everything is fodder for nunns 
vision of the stage as a great populist meeting place 
im interested in theater in all its forms and theater 
audiences in all their forms the bearded 50yearold director 
said one evening after work at his office in londons theater 
district where he has four musicals running at the same time 
cats based on the ts eliot poems has been running since 
1981 starlight express a show that casts actors as trains 
opened in 1984 les miserables the victor hugo 
novelturnedmusical codirected by john caird followed in 1985 
and last year came aspects of love based on a littleknown 
1950s english novel about the complex entanglements of five lovers 
but for 18 years he also headed or coheaded the royal 
shakespeare company one of britains two major statesubsidized 
theaters he left it in 1986 but retains the title director 
emeritus 
accordingly his credits present an intriguing mix of romeo 
and juliet and rollerskating trains hedda gabler and 
anthropomorphized cats aspects and alls well that ends 
well les miserables and macbeth 
i dont like categories i dont like signatures says nunn 
defining a career that began at cambridge university where he 
directed the footlights revue 
i dont see any disparity between different types of work to 
have eclecticism only requires a theater community with sufficient 
variety and sufficient promotion of that variety 
whether directing the bard in stratforduponavon or a mammoth 
musical on broadway nunn feels theres no point in doing it for 
the critics or the already converted 
but its musicals that have given nunn fame and wealth most 
often in conjunction with composer andrew lloyd webber 
in 1981 they paired up on a song cycle of eliots old 
possums poems for practical cats which lloyd webber thought 
might make a charming childrens entertainment 
theater insiders were disdainful but the result was cats 
currently purring its way toward a gross of over 460 million in 
the united states alone 
nunn says the show married a love of language to his 
longstanding interest in musicals indeed he had turned down 
several previous offers that didnt seem right including 42nd 
street on broadway which he felt an american should do 
during cats rehearsals lloyd webber gave nunn a copy of the 
1955 novel aspects of love by david garnett nine years later 
their musical version still running in london is now playing at 
the broadhurst theater in new york 
the show concerns a lovestruck quintet pursuing their 
emotionally dangerous liaisons in the south of france four of its 
stars originated their parts on the west end 
michael ball a briton making his broadway debut plays alex an 
english army recruit whose love for a french actress ann crumb 
shapes his entire life kevin colson is alexs dilettantish uncle 
george kathleen rowe mcallen plays georges italian mistress 
giulietta 
its a piece of work interested in character and the 
character is artfully and cleverly and touchingly presented nunn 
says 
as production costs rise on broadway and critical pressures 
mount lloyd webber is one of the few theater artists whose 
boxoffice clout makes him impervious to the reviews which can be 
harsh 
nunns career has ridden its own critical roller coaster in 
london plaudits have been tempered with accusations that he has 
sold out to the commercial theater sacrificing firstrate work in 
the classics for the ready money of the major musical on broadway 
both starlight express and chess were poorly received 
many of the things ive done have run long periods of time no 
thanks to critical reactions which were frequently very hostile 
he says therefore i have every reason to trust the general 
public 
by and large that public has confirmed his trust nicholas 
nickleby an adaptation of the charles dickens novel opened to 
lukewarm reviews in london in 1980 then became a popular favorite 
on both sides of the atlantic despite a broadway top ticket of 
100 
les miserables adapted from victor hugos epic novel got 
mixed reviews at its 1985 london bow but swept the 1987 tony 
awards on broadway and won international acclaim 
occasionally nunn misjudges his staging of chess the tim 
riceabba musical ran more than three years on the west end but a 
scant 10 weeks on broadway in 1988 a broadway revival of 
nicholas nickleby also flopped 
in january nunns london production of the american musical 
the bakers wife closed after 56 performances at a loss of 
almost 17 million 
its flop was very disappointing denting as well as 
daunting he says 
the musical starred his second wife australian performer sharon 
lee hill in the lead role the couple who met when she appeared 
in cats have two daughters he has a son by his previous wife 
actress janet suzman 
away from the highstakes world of musicals nunn continues to 
mount landmark productions of the classics last fall he returned 
to the royal shakespeare company to stage othello with opera 
singer willard white as the jealous moor and ian mckellen as his 
nemesis iago 
nunn has also triumphed with more obscure shakespeare works his 
1982 alls well that ends well seen in london and new york 
made one of the bards socalled problem plays hauntingly clear 
and poignant 
plans for the future include another collaboration with david 
edgar who adapted nicholas nickleby and a staging of 
shakespeares twelfth night which nunn calls one of the 
unassailable masterpieces of the western world

thats hogwash and is asking the government to do something about 
it

the price of crude oil should fall in the 
apriljune quarter before rising in the last half of the year the 
worlds leading oil producers believe 
opec secretarygeneral subroto said sunday the 13 organization 
of petroleum exporting countries and more than a dozen independent 
oil producers differed on how steep the price fall would be but 
agreed it would not be sharp 
in the short term we foresee some weakness in the second 
quarter but in the third and fourth quarter the market will 
strengthen subroto said everybody seems to agree there will 
not be a dramatic change in price 
subroto made the comments to reporters during a conference of 
experts from opec and independent producers including the soviet 
union and norway the us oilproducing states of alaska and 
texas and the canadian province of alberta 
over the longer term subroto said delegates expected world 
crude oil demand to grow about 32 percent to 33 percent per year 
but he said there also were differences of opinion on that subject 
the experts met over the weekend following an opec ministerial 
meeting in vienna last week the cartel voted to maintain a 
production ceiling of 22 million barrels per day for the apriljune 
quarter 
oil prices have fallen since the opec meeting because of lack of 
firm guarantees by member states not to overshoot individual 
production quotas and because of the end of high winter demand 
opec is believed to be producing about 1 million barrels a day 
more of crude oil than the market can absorb opec ministers are to 
meet meet may 25 to consider production and pricing policy for the 
cartel for the second half of 1990 
delegates to the muscat conference said no decisions were made 
on production or pricing policies 
oman which is not an opec member has played a major role in 
generating support of other independents to restrict oil output and 
help opecs targeted prices 
omani minister of petroleum and minerals saeed ahmed shanfari 
said common understanding was still needed between the two 
blocs on short medium and longterm policies even though world 
oil demand was rising 
weve proved that the independent oil producers and exporters 
are serious in their efforts and are ready to shoulder part of the 
responsibility with opec to achieve stability of the market and its 
prices he said saturday 
opec faced with a collapsing oil market in 1986 pressed for 
the support of major producers outside the cartel to coordinate 
output to stabilize prices around 18 a barrel but rising world 
demand helped strengthen prices beyond 18 
a 1988 conference similar to the one in muscat produced an 
agreement for a selfimposed 5 percent production cutback to 
bolster opec efforts 
the market has steadily improved with an unexpected rise in 
demand induced by dwindling production levels in the united states 
and the soviet union as well as other majors tapping into 
possible high demand from eastern europe also is being considered

the dollar rose against most major foreign 
currencies except the british pound in early european trading 
today gold prices fell sharply 
foreign currency dealers said trading was a little nervous 
because of continued yen weakness and market fears about tensions 
in the independenceminded baltic republics of the soviet union 
the lithuania situation is keeping everybody on the edge 
said one trader at a us bank in frankfurt west germany as 
long as there is the threat of military conflict the dollar will 
remain firm 
traders said the dollar was also benefiting from the weakness of 
the yen following a largely uneventful meeting friday between us 
treasury secretary nicholas brady and finance minister ryutaro 
hashimoto of japan 
brady made it clear he doesnt want to go to extraordinary 
lengths for the yen said a trader in milan italy the view is 
that the yens weakness is tied to uncertainties about the stock 
market and fiscal yearend considerations 
the dollars scope for upward movement is limited by fear of 
central bank intervention traders said 
in tokyo where trading ends as europes business day begins 
the dollar rose 133 yen to 15640 yen its highest close since 
jan 13 1987 later in london it was quoted at 15598 yen 
other dollar rates at midmorning compared with late fridays 
prices included 17165 west german marks up from 17100 15195 
swiss francs up from 15179 57725 french francs up from 57645 
19230 dutch guilders down from 19249 126100 italian lire up

the tokyo stock exchanges key index soared by 
nearly 5 percent today in its secondbiggest singleday rise ever 
while the dollar gained more against the japanese yen despite 
central bank intervention 
the nikkei stock average of 225 selected issues which gained 
52882 points last friday surged 146833 points or 483 percent 
today closing at 3184049 
the gain was second only to the 203732point rise on oct 21 
1987 when shares prices rebounded from the worldwide black 
monday crash 
last monday the index dived 135320 points at the start of a 
threeday plunge that took the index below 30000 before it began 
rebounding friday 
many investors believed the index had bottomed out last week 
when it fell a total of 27731 points in three days securities 
dealers said 
shares were broadly bought in anticipation of the actual start 
of the new fiscal year a dealer with nomura securities said on 
condition of anonymity japans fiscal year formally begins on 
april 1 but after today new contracts are counted under the new 
fiscal year 
while share prices rose almost across the board construction 
and electric power issues led the gains 
bluechip electrical shares such as toshiba hitachi and sony 
were also big gainers 
volume traded on the first section of the exchange was estimated 
at 700 million shares compared with last fridays 66898 million 
shares 
on the currency market the dollar closed at 15640 yen up 133 
yen from last fridays close of 15507 yen after opening at 15565 
yen it ranged between 15550 yen and 15640 yen 
the dollars close was its highest since 15600 on jan 13 
1987 it now has gained 420 yen in the last seven trading days 
previously the weak yen has been cited as one factor behind 
declining stock prices the sagging bond market was another 
the price of benchmark no 119 10year government bonds due 
june 1999 finished today at 8682 yen up 022 yen from fridays 
close of 8660 points with the yield dropping 0045 percentage 
points to 7170 percent 
currency dealers attributed the dollars strength today to the 
markets disappointment over fridays talks between japanese 
finance minister ryutaro hashimoto and us treasury secretary 
nicolas brady in los angeles 
nothing came out of the the talks that would help stabilize 
exchange rates said naoto kawamura a senior dealer with the bank 
of tokyo 
hashimoto and brady said in a statement that they discussed a 
range of issues and remained committed to cooperation in the 
exchange markets a reference to efforts to stop the yens slide 
against the dollar 
the bank of japan the nations central bank sold up to 1 
billion in efforts to support the yen traders estimated the bank 
does not comment on its market intervention activities 
due to the relatively weak position on market intervention by 
the monetary authorities the bullish sentiment toward the dollar 
remains strong said kozo yoshida a dealer with mitui bank 
yoshida said speculators accounted for most of todays early 
dollarbuying

former exxon valdez skipper joseph 
hazelwood has left town and the voices of protest that marked the 
first anniversary of the nations worst oil spill have quieted 
now the legal cleanup begins 
with more than 150 lawsuits on file against exxon corp 
hazelwood and others alaskas court calendars will be clogged for 
years to come 
exxon and alyeska pipeline co the oil company consortium that 
operates the transalaska oil pipeline and valdez terminal also 
have been indicted by a federal grand jury on five criminal counts 
stemming from the grounding of the exxon valdez 
the tanker hemorrhaged nearly 11 million gallons of alaska crude 
oil into prince william sound on march 24 1989 killing countless 
birds fish and other wildlife and fouling the rocky shore for 
hundreds of miles 
as many as 75 people marked the anniversary saturday with a 
protest outside alyeska headquarters in anchorage someone 
splattered the building with a plastic bag filled with chocolate 
syrup intended to symbolize spilled crude 
environmental groups held lowkey events to raise money for 
spillprevention efforts and to pursue valdezrelated lawsuits 
gov steve cowper called n exxon to settle quickly the flood of 
lawsuits filed by environmental groups fishermen native alaskans 
and the state 
the lawsuits are not scheduled for trial until 1992 if exxon 
does not settle all valid spillrelated lawsuits litigation could 
drag on into the next century cowper said 
a lawyer coordinating the lawsuits said he wants to set a 
precedent 
we have to make it unprofitable to pollute said attorney 
macon cowles of boulder colo 
the national wildlife federation natural resources defense fund 
and other plaintiffs want exxon to set up a fund to pay for 
environmental damage assessment restoration and the purchase of 
wildlife preserves 
cowles said he might even try to collect damages on behalf of 
plants and animals 
were trying to come up with a way to put a value on the 
devastation to life he said cowles said it might take 10 years 
to assess that damage 
hazelwood the only individual charged criminally in the spill 
was convicted last thursday of a state misdemeanor charge of 
neglegent discharge of oil but was acquitted of seconddegree 
criminal mischief a felony and misdemeanor charges of reckless 
endangerment and operating ship under the influence of alcohol 
in an emotional hearing on friday superior court judge karl 
johnstone sentenced the skipper to spend 1000 hours helping to 
clean up oiled beaches he also ordered hazelwood to pay 50000 in 
restitution 
hazelwoods lawyers said they would appeal the conviction and 
the highly unusual sentence which they asserted was harsher than 
the law allows 
the judge said he will stay hazelwoods sentence once the appeal 
is filed 
in an interview before he left alaska hazelwood said he was 
troubled by the enormous environmental devastation in prince 
william sound 
it was terrible he said its like any devastation its 
like chernobyl or medical waste washing up on my back yard in long 
island ny it was a terrible tragedy theres no getting 
around it 
but hazelwood 43 was prevented from giving his own view of 
what caused the exxon valdez to run aground on bligh reef his 
lawyers feared his comments might affect the outcome of the 
lawsuits against him 
meanwhile the coast guard plans to hold hearings on whether 
hazelwoods maritime masters license should be suspended renewed 
or revoked coast guard commandant paul yost said 
but yost appeared to partially absolve hazelwood of 
responsibility saying a fully qualified third mate ran the 
vessel aground 
hazelwood was below deck when the accident occurred third mate 
gregory cousins was on the bridge directing a helmsman at the 
wheel jurors in hazelwoods trial rejected the claim that the 
skipper was reckless to leave the bridge in cousins control 
in the federal indictments exxon is charged with staffing the 
tanker with people who were physically or mentally incapable of 
performing their duties hazelwoods acquittal could weigh in the 
companys favor on that charge

a petition has been filed to decertify the union 
representing employees at nordstrom incs tacoma store the 
retailer said 
nordstrom said sunday that it was notified of the filing by the 
national labor relations board 
the store has 310 employees represented by local 367 of the 
united food and commercial workers union to hold a decertification 
election at least 30 percent of the employees in a bargaining unit 
must sign the petition 
a union leader said sunday that the petition was expected and 
was an attempt by nordstrom to divert attention from its problems 
i dont think its serious said joe peterson president of 
ufcw local 1001 in seattle 
nordstrom an upscale department store retailer with a 
nearlegendary reputation for customer service has been embroiled 
in a bitter fight with the ufcw over labor relations and pay 
practices 
last month the state department of labor and industries acting 
on a ufcw complaint ruled nordstrom had violated state laws by 
failing to pay some employees for attending meetings delivering 
merchandise checking inventory writing thankyou notes to 
customers and doing other chores outside normal working hours 
later the nlrb accused the company of bypassing the union and 
bargaining directly with employees over whether they are owed back 
wages union complaints on other issues remain under nlrb review 
the union also filed a classaction lawsuit accusing the company 
of wage and hour violations 
since june 1989 nordstrom has been seeking changes in contracts 
with locals 367 and 1001 in seattle to allow employees to choose 
whether to join the union the ufcw only represents employees in 
the seattle and tacoma area out of 60 nordstrom stores and 30000 
employees in six states 
in a news release sunday the store said that position ignited 
the unions expensive nationally funded smear campaign against 
nordstrom 
it is apparent that many of our employees are unhappy with 
their union and feel the ufcw has been inaccurately representing 
their views said joe demarte nordstroms corporate personnel 
director they have been forced to take matters into their own 
hands 
we hope an election date will be set promptly although we 
fully anticipate the union will file a string of unfair labor 
practice charges to delay and block the decertification process 
peterson had said earlier that the union was preparing more 
federal labor charges after receiving complaints of management 
pressure to sign statements supporting nordstrom to participate in 
rallies for the company and to join the decertification campaign 
nordstrom is attempting to divert attention from its problems 
by suggesting its employees dont support our efforts peterson 
said the fact is most nordstrom employees have gone underground 
in fear of reprisals or of being blacklisted 
nlrb spokesman larry mccargar said the agency probably would not 
act on any decertification petitions until pending unfair labor 
practices complaints are resolved

seabrook nuclear power plant operators 
brought the reactor past 5 percent power for the first time as they 
gear up for longdelayed commercial operation 
opponents meanwhile are preparing another appeal they hope 
will pull the plug on the 65 billion plant 
seabrook initially was planned to generate electricity 
commercially in 1979 at a fraction of the cost but was completed in 
1986 and licensed only this month 
plant operators brought the 1150megawatt reactor above 5 
percent power sunday evening spokesman ron sher said during 
lowpower atomic testing in june the reactor remained below 5 
percent power 
sher said power would stay between 8 percent and 10 percent for 
several weeks to test turbines that will drive electrical 
generators seabrook officials have estimated it would take two to 
three months to bring the reactor to 100 percent power 
after repeated construction cost overruns and regulatory delays 
focusing largely on evacuation plans for crowded beaches less than 
two miles from the plant the nuclear regulatory commission 
approved seabrooks commercial license on march 1 
the us circuit court of appeals in washington declined to 
block the license on march 14 though it has yet to rule on 
seabrook opponents appeals the commission signed the license the 
next day and plant operators started the reactor tuesday 
operators briefly shut down the reactor thursday because of a 
false electrical alarm a commission inspector called the shutdown 
conservative 
a tardy shutdown during last years lowpower testing is the 
subject of an appeal that seabrook foes will argue before an nrc 
panel this week 
new hampshire yankee seabrooks operator acknowledged 
improperly delaying the shutdown after a valve malfunctioned june 
22 and plant management was realigned but seabrook officials said 
it was an isolated problem 
an nrc atomic safety and licensing board ruled in october that 
the delayed shutdown was not a significant safety issue and 
rejected a request by massachusetts officials for new hearings on 
seabrook management and training 
six massachusetts communities lie within seabrooks 10mile 
evacuationplanning zone and state officials oppose the plant 
the seacoast antipollution league and the new england coalition 
on nuclear pollution are joining massachusetts in appealing the 
licensing board ruling an nrc atomic safety and licensing appeal 
board plans to hear the opponents oral arguments and plant 
supporters replies on tuesday in bethesda md

the nations savings and loans lost 192 
billion in 1989 the worst performance ever and the third 
consecutive record the government said today 
with a 65 billion loss in the final three months of the year 
red ink for all of 1989 easily topped the previous record of 134 
billion in 1988 that had topped what was then a record of 78 
billion in 1987 
but james freund acting chief economist of the office of thrift 
supervision offered a glimmer of hope for this year pointing out 
that the bulk of the losses occurred at institutions either taken 
over by the government or targeted for takeover 
i would presume by this time next year the industry would 
be smaller and the losses would be smaller he said 
in the fourth quarter for instance the 485 institutions either 
under government control or targeted for government control 
compiled all of the industrys losses while the rest of the 
industry 2393 sampls actually posted a slight profit of 28 
million 
the governments numbers also revealed the cost of the 
governments slow start in shutting down failed institutions 
losses on operations for the 485 totaled 26 billion in the 
octoberdecember period an average loss of 29 million a day 
once these institutions are shut down or sold the industry 
would no longer have to absorb that continuing expense since 
august the government has disposed of 52 sampls and announced plans 
recently to close or sell another 140 by the end of june 
thrift industry deposits totaled 946 billion at the end of 
1989 down 26 billion from a year earlier most of the shrinkage 
occurred as institutions sold off assets in order to meet tough new 
financial standards enacted last august 
the number of institutions open both failed and solvent 
totaled 2878 down from 2949 a year ago and from a peak of 3246 
in 1985 
1989 was clearly a year of substantial change and retrenchment 
for the thrift industry freund said

firstquarter pace to total 893 baker hughes inc reported monday 
the decrease in rig activity conforms to previous first quarters

jr an economist for baker hughes 
the yeartodate count however remains well ahead of the 1989 
tally when 766 rigs were working baker hughes said 
baker hughes rig count the widelywatched industry index of 
drilling activity reflects the number of rotary rigs actively 
exploring for oil and gas as of last friday not the number of

merged with baker international corp of orange calif has kept 
track of the rig count since 1940 
in december 1981 at the height of the oil boom the rig count 
reached a peak of 4500 but oil prices plunged to less than 10 
per 42gallon barrel in the summer of 1986 prompting a collapse in 
the rig count that bottomed out at 663 the lowest since hughes

the supreme court accepting a case that could 
affect millions of working women said today it will review a 
ruling that lets employers exclude all women of childbearing age 
from some hazardous jobs 
the justices agreed to study an automobile battery 
manufacturers policy of banning women who cannot prove they are 
infertile from jobs that expose them to lead 
a decision is expected sometime in 1991 
a federal appeals court last year upheld the fetal protection 
policy rejecting arguments that banning women from highpaying if 
hazardous factory jobs amounts to illegal sex discrimination 
exposure to lead the principal material used in making 
batteries is a health risk to workers and to the fetuses of 
pregnant workers 
since 1982 the battery division of johnson controls inc based 
in milwaukee has barred women at its factories from jobs involving 
exposure to lead and from jobs that through transfers or 
promotions could progress to leadexposed duties 
eight employees and the united auto workers union challenged the 
policy in court among the women who sued was one who had submitted 
to sterilization to preserve her job and a 50yearold divorcee 
the suit alleged that the policy violated a part of the civil 
rights act of 1964 called title vii barring sexual bias in 
employment 
us district judge robert w warren in milwaukee ruled for 
johnson controls based on both sides pretrial arguments no trial 
was held 
the 7th us circuit court of appeals upheld his ruling by a 74 
vote last sept 26 
in other action today the high court 
agreed to consider giving federal regulators more authority to 
lower electricity rates setting the stage for a decision that 
could affect more than 49 million homes 
the court said it will review a ruling that barred the federal 
energy regulatory commission from slashing rate increases to 
customers in 15 ohio communities 
agreed to hear an appeal challenging the authority of states 
to house convicted murderers on death rows and keep them apart 
from other inmates 
the justices said they will review the appeal of nebraska death 
row inmate john rust who says such segregation is without 
penological justification and grossly disproportionate 
punishment 
agreed to review a ruling that if upheld could reinstate 
forced busing for the racial desegregation of oklahoma city okla 
elementary schools 
the court must decide whether the city school board acted 
lawfully when in 1985 it returned to a neighborhood schools plan 
for children in kindergarten through fourth grade 
refused to revive a lawsuit stemming from one of the nations 
most publicized cases of alleged child abuse at the nowdefunct 
mcmartin preschool in manhattan beach calif 
the court without comment let stand a ruling that threw out 
the suit against a private child welfare group and one of its 
therapists by two of the preschools former teachers 
refused to extend a key civil rights law to protect 
noncitizens from private as well as governmental bias 
the court over two dissenting votes let stand a ruling that 
the first national bank of commerce in new orleans did not 
discriminate illegally against jeetendra bhandari when it denied 
his application for a bank credit card because he is not a us 
citizen 
rejected an appeal by a leading conglomerate found to have 
fraudulently obtained a 75 million bank loan to develop natural 
gas fields in mississippi 
the court without comment left intact a ruling that could 
subject wr grace amp co to major punitive damages in a lawsuit by 
the federal deposit insurance corp 
in the fetalprotection case judge john l coffey wrote for the 
appeals court that the differing treatment of women employees was 
based on a business necessity and added we are also 
convinced that johnson controls fetal protection policy could be 
upheld under the bona fide occupational qualification defense 
the appeals court concluded that the policy is reasonably 
necessary to industrial safety 
three of the appeals courts four dissenting judges wrote 
opinions the most scathing of which was authored by judge frank 
easterbrook a conservative appointee of president ronald reagan 
calling it likely the most important sexdiscrimination case 
in any court since congress enacted title vii easterbrook 
said if the majority is right then by one estimate 20 million 
industrial jobs would be closed to women for many substances in 
addition to lead pose fetal risks 
the law would allow employers to consign more women to 
womens work while reserving betterpaying but more hazardous 
jobs for men easterbrook said title vii was designed to 
eliminate rather than perpetuate such matching of sexes to jobs 
he added cases show that many additional women are 
affected by restrictions placed on other jobs such as the xray 
technician jobs that exposed embryos to radiation concern about 
emissions from computers and their terminals has led to proposals 
that could restrict access even to traditional office jobs 
johnson controls has battery plants in several states 
a california appeals court recently ruled that the fetal 
protection policy is illegal sex discrimination under state not 
federal law 
the case is international union vs johnson controls 891215

the nations two largest 
commercial banks amro bank and algemene bank nederland abn have 
begun merger talks aimed at eventually creating the worlds 
20thlargest bank officials of both companies announced monday 
the merger would transform the two banks into a conglomerate 
that could act as a global player using the entire european 
community as its home base according to abn chief r hazelhoff 
but claiming that the talks were still in an embryonic stage 
bank officials refrained from providing details on the projected 
merger which surprised the dutch financial world 
with reported assets of 180 billion guilders or 90 billion 
amro bank ranks as this nations largest commercial bank while abn 
ranks second with assets reportedly totaling 173 billion guilders 
or 865 billion 
based upon recent developments in the markets for financial 
services we are of the opinion that concentration of forces of 
forces is strongly advisable the two banks said in a statement 
such a concentration will mean a stronger basis for our 
position in several segments of the domestic market according to 
the statement internationally as a result of both europe 1992 
and developments outside europe an important strengthening can be 
attained through a merger 
last year a merger between amro bank and the belgian societe 
generale de banque foundered on what the dutch bank called cultural 
differences 
that planned merger was also inspired by the expected 
concentration of financial forces in the fully integrated european 
market which is expected to be established by 1992 
at present abn which employs 32000 people has 711 offices in 
the netherlands and 269 offices in foreign countries amro bank has 
762 offices in the netherlands and 106 offices abroad its payroll 
totalling 24000 employees 
based on assets the new combination would rank as the worlds 
20thlargest commercial bank just behind the deutsche bank of west 
germany according to figures provided by the trade journal

weight loss clinics need closer scrutiny by 
the federal trade commission a congressman said today as he opened 
hearings to investigate the growing fatfighting industry 
most lay counselors and specialists in commercial diet clinics 
are undertrained lay people operating without any medical 
supervision said rep ron wyden dore 
he said products sold in such clinics are untested with little 
or no scientific proof of their safety and effectiveness 
officials of major commercial weightloss programs declined to 
testify the subcommittee staff said before the hearing 
wyden told ftc chairwoman janet steiger that he wanted her 
agency to check weightloss clinics for possible fraud and to work 
with state attorneys general and other consumer fraud agencies to 
police them 
steiger who was the first witness before wydens house small 
business subcommittee on regulation said her agency has been 
trying to weed out the most outrageous of the weightloss schemes 
diet pills that are supposed to make you thinner while you sleep 
for example 
now were taking a closer look at the weight loss clinics 
she said 
she advocated consumer education and said a task force within 
her agency is trying to find ways the federal government can 
coordinate with state government 
we are encouraging state criminal enforcement where it is 
appropriate she said 
witnesses included women who had had medical problems after 
going to weight loss clinics 
a subcommittee staff report on the diet industry said that 
despite optimistic claims an estimated 90 percent of all dieters 
who lose 25 pounds in a diet program regain the weight within two 
years 
it said americans spent 33 billion on weight loss in 1989 
onethird of it for diet clinics alone it cited a warning by the 
american medical association that some diet formulas could lead to 
complications and even fatalities among dieters 
the worrisome trend is away from exercise and toward liquid 
protein diets virtually all of them sponsored by physicians and 
hospitals and socalled fast diets which ignore nutritional 
safety the report said 
much of the growth in the industry has been due to heavy 
advertising which the ftc has largely ignored the report said 
the food and drug administration has authority to regulate the 
diet products 
but in reality few if any of these diet gadgets drugs or 
food have been tested for safety and effectiveness before patients 
and consumers become unsuspecting guinea pigs the staff report 
said 
it contended that many socalled diet experts including 
physicians have little knowledge about how to treat obesity the 
products are often sold by people whose principal training is in 
sales not nutrition or medicine it said 
the report cited industry research estimating the nation has 65 
million dieters including half of all women it said 60 percent of 
all women are usually dieting in some form and 18 percent of all 
adults are constantly dieting 25 percent of american adults are 
obese and 13 percent are severely overweight

avon products inc and an investment group that 
owns 99 percent of avons common stock announced monday they had 
reached a settlement to end a planned proxy fight by the group 
the settlement also ends for now a challenge to the big 
cosmetics companys existing management by chartwell associates a 
limited partnerhip 
a joint announcement said the avon board has agreed to nominate 
two candidates proposed by chartwell for election to the board of 
directors at the annual meeting in new york on may 3 the board 
also will nominate two incumbent avon directors 
under the settlement the directors will establish a committee 
to consider ways of boosting value for avon stockholders members 
of the special panel will be james e preston avons chairman and 
chief executive officer three incumbent members of the avon board 
and the two chartwell nominees 
the panel will examine alternatives to maximize value such as a 
recapitalization asset sales an outright sale of avon or a 
leveraged buyout 
another key element of the settlement is the resignation of john 
p rochon as vice chairman of mary kay corp parent of mary kay 
cosmetics which is a dallasbased rival of avons in the direct 
sales business rochon will become a consultant to avon for a year 
and report to preston 
his assignment will be to assist the special committee avon 
spokesman john cox said 
rochon is a principal of chartwell an investment group which 
owns about 75 percent of avons voting shares or roughly 99 
percent of the companys outstanding common stock 
chartwell recently launched a proxy fight to win four seats on 
avons 11member board proxy fights essentially are attempts by 
outsiders to overthrow a companys management by obtaining enough 
proxies to influence a corporate election a proxy is the legal 
right to exercise a shareholders vote 
given the amount of avon stock held by investors potentially 
hostile to management it had appeared probable that chartwell 
would succeed in capturing at least two seats if it continued to 
wage its proxy battle the terms of the avonchartwell settlement 
therefore recognize the inevitable while averting the expenses a 
proxy contest would have entailed 
in addition to rochon other partners in chartwell include 
members of the fisher real estate family of new york and gordon p 
getty the oil heir the chartwell candidates who will be nominated 
to avons board are anthony fisher and marc e leland representing 
the getty interests 
commenting on the settlement chartwell said we believe that 
our agreement with avon serves the best interests of all avon 
stockholders we look forward to working with jim preston and 
sharing ideas with him and with our fellow directors 
incumbent avon board members who will be up for reelection are 
preston and charles s locke chairman and chief executive officer 
of morton international inc the incumbents not standing for 
election again are emil mosbacher jr an investor and independent 
oil and gas producer and merlin nelson former vice chairman of 
amf inc 
last year avon the worlds biggest direct selling company drew 
several unsolicited takeover proposals in rejecting the offers 
avon speeded up its plans to improve profitability and focus on its 
core direct selling operations avon sales representatives market 
gifts cosmetics jewelry and other items 
avon earned 546 million in 1989 after a deficit of 4045 
million in 1988 when it had 5466 million in losses from 
discontinued operations 
other major holders of avon stock include minneapolis investor 
irwin jacobs and a group led by texas billionaire robert m bass

the walt disney co says moviegoers are 
applauding its refusal to show its films in theaters that run 
onscreen ads first 
richard cook president of disneys buena vista pictures 
distribution said anyone who ever heard an audience hiss the ads 
knows how unpopular they are he said the depth of that hatred came 
out in overwhelming praise after disney announced its policy last 
month 
we had five boxloads of letters cook said 
some theaters have been showing no ads others have been at 
least when nondisney movies are playing 
for example the nations largest theater chain the 
denverbased 2700screen united artists theater circuit announced 
last week it would go along with the advertising ban but only on 
screens where disney films are shown 
no other movie distributors have joined disneys no onscreen 
advertising policy 
i applaud the policy as a consumer 20th century fox 
marketing and distribution chief tom sherak said but its not up 
to me to tell them theater owners that they should or shouldnt 
do it it has to come from their patronage 
sherak suggested that angering audiences may cost theater owners 
more than they make in ad revenue 
exhibitors should sit in their theaters and see what the 
public sees they might see that they might be hurting themselves 
in the long run he said 
some observers believe disney has a big extra motive for wanting 
no ads to be shown its archrival mcauniversal has been running 
ads for its universal studios florida theme park in most of the 
1930 theaters operated by cineplex odeon 
the studio tour is a headtohead competitor with the nearby 
walt disney world complex mca owns 50 percent of torontobased 
cineplex odeon 
cook the disney distribution chief denied the mca ads 
motivated disneys policy the impetus was not any one ad in 
particular 
the exception to the ban is slide ads for soft drinks car 
washes and the like which disney says may be shown when the 
theater lights are up during intermission and before the show 
starts 
also disney is allowing existing contracts to be honored so 
some viewers of disneys new release pretty woman may have seen 
commercials over the weekend 
but when the ad contracts run out disney says theater owners 
must cave in to its demands or do without its pictures

rising prices and growing demand soon will 
push the us bill for imported oil higher than the nations 1990 
trade deficit former energy secretary james r schlesinger told 
congress monday 
there is a strong possibility of a 30 percent or 40 percent 
increase in prices in the 1990s schlesinger said in presenting 
the senate energy committee a gloomy summary of the world oil 
outlook 
that we will have a price surge in the decade seems to me to 
be beyond question 
us demand for oil will grow by about 2 percent a year until 
there are steep price increases schlesinger said in a recent 
month he added the united states had to rely on foreign sources 
to meet a record 54 percent of its oil demand 
schlesinger also a former secretary of defense and director of 
the central intelligence agency said that us imports should 
reach as much as 11 million barrels a day by 1995 compared with a 
net average of just over 7 million barrels a day in 1989 
the oilimport bill then will likely exceed our present trade 
deficit he said 
the 1990 trade deficit is about 100 billion 
that statement if correct is of profoundest concern to the 
us economy said sen bennett johnston dla chairman of the 
committee 
while domestic demand for oil has been growing schlesinger 
said us production continues to fall drilling activity is low 
by historical standards he said and the giant prudhoe bay field 
in alaska is in declining production 
dependency on foreign oil will continue to grow although 
the pace can still be affected by our policy decisions 
schlesinger said 
while the us appetite for imported oil grows toward 65 
percent the strategic petroleum reserve our chief surviving 
element of protection against a cutoff will have shrunk in real 
terms from roughly 100 days to 60 days of imports he said 
we may as well acknowledge that over the past decade the 
united states as a practical matter abandoned the quest for energy 
independence indeed even the quest for low energy dependency 
schlesinger said if we are to limit our future vulnerability 
either for national security or international financial reasons we 
shall have to reverse course and take vigorous action 
schlesingers formula for reducing imports includes increased 
conservation more tax incentives for domestic producers and 
expanded drilling 
relying on renewable energy sources such as solar energy 
will not solve the problem because those sources do little for 
transportation which is responsible for the growth in demand for 
oil he said 
despite relaxed eastwest tensions and the end of the iraniraq 
war schlesinger said the strategic petroleum reserve should be 
increased from the present 750millionbarrel supply to 1 billion 
barrels 
john j easton jr an assistant secretary of energy was less 
pessimistic about the growth of oil imports and oil prices 
through concerted efforts to find and produce more of our 
domestic resources we may be able to slow the rate of decline in 
us production but it is unlikely under current conditions that 
we will be able to reverse the trend easton said

the savings and loan industry lost a record 
1917 billion in 1989 after posting its worst fourthquarter loss 
the government reported monday 
analysts said the erosion would continue this year although at 
a slower pace 
the fourthquarter loss totaled 65 billion up from 497 
billion in the julyseptember period and pushed the yearly total 
to a third consecutive record deficit 
the red ink was 134 billion in 1988 and 78 billion in 1987 
james freund acting chief economist of the office of thrift 
supervision said most of the losses were suffered by institutions 
that have either been taken over by the government or are scheduled 
to be taken over under the sampl bailout law passed by congress in 
august 
ots is carrying out the bailout law mandate of weeding out 
the insolvent and unsalvageable institutions that are compiling the 
big losses and transferring them to the rtcs control for eventual 
sale or liquidation freund said 
the rtc or resolution trust corp is charged in the bailout 
legislation with disposing of the failed institutions it has 
gotten rid of 52 sampls and announced plans recently to close or sell 
another 140 by the end of june 
the rtc has been criticized recently for not acting quickly 
enough in disposing of the troubled sampls freund said that failure 
to shut down the institutions cost the government 26 billion in 
the fourth quarter an average of 29 million a day 
however freund said the industry would be smaller and the 
losses would be smaller by this time next year 
despite smaller losses theyre still losses said bert ely 
an alexandria va financial institutions analyst 
ely said he saw a continuing and disturbing trend and that 
is a decline in the number of sampls making money 
the ots reported that 1818 thrifts not under government control 
at years end reported net earnings of 13 billion in the fourth 
quarter that ely said is 88 fewer than the number of profitable 
institutions reported in the third quarter 
the other 779 sampls not under government control lost 34 
billion bringing to 21 billion the total fourthquarter loss for 
all nonconservatorship thrifts 
the 281 thrifts in conservatorship or under government control 
at years end lost 44 billion the ots said and the 84 other 
institutions transferred to the rtc since jan 1 lost 18 billion 
in the last three months of 1989 
another 120 thrifts targeted for transfer to the rtc had losses 
of 324 million 
the thrift industry posted net losses in 33 states net gains in 
15 and no change in two states during the last quarter the biggest

the us trade deficit is not expected to 
improve in the next two years to the extent that it did in the past 
two and it could worsen the bush administration said monday 
the administration said that achieving additional reductions in 
americas trade imbalance would depend on a variety of factors 
from the growth rate in foreign countries to the value of the 
dollar on foreign currency markets 
given the forecasting uncertainties the administration said it 
could not rule out the possibility that the trade deficit would 
actually worsen in the next two years 
it did not forecast an actual deficit figure 
the administrations assessment was included in its annual 
trade projection report to congress which is required under the 
1988 trade law 
the administration said it was possible that further progress 
will be made in reducing the gap between exports and imports but 
it said any improvements would be at a slower pace than in 1988 and 
1989 two years when rapid growth in export sales helped to boost 
the countrys economic fortunes 
the merchandise trade imbalance declined to 109 billion in 
1989 its lowest level since 1984 after hitting an alltime high 
of 152 billion in 1987 but many private economists are warning 
that the deficit will begin rising again this year reflecting 
slower growth in us export sales

gold prices plummeted as much as 30 an ounce 
monday in hectic selling linked to the dollars strength and 
intensified by rumors of heavy sales by large international 
investors 
another dollar advance against the japanese yen stoked the 
bearish attitude toward gold that has been building for weeks 
several negative forces joined to jolt gold an unconfirmed 
report of a huge sale by saudi arabia plus rumored selling by 
japanese and soviet parties had a domino effect on precious metals 
markets as other investors dumped gold to beat further price 
declines 
my guess is that theres been pretty widespread selling 
based on a technically bearish chart picture and expectations of 
continued strength in the us dollar which has been the main 
culprit in golds weakness for several weeks said jeffrey a 
nichols president of american precious metals advisors inc in 
toronto 
gold for march delivery closed at 36580 a troy ounce on new 
yorks commodity exchange 2310 lower than fridays settlement 
price later republic national bank of new york quoted a troy 
ounce of gold at 36675 down 2235 from fridays late bid 
gold tumbled to 363 an ounce in zurich switzerland from 
39305 late friday gold was quoted at 37925 an ounce late 
monday in london down from 38695 late friday earlier in hong 
kong gold fell 549 to close at a bid of 38494 an ounce 
among the rumored big sellers was the saudia arabian monetary 
agency which was said to have bought british pounds with the 
proceeds from selling an estimated 3 million troy ounces the 
agency acts as the countrys central bank and is the main 
repository of hard currencies and gold reserves 
japanese institutions reportedly unloaded gold to raise cash for 
buying stocks the tokyo stock exchanges key index soared by 
nearly 5 percent monday in its secondbiggest singleday rise ever 
rebounding slightly from this years severe slump 
it has been widely assumed that the japanese had been selling 
gold for months possibly to cover stock losses 
market reports also said the soviet union sold gold to raise 
money to help it cope with economic difficulties 
john p norris manager of the precious metals department at 
citibank in new york said returns on currencies have become 
increasingly attractive due to rising interest rates 
there has been liquidation by large gold investors to take 
advantage of higher yields elsewhere he said 
silver also was under pressure silver for march delivery fell 
to 4955 a troy ounce on new yorks comex from 5043 friday 
earlier in london silver fell to a bid of 495 an ounce from 
504 late friday marking the first time silver closed below 5 an 
ounce there since june 30 1986 
the dollar has been bid up due to speculation that us interest 
rates will remain at present levels or higher there is a 
perception the federal reserve wont nudge rates down because 
economic growth appears adequate while inflationary pressures 
persist 
tension in the soviet union over the lithuanian independence 
movement and forecasts of further weakness in the japanese yen also 
have driven up the dollar 
the dollar rose to 15670 yen in new york from 15430 yen late 
friday in tokyo the dollar rose by 133 yen to 15640 yen monday 
its highest close since jan 13 1987 later in london the dollar 
was quoted at 15635 yen 
the british pound benefiting from the reported saudi sterling 
purchase strenghthened to 16185 in new york from 16010 on

gold futures prices were swamped monday by a tidal wave of 
selling that apparently began in the middle east and swept through 
markets around the world eroding prices to their lowest levels in 
more than five months 
on other commodity markets soybean futures surged grains were 
higher copper futures fell pork bellies rose sharply while 
livestock futures were mixed and energy futures were mixed 
gold futures settled 2320 to 25 lower on new yorks commodity 
exchange with the contract for delivery in april at 36620 a troy 
ounce the lowest gold settlement price on the exchange since oct 
13 
silver futures prices fell 88 cents to 107 cents in new york 
with the march contract settling at 4955 a troy ounce the first 
close below 5 since mid1986 
analysts agreed the collapse was sparked by an overseas sale of 
as much as 1 million ounces of gold bullion a huge amount by a 
single source 
rumors were rampant but many experts traced the initial sale to 
the saudi arabian monetary agency or to a commercial bank in saudi 
arabia that may have sold gold and bought british pounds 
another view was that china was the initial seller exchanging 
gold for hard currency 
major investors quickly followed suit analysts said pouring up 
to 2 million more ounces of gold onto the market 
we had three million ounces hitting the market at a time it 
was structurally a little weak anyway and knocked it all to 
hell said george millingstanley first vice president in charge 
of bullion sales at shearson lehman hutton inc 
spot gold prices fell sharply amid heavy selling in zurich 
switzerland and panic selling in london before the new york 
market opened said don tierney an analyst with stanley bell amp co 
in new york 
at midday the commodity exchange announced it was raising by 
700 to 2100 the speculative margin or downpayment needed to 
play the gold market forcing further selling by traders who could 
not afford the extra margin 
tierney said some traders who would normally have been rolling 
their positions out of the soontoexpire april contract and into 
the june contract chose instead to get out of the market entirely 
to see how far this thing is going to go 
some experts predicted a rebound on tuesday but opinions varied 
greatly 
peter cardillo commodity trading adviser with josephthal amp co 
said the market was oversold but he also said that the fact the 
april contract closed below its previous low of 370 is not a 
healthy sign 
soybean futures rose strongly on the chicago board of trade 
after an expected crush of brazilian soybean exports failed to 
materialize grain futures also advanced 
the soybean market had sold off sharply friday on speculation 
that economic reforms aimed at stemming brazils runaway inflation 
rate would be implemented over the weekend causing soybean exports 
to resume after a weeklong lull 
but the brazilian economic picture remained muddled monday and 
analysts said there was no appreciable increase in farmer sales or 
export shipments of brazilian soybeans 
wheat futures settled cent to 2 cents higher with may at 
359 a bushel corn was cent to 2 cents higher with may at 
260 a bushel oats were 1 cent to 1 cents higher with may at 
149 a bushel soybeans were 5 cents to 7 cents higher with may 
at 603 a bushel 
copper futures fell sharply on the commodity exchange on news 
that union workers at two stateowned copper refineries in peru had 
postponed a planned twoday work stoppage copper settled 2 cents 
to 33 cents lower with march at 1262 a pound 
porkbelly futures rallied on the chicago mercantile exchange in 
reaction to fridays monthly agriculture department coldstorage 
report showing a smaller stockpile of frozen bellies than the 
market had expected 
frozen porkbelly futures settled 80 cent to 167 cents higher

olympic federal a little old midwestern thrift 
that wants to stay around another 100 years is trying to ensure 
its future by pressing ahead with a lawsuit against federal 
regulators chairman john j lanigan said monday 
olympic one of about 600 of 2600 sampls nationally that fall 
short of federal capital requirements sued to stop the treasury 
departments office of thrift supervision from taking it over that 
suit initially upheld by a district court judge threatened to 
disrupt the bush administrations bailout of the thrift industry by 
prompting a flood of similar suits 
however the us court of appeals for the district of columbia 
circuit moved to avoid such a deluge friday when it lifted an 
injunction against a takeover of olympic saying the harm to the 
public outweighs the harm to olympic in this instance 
olympic officials and attorneys are not upset by the reversal 
because the decision prohibits the thrift office from liquidating 
the suburban chicago sampl and selling its 11 billion in assets 
what officials of the berwynbased olympic want from the lawsuit 
is about 100 million that they believe the government owes them a 
sum that will enable them to accept a friendly buyout offer said 
lanigan 
were not asking for anything that shouldnt be coming to 
us he said 
olympic also is asking the court to bar the thrift office from 
initiating a takeover until after the federal deposit insurance 
corp rules on the purchase of the thrift by a bank holding 
company said olympic attorney charles j cooper 
the government has taken over more than 120 sampls since the 
bailout began and is expected to seize as many as 200 more 
institutions 
olympic contends that last years sampl bailout legislation 
unfairly wiped out an accounting measure known as supervisory 
good will dropping olympic below the capital requirements 
cooper said 
before the sampl legislation the government permitted an 
institution that bought an insolvent thrift to count as capital the 
difference between assets and liabilities of the failed sampl cooper 
said that amount known as supervisory good will was to 
amortized or written off over time 
at least four lawsuits have been filed against the government 
protesting the reversal on good will said thrift office spokesman 
paul lockwood 
olympic took over seven insolvent sampls in the early 1980s and 
tallied 160 million in good will to be written off over about 40 
years lanigan said writing off 6 million per year the thrift 
now has 115 in good will capital that no longer counts 
they took what we used to count as an asset on our balance 
sheet all we want to say is reimburse us lanigan said 
olympics lawsuit seeks the restoration of the good will 
accounting measure or a government reimbursement 
the thrifts suitor whom lanigan declined to name is willing 
to inject 30 million to 40 million into olympic if the good will 
is restored or reimbursed by the government lanigan said 
no investor is going to come in and buy an asset that isnt 
recognized by the government he said 
another court hearing on olympics suit is set for april 11 
olympics suit also challenged the constitutionality of 
takeovers on the grounds that the director appointed as part of the 
bailout legislation and his replacement were not nominated by the 
president and confirmed by the senate as provided by the 
constitution 
it was on these grounds that the district court judge barred the 
federal takeover of olympic 
that argument would be moot for olympic if t timonty ryan jr 
a former labor department attorney is confirmed as thrift office 
director ryan has been nominated for a fiveyear term and the 
senate banking committee has scheduled a confirmation hearing for 
wednesday

witnesses who said diet clinics caused them or their family 
members medical problems told their stoies to the subcommittee one 
woman said she had to have a gall bladder operation after rapidly 
losing weight through one clinic 
wyden said he was glad to see the federal trade commission going 
after the most outrageous of the getthin schemes such as diet 
pills said to work during sleep mail order starvationbinge plans 
or ear molds that allegedly use an acupuncturetype technique to 
reduce appetite 
but he said a potentially greater threat is the trend toward 
commercial weightloss clinics and physiciansupervised diet 
programs he said the ftc is doing nothing about them 
he also criticized the agency for inaction against the new tin 
men of television the infomercial lengthy product promotions 
often appearing to be documentaries or interview shows 
the american people falsely believe they are well protected 
both by government and the ethic of commerce said wyden 
he said that under thenpresident reagan the ftc was 
particularly lax about pursuing fraud in diet advertising leading 
to the problem he said exists today 
in the name of promoting competition in health care the 
commission fostered an environment that left us a buyerbeware 
medical marketplace in which the scam artists could claim virtually 
anything with impunity and did said wyden 
janet steiger named to head the ftc by president bush said the 
commission has been acting against phony weight plans since 1926 
concentrating on the most egregious 
now were taking a closer look at the weight loss clinics 
she said 
she advocated consumer education and said an agency task force 
is trying to find ways the federal government can coordinate its 
efforts with state governments 
we are encouraging state criminal enforcement where it is 
appropriate she said listing several court actions taken 
against abusers in the 1980s 
sherri steinberg of broward county fla said she needed a 
gall bladder operation after rapidly losing 28 pounds through a 
popular heavily advertised weight loss center 
loretta pameijer of miami said she paid 2000 to a diet 
clinic advertised as being supervised by a doctor so that her 
12yearold daughter could lose 55 pounds in hopes of becoming a 
school cheerleader 
she said the girl lost weight began eating normally and about a 
year later after a meal at a fastfood restaurant had a gall 
bladder attack that required surgery 
mrs pameijer said her doctor told her that diets can lead to 
gall bladder disease 
i had no idea that any die could do this she said 
wydens staff said officials of major commercial weight loss 
clinics would not testify to the subcommittee 
william rush senior vice president of optifast a 
hospitalbased weight loss program said he asked to testify and 
was told he would be scheduled later 
we think were the good guys he said we only treat 
patients who are 30 percent or more over their ideal body weight 
and we treat obesity like a disease 
rush said the type of weightloss clinics found in shopping 
malls are fine for people with only five or 10 pounds to lose 
about 33 billion was spent in 1989 on diets said a report 
released by the subcommittee 
there are 65 million dieters in this country said the 
report sixty percent of all women are usually dieting in some 
form and 18 percent of all adults are constantly dieting

the united states and european economic 
community are considering an international agreement to settle 
possible jurisdictional disputes once internal european trade 
barriers are removed in 1992 vice president sir leon brittan of 
the european commission said monday 
at present there is no means of resolving such a dispute 
brittan said i therefore think that we now need to give serious 
consideration to the desirability of a treaty or less formal 
agreement between the community and the united states to deal with 
such problems 
brittan said the tearing down of nontariff barriers under a 
single integrated market system in 1992 will intensify european 
competition with the united states such a treaty would pertain to 
competition involving mergers within the economic community 
brittan the european community commissioner in charge of 
financial services and competition made the remarks in a speech to 
the ec chambers of commerce in new york where he wound up a 
oneweek visit to the united states 
the commission is the joint executive body of the 12 member 
countries 
brittan said he met with various us cabinet members and 
lawmakers in washington during his visit including assistant 
attorney general james rill with whom he discussed the proposed 
treaty 
i was encouraged by his positive reaction and we will now be 
working up our ideas in detail so that they can be properly 
considered on both sides of the atlantic he said 
brittan said the substance of any such agreement would still 
have to be formulated 
such an agreement would provide for information gathering and 
exchange and would lay down a detailed procedure for consultations 
on cases and issues of common interest he said 
it might even contain an arbitration clause although the 
political difficulties of getting that agreed should not be 
underestimated

new yorks budget woes took a dramatic turn 
for the worse monday as wall streets two major rating agencies 
lowered the states credit rating leaving it with the third worst 
rating among the 50 states 
the credit downgradings could cost new york taxpayers millions 
of dollars in higher interest payments on the states debt only 
massachusetts and louisiana are rated as worse credit risks than 
new york now 
were behind west virginia for christs sake complained 
state comptroller edward regan 
regan a republican said he would not help democratic gov 
mario cuomo and the legislature balance the books for the coming 
budget year by jiggering the contribution formula for the states 
public employee pension system 
cuomo has blamed the states third straight year of fiscal 
problems on an unanticipated drop in state revenues stemming from 
the 1986 federal tax reform act and the economic slowdown that has 
hit the northeast 
the states budget deficit for fiscal 1990 which ends saturday 
is projected at more than 1 billion and a forecast gap of 15 
billion for fiscal 1991 continues to grow standard amp poors 
corp said in announcing its downgrade 
both standard amp poors and moodys investors service inc 
dropped their credit ratings on the 775 million in shortterm 
funds the state will borrow on tuesday to balance this years 
budget the new ratings are one notch lower than ratings for 
budgetbalancing loans taken out a year ago 
standard amp poors also went one step further and lowered the 
rating on new yorks longterm debt by two notches to the lowest 
level in state history 
the agency lowered the ratings because there are no responsible 
solutions in sight for new yorks chronic fiscal imbalance sampp 
analyst hyman grossman said 
obviously the situation has gotten materially worse and the 
solution is a bigger hurdle than it was only a few months ago 
grossman said 
the move by standard amp poors reduced the states longterm 
credit rating from doubleaminus to singlea 
during the fiscal crisis of the mid1970s when new york city 
nearly went bankrupt standard amp poors rated the states credit at 
aa three notches higher than the new rating 
but state officials and analysts said the new rating didnt 
necessarily indicate that the current fiscal problems are worse 
than the crisis of 15 years ago 
moodys did not change its longterm credit rating for new york 
but analyst george leung said the agency would be watching the 
state closely moodys currently gives new york a rating of a1 
which is roughly comparable to sampps new singlea rating 
an a is a mediocre rating leung said 
the sampp downgrade affected the states 39 billion in 
outstanding general obligation bonds new york has a total of more 
than 20 billion of various types of debt outstanding 
a lower bond rating typically forces borrowers to pay a higher 
interest rate to sell its debt 
cuomo said the lower rating on tuesdays shortterm borrowing 
alone would cost the state an additional 10 million in interest 
the continuing delay in achieving progress on a new state 
budget has now taken its toll on taxpayers as i have warned for 
weeks that it would cuomo said in a statement 
cuomo and assembly speaker mel miller also a democrat are 
locked in a battle with the state senates republican majority over 
whether higher taxes are needed to help close the mounting budget 
deficit 
standard amp poors criticized cuomo and legislative leaders for 
failing to agree on the size of the states budget problem and to 
devise a credible plan to address it in a fiscally responsible 
manner 
the budget is supposed to be in place by the start of the 
states fiscal year which begins on sunday but that hasnt 
happened since 1984
