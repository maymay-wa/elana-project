the tower of pisa has been leaning for 800 
years so the keeper of the marble wonder cant understand what all 
the latest fuss is about 
its true that experts have been making dire predictions for 
years but there was a real tower tizzy after the minister of 
public works giovanni prandini sounded an alarm recently that 
scared all of italy 
newspapers immediately published headlines warning of a red 
alert for the tower raising fears that one of the symbols of 
italy could at worst topple or at best be closed for repairs 
but giuseppe toniolo chairman of the committee responsible for 
preservation of the monument says theres nothing to get excited 
about 
there is absolutely nothing new in the situation he said in 
an interview to say that the tower is in danger so what its 
always been in danger 
what does the tower need toniolo added it needs to be 
left in peace 
the 180foot circular tower begun by bonnano pisano in 1173 
started to tilt almost immediately because the ground shifted 
underneath it was completed by tomasso dandrea with the 
construction of the belfry between 1360 and 1370 
the tower now leans about 13 feet off the perpendicular but 
toniolo and other tower experts say it would not topple for more 
than another century if it continues to tilt at its average rate 
according to the last measurement in june the tower leaned an 
additional 0008 inches in the last 12month period the average 
yearly tilt since the measurements began in 1918 is 0047 inches 
the thing should fall over toniolo said seated behind a 
desk in his office the tower visible through gothic windows how 
long will this lean last no one can say but at a certain time it 
will reach the point where it falls that will take more than 100 
years it could be 200 250 years 
for decades italy has tried to come up with ways to save the 
tower a number of national and international commissions have 
proposed plans for stabilizing the monument but none has ever been 
implemented 
the problem of trying to stabilize the tower is enough to make 
the hands of great technicians tremble said gero geri a 
topography professor who has been measuring the lean of the tower 
since 1969 who wants to risk doing something that could upset 
the equilibrium 
the latest plan approved by the government in 1987 is to 
implant a wheelshaped support below the base around the tower it 
would be connected by concrete spokes to the marble foundation 
the public works ministry appointed a commission a few months 
ago to study the soil conditions to determine whether the plan can 
go ahead 
but toniolo believes the tower cant be fixed until officials 
figure out what has kept the 14000ton structure standing all 
these years 
all the technicians say it cant be understood said the 
whitehaired 80yearold retired radiologist who has headed the 
monument preservation committee for 12 years this means there 
are special conditions of the terrain which havent yet been 
explained if you cant understand this how can you do a project 
to save it 
prandini a christian democrat who has been public works 
minister for barely two months apparently wants to find a solution 
after expressing his concern over the state of the tower 
prandini ordered a panel of technical experts to report back 
quickly on the feasibility of a stabilization plan he also told 
them to devise a roundtheclock monitoring system for the tower 
mayor giacomino granchi a socialist accused prandini of 
exaggerating the situation and trying to get publicity for himself 
prandini replied i dont see why one wants to make a 
controversy out of a well known problem only because theres the 
will to act decisively and go from the study phase to concrete 
realization 
the sense of urgency was heightened by the collapse in march of 
the 900yearold tower of pavia in northern italy killing three 
people experts said the 255foot tower crumbled either because of 
natural decay in the mortar holding the bricks together or because 
of a sudden sinking following a dry spell that lowered the water 
table 
the example of pavia doesnt count because no one ever 
monitored it toniolo said no other tower in italy is 
monitored like pisas if pavia had all the instruments that we 
have they would have known a few months before that it was in 
danger 
toniolo said he receives an average of 40 proposals a year from 
people around the world mostly americans for saving the tower 
the latest erecting a huge statue of saint ranieri pisas 
patron saint with arms raised to hold up the tower 
some even suggest trying to straighten the tower a notion that 
makes toniolo shudder 
never for heavens sake he said it was born tilted our 
ancestors built it that way eight centuries ago it must remain 
that way

as moscows first snowfall ushered in an early 
winter last week soviet officials worried openly that the nation 
could face dangerous shortages of food fuel and heat in the colder 
weeks and months to come 
attention focused on a breakdown of the transportation network 
as supplies of every kind bottlenecked at railheads and ports 
throughout much of the country 
but the looming threat also exposes president mikhail 
gorbachevs inability so far to implement any real perestroika 
or restructuring of the soviet economy 
after four years of reform measures gorbachev has succeeded in 
discrediting the old system built around a centrally planned 
economy but he hasnt instituted the marketdriven replacement 
that he and other reformers advocate 
the result is most evident right now in the dislocation of the 
supply and transport system 
first deputy premier lev voronin said last week that power 
stations and public utilities have 45 million fewer tons of coal 
on hand than at this time last year 
he said miners will have to make an enormous effort if the 
people are to avoid rationing of heat light and electricity this 
winter 
a threeweek national coal miners strike in july disrupted 
production and since then shipments have been held up by the 
logjams that also affect food and consumer products 
voronin blamed the transport breakdown for frustrating the 
kremlins effort to relieve chronic shortages by spending tens of 
millions of precious dollars to import goods the soviets themselves 
have failed to produce 
more than 2 million tons of imported cargo are sitting in soviet 
ports waiting to be unloaded he said and 130 loaded freight 
trains are standing idle inside hungary romania and czechoslovakia 
ready to leave for the soviet union 
newspapers report carloads of food rotting on trains while 
consumers complain bitterly that store shelves are empty 
the situation is even more critical in armenia which for two 
months was all but cut off from the rest of the country by an 
azerbaijani blockade inspired by ancient ethnic hatreds 
voronin charged that outright sabotage is playing havoc with 
government efforts to rebuild towns and cities destroyed by the 
december 1988 earthquake before winter comes again 
in an article wednesday in the daily sotsialisticheskaya 
industriya the first deputy premier was quoted as saying that 
water has been poured into rail cars carrying cement to the quake 
zone and building materials have been damaged 
thousands of tons of fuel have not been delivered he said and 
even emergency vehicles have been sidelined in the hardhit 
republic 
the tass news agency reported friday night that some rail 
traffic bound for armenia had been under escort by soldiers but it 
said disruption on main rail lines caused by the azerbaijani 
blockade had idled some 400 trains totaling 60000 wagons 
pravda the communist party daily reported that across the 
country there are 13500 freight cars waiting to be unloaded 
in a brief frontpage article headlined is it sabotage the 
national newspaper said friday that railway officials were 
complaining there were no trucks to deliver goods arriving by train 
pravda correspondents saw with their own eyes unloaded freight 
trains that had brought to moscow imported furniture cosmetics 
coffee tea soap shampoo washing powder and sovietproduced tv 
sets refrigerators batteries and cigarettes all in all 585 
cars ready to be unloaded and 700 more waiting at stations from 
moscow to smolensk about 200 miles away the newspaper said 
more goods are stored in depots or right outside without anything 
to protect them from the weather it said 
gorbachev trying to prevent the situation from deteriorating 
further called for a 15month ban on strikes saying strong 
medicine is needed to prevent anarchy and irresponsible 
management 
the recently elected supreme soviet legislature declaring its 
independence from kremlin edicts refused to give gorbachev the 
sweeping ban he wanted but it did temporarily order workers in 
critical industries such as coal mining to remain on the job until 
legislation can be adopted defining their right to strike

matchstickthin naked children with 
swollen bellies stand under a harsh sun chewing dried uncooked 
fish their emaciated elders sit with blank stares gazing toward 
the horizon 
half the 50000 people living in this wretched nile riverport 
are seeking shelter in malakal from the horrors of a seemingly 
interminable civil war refugees in their own country 
sanitary services are nonexistent and malaria and typhoid run 
rampant those who are sick have but one dilapidated hospital to 
turn to with only a handful of doctors and almost no medical 
supplies 
malakal capital of the southern upper nile region is a 
microcosm of sudans southland an area the size of texas laid 
waste by 6 years of warfare and famine 
a massive international relief operation prevented a repeat of 
the mass starvation experienced in the summer of 1988 but the 
rebellions accumulated effects continue to wreak havoc on the 
regions desperate civilians 
government troops control malakal 425 miles south of the 
capital khartoum as they do most southern population centers 
nevertheless rebels of the sudan peoples liberation army stake 
out areas on its perimeter as freely as they move about in more 
than 90 percent of the southern countryside 
militarily the war has basically been at a standstill for 
months both sides agreed in april to quiet their guns to let 
relief goods go through 
a military junta took power in khartoum june 30 promising to 
end the war and has extended the truce each month the rebels have 
gone along 
but political maneuvering over how and when to talk peace 
continues leaving the people of malakal and the rest of the south 
struggling but surviving 
people may think were all dead said joseph maker a 
government employee but were still living despite the war 
a chieftain of the shuluk tribe told a visiting reporter life 
is going on here we are life we are giving birth and we are 
eating although very little 
the united nations says 250000 southerners died a year ago of 
starvation or disease in a famine caused by the war other western 
relief workers estimate the death toll at twice that 
to prevent a recurrence the un agencies organized operation 
lifeline sudan to position 105000 tons of relief goods in key 
transit points for distribution to displaced people after 
monsoonlike summer rains isolated them this year organizers say 
80 percent of the goods was positioned in time 
james oneil regional monitor of the un world food program 
said government and rebels are negotiating the dispatch of a third 
convoy of nile river barges with additional relief for the upper 
nile 
the program has had to overcome logistical and political 
problems he said there were too few workers for unloading the 
barges en route and inadequate storage facilities local officials 
complained about unfair distribution as displaced people flooded 
the towns the numbers of people who had to be cared for kept 
changing 
malakal still faces lifethreatening problems especially in 
health care 
malaria and typhoid are everywhere and we have no chloroquine 
malaria medicine or syringes said lt col galwak deng 
military governor for the upper nile 
we have only one general practitioner when we need at least 
24 we have some 500 doses of medication which would be consumed 
in one day if we were to use them but we have more than 600 
patients coming in every day 
doctors and nurses said the towns lone hospital has 14 badly 
equipped wards with about 500 beds hospital records show at least 
two deaths a day from malaria or typhoid 
hospital staff are helped by three doctors of the french 
organization medicins sans frontieres and some military doctors 
these deaths are only the ones in the hospital said one of 
the french physicians who identified himself as dr pathot we 
have no car at all nor an ambulance so if somebody is going to 
die he may do it before coming to us 
we cant say how many die every day 
as the civilian populace struggles to survive the army has been 
trying to reopen the towns 10 schools closed for almost three 
years 
two primary schools have been reopened a reporter touring them 
found the classes had no desks stools or blackboards 
children sat on the ground their teachers instructing them to 
read and write by using the earth as a blackboard and a stick as 
chalk

a plan to improve and expand louisianas 
highways won solid approval from voters but proposals to enhance 
blacks voting power in electing judges were rejected in saturdays 
statewide referendum 
none of the 13 state amendments to the state constitution on the 
ballot drew much organized opposition 
the only extensive campaigns were for passage of the highway 
plan a proposal to make it easier for police to confiscate the 
property of suspected drug dealers and a measure to set aside at 
least 5 million a year in state mineral revenue to restore eroding 
wetlands 
the drug confiscation and wetlands issues both passed easily 
gov buddy roemer who included the highway funding plan as part 
of a tax revision package that voters rejected april 29 said it 
would boost efforts to attract new industry to louisiana and create 
thousands of construction jobs 
with about 94 percent of the votes counted the amendment had 
the support of 430791 voters or 71 percent and was opposed by 
174528 or 29 percent 
the proposal would put the states 16cent motor fuel tax into a 
trust fund to be used solely for highways and public works 
projects it included a 4cent gasoline tax increase to finance 
14 billion in transportation improvements including four lanes 
for major highways and expansion of ports and airports 
the two judicial amendments defeated by 3to1 margins would 
have added a supreme court justice and a majority black district in 
the new orleans area and created up to 35 blackmajority 
subdistricts for district and appellate courts 
the civil rights challenges that prompted the amendments came 
about because there are no blacks on the state supreme court only 
one black among the states 52 appellate court judges and five 
black district court judges out of 192 
several taxrelated amendments also were on the ballot 
including measures to raise the automobile license plate fee to 
allow cities and towns to raise property taxes and to extend from 
five years to 10 years the current property tax assessment freeze 
for owners who expand or improve buildings in certain districts

pope john paul ii appealed sunday for 
an end to ideological divisions worldwide and said the bitter 
struggle that divides north and south korea symbolized suffering 
east is divided from west north from south john paul said 
at an open air mass attended by 700000 he appealed for the world 
to give up mistrust hostility and conflict to live in peace and 
brotherhood 
the korean nation is symbolic of a world divided and not yet 
able to become one in peace and justice the pope said speaking 
alternately in korean and english 
the vast crowd many of whom had lined up before dawn waved 
white korean flags and some wept as the pope entered an immense 
plaza for the mass 
hundreds of singers burst into hymn as the pope walked along a 
red carpet toward a fourstory stage and altar tiered with 
thousands of red white yellow and pink flowers and flanked by 
colorful banners 
plainclothed south korean security agents carrying submachine 
guns ringed the stage and 11000 police were deployed on the 
outskirts of the plaza those who attended the mass had to pass 
through metal detectors 
about 2000 priests aided by 2000 women in traditional korean 
gowns served communion while 1200 white doves were released as a 
sign of peace 
at an earlier meeting with president roh taewoo the pope asked 
the south korean leader to make every effort to achieve full 
democracy and eradicate the nations legacy of authoritarian rule 
a vatican spokesman said 
john paul told roh that south koreans want full democratic 
rights and freedoms the spokesman said 
john paul ii began his asian pilgrimage in seoul saturday about 
1000 dissidents and radical students staged an antigovernment 
rally at sogang university to urge the pope to speak out on human 
rights abuses in south korea 
an equal number of riot police surrounded the campus but made 
no move to halt saturdays protest the students dispersed 
peacefully after demanding the release of jailed dissidents 
including south korean clergymen charged with visiting north korea 
for unification talks 
john paul arrived in seoul after for the first time flying 
across the soviet union and sending greetings to soviet president 
mikhail gorbachev in a sign of remarkably improved vaticansoviet 
relations he expressed hope he would soon visit moscow 
he immediately took up the issue of korean reunification which 
has divided the influential catholic community in south korea 
addressing himself to the dear people of korea john paul 
said in the face of the tragic division which continues to 
separate your own people do you not have the urgent mission to 
prove to a world torn by mistrust strife and hatred that mankind 
does have the resources to end division and war and to forge an 
enduring peace 
the korean peninsula divided in 1945 is the site of one of the 
worlds most bitter ideological confrontations the capitalist 
south and the totalitarian north which fought to a bloody 
stalemate in the korean war clash frequently and maintain huge 
armies along their 150mile border 
they still are technically at war since no peace treaty was 
signed at the end of the korean war in 1953 
a heated debate broke out in the catholic community after a 
dissident priest visited north korea in july to escort home a 
radical college student the two claimed the trip was to promote 
reunification but the seoul government called it an illegal 
contact with an enemy state 
the priest and student were arrested when they crossed back 
across the border three other priests were jailed for organizing 
the priests trip without government approval 
after south korea the pope travels on to indonesia and east 
timor and then to the indian ocean island nation of mauritius he 
is to return to rome oct 16

a burmese student group sunday said the 
demands of two burmese hijackers that democracy be returned to 
their homeland were identical to those of the people of burma 
we regard this hijacking as a reaction to the current 
situation in burma where freedom of speech is totally impossible 
said a press release from the all burma students democratic front 
on saturday thailand said it would not repatriate the students 
who hijacked a burmese domestic flight with 83 others aboard then 
threatened to blow up the plane if their demands for reform were 
not met 
the front is the major representative of students who fled 
central burma to fight for democracy from camps along the countrys 
borders after the military brutally crushed a studentled uprising 
there last year 
it claims that nearly 5000 students and other dissidents are 
living in 24 frontier camps under the protection of various ethnic 
minority groups also battling the militaryled government 
their demands are identical to those of the people of burma 
and these are the demands we have been relaying the world with our 
tears and blood since the brutal military takeover in burma said 
the release seen in bangkok 
an official media report from burma sunday said the hijacking 
was settled successfully because of good relations between thailand 
and burma 
a radio rangoon broadcast gave details of the hijacking friday 
by the students who diverted a fokker 28 domestic airliner to 
thailand and held 83 people hostage for about 10 hours before 
surrendering to thai officials 
the students are being held in military custody but thai 
officials have said they would not be repatriated 
we will not hurt them they will not be sent back to burma 
deputy prime minister tienchai sirisunpan said in a news 
conference the burmese government also does not want them back 
so far they have not asked for asylum in any country 
although thailand has friendly relations with burma it does not 
have an extradition treaty with the military government in rangoon 
as i understand it they want to let the world know what has 
happened in burma especially the life without freedom of burmese 
citizens tienchai said 
the hijackers demands included the release of political 
prisoners lifting of martial law freedom of the press and the 
formation of an interim government with persons nominated by the 
united nations the radio broadcast said 
the hijackers also wanted the release of opposition leader aung 
san suu kyi the governing of the people leniently and 
ordering soldiers back to the barracks 
a military junta seized power in burma in september 1988 
following a nationwide uprising to demand an end to a quarter 
century of authoritarian rule 
the military has promised general elections next year but in 
july placed under house arrest its leading opponent suu kyi and 
has arrested several thousand other dissidents according to 
western sources 
the two students initially threatened to blow up the aircraft 
with what thai officials say was a homemade explosive 
thailand is one of the few nations which has tried to establish 
friendly ties with the military regime and has shown particular 
interest in exploiting burmas rich natural resources including 
teak and fish thailands powerful military has been at the 
forefront of efforts to develop closer ties

embarrassed the aging leadership in east berlin during weekend 
anniversary celebrations 
however the official east german news agency adn said that in 
three hours of talks honecker told gorbachev east germany will 
adhere to the basic values of socialism

a mirage 2000 fighter jet crashed and 
exploded sunday during a final acrobatic maneuver on indian air 
force day killing the pilot who had attempted an extra roll 
officials said 
no one on the ground was killed but some of the 2000 
spectators suffered sprained ankles or bruises running to or from 
the site they said 
the silver deltawinged aircraft of french design was completing 
a climb known as a vertical charlie when it plunged to the 
ground about 300 yards from a reviewing stand at palam airport in 
west new delhi 
military and civilian dignitaries journalists and other guests 
had watched the parade of 650 enlisted men and an aerial display 
the pilot identified as wing commander ramesh bakshi the 
39yearold commander of the mirage squadron was killed instantly 
air force chief marshal sk mehra said 
he told reporters the accident apparently was caused by an 
error in judgment 
mehra said the sky was hazy and may have disoriented bakshi the 
plane was about 18 feet from the ground when the pilot tried the 
maneuver he said 
the mirage was completing the final flyby during the parade 
marking the 57th anniversary of the indian air force and honoring 
its 115000 officers 
air marshal nc suri vice chief of the air staff said bakshi 
was only supposed to perform three rolls in the finale instead 
the officer said he attempted four 
the plane made a steep climb then descended making three loops 
and rolls he said after failing to complete a fourth roll the 
pilot was unable to pull out of the descent and the plane hurtled 
to the ground he said 
some spectators gasped and several air force wives ran toward 
the burning wreckage 
the aircraft slammed into the ground exploded and bounced three 
times through fuel tanks igniting a huge fireball several 
vehicles parked in the area were badily damaged by the burning 
chunks 
the mirage is capable of flying up to 1460 miles an hour at an 
altitude of 65600 feet 
the indian air force bought 49 mirage 2000 planes between 1982 
and 1986

palestinian leaders urged the united states on 
sunday to pressure israel to begin peace talks and said israels 
rejection of a proposed meeting with palestinians in egypt will 
lead to more violence in the uprising 
a leading labor party politician moshe shahal said us help 
in choosing palestinian delegates to talk with israel could 
rescue the political situation following fridays rejection of 
the egyptsponsored dialogue 
in the occupied west bank and gaza strip businesses were closed 
by a general strike the first of a threeday shutdown ordered by 
the uprisings plobacked underground leaders to step up the revolt 
against israeli rule of the lands 
the israeli army closed off the territories sunday afternoon 
blocking palestinians from entering israel on yom kippur the 
jewish day of atonement which began at sundown 
radwan abu ayyash one of the palestinian leaders reportedly 
suggested by egyptian leader hosni mubarak to meet with israeli 
representatives said only us pressure would lead to the dialogue 
suggested by the egyptian president 
the united states must take a more active and serious role to 
convince the israelis to hold the meeting proposed by mubarak he 
said in a telephone interview 
abu ayyash head of the west banks arab journalists 
association and a supporter of yasser arafats mainstream palestine 
liberation organization faction fatah urged the us government 
to step up its dialogue with the plo to counter the israeli 
decision 
mubaraks offer was rejected because prime minister yitzhak 
shamirs rightwing likud bloc objected to the egyptian leaders 
call to include palestinians deported from the occupied territories 
in peace talks shamir said including the exiles would amount to 
allowing the plo into the peace process 
the centerleft labor party likuds partner in the coalition 
government urged israel to accept mubaraks offer but the 
policymaking inner cabinet vote produced a 66 tie along political 
lines which amounted to a rejection of the egyptian offer 
assad saftawi a gaza strip school principal and another 
reported choice of mubarak for the talks said he was shocked that 
mubaraks offer was rejected 
the decision will bring waves of violence and extremism 
saftawi said the blame is on israel 
saftawi and abu ayyash predicted more violence in the 
palestinian uprising if there were no progress toward peace the 
revolt which begins its 23rd month monday already has led to the 
deaths of 585 palestinians and 40 israelis 
palestinian moderation has its limits if there is no 
achievement then our people will go back to extremism saftawi 
told the ap 
members of likud maintained meanwhile that the inner cabinet 
vote did not halt progress toward peace 
the peace process does not depend on one vote in the 
cabinet said ehud olmert the minister in charge of arab affairs 
he told israel radio that the government could still agree to 
meet a palestinian delegation if the members were acceptable to 
israel 
his likud colleague foreign minister moshe arens blamed last 
weeks rejection on the stubbornness of labor in forcing a vote 
on mubaraks proposal he said the vote should have been put off 
until after israel received an expected us proposal to assist in 
forming a palestinian delegation to the peace talks 
but shahal energy minister in the coalition cabinet said arens 
never requested a delay and came to fridays meeting with only a 
vague notion of what the united states might propose 
if there is an american proposal which we havent heard 
explicitly from the foreign minister this could rescue the 
political situation he said 
shamir speaking on the radio in a yom kippur address called 
israelis seekers of peace but said israel has survived only 
through armed might 
the army has proved to our enemies and the whole world 
that it is impossible to defeat us he said

when thenhouse banking committee chairman 
fernand j st germain asked for help from the department of housing 
and urban development in june 1985 an agency official asked 
deborah gore dean whether he should get it 
absolutely was her short but emphatic answer 
and when sen carl levin of michigan wrote hud about a problem 
in his state not long before an important vote dean swung into 
action 
this looks like trouble she wrote an aide we need levin 
too much please call him tell him that well do whatever we 
can 
but when jesse jackson wanted her boss hud secretary samuel 
pierce to accompany him to a housing project devastated by a 
hurricane dean frowned at the request 
respectfully decline she wrote 
those episodes detailed in more than 20000 pages of deans 
files are but three of hundreds of glimpses of the politics of hud 
during the reagan administration and of the power dean held as 
pierces close aide 
dean who had no experience in housing and only a brief stint in 
government before coming to work at hud is a central figure in the 
congressional investigation of favoritism and mismanagement at hud 
like pierce she has refused to testify by citing her right against 
selfincrimination 
her files show she was also a central figure in agency affairs 
keeping pierce apprised of important developments endorsing 
projects she liked and cracking down on work that didnt satisfy 
her 
you all must bear down no more garbage for pierces 
signature she said in a july 1985 note to three hud officials 
who worked on a letter for pierce he deserves better work from 
his assistants review my notes and do four hail marys 
when a request from someone who could help hud like st 
germain whose committee controlled the agencys budget reached 
deans desk she made sure it was handled quickly often sending 
critical notes to aides who had not responded to the requests 
sooner 
she was just as keenly aware of the other side of the political 
fence rejecting pierce appearances with jackson and another 
prominent black south african archbishop desmond tutu both of 
whom had major differences with the reagan administration 
her files released last week under the freedom of information 
act show she was swamped with requests for help from developers 
consultants local housing officials city councilors and mayors 
and members of congress 
for some she arranged meetings or telephone conversations with 
pierce for others she made sure their proposals were routed to 
the proper agency official sometimes adding her endorsement 
please give these people all the help you can she wrote to 
a deputy when sending him a proposal for a hud grant which was 
later approved 
on occasion she even delved into the realm of social director 
securing white house tour passes for thencolumbus ohio city 
councilor david e cain in 1983 and an invitation to a dinner in 
honor of former president nixon for one of pierces former law 
partners in 1985 
my family and i enjoyed the tour very much cain said in a 
thankyou note to dean 
although she wrote flowery letters to some of the most powerful 
people in washington ms dean took a jab at many of them in a note 
to an aide who had sent her a copy of a washingtons magazines 
1985 list of the capitals social 400 which did not bear her 
name 
with the exception of ron amp nancy reagan and bob amp liddy 
dole i wouldnt be seen with any of them she wrote 
among others on the list george and barbara bush cabinet 
secretaries james baker george shultz and edwin meese several 
supreme court justices and dozens of senators and representatives 
not to mention the richest of the rich 
her notes also show signs of the sense of humor friends and 
colleagues often recall 
ba humbug im not giving back anything she scribbled on a 
memo detailing policy against accepting gifts from government 
vendors 
she also was fiercely protective of pierce keeping a close eye 
on hudrelated news accounts and once warning a public affairs aide 
not to include in an internal newsletter some derogatory questions 
employees had submitted for pierce 
among them why do you stay in a job that you wanted to leave 
after the election when the president is attempting to eliminate 
your key programs and would you like to live out the rest of 
your life in a deregulated nursing home 
when she sent a copy of the questions to pierce she scribbled 
one of her frequent oneword notes 
incredible

an antihazing campaign aimed at countering the image of greek 
rows as ginsoaked animal houses appears to be gaining this 
fall on campuses from the university of southern california to 
dartmouth 
worried by their image as well as the possibility of lawsuits 
fraternities around the country are moving to eliminate hazing 
some want to eliminate pledging the practice of having a period 
between the recruitment of a member and his formal initiation when 
hazing is most likely 
in august two of the nations largest fraternities tau kappa 
epsilon and zeta beta tau decided that the most effective way to 
end hazing was to ban pledging altogether in their chapters 
kappa delta rho also approved a longrange plan that includes a 
move to no pledging by 1995 phi sigma kappa amended its 
constitution to allow for experimentation with nonpledge programs 
alpha epsilon pi introduced new membership education programs 
the national interfraternity council which represents 
fraternities at 900 college campuses weighed in with an 
antihazing campaign of its own in september stressing that the 
image of fraternities everywhere was suffering from hazing 
incidents that harmed pledges physically or psychologically 
its not a concern for decreasing membership said jonathan 
j brant executive director of the indianapolisbased council 
were just really fed up with the perception that silly and 
dangerous things occur on the college campus and fraternities are 
sometimes associated with those things 
what has empowered us in making our case to fraternities is 
that we are painfully aware that the stakes have been raised in 
legal liability brant said 
fraternity brothers on many campuses still resist the idea of 
ditching the timehonored practice of putting new members through 
physical or mental ordeals before their formal initiation despite 
excesses that have led to 40 deaths and hundreds of injuries in the 
last decade nationwide 
i really dont think you can form any sort of loyalty to a 
house without pledging said steve colafella a sophomore 
initiated last month into alpha sigma phi at penn state university 
the oneness that you show with the brotherhood the thing you 
have in common is the trials and tribulations that got you there 
some 400000 undergraduate men and 250000 undergraduate women 
belong to greek organizations in the united states and canada 
after a slump in membership from 1965 through the 1970s greek 
organizations have grown steadily over the last decade 
hazing has continued at some campuses this fall including one 
notorious case at the university of mississippi where beta theta 
pi pledges were abandoned bound and naked last month on the campus 
of rust college a predominantly black school with kkk and a 
racist epithet painted on their chests 
but many fraternities are looking for better ways to initiate 
members 
at usc for example theta xi is dropping pledging this fall and 
will instead require candidates to complete educational programs to 
acquaint them with active members and the mores of the house 
phi sigma kappa will scrap pledging and replace it with four 
weeks of informal rushing said chapter president darrin aoyama 
the house is recruiting prospective members by making friends and 
inviting them to the chapter those who decide to rush have to pass 
a test on the fraternitys traditions history and rules 
i think its a lot more positive aoyama said how can you 
expect the person to be your friend after you treat him like dirt 
but tau kappa epsilon member terry koh whose fraternity will 
abolish pledging in two years said the most disgusting thing in 
the world is to get rid of pledging it no longer becomes a 
fraternity it becomes a club if you ask anybody their pledge 
semester was the funnest 
at the university of alabama where 28 percent of the 16000 
undergraduates belong to one of 46 greek organizations zbt 
president brian katz said his group is following the antipledging 
program this fall as laid out in a 400page manual issued by the 
national fraternity 
but some brothers dont understand why they cant do the same 
things that were done to them as pledges he said the chapter has 
about 100 members 
its like if youve been swinging a golf club one way all your 
life and all of a sudden this guy comes up to you and he says 
youre doing it wrong and you have to change katz said youre 
going to have trouble changing your swing 
at tulane university in new orleans where 32 percent of male 
and 40 percent of female undergraduates belong to greek 
organizations zbt president jon randman said the nopledge rule is 
just about the only way a fraternity can go these days the 
tighter rules he added spare him from looking over my shoulder 
and worrying as much as i might have been in the past when people 
had been able to run pretty much free 
randman said the pledge semester has been replaced with a 
fourweek educational period during which older members work to 
make the freshmen part of the group and a cohesive class unto 
themselves 
since my freshman year it has changed a lot said jeff 
switek a senior and president of bones gate fraternity one of the 
largest at dartmouth where 58 percent of undergraduates join 
fraternities or sororities now school officials insist that such 
organizations give details of their rush plans 
a lot of people thought what they had to go through was 
humiliating and didnt want others to have to go through the same 
thing switek said

as night fell sunday jews throughout israel 
marked the start of their holiest day yom kippur with fasting and 
prayers of penitence 
traffic on the nations highways and streets came to a halt 
commercial flights were suspended and the border with egypt and 
bridges to jordan were closed 
staterun israel radio and television and the army radio ceased 
broadcasts leaving the country without communications for the 
solemn holiday which ends at sundown monday 
although most israelis are secular yom kippur is widely 
observed and many flock to the nations almost 8000 synagogues for 
prayer services it is traditional for jews to refrain from taking 
food and water during the 24hour holiday 
jews beg god for forgiveness and pray for life and peace during 
yom kippur also known as the day of atonement it is 
traditional for men to wear a white robe called a kitle 
symbolizing purity during holiday services and to refrain from 
wearing leather shoes as a symbol of humility 
israeli families often take advantage of the quiet by walking 
down major roadways to synagogues in past years cars that 
ventured out on israeli streets were sometimes stoned by religous 
zealots appeals were broadcast on the radio to allow ambulances to 
pass freely 
tens of thousands of jews traditionally gather at the western 
wall judaisms holiest site the wall is the last remnant of the 
temple destroyed by the romans in 70 ad many jews spend the 
entire 24hour fast day praying at the site 
early sunday some orthodox jews went to markets to carry out 
the ancient rite of kapparot waving live chickens over their head 
they prayed that their sins would be transferred to the sacrificial 
chicken afterward the chickens were slaughtered and given to the 
poor 
yom kippur ends the 10 days of awe that begin on rosh 
hashana the jewish new year jews believe that during the period 
god decides each persons destiny over the next year 
the days of awe are traditionally filled with prayer and many 
jews greet each other by saying may you be inscribed in the book 
of life 
this yom kippur marked the 16th anniversary of the 1973 middle 
east war which began when egyptian and syrian armies launched a 
suprise attack on israel 
fierce battles were fought on the golan heights and in the sinai 
desert and arab armies briefly threatened to invade israel itself 
every year at this time bereaved families lay wreaths and 
flowers at the gravesites of the almost 3000 israeli troops who 
fell in the war 
israeli newspapers on sunday printed reminiscences and 
commentaries about the war and many families placed notices in 
newspapers memorializing relatives who died as soldiers 
one of the first communal settlements in the country kibbutz 
mizra put an ad in several papers listing seven members ages 19 to 
48 who were killed in the war 
nearly everyone had a close friend or relative that was 
killed said kibbutz secretary edna greenbald until today we 
have still not recovered 
in a special broadcast to the nation prime minister yitzhak 
shamir paid tribute to those who fell 
to prevent a repeat of the suprise attack and halt any guerrilla 
infiltrations the military placed forces on high alert sunday 
israel radio said 
palestinians in the occupied west bank and gaza strip began a 
threeday strike to coincide with yom kippur and step up the 
uprising against israeli rule of the territories monday marks the 
beginning of the 23rd month of the rebellion 
the army announced saturday that travel between the occupied 
lands and israel would be barred during the holiday

a fighter jet crashed and exploded in a 
giant fireball at ceremonies honoring the indian air force sunday 
after the pilot apparently misjudged the planes altitude and tried 
an extra acrobatic maneuver officials said 
about 2000 military and civilian dignitaries journalists and 
other guests watched in horror as the frenchdesigned mirage 2000 
plunged to earth about 300 yards from a reviewing stand killing 
the pilot 
no one on the ground was killed some spectators suffered 
sprained ankles or bruises while running either toward or away from 
the burning wreckage 
the silver deltawinged aircraft was completing a maneuver known 
as a vertical charlie the finale of a 20minute aerial display 
of 22 of the air forces supersonic fighters transport and 
training aircraft 
an inquiry was ordered to determine what caused the crash the 
first major accident at an indian military airshow 
the pilot was identified as ramesh bakshi the 39yearold 
commander of the mirage squadron 
air force chief marshal sk mehra told reporters the accident 
apparently was due to an error in judgment mehra said the sky 
was very hazy and bakshi may have miscalculated the jets altitude 
when the pilot started to pull up mehra said the plane was 
about 18 feet from the ground if the jet had been 12 feet higher 
bakshi probably could have made it he said 
he was one of our most experienced pilots mehra said 
the mirage was completing the final flyby of indian air force 
day marking the 57th anniversary of the indian air force and 
honoring its 115000 enlisted men the ceremony was held at the 
military section of palam airport in west new delhi and all 
civilian flights were halted during the show 
the aircraft slammed into the ground exploded and bounced three 
times through fuel tanks on the ground igniting a giant fireball 
two buses caught fire and several trucks and other vehicles in the 
area were badly damaged by burning chunks of debris 
the mirage is capable of flying up to 1460 mph at an altitude 
of 65600 feet the first mirages came off the assembly line in 
1966 
the indian air force acquired 49 mirage 2000 fighters between 
1982 and 1986 the jets are considered an essential part of indias 
fleet which includes other frenchdesigned aircraft and some of 
the soviet unions most sophisticated planes helicopters and 
fighters 
military experts from nato and warsaw pact countries have rated 
the skills of indian air force pilots among the worlds best but 
they gave them low marks for aircraft maintenance 
at least 30 accidents most involving the sovietmade mig27 
fighters have occurred in the past four years

the government is preparing orders that will 
force airlines to regularly strip the interiors of their aging 
jetliners for corrosion inspections 
rules are also being considered to require all new airliner 
models to undergo pressurized tests on a sample aircraft that would 
batter the fuselage with the equivalent of two lifetimes of 
takeoffs and landings 
these and other steps to ensure the safety of airliners that are 
increasingly used long past their designed lifespans were presented 
at a threeday industry and government conference last week 
more than 300 aviation experts at the second annual 
international conference on aging aircraft viewed slides of 
deteriorating jetliners discussed an array of sophisticated 
detection equipment and exchanged horror stories including the 
supposed discovery of a dead frog in a corrosionprone jetliner 
section now referred to as the guppy pond 
with the us fleet of passenger jets exceeding 12 years old and 
expected to grow older as the demand pushes airlines to refurbish 
rather than retire their oldest models federal aviation 
administration officials disclosed plans for new airworthiness 
directives to deal with corrosion in boeing 747 737 727 and 707 
jetliners 
the orders are expected next month to be followed in february 
1990 by similar directives affecting mcdonnell douglasbuilt jets 
and later for other aircraft said leroy keith head of the faas 
air certification directorate in seattle 
there are no plans for mandatory retirement ages but the cost 
will be going up in maintaining aging aircraft keith said 
the corrosion orders are based on the work of an 
industrygovernment task force that already has triggered sweeping 
changes in the way older airliners are kept safe 
both industry and government officials stress that none of the 
steps indicate that airliners now in service are unsafe but are an 
effort to ensure against failures before dangers arise 
since the task force was set up at the first aging airliner 
conference sponsored by the faa and the industrybacked flight 
safety foundation 16 months ago the government has ordered 
mandatory replacements of parts on jetliners as they reach a set 
number of takeoffs and landings previously the faa ordered 
repetitive inspections with replacements required only when 
problems were found 
those orders focused primarily on problems related to metal 
fatigue as an airliner is pressurized for flight and depressurized 
upon landing 
the new directives which are expected to be adopted in other 
countries where usbuilt airliners fly will require carriers to 
set up their own anticorrosion programs with inspections on 
various sections of each airliner at intervals ranging from three 
to eight years 
corrosion is more closely related than fatigue to chronological 
age the quality of care the airliner is given the environment in 
which it is flown and conditions within the aircraft 
frequent coffee spills in the galley or regular hauling of fish 
or animal products in the cargo hold for example can accelerate 
corrosion 
no airliner model is immune to deterioration said government 
scientist pin tong 
multiplesite damage is not isolated to one manufacturer or 
one model but may appear anywhere in the aging fleet he said 
both boeing and mcdonnell douglas have conducted extensive tests 
on selected models to determine how many takeoffs and landings an 
airliner can undergo without damage 
a dc9 fuselage went through the equivalent of more than 200000 
flights with no evidence of multiplesite fatigue damage said 
dan hagemaier a douglas aircraft engineer 
faa officials said rules requiring such testing for all new 
aircraft models are being drawn up and could affect future design 
the air line pilots association has been calling for such tests 
to set design service life for airliners 
alpa proposes that any extension of the service life be 
certified only after a teardown inspection of a representative 
aircraft 
j a marceau a boeing corrosion expert said more than 75 
percent of corrosion problems been solved in new passenger planes 
rolling off the assembly line 
we have the majority of problems licked with new design 
philosophies he said 
the new corrosion orders will classify damage at three levels 
including the earliest signs localized damage and extensive 
deterioration 
an airline will have to open its planes up inspect repair 
anything thats found report the findings to the government apply 
corrosiveprevention compounds and then close it up said owen 
schrader faa aging aircraft program manager at the certification 
office in seattle 
the goal is to require inspections frequently enough that 
eventually we wont find anything but levelone corrosion he 
said 
the orders could prove costly to some carriers but schrader 
said most major airlines already have anticorrosion programs and 
the required inspections could be done along with other mandatory 
work 
the goal is to find an inexpensive means of quickly checking 
whole airliners for both cracks and corrosion without tearing them 
apart 
faa and national aeronautics and space administration scientists 
indicated significant research still is needed with a number of 
methods being tested and used in current inspections 
but schrader said the only acceptable detection device for the 
mandatory corrosion inspections is likely to be the human eye

the dramatic rush of refugees from east to 
west germany is causing officials to take a new look at a prospect 
once considered remote the reunification of that divided country 
while experts say the formation of one germany is still not in 
the cards for the near future it is a possibility that can no 
longer be dismissed as very remote 
any concrete moves toward reunification are likely to worry 
people in countries that have twice in this century faced germans 
on the battlefield 
raymond gh seitz assistant secretary of state for european 
and canadian affairs reaffirmed us support for eventual 
unification in testimony before a house foreign affairs 
subcommittee last week but added that it must be approached with 
caution because of a history in which the unification of germany 
led to instability and war 
the reunification of germany raises the prospect of major 
changes on the continent and therefore is something we have to 
look at very carefully said rep lee hamilton dind chairman 
of the house foreign affairs subcommittee on europe and the middle 
east 
we have kind of paid lip service to it without really thinking 
about the implications of it hamilton said in an interview i 
think a lot of countries have done that 
the united states and west european governments have long been 
on record in favor of reuniting germany which was split into two 
countries after the allied victory in world war ii and the onset of 
the cold war between east and west 
a senior us official speaking on condition he not be 
identified said in an interview a lot of people in britain 
france most west european countries have strong emotional 
reservations about reunification they havent had to deal with 
those reservations until very recently 
like others interviewed this official said my own 
expectation is that reunification is still a good many years 
away but he added if we had been talking a couple of months 
ago i would have said it was very very remote the fact that 
things are moving in eastern europe has obviously changed the 
picture 
hamilton said i dont think reunification of germany is going 
to come about in 1990 but it is clearly going to be put on the 
agenda now and discussed much more 
so far this year more than 120000 east germans have reached 
west germany where they are granted automatic citizenship the 
exodus has been helped by the decision of the reformist regime in 
hungary to open its borders 
west german foreign minister hansdietrich genscher has spoken 
recently of the possibility of a german confederation a step short 
of complete unity 
ingrid stahmer deputy mayor of west berlin asked about 
reunification on abctvs good morning america thursday said 
we dont see reunification in that we would form one state again 
but i think that we must come closeri think that we will come 
together on the way to a united europe 
but east german historian siegfried prokop asked on the same 
program whether unification was in prospect replied absolutely 
not its a dream of the reactionary forces in west germany 
faced with reform movements in hungary and poland the soviets 
are anxious to keep east germany in their orbit the country has a 
standard of living that is the envy of many of its east bloc 
neighbors although it remains far below west germanys 
experts said one of the major obstacles to unification is the 
absence in east germany of a strong opposition such as the 
solidarity union which has formed the new government in poland or 
the movements that are bringing about broad political reforms in 
hungary 
i think we are far from a place where this east german regime 
or its likely successors are going to move in that direction 
said helmut sonnenfeldt berlinborn guest scholar in foreign 
policy studies at the liberalleaning brookings institution and 
former state department counselor 
east germany in this situation i dont think has very many 
good choices said hamilton 
there seems to be no way out said kim holmes director of 
foreign policy and defense studies for the conservative heritage 
foundation 
still said holmes we see the possibility for the first time 
of revisiting the german question in a real kind of way i would 
have said a year ago not in my lifetime i am beginning to 
think given how swift the events were in poland and what has 
happened with the refugees that it could happen a lot sooner than 
a lot of people think 
sonnenfeldt said the recent developments certainly have put 
that subject on peoples agenda again 
if one means reestablishing the previous german reich even 
in a somewhat smaller territory i think that is probably not in 
the cards for any time soon the former state department official 
said 
i think there is a lot of concern in europe about the 
reconstitution of something that resembles the previous united 
germany that existed from 1871 on and especially in the hitlerian 
period he said i think in the united states this is less of a 
factor but i am sure there are particular groups in this country 
who would have strong feelings about it 
said holmes it raises maybe concern but concern only in the 
sense that we are not sure where it might end up and it could end 
up in a number of different ways some of which could not be in our 
interest

a newspaper advertisement offering 
interestfree home improvement loans for hurricane hugo victims 
targeted residents of the wrong charleston 
the sears ad ran last week in the charleston daily mail and the 
charleston gazette the storm caused some flooding and power 
outages in southern west virginia but the real damage was in 
charleston sc 
due to the recent damage caused by hurricane hugo we will now 
offer 0 percent financing the ad began it went on to tell 
customers they didnt need to wait for insurance checks to begin 
repairing their homes and that the loans didnt need to be repaid 
for three months 
the ad listed a telephone number for sears credit central in 
charlotte nc 
i think its pretty obvious in this case its the wrong 
charleston said emerson thomas an advertising salesman for the 
west virginiabased charleston newspapers 
he said the paper was partly to blame for not spotting the error 
on the page but then again they send a cameraready 
readytoprint ad an insertion order and we just schedule it 
he said 
susan bird of the sears store in charlestons town center mall 
said the ad was probably placed by someone in the charlotte 
district while the west virginia stores are part of the pittsburgh 
district 
we dont know at this point how it got in the paper here 
she said saturday 
sears officials said they did not know whether local stores 
would honor the ad charleston store manager peter martin said he

a columbus day poll suggests onefourth of 
american college seniors either never heard or do not remember the 
childhood ditty in 1492 columbus sailed the ocean blue 
in addition to finding that one in four do not know christopher 
columbus made his famous landing in the western hemisphere prior to 
the year 1500 the gallup poll suggests considerable ignorance of 
other basic facts about history and literature 
nearly 60 percent did not know the korean war started when harry 
s truman was president 58 percent did not know that william 
shakespeare wrote the tempest and nearly a quarter believed a 
famous saying from karl marx is part of the us constitution 
if the students answers were to be graded more than half of 
those tested would have failed concluded the survey which was 
conducted for the national endowment for the humanities 
armed with the survey results neh chairman lynne cheney called 
sunday for colleges and universities to revise their curricula so 
undergraduates study essential areas of knowledge 
in a booklet titled 50 hours she outlined a suggested core 
curriculum for college students 
responding to her admonition several college presidents 
essentially told the neh chief in more or less polite terms 
either to mind her own business or that she was behind the times 
here are some of the gallup poll highlights 
24 percent of the college seniors surveyed thought columbus 
landed in the western hemisphere some time after 1500 
42 percent could not place the civil war in the correct half 
century 
58 percent did not know that shakespeare was the author of 
the tempest but 95 percent knew that mark twain wrote the 
adventures of huckleberry finn 
58 percent did not know truman was president when the korean 
war began fourteen percent thought it started when john f kennedy 
was president 
55 percent could not identify the magna carta 
23 percent believed that marx phrase from each according to 
his ability to each according to his need is part of the us 
constitution 
according to the survey 39 percent of the college seniors 
failed the 49question history section on the portion of the 
survey devoted to literature which consisted of 38 questions 68 
percent of the students failed 
cheney said many colleges and universities allow students to 
earn bachelors degrees without taking courses in history 
literature science or mathematics and urged trustees and 
administrators to support faculty members who are working to 
strengthen general education requirements 
cheneys core curriculum suggests study in five basic areas of 
knowledge 
the first area 18 semester hours on cultures and civilizations 
would start with a onesememster survey course on the origins of 
civilization in general to be followed by two semesters of western 
civilization and one of american civilization and then two 
onesemester courses to be chosen from among the following african 
civilization east asian civilization islamic civilization latin 
american civilization and south asian civilization 
the other four areas of basic study foreign language 12 hours 
concepts of mathematics six hours natural sciences eight hours 
social sciences six hours 
the courses cheney said should be taught in small classes and 
in an integrated fashion so that for example students reading 
descartes philosophy in a western civilization course are reminded 
of his contributions to mathematics she also suggested that the 
classes be taught by the colleges most distinguished faculty 
james underwood dean of faculty at union college in 
schenectady ny criticized the neh for recommending a 
superficial rigid and impractical college curriculum he 
added that union college this fall began a general education 
curriculum with an emphasis on history and literature 
a reform that relies so heavily on the traditional western 
civilization course runs the risk of a dangerous superficiality 
said underwood the western civilization course tries to do 
everything and demands for its success the mythical renaissance 
man as teacher history should be taught by broadly educated 
historians and literature by professors of literature 
norm adler at the university of pennsylvania said it is 
encouraging to notice how much the report mirrors the curricula 
revisions that have taken place at his school 
similar sentiments were echoed by michigan state president john 
dibieggio who said the school already has gotten an revised 
curriculum approved by the community and board of trustees 
elton bruins of hope college in holland mich said hope 
never gave way to current fads of dropping core curriculum weve 
always believed it is very important for many years we were 
probably considered oldfashioned by a lot of schools 
the gallup survey included 33 questions taken from a 1986 
nehfunded survey of 17yearolds and five questions from 
examinations that the us immigration and naturalization service 
administers to prospective american citizens 
grading the 87question survey on the standard a to f 
scale where scoring less than 60 percent correct constitutes a 
falling grade 55 percent of the students would have earned an 
f an additional 20 percent would have received a d only 
11 percent of the respondents would have earned an a or b 
the gallup survey of 696 seniors was conducted between april 4 
and april 27 using a selfadministered test booklet it had a 4 
percent margin of error the participating students attend 67 
fouryear american colleges and universities both public and

education secretary lauro cavazos criticized 
the governments schooling of native americans on sunday and called 
for a study that he said could prove revolutionary for indian 
education 
cavazos used the 21st national indian education association 
conference in anchorage alaska to call for a federally directed 
gathering campaign and a special task force involving the 
participation of native american citizens and educators to 
analyze the problems that native americans face with education 
a copy of his speech was released in washington 
cavazos said the results of the survey he called for could have 
the same impact as the a 1983 government general education report 
that shocked the american public and led to the education reform 
movement that has come to many areas of the country 
i see this developing into an indian nations at risk study 
which will follow the path laid out by the landmark study of the 
national education structure a nation at risk said cavazos 
the education secretary said interior secretary manuel lujan has 
agreed that we must move in this direction and the two 
departments education and interior must work together to address 
the needs in indian education 
cavazos and lujan are the bush administrations only hispanic 
cabinet members the education secretary a texan like president 
bush was first appointed by former president reagan as the first 
hispanic to the cabinet 
briefly recounting the history of native americans cavazos 
said long before the appearance of the anglo on the shores of 
the north american continent you nations had instituted systems of 
education 
the first treaty signed with the newly independent united 
states in 1794 by the oneida tuscarora and stockbridge tribes 
provided for indian education he said 
the respect for knowledge held by native americans makes the 
failures of effective education policies for the indian nations 
these past two centuries all the more tragic said cavazos 
noting an article that described the history of indian education 
as one of crossed purposes and unfulfilled hopes that is still 
unfolding today 
an education department study of high school sophomores found 
that from 1980 through 1986 american indians and alaskan natives 
dropped out at more than double the rate for the whole test group 
native american students are likely to be labeled handicapped or 
learning disabled the study said eleven percent of indian 
sophomores in public and private schools were enrolled in special 
education programs and 36 percent were classified as having some 
form of handicap 
in comparison 9 percent blacks and 7 percent of hispanics were 
in special programs 
cavazos said the 1980 census found only about 8 percent of 
american indians 25 years and older had completed four years of 
college he said a recent study revealed that nearly three out of 
four american indian college students do not earn degrees 
the statistics are due partly to the governments failed 
attempts to at first assimilate native americans and then to 
urbanize them he said 
now cavazos said the federal government is trying to replace 
assimilation with selfdetermination he said these efforts are 
being bolstered by the administrations education initiatives like 
choice allowing parents to decide where to send their children to 
school and schoolbased management where principals teachers 
parents and students set their own curricula agendas and plans 
he said the study he wants must provide a complete review of 
government programs that affect indian education the focus will be 
on the cost effectiveness of current efforts as well as developing 
cooperation between the bureau of indian affairs and the education 
department

both young men from the island of kauai are attending the small 
university of mary south of bismarck after being lured some 3000 
miles by football scholarships kaleo 20 a junior is majoring in 
business while trevor 19 a sophomore is leaning toward a 
profession in medicine 
both were recruited by other small colleges but kaleo took 
marys offer and trevor followed a year later he said it was 
fun trevor said 
the iwasaki brothers like north dakota just fine 
the island where were from is laid back kaleo said up 
here its the same way in north dakota everyones relaxed 
the north dakota climate with snow drier air and extreme 
temperatures took some getting used to the brothers admit 
this weather is so dramatic trevor said 
but he said the bitterly cold winters are no big deal 
because when the cold comes around were inside most of the 
time 
its hard for us to explain to people back home what 40 below 
feels like kaleo added

the connection between barbecue and global 
politics may seem tenuous at best until its described by a man 
planning to take his traveling cooking contest to the soviet union 
like turning swords into plowshares we say turn missiles 
into barbecue pits said bar owner silky sullivan who has 
promoted barbecue contests in ireland and thailand and has his 
sights now on estonia one of the baltic states in the soviet union 
the idea began to take root in september when a cooking team 
from estonia showed up at a barbecue shindig sullivan has organized 
in lisdoonvarna ireland for the past five years 
the estonians were invited to the irish barbecue by an irish 
peace group that is also helping sullivan organize the excursion to 
the soviet union planned for next september 
sullivan said he began organizing the contests in ireland after 
visiting and getting a taste of the locals paltry attempt at 
barbecue 
they reached in a pot of potatoes and cabbage and pulled out 
this old chunk of meat threw it on irish soda bread put some red 
stuff on it and said now taste that he said when we 
brought the contest to ireland the first year it was like aid to 
ethiopia you wouldnt believe it they were taking the bones home 
for their soup they loved it

senate democratic leaders seeking to expedite 
passage of a giant deficitreduction bill expressed concern sunday 
that a proposed expansion of childcare benefits might be lost in 
the process 
childcare legislation is of the highest priority in this 
congress a far higher priority than a capitalgains tax cut 
which president bush wants senate majority leader george j 
mitchell dmaine told reporters we dont want that to fall 
between the cracks 
the childcare issue apparently was the main one raised in a 
private meeting of senate leaders of both parties 
as recently as saturday the biggest questions facing similar 
meetings were how republicans could win the capitalgains tax cut 
that president bush wants and how democrats could defeat capital 
gains and substitute expanded individual retirement accounts 
whatever the issues the only agreement was that meetings would 
resume tuesday in an effort to see if hundreds of provisions 
unrelated to deficit reduction can be stripped from a bill whose 
main purpose is deficit reduction 
finishing the big deficit bill is the major business facing both 
the house and senate during the upcoming holidayshortened week 
however the house may get to senatepassed flag legislation by the 
end of the week 
unless congress completes action by oct 16 on the deficit bill 
the grammrudman law will trigger automatic acrosstheboard cuts 
in most spending programs 
the house already has passed its deficit bill a package loaded 
down with such extraneous issues as repealing catastrophic health 
coverage for retirees restoring the fairness doctrine that 
requires broadcasters to air all sides of an issue extension of 
several expiring tax breaks for a variety of interests and a broad 
new initiative to help lowerincome working parents 
the house bill also includes a capitalgains tax cut the cut 
cannot be considered totally extraneous because it would increase 
tax collections and reduce the deficit in the next three years but 
lose money for at least two years after that 
a similarly bloated bill is awaiting action in the senate it 
contains a different childcare plan but no capitalgains tax cut 
instead democrats added to the package an expansion of 
taxdeductible iras for all workers 
leaders of both parties have decried the tendency to load up the 
deficitreduction bills with unrelated amendments now to avoid 
disruptions that the oct 16 automatic spending cuts might bring 
they are looking for a way to strip away the amendments and leave a 
relatively clean deficitreduction package 
if the effort is successful it likely will require that a new 
bill be originated in the senate to include the ira expansion the 
childcare initiative dozens of other tax provisions and if the 
republicans have their way a capitalgains cut 
we dont have an agreement yet but everybody in there today 
thought we should get one senate republican leader bob dole of 
kansas told reporters 
there was no explanation of why so much attention was given the 
childcare issue in sundays meeting mitchell said only that in a 
caucus saturday several democrats insisted that the childcare 
initiative not be lost in efforts to trim the deficitreduction 
bill 
child care is a popular issue with both parties this year 
although there are differences on the form in which aid should be 
channeled to lowincome working parents 
the bill written by the democraticcontrolled finance committee 
involves only three tax credits with no increase in federal grants 
to states the taxcredit approach traditionally is the one favored 
by republicans 
however it is no secret that some liberal democrats are 
uncomfortable that most of the debate on deficit reduction has been 
focused on the capitalgains cut which would benefit chiefly those 
making more than 100000 a year and on expanded iras which are 
aimed mostly at those between 50000 and 75000 
talking about child care allows democrats to shift the focus to 
families in the 25000ayear range 
involved in the discussions sunday in addition to mitchell and 
dole were finance committee chairman lloyd bentsen dtexas and 
senior republican bob packwood of oregon budget committee chairman 
james sasser dtenn and senior republican pete domenici of new 
mexico and sen robert c byrd dwva who heads the 
appropriations committee

nearly six months after the brutal rape of a 
central park jogger the 29yearold woman is recovering and 
sending messages to a group of fellow runners who are helping make 
the park safer for everyone who uses its green expanse 
police have beefed up park security and volunteers are 
patrolling the park offering partners for runners and bringing 
groups of them together for safer exercise 
this is how good comes from bad said debbie king director 
of the new york road runners safety program 
the jogger an investment banker was attacked by a mob of 
teenagers as she ran alone in the northern part of the park late 
in the evening of april 19 
when police found the woman hours later she was in a coma and 
had lost threequarters of her blood paramedics did not expect her 
to live 
she remained in critical condition until may 1 when she 
appeared to raise her eyebrows as her name was called and raised 
her hand 
she was walking a bit when she was moved june 7 to gaylord 
hospital in wallingford conn 
by midsummer she reportedly was classified as a 7 on a recovery 
scale of 1 to 8 patients must reach level 8 to live independently 
she was able to read novels relearn basic math skills and call 
colleagues at solomon brothers where she had worked before the 
attack 
gaylord spokeswoman lori ann brass said last week that the 
jogger was making good progress doing well she would not 
elaborate 
fred lebow president of the new york road runners said he had 
never met the injured jogger but received communications from her 
through a mutual friend 
i get little messages from her that she jogs a little bit at 
gaylord and that she hopes someday to run the marathon said 
lebow 
shes inspirational to anyone not just runners said 
lebow she came through a horrendous experience and evidently 
shes recovering 
six youths have been indicted in the attack hearings are 
scheduled for tuesday although no trial date has been set 
the case focused the energy of the citys legions of joggers who 
were unwilling to surrender the huge park which stretches 2 miles 
long and a halfmile wide through the center of manhattan 
in june the road runners launched its safety program in which 
200 men and women take turns walking or running along a course in 
the park in shifts from 7 am to 9 pm the joggers carry 
lightweight radios and wear bright orange vests 
they are the eyes and ears of the central park community 
ms king said the police cant be everywhere citizens have to 
take responsibility 
the volunteers have used the radios to report bicycle accidents 
stonethrowing incidents a car accident and a sexual assault last 
month a man who allegedly fondled two female joggers was arrested 
15 minutes after they flagged down a road runner volunteer for help 
there is a very positive feeling among people in central park 
toward the people in the orange vests it really boosts the 
community morale in central park ms king said

the bush administration was preparing covert 
action to seize panamanian leader gen manuel antonio noriega 
during a coup attempt last week but the uprising collapsed before 
the plan could be executed top officials said sunday 
president bush made the decision near the end of a failed coup 
last tuesday and the order was conveyed to the commander of us 
forces in panama gen maxwell thurman said secretary of state 
james a baker iii and brent scowcroft the white house national 
security adviser 
the message that was sent was that if there were an 
opportunity to do this without risking bloodshed and significant 
loss of american life and to do so without open military 
involvement then he was free to go ahead the commander on the 
ground was free to go ahead baker said on the nbctv program 
meet the press 
defense secretary dick cheney said that at the outset of the 
coup he told thurman to be prepared to use peaceful means to take 
custody of noriega but the chance never came 
after the panamanians had contacted us and told us that 
they had noriega but that they would not give him to us i made it 
clear that our commander on the scene was authorized to get him if 
he could without using military force and that he should develop 
an option or a plan to use military force to get him cheney said 
on the cbstv program face the nation 
we never made the decision to use military force that would 
have involved going in against the rebels and taking noriega from 
them i never thought that was a very good idea but we told to him 
to be prepared in case he got the order to do so shortly after 
that the coup fell apart said cheney 
the order to ready nonuniformed us forces for a covert action 
to grab noriega was first reported in sunday editions of the 
washington post 
although that report did not attribute the decision to the 
president scowcroft said president bush personally was 
responsible what ever guidance was sent down yes personally 
ordered whatever guidance was sent to general thurman 
baker cheney and scowcroft said top presidential advisers 
believe they acted correctly during the failed coup despite 
criticism from congress that us forces should have helped the 
rebels or to intervened to seize noriega for trial in the united 
states on drug charges 
there is nothing like 2020 hindsight given what we know now 
about what was actually happening on the ground then i think i 
would not change what we did scowcroft said on the abctv 
program this week with david brinkley 
nearly a week after the incident it was still not 100 percent 
certain that the rebels who seized noriegas headquarters ever had 
custody of the strongman scowcroft said and they told the deputy 
us commander in panama maj gen marc cisneros that they would 
not hand him over 
the rebels never asked us indeed when we had that one meeting 
with general cisneros we asked them to give him and they said 
no said scowcroft 
at that point we became fairly certain although we did not 
know for sure and still have no positive proof noriega was there 
we had pretty good assurance that noriega was in fact there and 
the decision was made to use nonuniformed us forces to grab him 
said scowcroft 
the indication later tuesday that noriega was at his 
headquarters about 600 yards from the us command center changed 
the calculus of what we were prepared to do said scowcroft 
noriega has told reporters that he was never in custody and 
the last thing he has said was that no he was never there 
said scowcroft 
throughout the coup said scowcroft the administration was in 
the fog of war you are operating without a full deck of 
intelligence information 
changes will be made to avoid a repeat he said but did not 
spell out what steps were planned 
were not happy scowcroft said we certainly hope noriega 
will not remain in power he is a dangerous symbol 
our procedures and in some cases some organizational things 
ought to be improved as a result of it and we will be doing 
that he said 
although the rebels said they did not want open us help they 
did ask american forces to block two of three overland routes to 
the noriegas headquarters 
the plotters came in and said we do not want american help 
we do not want our action tainted by being involved with the united 
states all we want you to do is just sort of keep the 
reinforcements from these two roads scowcroft said 
us forces deployed to block the two roads designated by the 
plotters but bush decided that further use of uniformed american 
troops to aid the rebels was too dangerous scowcroft said 
the two roads that we blocked the causeway and the bridge 
over the canal are bottlenecks they are easy to isolate they 
are areas within our exercise area clearly they are they are 
things that can be done within our general treaty authorities 
said scowcroft referring to the 1977 pact turing over the panama 
canal to the panamanians 
the third route is very different it is down through the 
heart of old panama city multiple routes crowded city to do 
that and outside the area where us troops move and exercise 
that have been the overt exercise of military force perhaps into a 
fire fight to block them in the heart of a heavily populated 
area scowcroft said

the new york city opera canceled the remaining 
six weeks of its neveropened fall season sunday after striking 
orchestra members overwhelmingly rejected a contract offer the 
companys lawyer said 
members of local 802 of the associated musicians of greater new 
york voted 564 against the fouryear proposal the union announced 
sunday they have been on strike since sept 13 what would have 
been the seasons opening night 
in addition to the orchestra members 300 to 400 performers and 
backstage personnel are idled by the strike said martin 
oppenheimer the operas attorney and lead negotiator 
the human loss is obviously significant and very 
regrettable oppenheimer said equally important he added is 
the cultural loss to this community 
the contract voted down saturday would have guaranteed the 
musicians 29 weeks of work per year the same number of weeks as 
the previous contract and raised wages and benefits 6 percent 
each year oppenheimer said the opera initially sought to cut the 
minimum work year to 23 weeks 
union spokeswoman judy west said members believed the deal 
didnt go far enough in improving wages and benefits 
under the old contract orchestra members made 755 per 19hour 
week 
no new talks were scheduled but both sides said they probably 
would meet soon in hopes of saving the operas spring season 
the opera company was established in 1943

nearly four centuries after explorer henry 
hudson sailed up the river that bears his name a replica of his 
ship the half moon will journey down the hudson river on its 
maiden journey 
the new half moon with a crew of 20 will set out downriver on 
its shakedown cruise this coming saturday making an overnight stop 
in new york city andrew hendricks who conceived the project 
announced saturday 
the crew will then sail it down the atlantic coast on a twoweek 
cruise to the ships new home at washington nc on the western 
side of pamlico sound hendricks said plans for future voyages are 
undecided he said 
the half moon was built to honor the netherlands contributions 
to america and hudsons 1609 voyage up the river when the english 
explorer was working for the dutch east india co 
the 85foot 120ton replica is a little different from hudsons 
halve maen this half moon features such nonauthentic features 
as an emergency engine and contemporary navigational equipment 
you play a fine line with the historical thing said 
hendricks citing constraints such as coast guard regulations 
but its as historically accurate as it can be 
the ship originally was set to embark on a tour of several 
northeastern ports on july 5 but the june death of the ships 
architect and chief builder nicholas benton who fell from the 
mast of another ship forced a change of plans 
we had blueprints but it didnt say what some of the sizes 
of the parts were or the colors hendricks said 
hendricks also had to hire people to do work that benton would 
have done for free boosting the cost from 1 million to about 12 
million he said 
hendricks said he hopes to pay for the half moon by charging 
admission at a planned visitor center in washington nc

president bush told a cheering audience of 
republican women sunday that he has appointed more women to senior 
positions in his first nine months than any president before did in 
a full year 
bush interrupted a threeday holiday weekend at camp david to 
fly here by helicopter for a selfcongratulatory address before 
2200 of the party faithful at the biennial convention of the 
national federation of republican women 
bush boasted that the republican party understands the 
heartbeat of the american people and is the only party that 
delivers on its promises 
he made no reference to panama and last tuesdays abortive coup 
there critics have accused bush of failing to act decisively to 
aid rebel officers seeking to overthrow strongman manuel antonio 
noriega 
bush his right hand bandaged from minor surgery three days ago 
instead crowed about successes on several fronts from arms control 
with the soviets to curbing pollution and rebuilding americas 
schools 
he praised the 140000member federation for mounting a 
candidate recruiting program called project 90 
part of governing is making sure that in the executive branch 
the best are chosen to serve so weve sought out the best and 
our record of appointing talented and qualified women to important 
offices proves it the president told the women at a luncheon in 
the baltimore convention center 
weve appointed 139 women to senior positions in this 
administration said bush thats more women appointed in 
our first nine months than any previous administration managed in 
any given year 
i frankly believe thats a great step toward good 
government said bush who said the 139 included 
88 women nominated or announced for senior positions requiring 
senate confirmation 
21 to presidential appointments not requiring confirmation 
30 to deputy assistant secretary posts in cabinet departments 
also not requiring confirmation 
white house personnel director chase untermeyer said last month 
that 20 percent of the posts requiring senate confirmation have 
gone to women the old record for appointing women to posts 
requiring senate confirmation was 72 set by president jimmy carter 
in 1980 
the gop women were winding up their 25th biennial convention 
bush who also addressed their last convention in 1987 said 
we promised america peace and prosperity and were keeping that 
promise 
he cited his recent call at the united nations for a ban on all 
chemical weapons as well as his proposal to drastically reduce 
conventional forces in europe and what he called steady 
movement toward longrange nuclear arms treaty with the soviets 
the economy has just entered the 83rd month of uninterrupted 
economic growth and nearly half a million black americans have 
found jobs in the past two years bush said 
bush said his administration has also made headway on the 
environment in staging the recent education summit and in the 
struggle against drugs 
the crowd gave some of its biggest cheers to first lady barbara 
bush whom the presidential affectionately introduced as the 
silver fox 
the couple flew immediately back to camp david from fort mchenry 
after the 15minute speech 
the bushes were spending the columbus day holiday at the 
presidential retreat before returning to the white house monday 
afternoon 
on thursday bush will be out on the hustings in mississippi and 
new york city trying to help republicans retain the congressional 
seat of the late rep larkin smith rmiss and wrest the 
mayoralty of new york from the democrats

president bush is waging a fullblown damage 
control operation over the botched panamanian uprising struggling 
against a torrent of criticism confusion and shifting explanations 
by the white house about the events and the us response 
the failed coup against panamanian strongman ge manuel antonio 
noriega was regarded within the white house as the first crisis 
test for bush and officials at the highest level were distressed 
by mistakes in intelligence gathering coordination and other 
problems 
were not happy our procedures and in some cases some 
organizational things ought to be improved as a result of it and 
we will be doing that white house national security adviser 
brent scowcroft said sunday on the abctv program this week with 
david brinkley 
defense secretary dick cheney said that given everything that 
was available to us then and given what i know now i still think 
we made the right decision 
paraphrasing the president secretary of state james a baker 
iii said that with 2020 hindsight i cant think of anything i 
would do differently than what i did 
bush was adamant in defending his decision not to intervene 
militarily to unseat noriega im not just being stubborn but as 
i look at all the information i wouldnt have made a different 
decision then he said last week 
aside from being a learning experience the episode was a 
dramatic reminder of the limits on us influence in other 
countries it was a painful experience for bush who had encouraged 
the panama defense forces to rise up against their leader but then 
decided to stay on the sidelines refusing to authorize action by 
any of the 12000 us military forces in panama 
bush did not hide his frustration that noriega was still in 
power disappointed that noriegas still there yes i am he 
said 
republicans joined democrats in flaying the administration in 
one of the toughest criticisms sen alfonse damato rny 
called the administrations handling of the coup as an incredible 
stain on us and called white house statements a weakkneed 
explanation for failure 
the chairman of the senate intelligence committee sen david 
boren dokla criticized the administration sunday for not 
planning in advance what aid it would give panamanian military 
officers who might attempt a coup 
every time there has been a witness before our committee we 
have asked again and again and again if we start to take action 
are we prepared to see it through boren said on abc 
since george bush became president every single word of 
authority that he had requested from the intelligence committee and 
every single penny that he has requested from the intelligence 
committee relating to panama he has gotten and gotten with my 
support boren said 
scowcroft immediately challenged borens contention but 
declined to give specifics saying the details were secret 
senator boren over the last year his contribution to such 
things leaves me kind of astonished that he would say that said 
scowcroft we did not get everything we had wanted 
much of the congressional criticism of the presidents handling 
of the crisis stemmed from the shifting administration version of 
events 
did rebel forces ever offer to turn over noriega to the united 
states 
baker cheney and scowcroft on sunday all repeated 
administration assertions that the rebels refused to hand over 
noriega and even questioned whether they ever had him in custody 
but late last week administration officials acknowledged that a 
cable was sent to washington saying that the rebels wanted to give 
him up the word want should have read wont officials 
insisted 
did the united states take part in the coup attempt 
the white house at first insisted there was no involvement then 
acknowledged that us troops were deployed along key access 
routes at the rebels request to block forces loyal to noriega 
from reaching his headquarters 
they would have been stopped white house press secretary 
marlin fitzwater said when asked if us forces would have 
intercepted noriega reinforcements 
fitzwater also recanted his original claim that the united 
states had not been in touch with coup leaders before the uprising 
in fact he said us officials had advance discussions with coup 
leader maj moises giroldi 
us officials originally said the united states had been 
reluctant to take direct action in the coup because of doubts about 
giroldi who was known as a noriega confidant and had helped put 
down an earlier coup 
on sunday cheney repeated that he at first feared the coup was 
setup 
giroldi was killed in the coup perhaps by noriega himself in 
retrospect fitzwater said we think it the coup was legitimate 
now 
confusion is endemic to such situations he said 
its because thats the nature of coups he insisted 
there is conflicting information this whole thing happened in a 
sixhour period and there are people running all over its 
the ambiguity of the coup itself as is true of all coups that 
caused the conflict of information

in 1953 soviet tanks and troops 
brutally put down an east german workers uprising but in 1989 
prodemocracy demonstrators in east berlin chant gorby gorby 
help us 
many of the nations 166 million people view reformminded 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev who visited east berlin over 
the weekend to mark the nations 40th anniversary as a sign of 
hope for democratic change 
but the communist leadership in east berlin will hear nothing of 
it despite the growing exodus of east germans who have fled to the 
west in the past month seeking more freedom and economic 
opportunity 
the official east german news agency adn called the weekend 
protesters troublemakers who had been chanting slogans against 
the republic referring at least in part to the cries of 
gorby 
east german leader erich honecker saturday dismissed the 
protesters demands and said their hopes were built on sand 
gorbachev told the 77yearold honecker of a russian saying that 
he who is late is punished and urged the east german leader to 
consider reform 
by the end of the day saturday more than 15000 people had 
taken to the streets in east berlin and five other cities in the 
biggest protests in 36 years 
in 1953 it was the red army that crushed demonstrations and 
killed at least 267 protesters more than 100 others were later 
executed for their role in the uprising 
angered by economic hardship and increased productivity quotas 
workers in east berlin walked off the job on june 16 1953 the 
following day more than 12000 protesters took to the streets in 
the city and demonstrators also marched in leipzig dresden and 
other major cities 
soviet military commanders stationed in east germany declared a 
state of emergency and sent in troops to quell the protests with 
tanks and guns east germany at the time was still under direct 
soviet domination even though the state was formed in 1949 
communist authorities called the uprising a coup attempt 
supported by western agents 
until recently mass protests had been a rarity in east germany 
this weekend the protesters were emboldened by a soviet leader 
rather than wary of possible kremlin intervention 
and although an estimated 380000 soviet troops remain stationed 
on east german soil this time it was east german police who put 
down the demonstrations 
witnesses and media reports said police chased kicked and 
punched demonstrators they also said hundreds of protesters were 
arrested and injured 
while gorbachevs visit was friendly and cordial there were 
other signs of change between the two countries 
when soviet leader leonid brezhnev visited east berlin for the 
30th anniversary celebrations in 1979 his picture was on the front 
page of the communist party newspaper neues deutschland 
ten years later there was no gorbachev picture and there was 
no customary live television coverage of his arrival

a leading lebanese moslem legislator 
said sunday that talks on ending his countrys civil war were 
deadlocked and that a more vicious war could break out unless 
christians surrender some political power 
zaher khatib a sunni moslem who represents the national front 
an alliance of 18 syrian and iranianbacked lebanese factions told 
reporters that syria will not withdraw its troops from lebanon 
until the christians agree to political reforms 
were at a dangerous crossroads he said after 63 lebanese 
lawmakers failed to meet for the third straight day because of deep 
divisions on the central issue of syrias military presence in 
lebanon and reforms proposed by the arab league 
the 33 christian and 30 moslem legislators have been in the 
saudi arabian resort of taif since sept 30 to discuss proposals to 
end lebanons 14yearold civil war the 22member arab league is 
sponsoring the meeting 
khatib said the meeting was a historic and golden 
opportunity that should not be lost 
the alternative is a renewal of the war and this time it will 
be a more vicious war because the weapons are going to be more 
vicious he said 
the arab league has proposed that syrian troops withdraw over 
two years from moslem sectors of beirut to the bekaa valley in the 
east a new lebanese government then would negotiate future syrian 
military deployments 
lebanese christian leader gen michel aoun a maronite catholic 
has demanded a complete syrian pullout within six months 
the syrians who consider lebanon vital to their security 
against israel have made it clear they will not withdraw before 
the christians agree to share power equally with moslems 
they have also linked withdrawal of their 40000 troops in 
lebanon to an israeli withdrawal from a border strip in southern 
lebanon the israelis have refused to budge despite un pressure 
youssef hammoud a lebanese shiite moslem parliament member 
said consultations in taif were deadlocked for the past three days 
by what he called a tug of war between moslems and christians 
the christians dominated by the maronites have held most key 
posts in lebanons government parliament judiciary and army since 
independence from france in 1943 
they were considered the majority then but moslems now make up 
an estimated 55 percent of the mediterranean countrys 4 million 
population 
the syrians moved in under an arab league peacekeeping mandate 
in 1976 the year after the civil war broke out aoun claims they 
abrogated that mandate by openly siding with the moslems 
the syrians insist they have never been asked to leave but the 
christians claim the syrians ignored two formal requests by former 
presidents elias sarkis and amin gemayel 
aoun although outgunned and outnumbered launched a war of 
liberation against the syrians in march that touched off six 
months of fierce artillery battles that killed more than 900 people 
before an arab leaguebrokered ceasefire took hold sept 22 
lebanons political problems are further complicated by the two 
rival governments that have ruled since september 1988 one is led 
by aoun and the other by acting prime minister salim hoss a 
syrianbacked sunni moslem 
king fahd of saudi arabia has been in contact with aoun and hoss 
in an effort to break the deadlock 
aoun has made no public comment but hoss was quoted by kuwaits

the botswana democratic party which 
has governed this diamondrich nation since independence in 1966 
retained a comfortable majority in parliament according to partial 
returns sunday 
the party captured all 19 districts where final results were 
available for the elections and it appeared set to add to its 
majority in parliament prior to saturdays balloting the party 
held 28 of the 34 seats 
the leftleaning botswana national front was expected to retain 
at least four of its five seats the botswana peoples party lost 
its lone seat 
this peaceful southern african nation is one of only a few on 
the continent to hold regular multiparty elections saturdays 
polls were the sixth since botswana gained independence from 
britain 23 years ago 
president quett masire and his democratic party retained their 
comfortable majority on the strength of botswanas surging 
capitalist economy which has grown at least 10 percent annually 
throughout the 1980s 
diamonds from the kalahari desert along with cattle ranching 
account for most of the wealth in this thinly populated desert 
nation of 12 million 
when botswana gained independence it was among the worlds 20 
poorest nations with a per capita annual income of less than 100 
today the average yearly income is more than 1000 one of the 
highest in africa 
at a time when many african nations are crippled by huge foreign 
debts botswanas government has spent cautiously and has foreign 
reserves in excess of 2 billion enough to pay for more than two 
years of imports 
masire president since 1980 has avoided expensive public works 
projects and concentrated on smallscale development 
the opposition national front argued that botswanas wealth has 
not reached the ordinary workers and called for an increase in 
public spending and the creation of more social programs

azerbaijani railroad crews defied a national ban 
on transport strikes sunday and again stemmed the flow of 
desperately needed supplies to rival armenia 
reports conflicted however on how much food fuel and building 
supplies were reaching the armenian republic 
our drivers are striking and demanding guarantees of their 
safety in response to gunfire and stoning attacks on several 
trains saturday night in armenia said azerbaijani activist shahin 
gadzhiev 
gadzhiev identified himself as a spokesman for the azerbaijani 
peoples front other members of the peoples front denied that 
train traffic had been halted 
the trains are running but the attacks on them are also 
continuing adel mamedov said in a telephone interview from the 
azerbaijani capital of baku 
tass the official soviet news agency reported late sunday that 
37 trains had been dispatched from azerbaijan to armenia over the 
past day and a half but it said extremist forces are still 
hindering the normal functioning of the route 
about 400 trains with a total of 60000 cars have been reported 
idled on main lines in the southwestern region of the soviet union 
the soviet legislature imposed a temporary ban on strikes in 
such key sectors as transport and energy tuesday after president 
mikhail s gorbachev warned that stoppages could ruin the economy 
and lead to anarchy 
it also ordered the ministries of defense and interior to 
restore rail traffic between the two feuding caucasus republics 
troops moved in to protect the trains and soviet media said friday 
the twomonth blockade that crippled armenia was over 
but the measures failed to quell the prolonged ethnic feuding 
over nagornokarabakh the fertile region claimed by both armenia 
and azerbaijan 
the christian armenian enclave has been part of moslemdominated 
azerbaijan since 1923 
nineteen months of unrest over nagornokarabakh has left 117 
dead thousands injured and more than 2000 homes and apartments 
destroyed tass said 
in the disputed region five people were wounded in clashes 
saturday and an epidemic of viral hepatitis threatened the 
population tass reported sunday 
mutual hostility blinds the participants of the conflict with 
dark malice and suppresses their reason the official news agency 
said noting that reports from the region increasingly resemble 
dispatches from war zones 
airlifts are the only thing preventing mass starvation in 
nagornokarabakh which has a predominantly armenian population of 
about 160000 tass said 
it said a highway bridge on the outskirts of nagornokarabakhs 
capital stepanakert was blown up early saturday cutting off 
additional areas 
ungathered grape crops are rotting in the field armed attacks 
against villages continue and ambulances cannot respond to calls 
because they have no gas tass said 
armenian activist rafael popoyan said sunday that armenia was 
still hit by food and fuel shortages although they were not as 
severe as in nagornokarabakh 
he said the few shipments that made it through azerbaijan to 
armenia were sabotaged they either contained damaged materials or 
cisterns filled with water instead of fuel 
everything that arrived is no good he said in a telephone 
interview from the armenian capital of yerevan that the blockade 
was stopped at all is a myth 
interior ministry officials and reporters for staterun media in 
armenia and azerbaijan were unavailable sunday for comment on the 
blockade 
about 80 percent of armenian rail traffic runs through 
azerbaijan the azerbaijani blockade has virtually halted 
reconstruction work on armenian areas destroyed by the massive 
earthquake last december that left 25000 dead 
gadzhiev whose peoples front is demanding azerbaijani control 
of nagornokarabakh accused armenians of attempting to impose 
their own blockades on azerbaijan 
he said saturdays bridge explosion in nagornokarabakh was 
aimed at the azerbaijani village nearby the power supply to part 
of azerbaijan also has been interrupted by nagornokarabakhs 
unrest gadzhiev said from baku

spring 1990 will mark the rebirth of flower 
power at least in the fashion world 
giorgio armani who opened the italian springsummer 
readytowear shows sunday with his emporio line called on the 
young to recall the hippie dress code of their parents gypsy 
skirts and shawls vests tattered jeans oversized shirts and 
jackets clumpy sandals 
for beach boys and girls armani drew inspiration from the south 
pacific with fishnet and burlap hisandher sarongs and diaper 
shorts 
italian beaches have long bade farewell to the bikini of the 
1960s giving way to whole suits for women and surf shorts for men 
armani takes the look a step further by delving into grandmas 
trunk for those great gatsby striped tank suits 
a gasp went up among americans attending the early morning show 
in the theater of armanis downtown palazzo at the parade of 
barebreasted woman surrounded by barechested men all wearing 
armanis jeans europeans accustomed to topless bathing didnt 
bat an eyelash 
the blazer king likes his jackets long and light with a curved 
front like a tulip petal reminiscent of designs several seasons 
ago by italys romeo gigli 
there was a touch of gigli too in the faded pastel shades of the 
collection and the rounded uneven hemlines of skirts and dresses 
for summer armani hikes his hemlines way above his demure winter 
length 
lightweight pantsuits with ample jackets and baggy trousers and 
a series of cool cotton jumpsuits are sure to attract summer city 
dwellers 
another fashion favorite of the younger set franco moschino 
also showed sunday morning 
what attracts the young in moschino is his irony toward fashion 
and the fashion world at large during his shows he likes to hide 
his own beautiful clothes under exaggerations of other designers 
embellishments 
thus he once based an entire show on headgear from stovepipes to 
teddy bears mocking christian lacroix at every show he makes a 
point of ladening his evening wear with heavy gold chains a chanel 
trademark 
moschino also likes to poke fun at people who live by labels 
often sewing his own label on the outside of an outfit last season 
he designed a jacket with the words very expensive jacket 
stitched on the back in gold letters 
for springsummer 1990 moschino also flirt with the new hippie 
trend in a series of multicolored gypsy skirts jeans outfits and 
mexicanstyle long vests but the bulk of his collection was based 
on an evening look of basic black and gold 
his most astonishing outfit was a threepiece suit jacket 
brassiere and short skirt in glimmery gold fabric with lavish 
gold jewelry and a gold chain belt 
his most ironic style was a floorlength black chiffon gown with 
the letters vip in gold down the front with the v incorporated in 
the neckline 
over the next five days forty of italys top readytowear 
designers including armani versace krizia biagiotti missoni 
fendi and ferre will present their styles for next years warmer 
weather 
along with beautiful clothes the fashion crowd will be treated 
to a night at the famed la scala opera house for a performance by 
moscows bolshoi theater

a hummingbird that mysteriously ended 
up thousands of miles north of its normal range will be making the 
trip south by airplane but its fate is still uncertain 
the 3inch costas believed to be a year old spent the summer 
and early fall feeding on fuchsias at a home on the edge of 
anchorage 
other types of hummingbirds make their way to alaska but the 
costas breeds in the southwestern united states and usually heads 
to mexico this time of year the bird normally travels only as far 
north as sacramento calif 
hes so cute hes like a member of the family said pat 
bergt whose bushes became the birds adopted home 
no one is sure how the hummingbird with plumage of green and 
violet got to alaska 
denise gillen a san diego zoo hummingbird specialist said the 
bird most likely was ushered north by a weather system other 
possibilities are some kind of strange thing going on in his 
body and theres even a remote chance the bird which 
periodically goes into a dormant state was on a household plant 
that got packed for a journey to alaska she said 
mrs bergt and her husband derril grew concerned about the 
advance of winter and its possible toll on the hummingbird after it 
lingered week after week about 20 feet behind their home so they 
called in the us fish and wildlife service 
bruce batten information officer at the agencys office in 
anchorage already had plans tuesday to head through seattle to 
washington dc for a seminar and decided to take the bird along 
in a shoeboxsize container 
he said he will release the costas in seattle if a relay flight 
and escort to a point farther south cannot be lined up 
gillen said she doesnt know how the bird will fare in seattle 
or whether it will fly south from there on its own 
mrs bergt said she also was worried 
he could get hurt he could not survive the shipping mrs 
bergt said but he has a better chance than he will have here

for three hours apdow jones reporter igor 
reichlin hid in the apartment of an east german family that risked 
prison sentences by refusing to open the door to police searching 
for demonstrators here is his account of the demonstrations in 
east berlin 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
two fellow correspondents and i were following a 
column of several hundred prodemocracy marchers down a narrow 
street in east berlin early sunday when riot police surrounded the 
protesters 
just as we realized we had been cut off the police charged us 
separating the column into small groups one of the groups ran into 
a doorway and then into a courtyard where more police jumped out to 
grab them 
one of the marchers was able to duck into an open doorway nbc 
radio correspondent gary matsumoto and i followed him in we ran 
upstairs where we were hidden by a family that had seen us fleeing 
the family concealed us for three hours at great personal risk 
police knocked on their door many times threatening to break it 
down if they didnt open it they refused 
our other colleague london sunday times correspondent peter 
millar of england was arrested and taken to a police station in a 
suburb 
we later found out that he was questioned for six hours and 
released he told us that up to 1000 people may have been arrested 
saturday night and early sunday in east berlin and that many were 
beaten while being detained 
a fourth western journalist london sunday observer 
correspondent catherine field got away somehow 
the demonstration started with about 7000 people saturday 
afternoon and continued with interruptions until around 1 am 
sunday by then the police had brought in water cannon and used 
them on the few hundred people still left on the streets 
the family that sheltered us consisted of a man in his 40s a 
woman in her 30s and their child about age 10 the couple asked 
that their names not be published because of possible harassment by 
security forces 
as we talked we heard screams outside of protesting crowds when 
the water cannon went into action and police boots stomping on the 
cobblestone streets as police scattered marchers 
our host who clearly was risking his job by hiding us was 
deeply sad 
its a horrible shame that germans are beating up on other 
germans out of fear of change he said we need to discuss our 
problems but what kind of discussion can you have when rubber 
truncheons are the strongest argument our government can offer 
both parents said they were whitecollar workers and are 
intensely interested in current affairs their large apartment was 
filled with books on various topics 
tens of thousands of despairing east germans have left their 
homeland for the west in the past two months and there is a 
growing prodemocracy movement that is unwanted by the countrys 
hardline leaders 
the east berlin couple was concerned about where their country 
was headed and that violence might soon erupt again 
the family offered us food but we were too nervous to eat we 
did accept their offer of some red wine and later tea 
the husband went over to a window inspecting the backyard to 
see if there were any police there there were none but police 
were still milling around in front of the house 
he said we would probably be able to get out safely if we left 
through a backdoor and walked through the backyard to a side 
street we decided to try it and thanked our hosts for their help 
i met up again with millar on sunday morning at the grand hotel 
who said he was ordered to leave east berlin he said he wasnt 
beaten while detained but he was handled roughly until the police 
found out he was foreign correspondent 
millar was first taken to the prison at ruemmelsburg because 
the prison was already full he was then taken to a large detention 
facility at marzahn 
i escaped the beatings and arrests and have little to show as 
battle scars except a wrist sprained in a successful tussle with a 
state security agent for my tape recorder

were welcomed with handshakes and handed addressed envelopes to 
send donations to jim and tammy ministries inc 
some who emerged from the nearly twohour service said it was 
filled with pleas for money but others said the call was more for 
hope than handouts 
as far as im concerned nothings changed i will still give 
money to jim anytime he needs it said myrna coppersmith a 
13year ptl partner who followed bakker when he moved his ministry 
here earlier this year 
i feel jim has been betrayed she said when all the facts 
come out jim will be a free man 
but another follower a lakeland woman who said she had been a 
ptl member for 12 years but refused to give her name disagreed 
you have to be realistic and accept the jurys verdict she 
said its like a death in the family and i was hoping this would 
be the funeral 
ushers had to put extra seats in the back of the tiny 
combination church and television studio to accomodate the tourists 
its just a big show said irma de la cruz of san juan 
puerto rico who said she came out of curiousity this confirms 
what ive always felt theres not much religion in this 
ministry 
bakkers attorney has said the orlando ministry will be 
suspended indefinitely but kennett said it will continue with the 
help of the partners

theres evidence an automatic fire alarm 
system may not have worked when a blaze broke out last week at a 
nursing home killing nine authorities said 
a preliminary investigation of the fire indicates the system 
which also is supposed to automatically close the buildings fire 
doors never sent an alarm out of hillhaven rehabilitation and 
convalescent center city fire marshal carl welch said the fire 
department instead heard about the blaze via telephone calls 
there seems to be some confusion on whether the fire alarms 
worked correctly said jeffrey mckain vice president of the home 
nine of the homes 160 residents were killed and 98 injured 
thursday when a 78yearold patient accidentally tossed a match on 
his bed while smoking cigarettes in his secondfloor room in 
violation of the homes rules the man was among those who died 
it looks like the main alarm had not been tripped welch 
said he said sunday that investigators were trying to determine if 
fire officials or anyone else reset the alarm after the blaze 
the possible alarm malfunction also may have prevented fire 
doors in the nursing home from closing welch said fire doors are 
ordinarily kept open with electric magnets until tripped by fire 
alarms mckain said 
welch said sunday that investigators were still determining 
whether the fire doors did indeed fail to close the fire was 
confined largely to one room but thick smoke surged through other 
parts of the building and most of the deaths were due to smoke 
inhalation 
the automatic alarm system is linked to mgi security services 
inc which is supposed to relay calls to the city fire department 
welch said mgi officials had not indicated whether the alarm 
reached the company investigators planned to look at the companys 
records monday he said 
a woman who answered the telephone sunday at mgi and refused to 
give her name said only one employee was authorized to answer 
questions about the fire and he would not be available for comment 
until monday 
two of the injured nursing home patients remained in critical 
condition sunday at sentara norfolk general hospital nursing 
supervisor mary dadell said a third was in serious condition and 
seven others were in satisfactory condition she said 
firefighters were called to the nursing home by four telephone 
calls from employees to the emergency 911 line welch said but he 
stressed that firefighters were able to respond quickly 
the fire still was confined to one room welch said sunday 
in a facility like that if we can do that we did good 
the brick nursing home was not required to have fire sprinklers 
because it was built 20 years ago but mckain said fire sprinklers 
will be added within six months the nursing home had passed two 
state inspections this year and held fire drills each month 
mckain said hillhaven held monthly fire drills as required by 
regulations and a staff training session on evacuation techniques 
was held about two hours before the fire 
patients who were not injured in the fire were taken to other 
nursing homes

gen manuel antonio noriega moved 
sunday to gain the backing of the panamanian people following an 
attempted coup thanking them for support that reinforced his 
leadership 
a small group of officers and troopers of panamas defense 
forces tried to oust noriega tuesday but the revolt was crushed by 
loyalists 
sundays editions of the governmentowned la republica newspaper 
were filled with articles praising noreiga and pictures of the 
general commander of the defense forces one headline read a 
general with nerves of steel 
a message from noriega was broadcast on nationwide television 
and radio at the end of an editorial on a military news program 
in his message noriega thanked panamanians for the 
demonstrations of moral and spiritual support that reinforced the 
position of man manuel antonio noriega and of his men in the 
critical moment when the fate of panama and its national liberation 
movement were at stake 
those who think that the cause will fail if one man falls are 
mistaken he said 
noriega has accused the united states of backing the failed coup 
washington has applied political and economic pressure in an 
effort to oust noriega since february 1988 when he was indicted in 
florida on drug trafficking charges noriega says the indictments 
are part of a us plot to renege on the treaties to turn the 
panama canal over to panama at the end of the century 
the news programs editorial declared we have a general for 
tough times commanding our troops 
it said more surprise attacks could be in store and added 
we wont be caught with our guard down 
more than 60 soldiers and political figures including three 
members of noriegas general staff have been arrested in the 
crackdown since the attempted coup

saying its history has ended the communist party 
officialy called the hungarian socialist workers party is to be 
replaced by the hungarian socialist party according to the congres 
resolution reform leaders said the new party would be similar to 
western european socialist parties 
it was the first time in the soviet bloc that the leadership of 
a communist party has decided to dissolve the organization the 
move represents an attempt to draw support for multiparty national 
elections scheduled for june at the latest

decision former politburo member janos berecz said sunday the old 
party remains in existence until its entire rankandfile decides 
on its fate 
berecz ousted from the party politburo by reformers several 
months ago said the membership still has to decide and if the 
majority or a large section of the membership decides that they are 
members of the hungarian socialist workers party then i am with 
them 
he spoke in an interview on state television and did not 
elaborate 
another conservative robert ribanszki said he would organize a 
plebiscite among the 720000 members of the old party to allow them 
to declare their party affiliation 
the decision made yesterday was a great step backward in the 
history of the hungarian leftwing movement said ribanszki 
its not the leninist principles that were wrong but the way they 
were implemented 
the hardline janos kadar society named for hungarys former 
leader announced plans to found a new communist party politburo 
member janos barabas suggested the courts may have to decide 
janos barabas a reform member of the politburo was asked if 
the new socialist party could be considered the legal successor to 
the communist party and he said the courts may have to decide 
some legal experts at the congress told reporters the new party 
was the legal successor because it was a child of the congress 
the old partys most authoritative body 
the new party has invited into its ranks all members of the old 
party who agree with its principles the new partys platform backs 
parliamentary democracy with competing parties and components of 
private ownership in the national economy 
vice premier peter medgyessy urged the successors of the 
dissolved communist party to stop interfering in government 
business as hungary prepares for its first free elections in 41 
years 
medgyessy told reporters he would like to see a government of 
experts run the country until the elections 
he also indicated he believed to many conservatives may be 
allowed into the new party saying i am not convinced that the 
socalled cleansing of ranks that is necessary actually has 
happened

health administration said in a sworn statement submitted to a 
court friday that workers removed a cinderblock barrier inside the 
western kentucky mine about 15 minutes before the sept 13

explosive methane finnie said

last month ron siler president of costain coal inc parent to

apparently tore pages out of mine record books before giving the 
books to federal officials the day of the explosion

possibly from a welders torch or electrical equipment ignited a 
dangerously high concentration of methane

president carlos menem assessed 
the political damage sunday of his pardons for military officers 
accused of human rights violations and found both support and angry 
criticism 
president menem had the courage to untie one of the most 
dramatic gordian knots of argentine life clarin the countrys 
largest newspaper commented in an editorial 
this is not to say the presidential measure will be a balm 
that miraculously cures all wounds it said but he worked 
inspired by the common good 
other expressions of support came from members of the 
conservative union of the democratic center argentinas third 
biggest political party a roman catholic bishop military figures 
and menems own peronist party 
but human rights groups and leftist politicians and newspapers 
denounced menem for pardoning 39 officers accused of kidnapping 
torture and murder in the dirty war against suspected 
subversives during the 197683 military dictatorships 
thousands of communist party pamphlets were distributed saying 
the killers and coup makers of today will be the repressors of 
tomorrow 
at least 8960 suspected leftists were arrested never seen 
again and presumed executed according to a commission appointed by 
former president raul alfonsin whose election in 1983 ended 
military rule human rights groups put the total number of victims 
who disappeared at 30000 or more 
congressman federico storani of alfonsins radical civic union 
second in size behind the peronists accused menem of appeasing the 
armed forces in case their intervention is necessary to quell 
protests against his economic policies 
menem a 59yearold former provincial governor was held under 
arrest for nearly five years following the march 1976 military coup 
that ousted president isabel peron he was elected president last 
may and took office on july 8 amid tripledigit inflation and 
rising unemployment 
opponents of the pardons said menems action was too much in 
favor of the military 
it is legitimite to desire that society be reconciled with 
itself but this is not the way eduardo luis duhalde director 
of the leftist newspaper nuevo sur wrote in a column 
carlos saul menem has committed a grave error that in the 
end may devour him duhalde wrote reconciliation can never be 
based on forgetfulness putting on the same level victims and 
aggressors killers and killed martyrs and hangmen 
also pardoned were 174 officers accused of participating in 
three rebellions against alfonsin and three officers including 
exarmy commander and president leopoldo galtieri who were jailed 
for mishandling the 1982 falklands war with britain

while house leaders dont like to publicly use 
the words pay raise they are quietly shaping a scenario under 
which congress can vote to increase its pay with bipartisan accord 
and the blessing of president bush 
still smarting from the political fiasco last february under 
which congress was forced by public outrage to reject a 51 percent 
raise house leaders have agreed on a set of conditions for the 
next attempt to raise lawmakers salaries 
foremost among them were that there will be a recorded vote and 
that the increase in pay will be coupled with a phasing out of 
speaking fees members of congress receive from interest groups 
the agreement as outlined by a democratic leadership source who 
insisted on anonymity also includes a demand for active white 
house support and a commitment from party organizations to refrain 
from using the pay vote as a political issue of course there is 
no way individual challengers to members of the house and senate 
can be forced to refrain from making a vote for a pay raise a 
political issue 
rankandfile lawmakers earn 89500 and leaders get more any 
pay plan would likely also include raises for federal judges and 
top federal executives who also came out losers when the last pay 
raise was rejected 
congressional leaders in both houses have publicly kept mum 
about their plans for the politically explosive issue 
we seldom whisper the words pay raise except in closets 
cloakrooms and bathrooms said a house republican leadership 
source speaking only on condition he not be named 
but behind the scenes there is movement 
a bipartisan house task force has presented republican and 
democratic leaders a proposal for raising congressional pay up to 
35 percent over two years an increase that would apply to the 
next congress 
the proposal never formally announced would be coupled with a 
phaseout of honoraria the speaking fees often paid by groups 
seeking to influence legislators there also would be changes in 
house ethics rules and laws including a tightening of financial 
disclosure travel and outside income from professions and boards 
separate republican and democratic task forces have considered 
the issue in the senate but have not made any proposals and appear 
willing to let the house move first 
republican leaders will accept those conditions but also would 
like to tie a payethics package to reform of campaign finance 
laws the gop source said congressional task forces are also 
trying to work out an agreement on that issue but have not yet 
done so 
last time the republicans backed out at the last moment 
the democratic source said this is going to be coming out of a 
bipartisan task force headed by reps vic fazio dcalif and 
lynn martin rill 
house members were angry early this year when the senate quickly 
took a position against a pay raise but privately expressed 
support for a raise without a vote both sides need good 
assurance they will deal with it in the same spirit the 
democratic source said 
in january and february he said the public felt something 
was cooked up that wasnt being put on the record this would be 
straightforward 
the democratic source predicted before the end of the session 
we will have some sort of ethics package on the floor but its not 
axiomatic that an ethics package would have to include pay and 
honoraria 
the gop source said chances for bipartisanship are much better 
now that thomas foley dwash has replaced jim wright dtexas 
as speaker republicans have given foley credit for hearing 
republican views while wright was considered more partisan 
bipartisanship in this current climate is realistic the gop 
source said bipartisanship in the previous climate was not 
realistic 
the house bore the brunt of the criticism last january when 
wright maneuvered for an immediate pay raise after members 
privately egged him on 
leaders initially wanted to let the 51 percent raise recommended 
by the presidential commission become law automatically but at the 
end of january wright abruptly switched tactics and decided to 
allow a vote both chambers overwhelmingly voted last feb 7 to 
reject the increase 
common cause president fred wertheimer whose congressional 
watchdog group pushed last january for a pay raise coupled with a 
phaseout of honoraria said his organization would be active again 
in favor of both 
the groups major interest has been elimination of honoraria 
which wertheimer called one of the most corrupting and corroding 
forces in congress today 
a senate source close to the democratic task force in that 
chamber said were not in this tricky procedural thing where you 
can play games it has to pass both houses and be sent to 
president before there were a lot of opportunities for mischief

the chiefs of five small police departments 
have protested what they consider undeserved credit given to los 
angeles police for the seizure of a record 19 tons of cocaine 
at stake the chiefs said in a letter to local newspapers and 
television stations is due recognition of their efforts and shares 
of the 124 million in cash confiscated with the cocaine on sept 
28 
los angeles police chief daryl f gates told the city council on 
wednesday that his department could expect up to 2 million of the 
124 million for its role in the seizure 
but police chiefs in arcadia bell huntington park maywood and 
south gate said los angeles played a minor role in the raid on a 
warehouse in sylmar providing backup security while their 
investigators and federal agents searched the warehouse 
officers from five smaller departments and two federal drug 
enforcement administration agents did surveillance work that led up 
to the raid the chiefs said 
we feel that those cities that were actually responsible 
should get the credit and along with that comes the money bell 
police chief manuel ortega said saturday lapd will get a share 
but certainly not the 2 million that chief gates spoke of 
the chiefs also complained about the amount of attention local 
media devoted to gates role in the affair 
cmdr william booth spokesman for los angeles police said the 
media repeatedly ignored gates frequent praise for the smaller 
departments 
federal drug officials have not announced a formula for dividing 
up the money seized in the sylmar drug bust but said the money was 
deposited in an unidentified downtown los angeles bank 
in most cases a hearing is held before the assets are 
distributed to law enforcement agencies a federal magistrate 
determines how much if any of the assets represent illgotten 
gains and should remain confiscated 
booth said the city would abide by whatever formula is used by 
the federal government

pope john paul ii left for indonesia 
monday after challenging south koreas president to move his 
country toward full democracy and praying for reunification of the 
two koreas 
the korean nation is symbolic of a world divided and not yet 
able to become one in peace and justice the pontiff said sunday 
speaking alternately in korean and english at an outdoor mass 
attended by 700000 people 
john paul told the vast throng of the faithful of his desire to 
visit china and he offered prayers for the people of asias 
communist nations including north korea just 30 miles from seoul 
at an earlier meeting with president roh taewoo at the blue 
house presidential mansion the pope challenged the south korean 
leader to make every effort to eradicate any traces of 
authoritarian rule a vatican spokesman said 
john paul who said there had been big steps toward democracy 
since he first visited south korea five years ago told roh that 
south koreans want full democratic rights and freedoms according 
to vatican spokesman joaquin navarro 
this present visit enables me to note the strong desire of all 
your people to proceed along the way to a prosperous and 
tranquil civil life and to generous and fruitful cooperation with 
the other nations of the world the pope told roh 
a statement by the presidential palace said the two leaders 
discussed the international situation and relations with communist 
north korea but it made no reference to domestic political issues 
south korea has made considerable progress toward democracy in 
the past two years and most koreans agree they now have a large 
degree of political freedom but the government still imposes 
restraints on leftwing and other radical groups and hundreds of 
antigovernment dissidents have been jailed for political activity 
in recent months 
the vast crowd at the outdoor mass waved white korean flags and 
wept as the pope arrived at the immense asphalt plaza in southern 
seoul to celebrate the end of the 44th international eucharistic 
congress many worshipers arrived before dawn 
john paul offered prayers for the people of communist north 
korea and china calling them our brothers and sisters 
china broke relations with the vatican in 1957 and recognizes 
only its own patriotic catholic church which names its own 
bishops the vatican estimates there are 2 million chinese loyal to 
the pope 
a choir of hundreds sang hymns in korean as the pope walked 
along a red carpet toward a fourstoryhigh stage and altar tiered 
with thousands of red white yellow and pink flowers and flanked 
by white yellow and blue banners 
plainclothes south korean security agents carrying attache cases 
containing machine guns ringed the stage and 11000 police were 
deployed on the outskirts of the plaza those who attended the mass 
had to go through metal detectors 
about 2000 priests aided by 2000 women in traditional korean 
gowns served communion while 1200 white doves were released as a 
sign of peace prayers were offered in chinese japanese spanish 
german french korean english and other languages 
cardinal stephen kim of seoul said in his welcome that the 
church issued an invitation to north korea to send delegates but 
they did not come 
this indicates that the division of the mind is more painful 
than the division of land he said 
the korean peninsula divided in 1945 is the site of one of the 
worlds most bitter ideological confrontations the capitalist 
south and the communist north which fought to a stalemate in the 
korean war are still technically at war and maintain huge armies 
along their 150mile border 
john paul offered a prayer for reunification of the divided 
peninsula a theme he stressed at two services saturday 
the pope arrived in seoul saturday after his visit to indonesia 
and east timor he will travel to the indian ocean island nation of 
mauritius he is to return to rome on oct 16

the oakland athletics won their second straight 
american league pennant on sunday beating the toronto blue jays 
43 to win the divisional playoffs in five games 
the athletics with the best record in baseball the last two 
seasons will open the world series at home next saturday against 
the winner of the national league playoff either the san francisco 
giants or the chicago cubs 
before sunday nights game san francisco had a 21 lead over 
chicago in the bestofseven playoff 
dave stewart outpitched dave stieb for the second time in the 
american league series as oakland became the first team to win 
consecutive league titles since the new york yankees and the los 
angeles dodgers each did it in 197778 
oaklands rickey henderson stole the series and was named most 
valuable player henderson got on base 14 times in 23 plate 
appearances andof the creditworthiness of the soviet union by 
standard amp poors corp or another creditrating firm would be an 
important boost for the soviet union should it try to tap the us 
bond market as part of its modernization drive 
the soviet union returned to foreign bond markets for the first 
time in 70 years when it sold a debt issue in switzerland in 
january 1988 since then it has sold five more bond issues in 
western europe mostly to banks for a total of about 850 million 
worth of borrowing according to sampp 
but it has yet to attempt a bond issue in the united states one 
reason is that it must first settle about 193 million worth of 
bonds sold by czarist russia to the us government to help finance 
russian participation in world war i after the 1917 revolution 
the new soviet government repudiated the bonds and has yet to make 
good on them 
under us law the soviets are barred from selling bonds here 
until they settle this old debt 
a 1986 settlement with great britain over a similar czarist bond 
offering bodes well for negotiations now under way with the state 
department on the us bonds sampp said 
the credit rating agency said many problems stand in the way of 
assessing the investment risk of soviet bonds 
among them are the unreliable and incomplete nature of soviet 
government statistics lack of comparability between some soviet 
and western economic data and the lack of firm figures on total 
soviet borrowings in the west 
right now analyzing the soviet economy is a game of 
estimations said philip bates an sampp analyst its a new 
frontier to some degree 
bates declined to comment on whether soviet officials have 
agreed to cooperate with a credit analysis should sampp decide to do 
one but he said its a little difficult to obtain that 
information without being able to talk to the government about it 
a credit rating is important because it helps investors 
determine the chances that their money will be repaid when a bond 
come due it also gives them an idea of the rate of interest they 
should require to tie up their money 
ironically the attempts of soviet president mikhail gorbachev 
to restructure his nations economy called perestroika could harm 
the countrys oncesterling credit standing among western bankers 
who have loaned it money since the early 1970s with perestroika 
has come instability and an economic downturn 
the system that was in place gave bankers a lot of confidence 
in the soviet governments ability to repay their obligations 
bates said 
however he said it appears that much of the soviet 
governments ability to adjust the nations balanceofpayments 
figures in order to repay foreign debt remain in place 
a book published earlier this year is skeptical of the soviet 
unions recent western borrowing the coming soviet crash 
gorbachevs desperate pursuit of credit in western financial 
markets contends that soviet economic statistics are extremely 
unreliable and that assumptions about the nations ability to repay 
its debt may be erroneous 
the author hoover institution researcher judy shelton also 
criticizes the popular belief that the west is accelerating 
gorbachevs reforms by loaning money she contends that instead of 
reducing military spending or making other tough economic choices 
the soviets are looking abroad for the cash to pay for perestoika 
while preserving their military might 
sampps chief competitor moodys investors service inc has not 
rated the soviet union either but it recently released a credit 
study of hungary another east bloc nation undergoing economic 
liberalization hungary also has been selling bonds in the west 
moodys analyst michael van bemmelen said obtaining the required 
information about hungary took longer than the time spent for 
similar evaluations of western nations but he said his company is 
confident about the results 
though there were problems in obtaining government data about 
the domestic hungarian economy he said most of the determinants 
of the creditworthiness are really in its relationship to western 
countries 
that type of information is available from several sources he 
said including international banks and exporters and importers 
but van bemmelen said he could foresee additional problems in 
rating the soviet union such as valuing its huge gold holdings 
the soviet government does not disclose that amount

comedian jackie mason says the staff of 
republican mayoral candidate rudolph giuliani is so incompetent 
that its hard to know if theyre running a campaign or theyre 
running for their life 
mason resigned under pressure from the giuliani campaign sept 
27 after remarks that the rabbiturnedcomedian made about blacks 
and jews were published in the village voice 
i never saw a more incompetent group of people in my life 
mason says of the giuliani campaign staff in the oct 16 issue of 
new york magazine 
they look like they dont know if theyre running a campaign 
or theyre running for their life or they should be running for a 
bar on second avenue 
the voice quoted mason as saying democratic mayoral candidate 
david dinkins looked like a black model without a job and that 
jews vote for blacks because they are sick with complexes 
in the new york magazine interview mason complained about what 
he called a double standard that finds giuliani guilty of racism 
when the candidate links dinkins with jesse jackson 
yet when dinkins connects giuliani to ronald reagan hes 
considered a political fighter he said 
but mason said that twenty years ago the white people were 
racists and the blacks were the victims today its exactly the 
opposite 
mason star of the abc series chicken soup also lashed out 
at mayor edward i koch and jewish leaders 
kochs criticism of masons remarks are like a nazi calling a 
jew a bigot he said 
jews are professional victims who practically beg their 
persecutors to keep persecuting them he said jewish leaders 
do this out of their own sick fears their own persecution 
complexes

a vandal threw paint on windows and walls 
of the jewish state theater over the weekend in an attack linked to 
the dispute over a roman catholic convent at auschwitz police 
reported 
the vandal painted the message this is for the convent 
worshippers saw the damage as they arrived sunday night to mark 
the beginning of yom kippur the most solemn jewish holiday at 
warsaws only synagogue that is next to the theater 
police said the blue paint had been splattered on the building 
saturday 
the theater created by the state shortly after world war ii 
presents plays in yiddish preserving a cultural remnant of what 
was once one of europes most vibrant jewish communities 
a lot of nasty and unexpected things have happened recently 
said rabbi menachem joskowitz a survivor of the nazi death camp at 
auschwitz who emigrated this year from israel to serve as polands 
only rabbi synagogue windows have been broken in lublin and 
czestochowa he said 
the rabbi said the violence was a result of controversy over the 
convent of carmelite nuns on the perimeter of the nazi 
concentration camp in southern poland jewish leaders have demanded 
that the convent be removed saying christian symbols are intrusive 
at a place where 25 million jews were murdered 
catholic cardinal franciszek macharski of krakow agreed in 1987 
to relocate the convent but a 1989 deadline was not met and the 
polish church said the agreement was not valid after the vatican 
intervened in the dispute in august polish bishops agreed again to 
move the nuns to an international prayer center 
on saturday the polish episcopate issued a statement saying it 
hoped the prayer center will contribute to development of 
christianjewish dialogue in the spirit of mutual respect and 
understanding of the importance of the auschwitz nazi death camp 
for poles jews and other nations 
the jewish demands angered some poles who said the nuns harmed 
no one and should be allowed to pray for the tens of thousands of 
nonjewish victims killed at auschwitz

incendiary bomb broke out on a bus in bogota sunday authorities 
reported they said seven people were killed and at least seven 
were injured 
no individual or group claimed responsibility 
police said they had no way of knowing if the incident was 
related to a wave of bombings by drug traffickers 
the bus driver luis fernando pataquiva told the radio chain 
rcn that a man and a woman apparently left a bomb in the back of 
the bus and it exploded moments after they got off 
police said seven people were killed and seven injured but 
local news reports said seven were killed and eight injured 
apparently the fire was caused by an incendiary bomb a 
national police spokeswoman said on condition of anonymity she did 
not elaborate

by a short circuit in the vehicles electrical system 
radio station caracol reported that a policeman at the scene 
said the fire apparently started in a fivegallon plastic container 
of gasoline in the back of the bus

communists at a historic congress have 
proclaimed their partys death and the birth of a socialist party 
aspiring to western democratic ideals but the difference between 
the old and the new remains unclear 
a document approved overwhelmingly by the congress saturday 
terminated the communist party called the hungarian socialist 
workers party and proclaimed the hungarian socialist party its 
successor 
it was the first time a warsaw pact communist party formally 
terminated its existence the move was part of preparations for the 
first free national elections in 41 years 
on sunday the party daily nepszabadsag appeared without its 
customary titlepage citation from the communist manifesto 
workers of the world unite 
instead of the usual masthead proclaiming nepszabadsag the 
central paper of the hungarian socialist workers party sundays 
edition simply identifed it as a socialist paper 
although the congress document sought to define ideological and 
practical differences between the old and the new party senior 
officials differed over what that really meant 
party chairman rezsoe nyers true to his role as a moderate 
said the document served the rebirth of our party as a new 
leftwing socialist party 
but deputy premier peter medgyessy was less optimistic that the 
congress had managed to bury the repressive leninist past and 
create a party in the western democratic tradition 
asked if the hungarian socialist party was truly new he told 
reporters sunday i dont see the signs of that although i 
honestly would have welcomed it 
since the congress opened friday radical reformers have 
insisted that orthodox communists would have no place in the new 
party 
but members of the old party are also members of the new party 
at least temporarily i am not convinced that the socalled 
cleansing of ranks that is necessary actually has happened 
medgyessy said 
premier miklos nemeth a key reformer told the congress that 
any new party would have no room for those with blood on their 
hands from past communist exceses 
membership is not automatically transferable the position paper 
said those wanting to join the new party would first have to state 
their intentions in writing 
but drastic language that would have barred communist 
conservatives was watered down out of fears the majority would 
reject the document the paper stated instead that the new party 
wants to call in its ranks all those who agree with its platform 
agree with its ground rules 
such ambiguity has resulted in the unsual development of former 
politburo member janos berecz among the most vehement opponents 
of reform asking to join the new party saturday just hours after 
he declared himself ready to be tied to the stake for his 
communist beliefs 
nyers whose moderate views make him the most acceptable 
candidate for the post of party president told berecz he was 
welcome it was a graphic demonstration of the new partys 
difficulties in breaking with the past 
berecz later confounded conference participants by declaring he 
wanted the issue of a new party put to the vote among all members 
of the old party he said in the meanwhile he would remain a 
member of the old party 
in another indication that some orthodox marxists feel the new 
party is not substantially different from the old berecz supporter 
robert hoch told the congress the berecz faction was dissolving 
because we have accomplished our goal of saving the ideals of 
the old party 
but there are striking differences on paper at least between 
the old and the new 
the document condemned the old partys stalinist excesses 
stating that its successor separates itself from the crimes 
and the principles and methods that were proven wrong during 
the 41year tenure of the communists that included the failed 1956 
uprising the soviet blocs bloodiest revolt 
the hungarian socialist party wants to contribute to the 
development of a multiparty system parliamentary democracy 
the document proclaimed 
while expressing support of some state ownership the document 
also called for private enterprise with minimal controls 
despite formal loyalties to marxismleninism and the 
proletariat the old party had gradually moved toward greater 
liberalism under former leader janos kadar 
amid growing dissatisfaction with the pace and extent of reform 
kadar lost his post in may 1988 opening the way to sweeping 
changes 
the preponderantly reformminded leadership allowed political 
opposition to flourish for the first time since the communists 
consolidated power in 1948 it went even further in february 
agreeing to hold the first free elections in 41 years and promising 
to abide by the results 
the elections are scheduled for next june at the latest the new 
party is expected to reveal its true nature well before then as it 
elects local officials in the next few months 
editors note george jahn is based in vienna and has covered 
east european affairs for the associated press since 1981

another outbreak of violence struck this 
country at war with drug lords sunday as fire blamed on a bomb 
killed seven people on a bus and the body of an army secretary was 
found riddled with bullets 
there were no immediate claims of responsibility but the 
attacks came in the midst of a 7weekold war that drug traffickers 
and government officials have been waging 
also sunday there were accusations and denials over allegations 
that president virgilio barcos government explored possibilities 
of a truce with the medellin drug cartel 
the driver of the bus in bogota luis fernando pataquiva told 
the rcn radio network that a man and a woman apparently left a bomb 
in the rear that exploded moments after they got off 
police said seven people were killed and seven injured but 
local news reports said seven were killed and eight injured 
apparently the fire was caused by an incendiary bomb a 
national police spokeswoman said on condition of anonymity she did 
not elaborate 
radio station caracol reported that a policeman at the scene 
said the fire apparently started in a fivegallon plastic container 
of gasoline in the back of the bus 
police said they found the body of mrs nury veelasquez de 
vasquez private secretary of the commander of the fourth army 
brigade shot 18 times 
unidentified men dragged her from a taxi in medellin on friday 
and took her with them in their car police said 
police said they found her body next to a car near the town of 
marinilla about 8 miles northwest of medellin 
authorities said they had no motive in the crime but the fourth 
army brigade has been active in confiscating property of suspected 
drug traffickers 
before sundays reports of violence 148 bombings and other 
attacks blamed on drug traffickers killed at least 10 people and 
wounded 164 since aug 19 when the traffickers declared war on the 
government 
the government declared an antidrug crackdown aug 18 the same 
day leading presidential hopeful sen luis carlos galan was 
assassinated 
joaquin vallejo a former interior minister said in reports 
published sunday that he acted as a gobetween in truce 
negotiations between the medellin cocaine cartel and the government 
before the antidrug crackdown began 
the new interior minister carlos lemos simmonds denied that 
the government had talks with drug traffickers 
the government received a proposal and immediately answered 
no he told reporters outside the presidential palace moments 
after being sworn in replacing orlando velasquez 
also sworn in sunday was roberto salazar manrique as minister of 
justice and enrique danies as communications minister 
the report of the negotiations was published saturday in the 
bogota daily la prensa an oppositionowned newspaper vallejo 
backed the la prensa account in interviews published by two other 
bogota newspapers el tiempo and el espectador 
valleho served briefly as interior minister in the 1970s when 
the conservative party was in power it is now in opposition to 
barcos governing liberal party 
according to the la prensa report the medellin cartel was ready 
to abandon its cocaineprocessing business turn over its arms 
laboratories and airstrips and help the government fight other drug 
traffickers in return the traffickers asked for amnesty and 
guarantees not to be extradited to the united states 
vallejo said in the interviews that indirect negotiations that 
began in september 1988 between the medellin cartel and the 
government ended after galan was killed police said galan a 
liberal party member slain while addressing a campaign rally was 
killed by drug dealers 
la prensas initial story saturday on the purported negotiations 
between drug traffickers and barcos government was seen as a 
challenge to the credibility of the presidents declared battle 
against the cocaine barons 
la prensa claimed barco had approved the contacts with the 
traffickers 
this is going to generate a huge national debate fabio 
valencia an opposition conservative party senator was quoted by 
el espectador as saying it seems to me that the government 
continues to handle matters with a double morality 
barco has said repeatedly he will not negotiate with the drug 
barons 
he has issued decrees allowing the extradition of drug 
traffickers to the united states and the seizures of their 
property colombian authorities have already extradited one alleged 
medellin cartel kingpin and have siezed hundreds of properties 
allegedly belonging to the cartel 
two of la prensas main owners are misael pastrana and belesario 
bentancur both former presidents and members of the conservative 
party

president gen ibrahim babangidas 
military government caught the nation and aspiring politicians by 
surprise sunday with its decision to dissolve prospective parties 
and create two from scratch 
babangida in a nationwide radio address saturday night said 
none of the 13 parties that applied to be one of two legal parties 
had passed the test as imposed by our vision of a new political 
order 
the candidate parties had ties to earlier parties that showed 
signs of being ethnic groupings the military would not tolerate 
babangida said 
babangida said limiting the country to two parties funded only 
by the government was the only way to avoid the parties becoming 
hostage to regional ethnic or religious groups in this west 
african country of 100 million 
david iornem spokesman for the peoples solidarity party said 
babangidas move was an attack on the political class 
dr said ngamdu of the nigerian national congress party said 
my heart bleeds when i think of the colossal amount of money 
time physical and mental energy expended by the national electoral 
commission and the political associations parties 
nigeria an oilproducing nation that has seen its economy near 
collapse from mismanagement corruption and falling oil prices has 
been ruled by military men for 20 of its 29 years since

while house leaders dont like to publicly use 
the words pay raise they are quietly shaping a scenario under 
which congress can vote to increase its pay with bipartisan accord 
and the blessing of president bush 
still smarting from the political fiasco last february under 
which congress was forced by public outrage to reject a 51 percent 
raise house leaders have agreed on a set of conditions for the 
next attempt to raise lawmakers salaries 
foremost among them were that there will be a record vote and 
that the increase in pay will be coupled with a phasing out of 
speaking fees members of congress receive from interest groups 
the agreement as outlined by a democratic leadership source who 
insisted on anonymity also includes a demand for active white 
house support and a commitment from party organizations to refrain 
from using the pay vote as a political issue of course there is 
no way individual challengers to members of the house and senate 
can be forced to refrain from making a vote for a pay raise a 
political issue

it is perhaps no small irony that a 
highly sought japanese auto plant was built on a road known as the 
bataan memorial highway memorializing a bitter us defeat to the 
japanese on a philippine peninsula and the resulting death 
march in which thousands died 
or is it 
the bataan highway signs are down because of road improvements 
but there are no plans to change the name of ind 38 the address 
of subaruisuzu automotive inc which is bringing as many as 3200 
jobs to the lafayette area mayor james riehle said 
its a reminder at least in my style of thinking of the 
horrors of war riehle said 
dont forget it was the united states that helped rebuild 
japanese industry after the destruction wrought by world war ii he 
said 
you can say their success has been our success too 
the success or failure of the joint venture wont be known for 
years but already lafayette has succeeded in recruiting what will 
be its largest employer after purdue university in spurring other 
development and in laying the groundwork for future expansion of 
the city 
projects that had been planned for some time in the future are 
being looked at and perhaps expedited said riehle who has been 
mayor 17 years 
those projects include a 33 percent upgrade in the capacity of 
the wastewater treatment plant and extension of a 24inch water 
main southeast of the city into an area that basically doubles the 
infrastructure for business 
it gave the county a whole new system of expansion said 
susan quick a local property broker retailers are starting to 
look at this area much more closely 
ms quick is codeveloper of park east a 247acre retail 
office and warehousing development planned along ind 26 east of 
lafayette and a couple of miles north of the japanese auto plant 
the project predates the plant but ms quick cannot ignore her new 
neighbor 
the car plant was just great for us 
ms quick said she and others in the community believed at first 
there was no need for a huge auto plant that might upset the 
balance of an already thriving community with an unemployment rate 
of 3 percent 
mark s davis president of the greater lafayette progress inc 
and the leader of local development efforts said the joint venture 
offered the local economy diversification and highpaying jobs with 
good benefits 
these are the best manufacturing jobs we could go after 
davis said it gets into fairness or equity not everybody wants 
to be a software engineer 
the lafayette area has lost many other jobs recently including 
about 600 at general foods and 250 each at pillsbury and north 
american phillips operations davis said 
economic development is not a game it is a deadly serious 
business with human family impacts the deaths are not the issue 
births are the issue if youre creating jobs your community will 
continue to prosper davis said 
nonetheless the plant also has stirred some fear and prejudice 
the rev carl malmgren pastor of the first baptist church said 
the arrival of the plant fueled unfounded rumors that japanese were 
buying a local country club to indulge their passion for golf 
they were uglier aspects too some people who got jobs at the 
new plant were isolated by former coworkers malmgren said 
i think the big thing is fear that gets played on fear of

arab petroleumproducing 
countries were urged by experts sunday to increase exploration in 
order to boost reserves and prevent shortages in the next century 
current arab oil reserves plus recoverable reserves and 
anticipated discoveries can satisfy oil demand until 2020 said 
abdulaziz alwattari assistant secretarygeneral of the 
organization of arab petroleum exporting countries 
but a gap between supply and demand will then occur unless new 
reserves are discovered to help meet the accelerating demand for 
energy from hydrocarbons wattari said in an inaugural speech of 
a fourday seminar in abu dhabi 
the fourday seminar on deep formations in the arab countries 
hydrocarbon potential and exploration techniques is the first of 
its kind in the gulf and was organized by oapec and the abu dhabi 
national oil co 
wattari told over 70 participants that world energy consumption 
has been increasing in recent years and was expected to continue 
rising in the coming years 
increases in oil production and reserves should match that 
and some oil experts forecast that oil production will peak at 75 
million barrels per day in the year 2010 he said 
daily world oil output currently is 62 million barrels of which 
the arab world accounts for roughly 18 million barrels 
he urged arab states to make use of new advanced exploration 
techniques developed in western countries 
adnoc general manager sohail almazroui backing wattaris call 
said expanded oil exploration was essential in order to guarantee 
the continuation of petroleum supplies at their current level 
experts believe there will be an increased global dependence on 
arab oil as reserves of other oilproducing nations will vanish in 
the future

top kuwaiti officials on sunday urged major 
industrialized nations to play a key role in resolving the debt 
problem of the third world 
abdulrahman alatiqi adviser to the emir of kuwait and a 
former oil and finance minister accused the industrialized nations 
of fraudulence and warned that the political aspect of debt 
was being overlooked 
atiqi addressed a symposium attended by about 400 prominent 
economists and bankers from the united states britain and the gulf 
cooperation council which consists of kuwait saudi arabia qatar 
bahrain oman and the united arab emirates 
market solutions to the international debt crisis is one of the 
topics being discussed at the symposium which focuses on the 
impact of globalization of markets on the gcc countries 
what the creditor rich countries are proposing for resolving 
the debt crisis is nothing more than fraudulence aimed at shackling 
the states of the third world and absorbing their resources 
atiqi said 
the rich countries did not grant loans to poor developing 
countries out of compassionate motives but rather for winning them 
as subservient states that rotate in their orbits to become 
markets for their goods and test fields for their weapons of 
destruction he added 
the emir of kuwait sheik jaber alahmed alsabah has launched 
an initiative for alleviating the indebtedness problem of the third 
world a plan atiqi called more favorable 
the emir proposed before the un general assembly last year the 
writing off interest paid by poorest countries on their debts as 
well as part of the principal he also called for an international 
conference on resolving the international debt crisis

a pharmaceutical maker on sunday voluntarily 
began the recall of a generic antibiotic used to treat urinary 
tract infections a day after the federal food and drug 
administration requested the action 
the fda contends that bolar pharmaceutical co inc based in 
copiague cheated on product safety tests when it submitted the 
drug nitrofurantoin for fda approval 
robert shulman president of the company said in a statement 
that the recall of the 100 mg capsules was in response to questions 
raised by the fda 
bolar is concerned first with the ongoing wellbeing of the 
people who use our drugs shulman said the charges that have 
been made against this product and our company warrant this 
cautious move on our part while we investigate to determine where 
the truth lies 
an fda investigation found indications that bolar substituted 
the brand name drug macrodantin for its generic version in tests 
three years ago to win approval of the generic product fda 
spokesman jeff nesbit said 
we believe that this occurrence is not of bolars doing 
shulman said adding that the product tested by the fda was not the 
same product it provided for laboratory testing 
because of the evidence of a substitution the fda contends it 
is not possible to determine whether the bolar product is 
equivalent to the brandname product which is made by 
norwicheaton pharmaceuticals 
bolar which is the largest of the generic drug makers under fda 
scrutiny won approval for its generic version of nitrofurantoin in 
june 1988 
bolars product is the only generic drug approved as 
therapeutically equivalent to macrodantin although other dosage 
forms of nitrofurantoin are available 
the fda also is investigating other generic drugs made by bolar 
as part of its probe of more than a dozen generic drug companies in 
the wake of allegations of fraud and corruption within the industry 
and fdas generic drug division
