we must defend the poor and deliver the needy today in reagans 
america there are more poor people than ever most poor people are 
not black or brown most poor people are young white and female 
but what does it matter 
red white black or brown a hungry babys belly turned inside 
out color it hunger color it pain 
most poor people are not on welfare they work hard every day 
that they can they sweep the streets they work they catch the 
early bus they work they pick up garbage they work they feed 
our children in school they work

uniforms no one refers to them by name hey you here go do 
they work every day that they can they work in hospitals they mop 
the floors they wipe the fevered bodies of the sick they empty 
their bed pans they clean out their commodes 
no job is beneath them and yet when they get sick they cannot 
lie in the bed they made up every day america is a better nation 
than that we are a better nation than that 
leadership must address the high moral challenges of our day in 
the nuclear age war is irrational strong leadership can never let 
the desire to look tough stand in the way of the pursuit of peace 
leadership we can take the lead to reverse the nuclear arms 
race 
at the very least we should pledge a pledge the soviet union 
has already made that we will not be the first to start a nuclear 
war first use leads to first retaliation and to mutual 
annihilation suicide is not a rational defense policy we must 
choose another way 
leadership we can build common security with the soviet union 
shared efforts to work for peace joint ventures to wipe out 
malnutrition in the world to explore the heavens to develop them 
for peaceful purposes star wars or a space development initiative 
redeem scientists held hostage by this mad arms race 
leadership we must change our policy towards the third world 
support international law respect selfdetermination defend human 
rights foster economic growth be consistent 
leaders must address the critical struggles in the world today 
we can have peace in central america stop the illegal war on 
nicaragua and join the regional peace process that offers dialogue 
and hope

the young man once known to the country as 
johnjohn son of the democrats martyred president brought 
convention delegates to their feet cheering tuesday night and told 
them because of you he is with us still 
and later the five children of jesse jackson introduced their 
father the candidate to a hall so crowded they locked the doors 
hundreds of delegates reporters and convention guests were 
stopped by a police line after the fire marshal ordered that the 
omni arena could hold no more 
jackson shared his big moment before the convention with the 
woman whose refusal to give up her seat on a bus in montgomery 
ala more than a quarter century ago began the turnaround in 
american race relations 
all of you think you are seated he said as he introduced 
rosa parks but youre really standing on someones shoulders 
the convention hall was a waving sea of red jesse signs as 
the runnerup in the nominee race appeared after his children 
introduced him onebyone not a single blue sign for michael 
dukakis the democratic nomineetobe could be seen 
the delegates to the democratic national convention had been a 
rather undemonstrative lot until they welcomed john f kennedy jr 
with a twominute standing ovation 
over a quarter century ago my father stood before you to 
accept the nomination for president said the 27yearold 
kennedy and then he introduced his uncle who he said inspired his 
generation 
as if to show that the kennedy name still carries magic the 
delegates stood and cheered again for sen edward f kennedy the 
dead presidents brother and johnjohns uncle teddy 
it was a fitting prelude for the big show yet to come jacksons 
closing speech of his long campaign for the presidency 
kennedy a spellbinding speaker didnt disappoint the 
convention until he arrived many seats were still empty like 
magic they filled 
where was george he asked repeatedly 
and the delegates responded with a cascading chant where was 
george where was george 
said kennedy we all know the answer to all these questions 
george bush is the man who is never there and he wont be there 
after the clock strikes noon on jan 20 1989 
in fact sen kennedy was the second speaker of the evening to 
bring up where was george earlier in the evening rep tony 
coelho of california recited a similar litany and got a similar 
response 
the two speakers may have been telegraphing a battle cry for the 
campaign to come 
the question caused banners to bob up and down in the hall the 
red jesse signs as well as the redwhite and blue posters 
saying dukakis for president 88

struggle against south african aggression 
we can act to end the austerity and desperation that burdens 
latin america and africa engage our allies relieve their debt 
offer a marshall plan for growth and development their debt is a 
factor in our deficit 
to do all of this we need bold leadership and a new direction 
our challenge is put forth in the words of a poem 
we have mastered the air conquered the sea annihilated 
distance and prolonged life but we are not wise enough to live on 
this earth without war and without hate 
 
i am tired of sailing my little boat 
far inside the harbor bar 
i want to go out where the big ships float 
out on the deep where the great ones are 
and should my frail craft prove too slight 
for waves that sweep those billows oer 
id rather go down in the stirring fight 
than drowse to death by the sheltered shore 
author unknown 
 
 
we can win but we must not gain the whole world and lose our 
own soul our soul is our youth we must not lose them to drugs 
violence premature pregnancy suicide cynicism pessimism and 
despair we must challenge our youth with high visions hope and 
dreams they must not be put in an environment or taught to 
submerge their dreams 
young people i challenge you this night exercise the right to 
dream face reality but dont stop with the way things are dream 
of things as they ought to be face pain but love hope faith and 
dreams will help you to rise above pain use hope and imagination 
as weapons of survival and progress use hope to motivate you and 
love to obligate you to serve the human race 
dream dream of peace choose the human race over the nuclear 
race we must bury the weapons and not burn the people

we the people of the democratic party of the united states of 
america in order to initiate the changes necessary to keep america 
strong and make america better in order to restore competence 
caring and incorruptibility to the federal executive branch and get 
it working again fairly for all americans and in order to secure 
for our children a future of liberty and opportunity hereby pledge 
our party our leaders our elected officials and our every 
individual effort to fulfilling the following fundamental 
principles for all members of the american family 
we believe that all americans have a fundamental right to 
economic justice in a stronger surer national economy an economy 
that must grow steadily without inflation that can generate a 
rising standard of living for all and fulfill the desire of all to 
work in dignity up to their full potential in good health with good 
jobs at good wages an economy that is prosperous in every region 
from coast to coast including our rural towns and our older 
industrial communities our mining towns our energy producing 
areas and the urban areas that have been neglected for the past 
seven years 
we believe that as a firstrate world power moving into the 
21st century we can have a firstrate full employment economy 
with an indexed minimum wage that can help lift and keep families 
out of poverty with training and employment programs including 
child care and health care that can help people move from welfare 
to work with portable pensions and an adequate social security 
system safeguarded against emasculation and privatization that 
can help assure a comfortable and fulfilling old age with 
opportunities for voluntary national public service above and 
beyond current services that can enrich our communities and with 
all workers assured the protection of an effective law that 
guarantees their rights to organize join the union of their 
choice and bargain collectively with their employer free from 
antiunion tactics 
we believe that the time has come for america to take charge 
once again of its economic future to reverse seven years of 
voodoo economics trickle down policies fiscal 
irresponsibility and economic violence against poor and working 
people that have converted this proud country into the worlds 
largest debtor nation mortgaged our childrens future by tripling 
our national debt placed home ownership out of reach for most 
young families permitted the rise of poverty and homelessness on 
the streets of america reduced the buying power of working men and 
women and witnessed the decline of our industrial natural 
resource and mining base the unending tragedy of family farm 
foreclosures an unhealthy dependence on foreign energy and foreign 
capital and the increasing foreign ownership of our land and 
natural resources 
we believe that it is time for america within a strong 
commitment to fiscal responsibility to reassert progressive values 
and reinvest in its people to invest in new priorities in 
lifelong education and training in targeted economic development 
in a healthy small business community and in retooled american 
industry that it is time for the broad revitalization of home town 
america involving financial institutions in the provision of 
crucial credit by encouraging special commitments in exchange for 
bailing out those that are failing reforming and expanding 
community reinvestment laws and reversing the trend of financial 
concentration and deregulation all combining to reverse the 
insecurity that has increasingly troubled our workers and their 
families in this rapidly changing society that has left some 
communities and regions behind 
there is no good reason why the nation we love the greatest and 
richest nation on earth should rank first among the industrialized 
nations in output per person but nearly last in infant mortality 
first in the percentage of total expenditures devoted to defense 
but nearly last in the percentage devoted to education and housing 
we believe that government should set the standard in 
recognizing that worker productivity is enhanced by the principle 
of pay equity for working women and no substandard wage competition 
for public contracts by family leave policies that no longer force 
employees to choose between their jobs and their children or ailing 
parents by safe and healthy work places now jeopardized by seven 
callous years of lowered and unenforced occupational safety 
standards for american workers and by major increases in 
assistance making child care more available and affordable to 
lowand middleincome families helping states build a strong child 
care infrastructure setting minimum standards for health safety 
and quality and thereby enabling parents to work and their 
children to get an early start on their education and personal 
fulfillment 
we believe that the strength of our families is enhanced by 
programs to prevent abuse and malnutrition among children crime 
dropouts and pregnancy among teenagers and violence in the family 
by aggressive child support enforcement and by emphasizing family 
preservation and quality foster care 
we believe that america needs more trade fair trade an 
administration willing to use all the tools available to better 
manage our trade in order to export more american goods and fewer 
american jobs an administration willing to recognize in the 
formulation and enforcement of our trade laws that workers rights 
are important human rights abroad as well as at home and that 
advance notice of plant closings and major layoffs is not only 
fundamentally right but also economically sound we believe that we 
can and must improve our competitiveness in the world economy 
using our best minds to create the most advanced technology in the 
world through a greater commitment to civilian research and 
development and to science engineering and mathematics training 
through more publicprivate and businesslabor cooperation and 
mutual respect through more intergovernmental partnerships and 
through a better balance between fiscal and monetary policy and 
between military and civilian research and development 
we further believe in halting such irresponsible corporate 
conduct as unproductive takeovers monopolistic mergers insider 
trading and golden parachutes for executives by reinvigorating our 
antitrust and securities laws reviewing large mergers and 
discouraging shortterm speculation taking place at the expense of 
longterm investment

we believe that the education of our citizens from head start 
to institutions of higher learning deserves our highest priority 
and that history will judge the next administration less by its 
success in building new weapons of war than by its success in 
improving young minds we believe that this nation needs to invest 
in its children on the front side of life by expanding the 
availability of preschool education for children at risk to invest 
in its teachers through training and enrichment programs including 
a national teacher corps to recruit teachers for tomorrow 
especially minorities with scholarships today to commit itself 
for the first time to the principle that no one should be denied 
the opportunity to attend college for financial reasons to ensure 
equal access to education by providing incentives and mechanisms 
for the equalization of financing among local school districts 
within each state to reverse cuts made in compensatory reading 
math and enrichment services to lowincome children and to expand 
support for bilingual education historically black and hispanic 
institutions the education of those with special needs the arts 
and humanities and an aggressive campaign to end illiteracy 
we believe that illegal drugs pose a direct threat to the 
security of our nation from coast to coast invading our 
neighborhoods classrooms homes and communities large and small 
that every arm and agency of government at every federal state and 
local level including every useful diplomatic military 
educational medical and law enforcement effort necessary should 
at long last be mobilized and coordinated with private efforts 
under the direction of a national drug czar to halt both the 
international supply and the domestic demand for illegal drugs now 
ravaging our country and that the legalization of illicit drugs 
would represent a tragic surrender in a war we intend to win we 
believe that this effort should include comprehensive programs to 
educate our children at the earliest ages on the dangers of alcohol 
and drug abuse readily available treatment and counseling for 
those who seek to address their dependency the strengthening of 
vital interdiction agencies such as the us coast guard and 
customs a summit of western hemispheric nations to coordinate 
efforts to cut off drugs at the source and foreign development 
assistance to reform drugbased economies by promoting crop 
substitution 
we believe that the federal government should provide increased 
assistance to local criminal justice agencies enforce a ban on 
cop killer bullets that have no purpose other than the killing 
and maiming of law enforcement officers reinforce our commitment 
to help crime victims and assume a leadership role in securing the 
safety of our neighborhoods and homes we further believe that the 
repeated toleration in washington of unethical and unlawful greed 
among too many of those who have been governing our nation 
procuring our weapons and polluting our environment has made far 
more difficult the daily work of the local policemen teachers and 
parents who must convey to our children respect for justice and 
authority 
we believe that we honor our multicultural heritage by assuring 
equal access to government services employment housing business 
enterprise and education to every citizen regardless of race sex 
national origin religion age handicapping condition or sexual 
orientation that these rights are without exception too precious 
to be jeopardized by federal judges and justice department 
officials chosen during the past years by a political party 
increasingly monolithic both racially and culturally more for 
their unenlightened ideological views than for their respect for 
the rule of law we further believe that we must work for the 
adoption of the equal rights amendment to the constitution that 
the fundamental right of reproductive choice should be guaranteed 
regardless of ability to pay that our machinery for civil rights 
enforcement and legal services to the poor should be rebuilt and 
vigorously utilized and that our immigration policy should be 
reformed to promote fairness nondiscrimination and family 
reunification and to reflect our constitutional freedoms of speech 
association and travel 
we further believe that the voting rights of all minorities 
should be protected the recent surge in hate violence and negative 
stereotyping combated the discriminatory englishonly pressure 
groups resisted our treaty commitments with native americans 
enforced by culturally sensitive officials and the lingering 
effects of past discrimination eliminated by affirmative action 
including goals timetables and procurement setasides 
we believe that the housing crisis of the 1980s must be halted 
a crisis that has left this country battered by a rising tide of 
homelessness unprecedented since the great depression by a 
tightening squeeze on low and moderateincome families that is 
projected to leave 7 million people without affordable housing by 
1993 and by a bleak outlook for young working families who cannot 
afford to buy their first home we believe that steps should be 
taken to ensure a decent place to live for every american 
we believe that homelessness a national shame should be 
ended in america that the supply of affordable housing should be 
expanded in order to avoid the projected shortfall that 
employerassisted housing and development by community based 
nonprofit organizations should be encouraged that the inventory of 
public and subsidized housing should be renovated preserved and 
increased that foreclosed government property should be restored 
to productive use and that firsttime home buyers should be 
assisted 
we believe that we can rebuild america creating good jobs at 
good wages through a national reinvestment strategy to construct 
new housing repair our sewers rebuild our roads and replace our 
bridges we believe that we must pursue needed investment through 
innovative partnerships and creative financing mechanisms such as a 
voluntary program to invest a portion of public and private pension 
funds as a steady source of investment capital by guaranteeing 
security and a fair rate of return and assuring sound project 
management

we believe that all americans should enjoy access to affordable 
comprehensive health services for both the physically and mentally 
ill from prenatal care for pregnant women at risk to more adequate 
care for our vietnam and other veterans from wellbaby care to 
childhood immunization to medicare that a national health program 
providing federal coordination and leadership is necessary to 
restrain health care costs while assuring quality care and advanced 
medical research that quality affordable longterm home and 
health care should be available to all senior and disabled 
citizens allowing them to live with dignity in the most 
appropriate setting that an important first step toward 
comprehensive health services is to ensure that every family should 
have the security of basic health insurance and that the hivaids 
epidemic is an unprecedented public health emergency requiring 
increased support for accelerated research on and expedited fda 
approval of treatments and vaccines comprehensive education and 
prevention compassionate patient care adoption of the public 
health community consensus on voluntary and confidential testing 
and counseling and protection of the civil rights of those 
suffering from aids or aidsrelated complex or testing positive for 
the hiv antibody 
we believe that the last seven years have witnessed an 
unprecedented assault on our national interest and national 
security through the poisoning of our air with acid rain the 
dumping of toxic wastes into our water and the destruction of our 
parks and shores that pollution must be stopped at the source by 
shifting to new environmentally sound manufacturing and farming 
technologies that the federal government must promote recycling as 
the best least costly way to solve the trash crisis aggressively 
enforce toxic waste laws and require polluters to be responsible 
for future cleanup costs that this nation must redouble its 
efforts to provide clean waterways sound water management and safe 
drinkable ground water throughout the country that our national 
parks forests wildlife refuges and coastal zones must be 
protected and used only in an environmentally sound manner that 
all offshore oil drilling in environmentally sensitive areas should 
be opposed and that regular world environment summits should be 
convened by the united states to address the depletion of the ozone 
layer the greenhouse effect the destruction of tropical 
forests and other global threats and to create a global action plan 
for environmental restoration 
we believe that all americans producers and consumers alike 
benefit when food and fiber are produced not by a few large 
corporations and conglomerates but by hundreds of thousands of 
family farmers obtaining a fair price for their product that the 
disastrous farm policies of the last seven years despite record 
federal spending have forced hundreds of thousands of families 
from their farms while others are struggling to survive and that a 
workable agricultural policy should include supply management 
reasonable price supports soil conservation and protection of 
rural water quality credit and foreclosure relief the return of 
federally held foreclosed lands to minority beginning and 
restarting farmers the development of new uses and markets for 
american farm products improved disaster relief and the 
revitalization of rural america through new sources of capital for 
rural business and new federal support for rural health care 
housing education water supply and infrastructure 
we further believe that no person should go to bed hungry and 
that we must renew the fight against hunger at home and abroad 
make food available to those nations who need it and want it and 
convene an international conference of food producing nations 
we believe that a balanced coherent energy policy based on 
dependable supplies at reasonable prices is necessary to protect 
our national security ensure a clean environment and promote 
stable economic growth and prosperity both nationally and in our 
energy producing regions that the inevitable transition from our 
present nearly total dependence on increasingly scarce and 
environmentally damaging nonrenewable sources to renewable sources 
should begin now that such a policy includes increased cooperation 
with our hemispheric neighbors filling that strategic petroleum 
reserve promoting the use of natural gas methanol and ethanol as 
alternative transportation fuels encouraging the use of our vast 
natural gas and coal reserves while aggressively developing clean 
coal technology to combat acid rain and providing targeted new 
incentives for new oil and gas drilling and development for the 
development of renewable and alternative sources of energy and for 
the promotion of energy conservation we believe that with these 
changes the country could reduce its reliance on nuclear power 
while insisting that all plants are safe environmentally sound and 
assured of safe waste disposal 
we believe that this countrys democratic processes must be 
revitalized by securing universal same day and mailin voter 
registration as well as registration on the premises of appropriate 
government agencies by preventing the misuse of atlarge 
elections the abuse of election day challenges and registration 
roll purges any undercounting in the national census and any 
dilution of the oneperson onevote principle by ending 
discrimination against public employees who are denied the right to 
full political participation by supporting statehood for the 
district of columbia by treating the offshore territories under 
our flag equitably and sensitively under federal policies 
assisting their economic and social development and respecting 
their right to decide their future in their relationship with the 
united states by empowering the commonwealth of puerto rico with 
greater autonomy within its relationship with the united states to 
achieve the economic social and political goals of its people and 
by giving it just and fair participation in federal programs by 
assuring and pledging the full and equal access of women and 
minorities to elective office and party endorsement and by 
minimizing the domination and distortion of our election by moneyed 
interests 
we believe in a stronger america ready to make the tough choices 
of leadership in an everdangerous world militarily stronger in 
our overall defense and antiterrorist capabilities and in the 
cohesion of our military alliances economically stronger at home 
and in the global marketplace intellectually stronger in the 
advances of our schools science and technology and spiritually 
stronger in the principles we exemplify to the world 
we believe in a clearheaded toughminded decisive american 
foreign policy that will reflect the changing nature of threats to 
our security and respond to them in a way that reflects our values 
and the support of our people a foreign policy that will respect 
our constitution our congress and our traditional democratic 
principles and will in turn be respected for its quiet strength 
its bipartisan goals and its steadfast attention to the concerns 
and contributions of our allies and international organizations 
we believe that we must reassume a role of responsible active 
international leadership based upon our commitment to democracy 
human rights and a more secure world that this nation as the 
world power with the broadest global interests and concerns has a 
greater stake than any in building a world at peace and governed by 
law that we can neither police the world nor retreat from it and 
that to have reliable allies we must be a reliable ally

we believe that our national strength has been sapped by a 
defense establishment wasting money on duplicative and dubious new 
weapons instead of investing more in readiness and mobility that 
our national strength will be enhanced by more stable defense 
budgets and by a commitment from our allies to assume a greater 
share of the costs and responsibilities required to maintain peace 
and liberty and that as military spending and priorities change 
government should encourage the conversion of affected military 
facilities and the retraining of workers to facilitate the creation 
of new forms of communication space development and new peacetime 
growth and productivity 
we believe in an america that will promote peace and prevent war 
not by trading weapons for hostages not by sending brave 
americans to undefined missions in lebanon and honduras not by 
relaxing our vigilance on the assumption that longrange soviet 
interests have permanently changed not by toasting a tyrantlike 
marcos as a disciple of democracy but by maintaining a stable 
nuclear deterrent sufficient to counter any soviet threat by 
standing up to any american adversaries whenever necessary and 
sitting down with them whenever possible by making clear our 
readiness to use force when force is required to protect our 
essential security commitments by testing the intentions of the 
new soviet leaders about arms control emigration human rights and 
other issues and by matching them not merely in rhetoric but in 
reciprocal initiatives and innovation which takes advantage of 
what may be the greatest opportunity of our lifetime to establish a 
new mutually beneficial relationship with the soviet union in 
which we engage in joint efforts to combat environmental threats 
explore peaceful uses of space and eradicate disease and poverty in 
the developing world and in a mutual effort to transform the arms 
race that neither side can win into a contest for peoples minds a 
contest we know our side will win 
we believe in following up the inf treaty a commendable first 
step with mutual verifiable and enforceable agreements that will 
make significant reductions in strategic weapons in a way that 
diminishes the risk of nuclear attack by either superpower reduce 
conventional forces to lower and equivalent levels in europe 
requiring deeper cuts on the warsaw pact side ban chemical and 
space weapons in their entirety promptly initiate a mutual 
moratorium on missile flight testing and halt all nuclear weapons 
testing while strengthening our efforts to prevent the spread of 
these weapons to other nations before the nightmare of nuclear 
terrorism engulfs us all 
we believe in an america that recognizes not only the realities 
of eastwest relations but the challenges and opportunities of the 
developing world that will support and strengthen international 
law and institutions promote human and political rights and 
measure them by one yardstick and work for economic growth and 
development we believe that we must provide leadership compassion 
and economic assistance to those nations stunted by overwhelming 
debt deprivation and austerity and that we must work to promote 
active agreements between developing and industrial countries and 
the major public and commercial lenders to provide debt relief and 
rekindle and sustain economic growth and democracy in latin 
america asia and the poorest continent africa which deserves 
special attention we further believe that we must enlist the trade 
surplus nations to join with us in supporting new aid initiatives 
to fuel growth in developing countries that though economically 
depressed are rich in human and natural potential 
we believe this country should work harder to stop the supplies 
of arms from both east and west that fuel conflict in regions 
such as the persian gulf and angola 
deeply disturbed that the current administration has too long 
abandoned the peace process in the middle east and consistently 
undermined it in central america we believe that this country 
maintaining the special relationship with israel founded upon 
mutually shared values and strategic interests should provide new 
leadership to deliver the promise of peace and security through 
negotiations that has been held out to israel and its neighbors by 
the camp david accords and to central america by the arias peace 
plan which calls for an end to the fighting national 
reconciliation guarantees of justice freedom human rights and 
democracy an end to support for irregular forces and a commitment 
by the central american governments to prevent the use of their 
territory to destabilize others in the region instead of the 
current emphasis on military solutions we will use negotiations and 
incentives to encourage free and fair elections and security for 
all nations in the region we will cease dealing with drug 
smugglers and seek to reconcile our differences with countries in 
central america enabling the united states and other countries to 
focus on the pressing social and economic needs of the people of 
that region we further believe in pursuing a policy of economic 
cooperation instead of confrontation with mexico and our other 
hemispheric friends in helping all developing countries build 
their own peaceful democratic institutions free from foreign 
troops subversion and domination and free from domestic dictators 
and aggressors in honoring our treaty obligations and in using 
all the tools at our disposal including diplomacy trade aid 
food ideas and ideals to defend and enlarge the horizons of 
freedom on this planet 
we believe in an america that will promote human rights human 
dignity and human opportunity in every country on earth that will 
encourage free speech and association and decry oppression in 
nations friendly and unfriendly communist and noncommunist that 
will encourage our european friends to respect human rights and 
resolve their longstanding differences over north ireland and 
cyprus that will encourage wherever possible the forces of 
pluralism and democracy in eastern europe and that will support the 
struggle for human rights in asia 
we believe the apartheid regime in south africa to be a uniquely 
repressive regime ruthlessly deciding every aspect of public and 
private life by skin color engaging in unrelenting violence 
against its citizens at home and promoting naked aggression against 
its neighbors in africa 
we believe that the time has come to end all vestiges of the 
failed policy of constructive engagement to declare south africa a 
terrorist state to impose comprehensive sanctions upon its 
economy to lead the international community in participation in 
these actions and to determine a date certain by which united 
states corporations must leave south africa we further believe 
that to achieve regional security in southern africa we must press 
forcefully for namibias independence by calling for the end of 
south africas illegal occupation a cease fire and elections must 
end our counterproductive policy in angola and must offer support 
and further assistance to mozambique and other frontline states 
in sum we believe it is time for america to change and move 
forward again in the interest of all its families to turn away 
from an era in which too many of americas children have been 
homeless or hungry and invest in a new era of hope and progress an 
era of secure families in a secure america in a secure world 
we believe the american dream of opportunity for every citizen 
can be a reality for all americans willing to meet their own 
responsibilities to help make it come true 
we believe that governments at the national state and local 
level in partnerships between those levels and in partnerships 
with the private sector exist to help us solve our problems 
instead of adding to them we believe in competent pragmatic 
governments accountable to the people led by men and women 
dedicated not to self interest but to service motivated not by

communist rebels rejected new peace 
talks with president corazon aquino as a farce monday charging 
her government and the military merely wanted to trap leaders of 
the 19yearold insurgency 
selfstyled communist rebels meanwhile killed a provincial 
official monday and a guerrilla spokesman warned of more killings 
as long as the government fails he said to prosecute human rights 
violators in the military 
the general command of the communist new peoples army in a 
statement sent by courier to news agencies claimed mrs aquinos 
government lost its credibility following the collapse of peace 
talks last year 
mrs aquino has said she would agree to new peace talks if the 
rebels made the first move 
defense secretary fidel ramos said the defense department and 
the 250000member armed forces would abide by her decision ramos 
earlier turned down the possibility of reviving the talks saying 
it would only give the rebels time to regroup 
the president has spoken ramos told reporters i dont 
think there is anyone that will oppose any objective such as 
obtaining peace but it must be peace with justice and honor 
the rebel statement was in response to a call last week by the 
influential catholic bishops conference of the philippines for the 
government and the guerrillas to call for a new ceasefire and 
revive peace talks 
history repeats itself twice the first as tragedy the second 
as farce the statement said 
we cannot respond positively to a call for a new 
ceasefire that will mean the annihilation of the revolutionary 
movement and its mass base we have learned our lessons well from 
the duplicity of the aquino government and its military 
establishment 
the rebels accused the government of insincerity and charged 
that what the government and the military establishment sought to 
lay down was a trap that played on the good faith of the leaders of 
the revolutionary movement 
about five members of the communist partys central committee 
and dozens of its regional leaders were captured by the military in 
raids after the 60day ceasefire lapsed in february 1987 
on sunday the rebels southern luzon command said it was 
agreeable to peace talks in principle but claimed the government 
was setting unacceptable conditions 
in a related development police said two men who claimed to be 
communist guerrillas barged into a government office on monday in 
lucena 60 miles southeast of manila and shot dead city councilor 
donaldo alfaro 54 
alfaro belonged to a government group organized to help the 
military curb rebel infiltration of local neighborhoods 
arnel sandoval spokesman of the alex boncayao brigade 
justified the guerrillas continuing attacks on police soldiers 
and government officials by claiming the government failed to 
prosecute notorious police and military human rights violators 
the brigade is a manilabased unit of the rebel army that has 
claimed responsibility for killing more than 100 police soldiers 
and officials during the past year 
in bulacan province police monday arrested two suspected rebels 
who killed a policeman a day earlier in baliwag just north of 
manila 
a gunman monday fatally shot vice mayor daud talib on the island 
of jolo about 600 miles south of manila police said 
the area is a stronghold of moslem separatist guerrillas

on the sabbath at salem baptist church the rev 
jesse jackson considered the week to come and led a crowd of 1300 
in a chant that had become his convention rallying cry never 
surrender he implored never surrender 
that was sunday 
on monday the convention dawned and jackson unveiled a new more 
conciliatory chorus he did not surrender but with the gavel about 
to fall he faced reality and to use michael dukakis language 
agreed to let the quarterback call the plays 
following the unity news conference between dukakis and jackson 
jackson led 2000 supporters and delegates in quite a different 
cadence discipline details hope 
the summit allowed both men to declare victory and for once 
dukakis got in the final word 
jackson looking ahead to wednesday nights presidential roll 
call could not yet endorse dukakis explaining gracefully almost 
sorrowfully im still looking for a chicago miracle dukakis 
gentle rejoinder i dont think were going to have a chicago 
miracle were going to have an athenian miracle 
actually it was something of a miracle to finally see these two 
fellows together after more than a month of jacksons patented 
creative tension 
as expected precious little was being said publicly about 
mondays meeting 
were dukakis and jackson chatting friendlylike about the 
american dream and the need for democratic unity as dukakis 
suggested or were they simply splitting up the spoils of 
democratic patronage either way dukakis said theres no deal 
no deal is a good deal for dukakis maybe its even true 
although that seems farfetched jackson provided only one hint of 
his meetingoftheminds with dukakis saying when the democratic 
national committee meets on friday it will be more reflective of 
the new democratic party 
jackson has said maybe a dozen times a day for the last few 
days that he wanted equity and shared responsibility with 
dukakis to put flesh on the bone his aides put a handful of 
demands on the table according to reliable party sources who 
declined to be identified by name 
the sources described several of the jackson requests as pretty 
routine stuff a greater role at the dnc an expensepaid presence 
during the fall campaign new language on some platform planks 
if the mans got to travel were not going to let him fly 
commercial said joseph warren a longtime dukakis supporter who 
has been involved in the negotiations make no mistake about it 
what jesse needs jesse will get 
but then there was the explosive issue of transition guarantees 
jackson negotiators want the dukakis team to hire jackson 
supporters for a hefty number of positions in the transition effort 
should dukakis be elected in november how many one source 
shrugged and said perhaps in joking half 
said jackson its not right to be in the seats on the floor 
tonight and not in the budget next january 
this might not sit well with many american voters who will want 
to think they are pulling the lever for dukakisbentsen in november 
is jesse jackson going to call the shots if he is there are 
a lot of americans who arent going to vote for this ticket said 
republican strategist ed rollins on monday 
michael dukakis knows george bush could make hay with an 
agreement to share the transition with jackson bush would never 
mention the dukakisbentsen ticket hed call it the 
dukakisjackson ticket at his first campaign stop in the morning 
and hed add a last stop in the evening to do it again hed say 
ill tell you whos going to set up a bush administration me 
sources said jackson did not present the transition issue in the 
facetoface meeting he knew surely that whether or not the 
jackson demands were routine or outrageous dukakis could not be 
seen as giving in to them he needs to exhibit leadership not 
timidity its a fact of life as the campaign moves from the 
democratic convention to the general election campaign 
oddly enough jackson probably was in no particular hurry to 
sign onto a public deal with dukakis anyway he has 1100 partisans 
at this convention many of them more ideologically motivated than 
he and bargaining for spoils is not exactly something jackson 
wants to explain 
a deal no way suggested jackson using the same words he did 
in 1984 as he headed for a platform fight he said on monday if 
you negotiate away your self respect you lose before you get to 
the floor we can afford to lose a vote we cannot afford to lose 
our selfrespect

the prospect of an end to the iraniraq war is 
raising the possibility that the united states will be able to 
reduce its military presence in the persian gulf administration 
officials say 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater alluded to that 
possibility monday after iran agreed to accept a united nations 
resolution calling for a ceasefire in its eightyear war with iraq 
we have always said that as hostilities end and as the war 
ends we were willing to consider a withdrawal fitzwater told 
reporters in santa barbara calif where president reagan is on a 
weeklong vacation 
undersecretary of state michael armacost spoke in a similar vein 
last week when he said the us presence will revert to more 
normal and traditional levels as tensions in the area abate 
it was just a year ago this week that the us navy began 
escorting kuwaiti tankers operating as american flag vessels in the 
gulf the key element of what has been a substantial us military 
buildup in the waterway 
according to official figures the number of us military 
personnel in the region has increased from 2000 to more than 
15000 while navy ships now total 27 compared with six less than 
three years ago 
the deployment has stirred intense controversy in congress and 
elsewhere particularly after the extensive loss of lives in two 
instances of mistaken identity when an iraqi jet fired on the uss 
stark in may 1987 37 us servicemen were killed and 290 
passengers died on july 3 when a us warship shot down an iranian 
civilian aircraft 
as a show of regret iraq offered to pay compensation following 
the stark incident and the united states did the same after the 
downing of the iranian plane 
the american commitment to the gulf has been costly in other 
ways the deployment has forced the united states to postpone ship 
overhauls and to reduce some forces normally assigned elsewhere 
including western europe 
both fitzwater and state department deputy spokeswoman phyllis 
oakley called the iranian acceptance of the un resolution a 
major breakthrough that opens the way for an end to what has 
been the longest running largescale war of the 20th century 
they also said the iranian decision could restore stability to 
the gulf region 
but fitzwater said us officials dont have a reading with 
any real definition on irans intentions and he cautioned that 
ending the war is not going to occur overnight 
an end to the conflict would remove one of three impediments to 
a more normal relationship between the united states and iran 
diplomatic ties were broken in april 1980 during the iran hostage 
crisis five months before the iraniraq war broke out 
the other conditions the state department has said are necessary 
for a friendlier relationship are the release of the americans 
being held hostage by proiranian militants in lebanon and an end 
to irans alleged promotion of international terrorism 
iranian officials have made several inquiries of the united 
states in recent months about improving diplomatic ties but the 
reagan administration has not followed up on them except to ask 
whether the overtures were made by officials in positions of 
authority secretary of state george p shultz has said no response 
has been received 
us officials speaking only on condition of anonymity said 
iran apparently decided to accept a ceasefire because of the 
countrys declining economy and fading popular support for 
continuation of the war 
beyond that iraqi troops have scored major gains in recent 
months leaving the forces of the two sides deployed roughly along 
the international border of the two countries the officials said 
this would enable the combatants to reach a final settlement 
without either being forced to surrender territory to the other

independent counsel james mckays conclusion 
that attorney general edwin meese iii probably violated tax and 
conflictofinterest laws wont hurt george bush politically a top 
aide to the vice president says 
i wouldnt go as far as to say its a dead issue but its not 
going to be a central concern in my judgment when voters go vote 
in november bushs campaign manager lee atwater said monday 
bush aides contend that for all practical purposes meese 
ceased to be a major political liablity for the vice president the 
certain republican presidential nominee when meese on july 6 
announced he would resign 
bush troubled by the accusations against meese previously had 
sought to make ethics in government a major campaign theme calling 
for a tougher conflictofinterest standard for all officials 
however the vice president had insisted he would not comment on 
the meese matter until the release of mckays report 
when that report was delivered on monday the vice president was 
not available for comment he was in a remote part of wyoming on a 
4day fishing trip with treasury secretary james a baker iii that 
began on saturday 
speaking on bushs behalf atwater said of the newly released 
report its not going to have anything to do with this 
election 
mckay concluded that meese probably willfully filed a false 
income tax return failed to pay taxes on time and broke a criminal 
conflictofinterest law the independent counsel said he would not 
seek criminal charges against the attorney general however 
meanwhile in atlanta one of meeses more outspoken democratic 
critics in congress said he didnt believe mckays report would 
have any effect on michael dukakis candidacy 
i dont think there is any partisan advantage or should there 
be a partisan advantage said sen carl levin dmich whose 
senate governmental oversight subcommittee investigated meeses 
involvement with the scandalplagued wedtech corp 
i dont think meese is a partisan issue republicans called 
for his resignation as well as democrats said levin who was 
attending the democratic national convention 
bush in the past has said that the attorney general should be 
held to a high ethical standard and that he found some of the 
allegations against meese particularly troubling 
a bush campaign aide who spoke on the condition of anonymity 
said meese by resigning took away the mckay report as a campaign 
issue the official said bush hadnt been bombarded by questions on 
meese since the attorney general announced he would step down 
before then bush had been asked at nearly every campaign stop 
whether meese should resign 
when meese announced he would step down as attorney general and 
said he was vindicated by mckays report bush said in a terse 
statement ed did the right thing and i wish him well 
atwater said bush would deliver a major speech on ethics in 
government within the next few weeks i dont want to upstage him 
on it the speech isnt complete 
campaign sources said bushs ethics proposals long in the 
works had been delayed to await the mckay report 
in the past bush has said the new code he will outline will 
help us avoid the excesses of the past 
people should come to washington to serve not to profit 
the vice president said in a recent campaign appearance when a 
congressman goes bad or a member of the executive branch betrays 
the public trust you know and i know that it hurts 
before meese announced his plans to resign two top bush 
campaign aides pollster robert teeter and former communications 
director peter teeley said publicly that the attorney general had 
become a major campaign liability for bush 
bush campaign aides said they had not heard from the presumptive 
republican presidential candidate since before he began the fishing 
trip 
he must be catching a lot of fish bush spokeswoman sheila 
tate said 
he planned reappear on wednesday the nexttolast day of the 
democratic convention with campaign appearances in the detroit 
area and also was to campaign daily at least through sunday

the environmental protection agency relied on 
solely political reasons to reject a staff recommendation that 
some oil and gas drilling wastes be more strictly regulated an 
agency employee says 
politics overrode science and weve never done that before 
said hugh kaufman assistant to the epas director of the hazardous 
site control division 
this is the first time in the history of environmental 
regulation of hazardous wastes that the epa has exempted a powerful 
industry from regulation for solely political reasons despite a 
scientific determination of the hazardousness of the wastes he 
said in an interview 
kaufman and another staff member who spoke on condition of 
anonymity said sens lloyd bentsen dtexas phil gramm rtexas 
and don nickles rokla pressured the agency as did the interior 
and energy departments and some states 
epa administrators deny their call was swayed by political 
pressure 
the majority of an epa working group that studied the issue had 
recommended that a small volume of drilling wastes come under 
stringent regulation as hazardous 
but epa administrator lee thomas and j winston porter epas 
assistant administrator for solid waste and emergency response 
said in a june 30 report to congress they had decided that all oil 
and gas drilling wastes would remain exempt from hazardous waste 
rules 
porter said it was certainly a close call not an easy 
decision but that his conscience is clear 
socalled associated wastes account for 1 percent of the 
total volume of drilling wastes but contain highly toxic materials 
such as benzene heavy metals and corrosive acids that are 
regulated as hazardous in other industries the epa staff said it 
concluded the wastes pose a threat to the environment if not 
handled properly and that states are largely doing a poor job of 
enforcing existing regulations 
a draft staff report said the cost to the industry to regulate 
those materials as hazardous wastes would have ranged from 200 
million to 500 million a year 
however relative to total production and the total volume of 
product the overall impacts on the industry should not be unduly 
burdensome the report said 
it would have been a fly in the economic health of that 
industry said kaufman a frequent public critic of toplevel 
agency decisions kaufman and officials responding to his 
accusations spoke in interviews last week 
porter agreed with the staff position that many states do not 
adequately regulate drilling wastes but said another layer of 
regulation was not the answer hazardous waste laws can be 
inflexible and are not necessarily appropriate for the nations 
hundreds of thousands of oil and gas wells he said 
porter wrote thomas that although the working group had wanted 
to regulate the lowvolume wastes as hazardous we now feel that 
removing any portion of the exemption would be too disruptive and 
burdensome to both the regulated industry and the regulating 
agencies 
gramm spokesman larry neal said the costs would have posed a 
huge economic burden on an industry staggered by three years of low 
prices of the senators push against the regulations neal said 
if wed do it again tomorrow wed do it just as strong 
bentsen tapped by democratic presidential candidate michael 
dukakis to be his running mate said the epas decision was by 
and large sound though there are some areas that may require 
further clarification and explanation 
nickles said additional regulations would have hurt people 
already on their backs economically and that states are doing a 
decent job

nurseries for at least twothirds of the nations commercial 
fisheries and are home to valuable and diverse species of fish 
shellfish and wildlife the epa said 
they also are sources of irreplaceble recreation and aesthetic

two government reports question the 
effectiveness of us assistance to egypt and cast doubt on whether 
the aid has brought about policy changes sought by the reagan 
administration 
a general accounting office study of us aid to seven 
countries of which egypt is the most populous concluded that the 
agency for international development has had mixed success in 
encouraging foreign policy reforms 
another report from aid inspector general hebert l beckington 
criticized the use of 15 billion worth of machinery and equipment 
sent to egypt between 1975 and 1986 
egypt got 8197 million in economic support funds from the 
united states in fiscal 1987 second only to israel 
aid spokesman timothy oleary said monday that 115 million of 
the aid was transferred in cash to the government of president 
hosni mubarak most of the rest was spent on projects designed to 
raise the countrys standard of living 
the gao report said the cash transfer to egypt was based on a 
document that described broad policy changes that the us 
government expected from egypt but gave no details on how progress 
would be measured 
the report dated june 29 and made public this month added that 
while the document listed egyptian policy reforms since the 
previous transfer it did not explain their meaning or how they 
related to what the united states sought 
egypt has not moved quickly enough to adopt the economic 
reforms necessary to address the numerous and costly inefficiencies 
that pervade the egyptian economy it said 
the state department in a comment included in the gao report 
said there are countries where setting reform targets in advance 
will fuel political opposition on the grounds that foreigners are 
dominating economic policy 
in some situations a less specific economic reform program 
may be preferable to a highly specific program with unrealistic 
expectations eugene j mcallister assistant secretary of state 
for economic affairs stated in the report 
the aid report on egypts use of usfinanced machinery and 
equipment blamed the inability of the egyptian government aid and 
contractors to coordinate procurement with actual construction 
large amounts were either not being used or used at levels 
much below what was anticipated the report said of the equipment 
the report issued about the same time as the gao document also 
cited the limited capability of government of egypt entities to 
operate and maintain machinery and equipment

new york democratic rep samuel s stratton 
devoted his 30year congressional career to working for a stronger 
defense but it wasnt until a republican administration came into 
power that he saw his hawkish philosophy return to political vogue 
i think that a lot of the difficulties that we have today on 
the subject of defense are primarily a matter of a generation 
gap he once said those of us who watched the rise of 
hitler recognize that military power is something that is very 
necessary to protect a free society costly and dangerous but 
absolutely necessary 
stratton strongly backed the vietnam war and believed the united 
states should have made a firmer commitment there after the war 
when defense became politically unpopular stratton stuck to his 
guns going so far as to become the only yankee among the boll 
weevils a group of southern democrats in congress pushing for 
stronger defense 
ive found in the last couple of terms that whenever im 
trying to get support on a particular measure like not withdrawing 
troops from korea or providing a more active response to the 
hostage situation it was usually the southerners who would line up 
in support stratton said in 1980 
strattons position got a boost with the 1980 election of 
president reagan as federal spending shifted toward military 
buildup after years of what the new york democrat considered 
overemphasis on social spending 
strattons soninlaw announced monday that the 71yearold 
congressman a longtime asthma sufferer wont seek a 16th term 
the family spokesman roger mott cited strattons health 
throughout his career stratton has favored most proposed 
increases in defense spending and new weapons systems including 
the b1 bomber mx missile and neutron bomb he was a leading 
congressional opponent of a nuclear freeze proposal and has been 
wary of arms control agreements 
but he considers himself a middleoftheroad democrat and has 
voted for such liberal causes as a national minimum welfare 
payment against an antibusing amendment to the constitution and 
more recently for economic sanctions against the south african 
government 
the liberals think im too conservative and the conservatives 
think im too liberal he once said 
but strattons defense positions have overshadowed his other 
work in congress perhaps strattons biggest disappointment was in 
never achieving his ambition to be chairman of the house armed 
services committee 
in 1984 the democratic caucus voted out the armed services 
committees elderly chairman rep melvin price dill but chose 
the much younger and less senior rep les aspin dwis over 
stratton who was then the secondranking democrat 
in 1986 stratton was among those who opposed aspin as the 
caucus voted not to make him chairman again however aspin won the 
chair back in 1987 and stratton had to content himself with 
heading the subcommittee on procurement and military nuclear 
systems 
because of his role in procurement stratton was among those 
congressmen recently rumored to be targets of the ongoing pentagon 
probe he has not been charged with any crime however and has 
denied any involvement in the investigation 
stratton was born in 1916 in yonkers ny he attended school in 
rochester and schenectady ny and graduated from the university 
of rochester he holds masters degrees from haverford college and 
harvard university 
he was commissioned as an ensign in the naval reserve in 1942 
and served in the south pacific during world war ii as a naval 
combat intelligence officer on the staff of gen douglas macarthur 
he was twice awarded the bronze star and retired from the naval 
reserve at the rank of captain 
a former mayor of schenectady stratton was first elected to 
congress in 1958 he was the first democrat since 1916 to be sent 
to congress from what was then new yorks 32nd congressional 
district despite several redistrictings by the republicans to 
force him out stratton has returned to congress with ease every 
two years from what is now the 23rd congressional district he has 
been dean of the new york delegation since 1978 
as schenectady mayor in the 1950s stratton fulfilled a campaign 
promise to clean up the city by leading a police raid on a gambling 
den in the shadow of city hall he also sparked an investigation 
that led to the resignation of the police chief but because the 
pay from his official post was small stratton supplemented his 
income by becoming an announcer and newscaster for several local 
radio and television stations he also appeared on tv as the 
character sagebrush sam who dressed as a cowboy and played 
harmonica

attorney general edwin meese iii has nothing 
but angry words for a 17 million investigation into his ethics 
that he believes both vindicates him and will allow him to ask the 
government to pay his legal fees 
independent counsel james mckay ended a 14month investigation 
of meese by issuing a lengthy report monday while making no formal 
charges but the report precipitated an immediate war of words 
between meese and his lawyers and mckay 
after court personnel handed out 6inchthick piles of documents 
to more than 100 journalists who had waited in line as long as 2 
hours at the federal court building the combatants began a string 
of news conferences at the national press club 
meese lawyer nathan lewin compared mckay to a hitandrun 
driver for accusing the attorney general of crimes and then running 
away from filing charges 
it was a cheap shot lewin said 
he called the investigation a total bust a colossal blunder 
and scoffed at the prosecutors 814page report downplaying the 
length of his own filing which was nearly as thick but printed on 
only one side of each page 
lewin said his rebuttal with sections titled fishing in 
foreign policy water the empty net and procrastination is 
not willfulness was more readable than mckays 
lewin accused mckay of stretching statutes beyond what any 
reasonable prosecutor would do of trying to make an iraqi 
pipeline project look like the opening of a mcdonalds franchise 
in baghdad and of making groundless accusations to justify the 
high cost of his fruitless investigation 
an hour later mckay held his own news conference and repeated 
for television cameras the accusations made against meese in his 
report that meese filed a false tax return missed a tax filing 
deadline and dealt with two separate matters that might affect the 
telephone industry while holding stock in a local telephone company 
in addition mckay accused meese both in the report and at the 
news conference of insensitivity in dealings as a government 
official with his close friend e robert wallach 
but mckay said he was using his prosecutorial discretion not 
to bring formal charges against meese because such offenses 
ordinarily would not lead to prosecution of a person who was not 
attorney general 
he said neither meese nor his wife ursula had a history of tax 
evasion and he had no evidence that the attorney general took any 
of the illegal actions for personal gain or that he deliberately 
lied 
mckay defended the high cost of the investigation i didnt 
spend it personally he quipped i feel confident we have not 
wasted any government funds any of the taxpayers money 
asked how he would respond to a lawsuit from meese if one were 
filed he said ive been sued before 
finally meese strode into the same hall where mckay had just 
appeared angrily defending all his actions and attacking mckay 
im glad that finally the long ordeal is over meese said 
but im outraged at the tarnishing of our system of justice that 
has gone on this afternoon and with the filing of this report by 
the independent counsel 
i am appalled that james mckay came in front of you and 
violated every principle of fairness and decency 
ive always acted legally ethically and properly meese 
said and any implication by the independent counsel that i have 
in any way violated any law is absolutely false 
meese said it went against the american judicial system for a 
court official to publicly accuse someone of a crime and then not 
file charges 
if anybody did that in the justice department theyd be 
fired he said 
meese said he would not disclose whether he would take any legal 
action against mckay but he said he would ask the government to 
pay his legal expenses which lawyer lewin said were approaching 
250000 six months ago meese said he didnt know how much the 
total bill would be

president reagan still feels edwin 
meese iii has been an outstanding attorney general despite an 
independent counsels finding that meese likely violated tax and 
conflictofinterest statutes 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater told reporters monday 
that reagan believes meese will be able to look back with great 
satisfaction on the contributions he has made to the justice 
department and to the administration of justice in general 
reagan who is vacationing with his wife nancy at the couples 
secluded ranch in the santa ynez mountains has never wavered in 
his support of his longtime california adviser and political 
confidant 
and the voluminous report by independent counsel james mckay 
which said meese conceivably could have been prosecuted on a number 
of matters did not change the presidents thinking 
the president is pleased that after extensive scrutiny the 
independent counsel did not charge the attorney general with any 
criminal wrongdoing fitzwater told reporters at a briefing at an 
oceanfront hotel 
his remarks closely paralleled the statement that reagan made in 
behalf meese earlier this month when the attorney general 
pronounced himself vindicated because he was not indicted and 
announced he was resigning effective in late july or early august 
the reagan white house seemed taken aback by meeses 
announcement even though it said the attorney general had alerted 
reagan months earlier to the fact he did not plan to remain until 
the end of the administration next january 
reagan subsequently nominated former pennsylvania gov richard 
thornburgh as meeses replacement and the administration has said 
it hopes thornburgh can be confirmed easily by the senate there 
have been no immediate problems on capitol hill although the 
confirmation hearings remain to be held 
in the lengthy report released monday mckay said meese probably 
violated the law in the sense that the attorney general failed to 
file his income tax form on time in 1985 and that the report failed 
to disclose a substantial capital gains income by the attorney 
general 
mckay also concluded that meese likely could have been 
prosecuted for a violation of federal conflictofinterest statutes 
for taking part in meetings regarding the telephone industry while 
still holding 14000 in regional bell telephone stock 
fitzwater said white house officials were in the process of 
reviewing the mckay report but he said meese and his attorneys had 
released a document which refutes the issues at hand 
asked whether the mckay report in effect cast a new legal cloud 
over meese the spokesman said the attorney general has filed a 
lengthy statement saying no 
without commenting specifically on the meese matter thornburgh 
on the day his nomination was announced by reagan on july 5 said 
he would follow such a case wherever the evidence leads 
there have been widespread reports that meese is prepared to 
join the conservativeoriented heritage foundation a research 
organization after he leaves office there also have been reports 
that he might become a senior fellow at the hoover institution in 
palo alto calif a similarly conservative think tank 
while reagan was defending meese through his spokesman monday 
the white house announced the resignation of a close associate of 
recently resigned chief of staff howard h baker jr 
fitzwater said reagan had accepted the resignation of dan 
crippen an economics adviser who is returning to private life 
the spokesman said crippen has been an integral part of the 
presidents economic team playing an important role in many major 
issues including the trade bill budget matters and general 
economic planning 
he sought to minimize speculation that there is an exodus of 
baker associates from the white house noting that the current 
chief of staff kenneth duberstein is a close baker friend 
both baker and white house communications director thomas c 
griscom who had been bakers spokesman for years during bakers 
days in the senate resigned last month 
baker said he was leaving for personal reasons including the 
health problems of his wife joy griscom said he wanted to accept 
a position at the university of tennesseechattanooga 
duberstein will hold a highlevel meeting of senior reagan aides 
here thursday 
its just a planning meeting by the senior staff to go over 
the last six months to talk about agenda and themes issues 
campaign activities all those kinds of things fitzwater said

a 14month investigation into the financial 
dealings of edwin meese iii concluded that a real estate magnate 
and a confidant of the attorney general may have had ulterior 
motives in helping arrange a 40000ayear salary for meeses 
wife 
independent counsel james mckay in the final report on his 
investigation also said he found no evidence to show that meese 
was aware of such motives mckay whose report was made public 
monday brought no charges against meese or anyone else 
the 814page report says that meese confidant e robert wallach 
received a 200000 loan from real estate magnate howard bender 
this february shortly before investigators looked into their roles 
in funding a job for ursula meese it was their involvement in 
arranging mrs meeses salary on which mckay questioned their 
motives 
in their rebuttals attorneys for wallach and bender objected to 
mckays references to their clients possible ulterior motives 
as for the loan benders lawyers said wallach said the money 
was needed for his legal fees because the government had frozen his 
assets they said the loan was disclosed to the us attorney and 
the federal court in new york where wallach is under indictment 
for trying to peddle his influence with meese 
mckay said that in return for the 200000 bender received a 
promissory note from wallach and a deed of trust on real property 
owned by wallach 
a separate agreement provided that bender would advance wallach 
additional funds up to a total of 500000 if a deed of trust in 
the amount of 525000 were delivered to mr bender mckay said 
this was one of several new elements turned up by mckay in his 
investigation of an incident in 1985 when howard and sondra bender 
head of a wealthy washington real estate family donated 40000 
for mrs meeses salary the money was to be paid by the multiple 
sclerosis society where she had previously worked as a volunteer 
the donation coincided with efforts by a bender real estate 
partnership to renew a lucrative lease on office space in the 
chester a arthur building for justice department agencies 
the lease was renewed at increased rent more than a year after 
the donation and the bender partnership quickly sold the building 
for 60 percent more than it had paid for it about two years earlier 
mckay revealed that wallach brought mrs meeses desire for a 
paid job to the attention of the benders but mckay said he turned 
up no information that meese was aware of benders interest in the 
building or took any role in the lease renewal 
in their rebuttal benders lawyers said he had only a 10 
percent to 11 percent interest in the partnership 
there is no basis in the report for the conclusion that 
mr bender may have had ulterior motives in supporting the 
november 1985 contribution to the multiple sclerosis society which 
was used by that reputable charity to provide employment to ursula 
meese benders attorneys wrote 
they said the bender family foundation made the grant because 
they believed in mrs meeses abilities to direct development of a 
job match program for ms victims 
wallachs attorney george walker said the reference to 
ulterior motives on wallachs part is gratuitous and without any 
factual foundation 
mckay also disclosed that mrs meese received 15000 in 
advances on her salary in both 1985 and 1986 he said the society 
had no prior history of giving such advances and she testified she 
needed them to pay bills

thousands of peasants rioted in a ripe watermelon 
field and hundreds of urban dwellers looted a melon stand official 
reports said in the latest replay of the melon madness that hits 
china each summer 
participants in similar melonlooting sprees last summer 
received heavy prison terms and growers and sellers this year have 
resorted to hiring police guards apparently to little avail 
chinese eat millions of watermelons during the summer nearly 
at a rate of one a day per person in cities and some literally go 
mad over them 
in one of the latest looting incidents about 2000 peasants 
swarmed onto a melon field in central chinas henan province and 
snatched 500000 pounds of the juicy fruit in raids july 8 and 9 
the legal daily fazhi ribao on monday carried a blurry picture 
of dozens of people running through the field grabbing melons in 
both arms it said police tried to restore order but were roughed 
up by the looters 
the growers 25 peasants who had jointly contracted to plant the 
land could only put their heads down and cry in the fields 
the national newspaper said 
in a separate incident in northeastern chinas jilin province 
the legal daily said hundreds of people in songjianghe town looted 
a melon stand over several days in early july grabbing 60000 
pounds of melon 
at first the melon owner had hired protectors who fended 
off thieves but three men beat up the protectors on july 6 and 
several hundred people began snatching fruit the report said 
several suspected looters were arrested but all later were 
released without charges it said without elaborating 
in last summers most spectacular melon riot nearly 100 melon 
vendors raided a beijing train depot where farmers had brought in 
melons under contract to other vendors 
the raiders beat up some of the farmers and made off with 55000 
pounds of the fruit two of the thieves were sentenced to life in 
prison and six recieved two to 12 years in jail 
also last summer more than 100 people in jilin province jumped 
on trucks carrying melons into the provincial capital jilin and 
stole 22000 pounds farmers and bystanders who tried to protect 
shipment were beaten 
beijing authorities announced measures in june to ensure an 
adequate supply of melons to the city at controlled prices partly 
in hopes of heading off violent grabs for the fruit 
they lifted the usual ban on bringing tractors and horsedrawn 
carriages into the city center so that farmers could easily get the 
melons to market and set up designated melon marketplaces 
so far no melon violence has been reported in the capital

irans acceptance of a un ceasefire 
plan comes almost exactly a year after the start of the persian 
gulf convoy operation that led to a massive us naval buildup and 
armed clashes with iranian forces 
navy officials said they would adopt a wait and see position 
on whether when and how the persian gulfbased us fleet of about 
17 ships would be affected should the eight years of iraqiran 
hostilities indeed be ended 
as tehrans surprise announcement was reported by its official 
islamic republic news agency on monday the 48th us navy convoy 
of 1988 and the 70th in the past year was en route up the gulf 
a spokesman at us central command headquarters in tampa fla 
said the usflagged kuwaiti gas tanker gas princess escorted by 
the missile frigate fahrion had passed through the strait of 
hormuz without incident 
since the stars and stripes was first run up the mast of the 
renamed supertanker bridgeton on july 21 1987 the us navy has 
sailed 42000 miles nearly equivalent to twice around the equator 
protecting 11 reflagged kuwaiti tankers from iranian attack in 
the gulf 
for kuwait operation earnest will has guaranteed safe 
transit for millions of tons of oil products that otherwise might 
not have reached customers in europe and japan 
for the navy it has meant a grueling test of ships sailors and 
technology in a twilight war where threats range from armed 
speedboats and underwater mines to fastmoving aircraft and 
dangerously deceptive signals on a radar screen 
the escort operation got off to a shaky start when the 
401382ton bridgeton hit a mine on the first northbound convoy it 
is now semiretired 
the navys middle east force based in the gulf since 1948 grew 
swiftly from about four ships to the present level with ten more 
including an aircraft carrier in a support role in the arabian sea 
a year ago nobody would have predicted wed have 16 or 17 
ships helicopter carriers minesweepers or a lot of other stuff 
in the gulf an officer said recently 
neither could it be known that the navy would sink or damage six 
iranian vessels in a oneday missile war or that a us cruiser 
would on july 3 shoot down an iranian jetliner killing 290 people 
the pentagon said the cruiser mistook the jetliner for an f14 
fighter jet 
the incident is still being investigated 
a second kuwaiti tanker was knocked out of service for five 
months by an iranian missile attack on kuwaits main oil terminal 
and us forces have had at least three other significant clashes 
with iranian craft 
about 100 commercial vessels were attacked in the past year 
many while sailing to or from kuwait which tehran regards as 
iraqs ally in the war but no usflagged tanker has been molested 
during a navy convoy 
the reagan administration said its reflagging policy reflects a 
longstanding us commitment to freedom of navigation and would 
blunt moscows effort to expand its influence in the oilrich 
region 
it has opposed a sovietbacked proposal for a un force to 
replace the seven foreign navies that together have about 30 
warships in the gulf 
congressional opponents assailed the reflagging policy as 
illdefined and risky but reagan backers thwarted repeated efforts 
to invoke the 1973 war powers act which would require us 
withdrawal in 90 days unless congress agreed otherwise 
by rough calculation the reflagged tankers carry about 20 
percent of kuwaits total oil product exports of 600000 barrels a 
day about a third goes to kuwaits retail outlets in europe the 
rest to regular customers in europe and japan 
us diplomats say kuwaiti officials have expressed satsifaction 
with the convoy operation and that deliveries have been smoother 
since january when the convoys were increased in frequency but 
reduced in size often to one tanker 
the pentagon estimates the cost of its expanded gulf force at 
20 million a month officials say this has been reduced since 
kuwait began providing us warships with free fuel 
nine americans have been killed in the gulf in the past year 
all in helicopter crashes 
the missile frigate samuel b roberts was nearly sunk by an 
iranian mine but officers say the crews ability to save it 
validated lessons learned in the may 1987 stark disaster when an 
errant iraqi missile attack killed 37 crewmen on the us frigate

following are excerpts from the report of 
james mckay the independent counsel who investigated attorney 
general edwin meese iii and from a written response prepared by 
meeses lawyers 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
from mckays report 
the independent counsel has determined from the available 
evidence that a trier of fact would probably conclude beyond a 
reasonable doubt that mr meese violated federal law by 
willfully filing a materially false tax return and that mr meese 
violated federal law by willfully failing to pay tax at the 
time required by law 
mckay said he wasnt recommending prosecution in part because 
mr meeses actions were a onetime failure to comply in full 
with his tax obligation they were not part of a pattern of 
disobedience to the tax laws 
based on the independent counsels careful review of mr 
meeses tax returns from 1981 through 1986 mr meese appears in 
all other respects to have complied with his tax obligations there 
is certainly no rule of law nor should there be that excuses an 
isolated violation of the tax laws however the absence of a 
pattern of noncompliance is a factor that weighs heavily in the 
taxpayers favor in the determination whether criminal penalties 
are the preferred remedy for offenses involving one item or 
one closely related group of items on one years tax returns 
from the response of meeses lawyers 
in an effort to justify the cost of such herculean labors mr 
mckays staff ultimately seized on two matters that are said to 
have been discovered in the course of the investigation and has 
with regard to both issued grossly unjust pronouncements mr 
mckay asserts that there were probably violations of a 
conflictofinterest law in the attorney generals conduct with 
respect t certain telecommunications matters in 19851986 and 
probably violations of criminal tax laws in the october 1986 
filing of his personal tax return for 1985 as to each of these 
matters for a host of reasons mr mckay concludes that 
prosecution is not warranted 
we agree of course that prosecution is not warranted as to 
either of these two episodes but the reason is more fudnamental 
than mr mckays extended discussion warrants there is no basis 
for prosecution because any responsible prosecutor would recognize 
promptly that there was no criminal violation in either event 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
from the mckay report 
during the period investigated by the independent counsel mr 
meese preformed several official acts that benefited mr wallach 
these included acts that assisted wedtech and acts in furtherance 
of the aqaba pipeline project 
mr meeses official acts that benefited mr wallach began 
with his actions that assisted welbiltwedtech when he was 
counselor to the president in 1981 and 1982 mr meese facilitated 
welbilts efforts to obtain a contract to manufacture small engines 
for the army 
in 1985 mr meese took actions that substantially assisted 
mr wallach and others in connection with the proposed aqaba 
pipeline project 
but he concluded that the independent counsel has determined 
that there is insufficient evidence to conclude that mr meese 
committed any such offense under bribery and antigratuity laws 
the report notes meese admitted helping wallach and wedtech the 
firm he represented but it adds there is no substantial evidence 
that mr meese was motivated to take his actions by any 
consideration other than his friendship for mr wallach the 
evidence does not establish that he was even aware at that time of 
the nature or extent of mr wallachs prospective financial 
interest in the success of wedtech 
from the response of meeses lawyers 
any sturdy soul who undertakes the arduous task of reading the 
entire report will see that it expressly vindicates mr meese on 
the allegations that initially produced the reference to mr meese 
ie charges relating to the wedtech corp the report similarly 
exonerates mr meese on all the publicized allegations concerning 
the investment of his family funds with w franklyn chinn on all 
questions relating to whether e robert wallach ever provided 
unlawful benefits or gratuities to mr meese on all questions 
relating to mr meeses financial disclosure reports and on the 
matter of mrs meeses employment with the multiple sclerosis 
society

michael dukakis won jesse jacksons cooperation 
if not his outright endorsement monday as the 40th democratic 
national convention opened with a rousing keynote call to end eight 
years of republican rule and get on with the future 
this election is a contest between those who are satisfied 
with what they have and those who know we can do better texas 
state treasurer ann richards told a primetime audience as she 
kicked off the democrats fourday campaign rally for dukakis and 
ticketmate lloyd bentsen 
nothings wrong with you that you cant fix in november 
she said to roars of approval 
dukakis would unify this country and get on with the future 
said the woman with the white hair and the salty southern accent 
but george bush she said in scorning the republican opposition 
poor george he cant help it he was born with a silver foot 
in his mouth she said scornfully of the republican nomineetobe 
dukakis watched the show on television in his hotel suite a few 
blocks away from the omni hall where the delegates gathered to do 
his bidding his night comes wednesday when the nomination is 
sealed and again thursday when he accepts the partys prize 
the delegates convened a few hours after dukakis and jackson met 
privately for more than two hours and emerged to say they had 
smoothed over the disagreements that marred the preconvention 
week jackson is expected to campaign for the ticket this fall and 
his supporters will receive greater standing in the party as part 
of the accords 
we did not come here for fireworks we came here for noble 
works jackson said party officials said that as a result of the 
unity pact with dukakis his supporters would receive close to half 
the 25 atlarge slts on the democratic national committee as well 
as the resources to campaign on behalf of the ticket this fall 
unity was the official theme of the week but network prime time 
wasnt five minutes old before the lingering tensions of the 
primary campaign surfaced jesse jesse jacksons delegates 
shouted rhythmically as america began watching dukakis 
dukakis the governors majority delegates shouted back across 
the hall 
some jackson delegates said even though dukakis and jackson were 
trying to make peace they were ready to wage war off the 
convention floor and their repeated chants were intended to be a 
message 
we are trying to show we still support jesse jackson and also 
show the democratic party it should include us more in the power 
structure said delegate bernard parker of detroit 
ms richards took the stage after humorist garrison keillor 
opened the televised program by leading a group of elementary 
school students in a warbling rendition of the national anthem 
in the key of g the peoples key he said with practiced wry 
wit 
her first ovation and it was a big one came after richards 
ticked off a litany of reagan administration figures who proved to 
be unpopular with the democrats 
i want to announce to this nation that in a little more than 
100 days the reagan meese deaver nofziger poindexter north 
weinberger watt gorsuch lavelle stockman haig bork noriega george 
bushera will be over she said to sustained applause 
she said for eight straight years george bush hasnt 
displayed the slightest interest in anything we care about and now 
that hes after a job he cant get appointed to hes like columbus 
discovering america hes found child care hes found education 
dukakis telephoned ms richards at the podium after her speech 
to offer congratulations what am i going to say on thursday you 
said it all spokesman dayton duncan quoted him as telling the 
texan 
party sources reported a gentlemans agreement on platform 
disputes jackson agreed to withdraw 10 of 13 minority planks and 
dukakis will ask his delegates to vote down his rivals call for 
higher taxes on the wealthy and no first use of nuclear weapons 
jacksons call for a palestinian homeland will be debated and is 
expected to be withdrawn without a vote the sources said 
the convention opened as a new poll pointed to a close contest 
against the republicans an abc survey found bush drawing 46 
percent support to 45 percent for dukakis nationwide the network 
said the survey had a margin of error of plus or minus five points 
only a fraction of the delegates were in their chairs when the 
opening gavel fell but the floor began to approach gridlock as the 
parade of speakers went by were going to look good on 
television house speaker jim wright the convention chairman 
said as delegates danced to a video presentation by entertainer 
neil diamond and that was precisely what the partys imagemakers 
had in mind 
the convention cornerstone was laid at the end of the evening by 
former president carter who urged the delegates to capture the 
partys most elusive value unity one more time unity he 
exhorted 
jackson beaten but unbowed after a gallant primary campaign 
set a conciliatory tone in remarks to his delegates and said he was 
looking forward to helping the nominee win in november 
god gave this gentleman a gift and were going to use it 
said joseph warren an aide to dukakis 
jackson said he would have his name entered into nomination for 
president on wednesday night but added he had no plans to contest 
dukakis selection of bentsen for vice president and would give 
no encouragement to others who might 
the accords of atlanta provided an upbeat curtainraiser for 
dukakis convention 
party chairman paul kirk praised all those who lost out to 
dukakis or almost all there was no mention of gary hart the 
long ago frontrunner who twice entered the race and twice 
departed hart was in the convention city in the role of newspaper 
columnist and television commentator 
opening night showcased some democrats little known on network 
television and some who were instantly recognizable 
my name is jimmy carter and i am not running for president 
did you hear that george said the former president in a retort 
that served at once as a revised version of his 1976 campaign 
slogan and a jab at republican george bush who likes to call 
dukakis a jimmy carter democrat and doesnt mean it as a 
compliment 
carter no doubt liked the conventions initial results 
acceptance of delegate credentials without a challenge for the 
first time in a quartercentury 
in her keynote address ms richards sounded the call for change 
that lies at the heart of dukakis drive to reclaim the white house 
for the democrats 
in a speech scripted for precisely 33 minutes ms richards 
praised dukakis bentsen and lavishly jackson and heaped scorn 
on president reagan and vice president bush 
jesse jackson is a leader and a teacher who can open our 
hearts and our minds and stir our very souls she said in 
contrast she said reagan for eight straight years has 
pretended to us that he cannot hear our questions over the 
helicopter noise

the yangtze river dolphin is rarer than the panda 
but also less famous and less cuddly and that means it may be 
doomed says visiting american dolphin trainer ric obarry 
the huggable blackandwhite visage of a panda looking out from 
world wildlife fund advertisements around the world has helped 
raise thousands of dollars to save the fewer than 1000 pandas left 
in chinese forests 
but there are no international fundraising efforts to save the 
200 to 300 squintyeyed batnosed river dolphins they are dying 
out as their only native home chinas yangtze river becomes 
increasingly congested and polluted 
thats where obarry comes in 
the trainer of the worlds most famous dolphin flipper who 
starred in a us television series in the 1960s obarry met last 
week with chinese dolphin experts in the central city of wuhan now 
he is heading back to the united states to try to launch an 
emergency campaign to save the dying dolphins 
theyre beautiful theyre bright and very friendly he said 
in a telephone interview but without quick action he said im 
afraid these dolphins may be doomed 
obarrys chinese colleagues were more optimistic but agreed 
speedy action is needed 
the number of dolphins has reached a critical level said 
liu renjun an associate professor at the wuhan institute of 
hydrobiology 
the dolphins can be protected he said but only with hard 
work and thousands of dollars that china lacks 
the yangtze river dolphins are relatives of the common dolphin 
found worldwide like the common dolphin they grow to more than 
seven feet and have a dorsal fin their snouts are narrower like 
a small baseball bat obarry said and their skin is whiter 
both kinds rely mainly on sonar to find food and navigate and 
this is part of the river dolphins problem 
the yangtze river long a commercial thoroughfare has become 
jammed in recent decades with boats whose engine roars confuse the 
dolphins sonar scientists think the hum of propellers often lures 
dolphins to their death 
commercial fishing is depleting their food source and many 
dolphins get caught in fishermens hooks industrial pollution 
sickens those who survive 
only two exist in captivity in a cement tank at the wuhan 
institute there liu and about two dozen other researchers are 
trying to learn more about river dolphins especially how to breed 
them 
no river dolphin has ever been born in captivity 
the team is trying to collect sperm from its 9yearold male 
dolphin to artificially inseminate a 4yearold female liu said is 
still two or three years from sexual maturity 
obarry was skeptical about the effort he said he watched the 
spermcollecting efforts and theyre not getting anywhere 
whats more he said the concrete tank is not conducive to 
dolphin romance their sonar bounces off the walls and thats 
alien to them and theyre not used to swimming in circles 
obarry and the chinese agree on the need to set up a sanctuary 
along the yangtze river where the dolphins can live naturally but 
with special protections from fishermen and traffic 
liu said the institute has located a potential site upstream 
from wuhan where many river dolphins congregate naturally the 
project will cost as much as 81000 but so far the institute has 
no money 
another dolphin expert dr zhou kaiya of the nanjing normal 
university has separately started building a large holding pond 
for dolphins in the channel between two yangtze islands futher 
downstream in anhui province 
obarry was enthusiastic about both plans and said he will ask 
us companies that do business in china to help underwrite them 
he also hopes to use his old hollywood connections to organize a 
televised fundraiser for the dolphins 
i think this is the last chance

here at a glance are key developments monday 
regarding the investigation of attorney general edwin meese iii by 
independent counsel james m mckay 
mckays conclusion finishing a 14month investigation mckay 
issued a report saying meese probably broke two tax laws and twice 
violated a criminal conflictofinterest statute however he told 
a news conference that i have decided that we will not 
prosecute a decision based on prosecutorial discretion 
meeses response meese declared that he was outraged and 
appalled by mckays findings saying that if justice department 
lawyers had issued such a document theyd be fired decrying 
the tarnishing of our system of justice meese contended that 
mckay had violated every principle of fairness and decency 
taxes mckay said in his report that a trier of fact would 
probably conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that mr meese 
violated a section of the internal revenue code by filing a 
materially false tax return he said meese and his wife failed to 
report a net capital gain of 20706 on the sale of 54581 in 
securities in 1985 
mckay also said meese probably also violated a section of the 
internal revenue code for willfully failing to pay tax at the 
time required by law 
conflictofinterest according to mckay meese probably 
violated the conflictofinterest law in connection with his 
holdings of 14000 in regional bell telephone stock meese owned 
the stock in 1985 and 1986 when he set in motion a review process 
that led to a reversal of justice department policy on the regional 
bell companies 
mckay also found that meese participated in discussions of 
proposed legislation to shift regulatory responsibility for the 
breakup of atampt from a federal court and the justice department to 
the federal communications commission 
congressional reaction sen strom thurmond of south carolina 
ranking republican on the senate judiciary committee said it 
appears from the special counsels report the attorney general did 
not exercise good judgment in a number of instances the attorney 
general has announced his pending resignation and i hope this 
report finally puts this matter to rest 
sen carl levin dmich chairman of a senate subcommittee that 
investigated meeses involvement in the wedtech scandal said of 
the mckay report the findings i believe are devastating to mr 
meese to his claim that he has been ethical how anyone other than 
ed meese could claim that this report vindicates him is beyond me

with water resources it cannot be worth waiting to see if the 
worst does happen the princess told delegates to an

river pollution in the 19th century 
i suspect she might be appalled by the lack of progress in

two theatrical ballets were given their new york 
premieres on opening night of the national ballet of canadas 
oneweek season at the metropolitan opera 
the program monday began with la ronde an entertaining 
ballet based on arthur schnitzlers 1900 tale of serial liasons 
among ten characters 
all 10 dancers were splendid ronda nychka has an enticing solo 
in the first scene the prostitute and the soldier which ends 
with john alleyne as the soldier walking away without looking back 
he returns for the soldier and the parlormaid an expansive 
exuberant duet with kimberly glasco he struts away from that 
encounter 
and so it goes as we see the narcissistic young gentleman the 
young wife the husband the sweet young thing and so on the final 
scene has the count frank augustyn after a duet of sophisticated 
decadence with the actress encountering the prostitute from the 
first scene 
tetley then runs his 10 scenes through again on fastforward a 
few steps from each la ronde would be stronger without that 
and he errs somewhat on the side of subtlety the differences 
between scenes should not be as broad as burlesque but sometimes 
the differences tetley draws are so subtle that contrast is lacking 
blue snake choreographed by robert desrosiers seems overly 
influenced by performance art its most striking feature is its 
sets with weird costumes coming in second 
it is set in a jungle with modern music by ahmed hassan and 
john lang dancers dressed as zebras in abstract black and white 
leotards cavort and undulate monkeys run about to strains of jazz 
the face of a giant appears his arms move in from the side walls 
his hands gathering up monkeys and stuffing them through his open 
mouth 
there is drumming eerie music people in black with tall 
dancecaps three women in blue with gold quills down their spines 
people with square pieces of cloth fastened to head ankle and 
wrists so they look like flying kites and people wearing 
gyroscopes on their heads it ends with a long snake flying through 
the air 
its very visual which must intrigue some audiences wed 
rather see a ballet

a smoky fire erupted monday night at the 
downtown union bank building burning offices on two upper floors 
of the 38story tower before it was extinguished 
at least two workers in the building escaped safely after the 
fire broke out about 820 pm no injuries were reported said 
battalion chief bob defeo 
on may 4 the worst highrise fire in the citys history killed 
one man and injured 40 people at the nearby first interstate bank 
building 
there were some lessons learned in the first interstate 
fire said inspector ed reed who told reporters that 
firefighters quickly raced up 34 floors to get to the union bank 
fire before it could rage out of control 
in the first interstate blaze firefighters had had difficulty 
reaching the flames 
mondays fire was declared extinguished shortly after 9 pm 
said fire spokesman jim williamson about 75 firefighters were at 
the scene 
michael turner said he was working on the 35th floor when the 
fire broke out 
i was in our law library doing some research and i felt two 
explosions which i thought was an earthquake he said when i 
realized it wasnt an earthquake i went back to my desk and the 
fire alarm went off 
i went and found a coworker we looked out one of the windows 
and saw flames coming up and we got the heck out of there 
the fire burned two offices on the 34th floor and 1 offices on 
the 35th floor said defeo adding this was nowhere near the 
interstate fire we got it in time 
before the fire was controlled a television news helicopter 
circled the tower and spotted flames coming from an upperstory 
office and thick smoke coming from other windows 
the union bank tower is located within blocks of the first 
interstate bank building 
a sprinkler system was being installed at the first interstate 
building but was not yet operating on the night the fire 
devastated the upper floors of the states tallest skyscraper 
alexander handy a 24yearold maintenance worker died after he 
became trapped in an elevator several people were trapped inside 
the smokefilled building for hours as firefighters worked to 
rescue them 
the union bank building was equipped with sprinklers in the 
basement and on the 30th floor according to fire department 
records it was built before the 1974 city ordinance requiring 
sprinklers in highrises

with enough cameras present to cover every 
conceivable angle of the democratic national convention franklin 
mcmahon seemed as obsolete as the flash bulb 
but there he was pencils in hand sketching the scene on his 
artists tablet recording the proceedings for time rather than 
for the moment 
i do this because an artist sees differently mcmahon said 
i see what all these cameras cant i see around the corners 
what i do is not just a snapshot its a statement and the camera 
usually doesnt make a statement 
mcmahon from chicago has been lending his perspective to the 
political scene for three decades now his work is being shown at 
the cnn center adjacent to the omni during the convention 
while the convention buzzed around him mcmahon deliberately 
outlined a picture looking for nuances and special characteristics 
of this convention he placed a computer terminal in the 
foreground symbolizing the equipment used to count each states 
votes 
i try to bring an element of humor to it mcmahon said 
this is a tv show and i make sure i show tv some way

from danny bigays perspective some 65 feet above the omni 
floor the democratic national convention hasnt been as well 
organized as say a rock concert 
bigay was part of the crew that rigged and focused the hundreds 
of lights that democrats hope make their convention shine he crept 
across steel trusses hung from the ceiling used ropeclimbing 
techniques and delighted in thrilling the earlyarriving reporters 
and delegates by descending upsidedown 
theyve never done this before so they were kind of making it 
up as they went along bigay said of the organizers but there 
havent been any major problems theres nothing thats not 
working and nobody got hurt

forget all the pomp and preparation the careful 
creation of convention images for national consumption for the raw 
guts of politics check the podium schedule 
from lowly house challengers to sitting governors politicians 
are lobbying fiercely for a moment or two in the spotlight at the 
democratic national convention the evolving schedule provides 
clearcut evidence of the pressure the winners and the losers 
for instance consider this years senate candidates 
on the schedule issued saturday they were allotted 10 minutes 
tonight for introductions in a revision released monday the 
contenders were up to 19 minutes and brief remarks 
true they were scheduled for 450 pm but any exposure is 
good exposure for challengers fighting for recognition from the 
home folks who read the local newspaper and watch local tv 
podium time is a good boost for these candidates theyll 
certainly be covered in their print outlets said anita dunn 
spokeswoman for the democratic senatorial campaign committee 
the success of her group sparked a competitive drive at the 
house congressional campaign committee we are coequal branches 
of government explained committee chairman beryl anthony dark 
his tongue was in his cheek but he made his point the revised 
schedule showed wednesday proceedings starting 39 minutes earlier 
than initially planned more than half an hour was devoted to the 
house candidates 
the house segment on the updated schedule was followed by an 
allnew governors segment as the national governors association 
weighed in the leaders of pennsylvania kentucky and louisiana 
secured four or five minutes apiece a princely chunk in the 
fastmoving new world of abridged television coverage 
people have been astonishingly cooperative about time said 
mike mccurry spokesman for the democratic national committee 
weve been able to persuade them that four minutes on the podium 
constitutes a major address 
other late additions to the schedule included introductions of 
others who ran for president all of them except sen joseph biden 
ddel who is not here and former sen gary hart who is here as 
a newspaper columnist and television commentator 
the new schedule set aside time for house majority leader tom 
foley of washington and washington dc mayor marion barry for 
introducing geraldine ferraro and even for introducing someone 
identified as the young delegate 
it appeared that walter mondale the presidential nominee in 
1984 was one of the casualties of the revised schedule designated 
to be introduced by house speaker jim wright on the initial 
program he was nowhere to be found on the revision 
you caught what must be either a typo or a lapse in the 
synapses of the press secretary said mccurry mondale was indeed 
introduced at about 830 monday night a half hour before network 
coverage began asked the meaning of this mccurry replied prime 
time was 8 to 11 last time i checked 
there were some true casualties or heroes forced to sacrifice 
their precious podium time to the demands of the modern convention 
everyone presenting a section of the platform lost a minute wright 
and sen christopher dodd dconn each lost four 
bob farmer the dukakis finance chairman widely considered a 
miracle worker dropped from four minutes to two and a videotape 
of praise for dnc secretary dorothy bush who calls the roll got 
slashed from six minutes to three 
the time pressure is such that mccurry wouldnt even consider a 
reporters question about the possibility of roll call rather than 
voice votes on platform amendments i wouldnt want to 
speculate he said on anything that would keep the clocks from 
running on time

deep bitterness smolders among many of jesse 
jacksons black delegates over what they see as michael dukakis 
slap in the face of their candidate and they say whether it 
hurts dukakis in november will be settled by jackson not dukakis 
even after the breakfast accord between dukakis and jackson 
william crawford of indianapolis ind speaks for many when he 
says george bush is not attractive but i dont think we can say 
dukakis at any price 
state sen hank sanders of selma ala echoes crawford and 
then some at some particular time dignity becomes more 
important than any election he says ill give up anything for 
dignity including life 
but political activist joe reed of montgomery ala draws the 
line at voting republican theres not a democrat here who wants 
to see george bush elected he says jesse jackson has as much 
obligation to get the democratic ticket elected as dukakis does 
on the floor of the democratic convention monday night jackson 
delegates chanted jesse jesse and said they were trying to 
send a message 
i think we are trying to show we still support jesse jackson 
and also show the democratic party it should include us more in the 
power structure said bernard parker of detroit 
associated press reporters interviewed a sampling of black 
jackson delegates on the potential november fallout from what many 
blacks call the insulting way dukakis treated jackson in picking a 
southern moderate lloyd bentsen as running mate at the very time 
jackson had started campaigning for the job and then failing to 
tell jackson of that decision 
arthur eve of buffalo ny deputy majority leader of the lower 
house in the state legislature says his fellow black new york 
delegates are outraged over a snub of jackson that was 
very deliberate and very planned 
milton toby fitch a black legislator from wilson nc 
calls it a slap in the face adding you dont have some 
underling contact rev jackson you do it yourself 
dissents cederick dwyer 45 of south haven mich i dont 
feel insulted and i dont think jesse jackson was insulted 
nonetheless he says dukakis needs to make an apology 
some black jackson delegates say jackson retains enormous power 
because the signals he sends will decide whether blacks will vote 
in massive numbers for the man from massachusetts 
painter george wood 71 from richfield minn says hell 
follow jacksons cues whatever way he goes im with him 100 
percent wood says 
chimes in jim richardson of charlotte nc a state senator 
most of the delegates i know will stick with jesse right down the 
line wherever it takes us 
a strong endorsement of dukakis by jackson would get me to 
support him strongly but it has to come to that says wayne 
williams of delaware 
adds mary jo haywood of camilla ga if he comes out 
enthusiastically for the ticket then black voters will support it 
but if hes lackadaisical they will interpret it as meaning that 
it doesnt matter if they vote in november or not 
nebraska brace a black alderman from albany ny says the way 
dukakis handled bentsen was an insult to black people in 
general but he feels the jackson forces will return to the fold 
well win in november and well win with the black vote he 
predicts 
the interviews yield these additional impressions 
some see a machiavellian duplicity in the way dukakis let word 
slip out before notifying jackson he did it deliberately says 
rep cardiss collins of chicago relaxing during a ride on an 
antique railroad he was trying to appeal to a certain segment of 
democratic voters who would like that kind of thing he was trying 
to say that he wasnt going to be dictated to by the jesse 
jackson supporters 
adds gail peterson 35 a community organizer from grand rapids 
mich by choosing bentsen dukakis made a statement to the 
conservative wing of the party 
but some like howard p rawlings of baltimore md pay 
grudging respect to dukakis pragmatism rawlings says dukakis 
has a tough balancing act to maintain and adds that jackson 
would not want to leave the convention with the weight of a 
potential democratic loss on his shoulders 
some black delegates say the incident displayed dukakis 
remoteness from black concerns the dukakis campaign has to be 
more sensitive to the needs and concerns of black constituents 
says william gibson of south carolina

commercial vegetable farmers have boosted 
acreages from a year ago but heat and drought are taking a toll of 
some of the crop yields including peas grown for freezing and 
canning says an agriculture department report 
consumer food prices overall are expected to rise 3 percent to 5 
percent this year with about 1 percentage point of the increase 
attributed to the drought in 1989 usda officials say the current 
drought losses may force up food prices an additional 2 percentage 
points perhaps making a total increase of around 6 percent 
prospective acreage for seven fresh market vegetables was 
estimated at 272100 acres down fractionally from 272790 a year 
ago the report said monday carrots and sweet corn declined while 
other crops increased those included broccoli cauliflower 
celery lettuce and tomatoes 
the total for five major vegetables for processing was 135 
million acres under contract to processors a 2 percent increase 
from 1987 increases were reported for snap beans cucumbers for 
pickles and tomatoes but there are fewer acres of sweet corn and 
green peas 
drought and heat have stressed a number of the crops that have 
not been irrigated the report said 
for example in the category of sweet corn for fresh market 
sale the report said that drought and heat have hurt the crop in 
new jersey pennsylvania ohio and michigan in california 
however sweet corn has made good progress after being slowed 
somewhat by unseasonably cool weather 
in new jersey the tomato crop declined due to drought and 
yields will be affected severely if the dry weather continues 
looking at processing vegetables the canned and frozen kind 
that consumer will see at stores next winter the report said hot 
dry weather has hurt yields of cucumbers used for making pickles 
and there is increased interest this year in fall planted 
cucumbers for processing 
production of green peas for processing is down 32 percent 
from last year based on reports from processors the report 
said hot dry weather has reduced the crop expectation to 
299000 tons compared with 437000 tons last year and nearly 
415000 tons the year before 
drought in the northcentral states has cut the pea crop 
drastically the report said 
minnesota yields dropped 45 percent as heat during bloom and 
filling devastated the crop the report said wisconsin 
processors report yields at half last years level atlantic coast 
states held good moisture supplies during the spring and are 
harvesting generally better pea crops than last year 
the governments interagency drought policy committee said last 
week in a report to president reagan that fruits and vegetables 
and many other crops will be largely unaffected even though 
production may be down in some areas such as the lake states 
it added these crops are produced over wide areas in the 
united states and are often irrigated the sugar beet crop is 
expected to be down modestly while supplies of sweet corn green 
beans carrots beets and tart cherries will also be smaller

sometimes old research like yesteryears 
fashions makes a comeback or at least is done up in new packages 
says the agriculture department 
back in the 1960s usda peanut researcher joseph pominski and 
others developed and patented a chemicalfree process that removes 
about half the fat from raw peanuts which then can be roasted and 
eaten as a snack food with about a third fewer calories than 
regular peanuts 
the departments agricultural research service said monday that 
the patent expired in 1983 but renewed health interest has 
helped bring new interest to the research 
a major food company heinz usa began selling partially 
defatted roasted peanuts made with a commercial process based on 
the technology developed by pominski and colleagues at the agencys 
southern regional research center in new orleans 
pominski a chemical engineer and his fellow workers used a 
press to squeeze out about half the oil from raw peanuts after 
that the raw peanuts are soaked in hot water and then roasted for 
five minutes 
regular roasted peanuts will crumble if you squeeze them but 
raw peanuts that are squeezed and then roasted dont they regain 
their shape says pominski we like to say that raw peanuts 
have a memory 
the agency said the lowerfat peanuts are sold by heinz usa 
under the weight watchers label

democrats pointed to the quick adoption of major 
rule changes and the seating of more than 4000 delegates without a 
fight as a sign to the nation of their commitment to party unity 
and hopes for victory in november 
we decided to go down the road of cooperation and it leads to 
victory in 1988 sen john breaux dla told delegates on 
monday at the start of the 48th democratic national convention 
rules and credentials constant points of contention for the 
democratic party were resolved weeks before the convention and 
adopted without a single floor fight or nay vote shortly after 
democratic chairman paul g kirk gaveled the gathering to order 
the speedy adoption within 45 minutes broke a 25year 
democratic record of fighting 
we are here to unite tonight said leroy irvis speaker of 
the pennsylvania house and chairman of the credentials committee 
i give you a report and there will be no minority report filed 
every single one has been unanimously approved of every single 
debate has been resolved 
negotiators for nomineetobe michael dukakis and jesse jackson 
reached agreements last month and the rules and credentials 
committees ratified the results to ensure a unified convention 
dukakis had enough delegates to win the nomination plus a 
600delegate cushion that allowed him to concede to jacksons 
demands for added delegate representation in kansas and indiana 
everybody had to swallow a little to win big said rep 
patricia schroeder dcolo who served on the credentials 
committee 
we had 24 disagreements and we resolved every single one of 
those disagreements before we had a formal meeting irvis told 
the convention we met in washington dc without a single 
problem to resolve 
and when the delegates responded with unanimous ayes to the 
credentials report kirk noted that it was the first sign of 
unanimity and unity 
on the issue of rules dukakis agreed to jacksons call for a 
change in the delegate selection process for 1992 to make it more 
closely conform to the popular vote expressed at the primaries and 
caucuses 
the new rules will reduce the number of super delegates 
elected or party leaders from 643 to 394 or 15 percent of the 
delegate total to about 10 percent 
super delegates are not bound by the results of their state 
contests jackson contended that his super delegate support which 
was about onetenth that of dukakis did not reflect the popular 
vote backing he received in some states 
the rules also ban directelection and bonus primaries 
which had the effect of awarding delegates on a 
winnertakemore basis 
in states such as new jersey pennsylvania and massachusetts 
those systems enabled dukakis to amass the delegates needed to 
clinch the nomination on the last day of the primary season 
we worked out our differences in a spirit of compromises 
said kathy vick vice chairman from louisiana and head of the rules 
committee 
marion barry mayor of the district of columbia and 
representative of the jackson forces said this year we worked 
together for a winning team 
as he left the podium ms vick said thank you governor 
barry a reference to one of the other rule changes the party 
will recognize the mayor of washington dc as a governor in the 
delegate selection process the only requirement is that he be a 
democrat

foreigners on hand for the democratic national 
convention are getting a rare look at politics american style and a 
sneak preview of what kind of foreign policy a dukakis 
administration might bring 
its fantastic to see the people from all these states it 
is very very impressive molefi pholo an official from tiny 
lesotho said monday 
less impressive were temperatures that soared high into the 90s 
each day outside is utter hell he said hot and humid we 
dont have that in lesotho he said 
pholo is one of more than 300 foreigners from nearly 100 
countries to visit the convention as guests of the national 
democratic institute a governmentfunded organization affiliated 
with the democratic party money for the trip was raised privately 
however 
it is a rare opportunity for a chinese to see your system 
said zhu hongqian a researcher at the institute of american 
studies in beijing 
like others in this city for the hoopla the foreigners were 
disappointed they were unable to visit the convention floor because 
space was so tight instead most watched the proceedings on 
television 
nonetheless they managed to get caught up in the excitement of 
the moment 
there is an air of confidence among the democrats that was 
noticeably absent at the last two conventions said bill walker 
a conservative member of the british parliament from blairgowrie 
scotland walker a fan of the united states said 1988 is his 
fourth democratic convention 
even so he predicted republican george bush would win the 
election they still have problems he said of the democrats 
david steel who is retiring as head of britains liberal party 
disagreed i am impressed compared to four years ago he said 
they have gotten their act together 
steel was also impressed with the zap behind jesse jacksons 
campaign the issues that jackson addresses are legitimate he 
said 
raquel cerezo the wife of guatemalas president vinicio 
cerezo had the same impression it seems like we have common 
problems she said childcare problems housing problems 
health problems 
but mrs cerezo acknowledged that democracy as an institution is 
not as healthy in guatemala as in the united states 
generally the international guests were eager to talk about the 
pros and cons of the democratic process but vitaly churkin of the 
international department of the communist party in moscow was 
closelipped 
im sorry i really cant talk with reporters he said 
pholo said he was a less than impartial observer because of 
concern about democrats supporting a platform that calls for tough 
economic sanctions against south africa 
pholo principal secretary to lesothos cabinet said his 
country is totally engulfed by south africa so sanctions 
against the pretoria regime would have a very deleterious effect 
on us 
j brian atwood the institutes president said the groups aim 
was to give leaders from abroad an indepth exposure to the 
political system and allow them a preview of what a democratic 
foreign policy might look like 
human rights would play a much larger role in policy if 
massachusetts gov michael dukakis wins in november he said 
the foreign guests have received briefings from wellknown 
democrats like former vice president walter mondale the 
institutes chairman and sen albert gore dtenn and toured 
atlantas landmarks particularly those connected with the civil 
rights movement 
theyve also been wined and dined one party for africans and 
frenchmen was hosted by businessman maurice tempelsman a sometime 
escort of jacqueline kennedy with mining interests in zaire

for gov michael dukakis it was a good opening 
days work at the democratic national convention a no deal 
deal with jesse jackson 
dukakis coped with his only major convention problem without 
yielding on points his democratic ticket cannot afford to concede 
and without the sort of confrontation that could have alienated 
jacksons largely black constituency 
indeed his peachtree street summit meeting may have solved a 
problem for jackson too by providing the defeated presidential 
candidate with a graceful exit after his certain loss in the roll 
call that will nominate dukakis on wednesday night 
jackson came away from a session that lasted nearly three hours 
on monday saying that he intends to work for the ticket that he 
wants to be supportive and complementary 
he dukakis and sen lloyd bentsen of texas who is getting the 
vice presidential nomination jackson also wanted appeared together 
and said all the proper things 
they talked about teamwork a better relationship 
understanding trust and very few specifics there is no deal 
and there is no fine print said dukakis that is not the way 
you win elections 
not with republicans watching for concessions that would enable 
them to say that dukakis had buckled under to the jackson wing 
who is going to be the coach asked ed rollins former white 
house political adviser and now a gop truth squad observer in 
atlanta is jesse jackson going to call the shots rollins said 
that would turn off a lot of voters 
dukakis said in advance that he would be calling the democratic 
plays he did on monday with gestures and concessions to reassure 
the jackson wing he conceded nothing of major significance 
party sources say the two camps reached an agreement on platform 
disputes under which jackson will withdraw 10 of the 13 minority 
platform planks that were to be debated tonight 
dukakis will ask his delegates to vote down his rivals call for 
higher taxes on the wealthy and no first use of nuclear weapons 
jacksons call for a palestinian homeland will be debated and is 
expected to be withdrawn without a vote the sources said 
jacksons major convention address also is scheduled tonight 
there was another gesture in dukakis telephoned invitation to 
jackson to the peace summit before not after the challengers own 
candidacy has ended jackson isnt endorsing the ticket because he 
still is running against it he said hes still looking for a 
miracle and that when it doesnt happen his campaign will pass 
over into a new phase 
that phase will get financial and staff help from the victors 
jackson will have chartered airplanes for campaign missions in the 
fall 
he got the same thing four years ago from the campaign of former 
vice president walter f mondale 
dukakis hinted at a role for jackson in a future democratic 
administration calling him a great leader and we hope in january 
part of the american government but campaign chairman paul 
brountas said there was no agreement on a role for jackson or his 
people in a dukakis transition or administration he said that 
would flow from natural evolution in a cooperative winning 
campaign 
jacksons camp was promised a bigger role on the democratic 
national committee but at the bottom not the top when 25 
atlarge members are appointed on friday jackson supporters will 
get about a dozen seats 
but they will not have one of their own installed as chairman or 
cochairman to replace or to share authority with chairman paul 
kirk there will apparently be a new top level voter registration 
position to be filled by a jackson ally 
dukakis representatives had agreed in advance to jackson demands 
on another front changes in the way democratic nominating 
delegates are elected the jacksonbacked revisions approved by 
the convention monday night without dissent have the effect of 
requiring that delegates be awarded more closely in proportion to 
the popular vote in primary elections 
in addition the rules cut back sharply on the number of 
convention seats set aside for party leaders and officeholders and 
left uncommitted by the primary process the idea was to create an 
independent bloc of officeholding delegates the assumption was 
that they would align with the candidate most likely to win the 
general election 
the 643 super delegates at this convention are for dukakis 10 
to 1 at the next convention there will be 394 
we negotiated new rules for 1992 said jackson 
that makes no practical difference to dukakis if he wins on 
nov 8 he will be up for renomination and it will be no contest 
if he loses the 1992 field will belong to other candidates 
one of them surely would be jesse jackson

the democratic national convention opened with a 
smoking ban a pledge to stay on time some homespun politics and a 
childs view of the presidency but unity 
not really 
supporters of the rev jesse jackson some wearing buttons 
reading respect blackocrats or else waged a war of shouts on 
the floor of the omni monday night 
they chanted jesse jesse jesse each time their candidates 
name was mentioned and audibly overpowered the refrains of duke 
duke 
the message wasnt lost on the majority of delegates for michael 
dukakis 
they can have their time said dukakis supporter don ortiz 
of new mexico 
when the whole thing is over well be demonstrating 
together predicted pennsylvania delegate david bielski the 
party has received their message 
the party also received a folksy pledge of allegiance from radio 
raconteur and author garrison keillor and a group of first graders 
as well as celebrity readings of childrens essays on the 
presidency 
if that werent enough wholesomeness the party banned smoking 
in the convention hall driving smokers out to a hazy arena outer 
lobby 
joe agostinelli a warwick ri businessman was on the floor 
chomping on an unlit cigar i dont like it but what are you 
going to do ive been a cigar smoker for 35 years its tough 
he said 
agostinelli a visitor not a delegate said i havent had it 
lit since i got out of the car but three people have come up to me 
and said would you mind putting that out 
the democrats offered everything from biographical videos of 
keynote speaker ann richards and former president jimmy carter to 
music videos of pop star neil diamond 
there was a brass band enough celebrities to satisfy 
entertainment tonight and plenty of corny provincialism like 
cardboard crab placards for the maryland delegation 
the opening affair ran a few minutes late and there were a few 
awkward moments like the 90 seconds the podium was empty after 
polly baca of colorado was introduced 
no matter 
i feel like im on the brink of history said dukakis 
delegate leslie hutchinson of baltimore md 
this partys not used to not having fights said richard 
trumka president of the united mine workers and a pennsylvania 
delegate

the democrats tailored their convention to 
network prime time all right down to casting a new television 
star 
texas state treasurer ann richards keynote address was the 
highlight of the opening session of the democratic national 
convention on monday night the speech soothed fears at least for 
the night that television coverage of the event was going to be 
dull as dishwater after jesse jackson and michael dukakis patched 
up their differences monday morning 
the convention even ended virtually on time running only about 
10 minutes over the 11 pm edt scheduled close 
richards 30minute address was downhome funny and 
sentimental it could have been a network sitcom in fact with her 
southern twang viewers tuning in for cbs designing women 
which the speech preempted might not have noticed the difference 
only cbs diane sawyer got to richards for an interview after 
her speech richards said she didnt think my eye contact with 
the camera was all that great but otherwise thought she did all 
right 
former president jimmy carters ascension to the platform this 
time he got primetime treatment unlike 1984 was an emotional 
high point though his speech was lackluster after richards 
until richards speech the name of the game monday night for 
the networks was get dukakis and jackson 
nbc even went on the air a halfhour earlier than the scheduled 
9 pm to be first with live interviews of the two principals abc 
stuck to its plan to open with dukakis at 9 cbs started with a 
dukakis interview taped minutes earlier 
only nbc viewers saw the nice bit of americana that opened 
primetime coverage of the session garrison keillor and a group 
of elementaryschool children saying the pledge of allegiance and 
singing the national anthem nbc went a tad high on the 
cuteometer though with cutaways to tom brokaw and john 
chancellor joining in 
despite a barrage of network interviews throughout the night 
dukakis and jackson revealed little about the behindthescenes 
bargaining that led to their reconciliation 
cnns bernard shaw was admirably dogged though sir i cannot 
turn this loose he told dukakis you still havent told me 
you havent told our viewers what you two agreed to to no avail 
until the dukakisjackson summit meeting and subsequent news 
conference on monday it seemed jacksons resentment at not being 
chosen running mate might turn into some newsworthy controversy at 
the otherwise wellplanned convention 
if it werent for jesse jackson we wouldnt have anything 
abcs brit hume had said sunday 
do you have a plane ticket to miami quipped nbcs dennis 
murphy on monday 
things went smoothly monday night for network floor reporters 
who had anticipated the worst in the small crowded omni arena 
though when abcs peter jennings remarked that it looked reasonably 
roomy down there jeff greenfield replied there will be no 
walkout at this convention it would take five pounds of axle 
grease to get anybody out of here

cbs in contract negotiations with legendary anchor walter 
cronkite is being careful to make him feel wanted during the 
convention during a weekend special cronkite and dan rather made 
their first network appearance together since cronkite suggested he 
would have fired rather for causing the network to go black for six

michael dukakis escaped the crowds for a brisk 
power walk through a city park then endured a gantlet of 
network interviews and technical glitches before settling in to 
watch the televised version of the convention that will nominate 
him for president 
awaiting his formal nomination on wednesday dukakis saw the 
opening night of the democratic national convention on a bank of 
color televisions in his penthouse suite at a hotel just blocks 
from the convention hall 
he tuned in just as the keynote speech by texan ann richards 
began and he phoned her immediately afterward 
what am i going to say on thursday he told her you said 
it all 
with the resolution of campaign tensions between himself and 
jesse jackson apparently out of the way dukakis was going today to 
the martin luther king jr center and gravesite for a tour and 
speech accompanying him were the slain civil rights leaders 
widow coretta scott king and dukasis designated running mate 
sen lloyd bentsen 
following a relaxed schedule dukakis took top aide nick 
mitropolous to atlantas piedmont park on monday afternoon for some 
exercise despite the muggy 90degree plus weather 
a former jogger who now prefers fast walks dukakis carried 
fourpound weights in each hand and moved his arms vigorously with 
each step in what he calls a power walk exercise they went to 
the park without the national press entourage that is otherwise 
ever present when he moves around the city and they walked for 
three miles 
we didnt see a single bush supporter in the park dukakis 
deadpanned hours later talking with aides and a reporter as he 
moved between suites at his hotel 
the massachusetts governor was joined in his private quarters by 
the speaker of his state house george kevarian and he took a few 
moments to talk with top state aides back in boston by phone 
compared to the boston statehouse this is a day at the 
beach he said 
dukakis also spent time working on his nomination acceptance 
speech to be delivered thursday night he didnt plan to enter the 
convention hall until that night 
dukakis threehour meeting with jackson early in the day 
produced talk of party unity by both men 
the main order of business for dukakis evening was the series 
of interviews he conducted with the four network anchors nbc cbs 
abc and cnn each had their turn using control rooms set up near 
where dukakis and aides are staying 
aside from the expected questions about the jackson settlement 
dukakis faced some unexpected remarks like when nbc anchor tom 
brokaw related the tale that dukakis was so frugal he once took a 
piece of hard candy from his mouth before a speech saved it and 
resumed enjoying it afterward 
off camera he later explained that his motive was to avoid a 
mess i didnt want to leave it there so i stuck it back in my 
mouth 
before his abc interview however dukakis sat silently while 
technicians shouted back and forth over multiple audio lines about 
a sound failure that lasted right up to airtime why doesnt he 
hear peter jennings a controlroom voice repeated 
im sorry for all that anchor jennings said into dukakis 
earpiece seconds before they went on live his sound line to the 
governor restored i think its designed to drive us all crazy 30 
seconds before air 
as the show came on mitropolous and other aides watched from a 
nextdoor bedroom that was converted into a control room the 
anchor quoted an unidentified senior aide to dukakis as saying 
we want a convention that is organized orderly and short just 
like our candidate 
stunned the assembled aides groaned dukakis who is 5foot8 
didnt flinch 
he can take a punch a producer for a rival network said 
later

jimmy carter shunned by his own party after a 
trying term in the white house that ended in a landslide defeat 
eight years ago is edging back toward the spotlight 
as his partys only living former president carter received a 
warm reception monday night after being introduced to the 
democrats national convention as a great american and a great 
democrat but he barely made prime time for his appearance was 
the closing act for the opening night of the democratic national 
convention 
twice he dominated party conventions in 1976 when he went on 
to the presidency and four years later when the campaign ended in 
humiliating defeat 
delegates applauded for two minutes at the beginning and again 
at the end of a speech in which he warned the democrats to set 
aside their propensity for internal battles 
if i had to give you just one special message tonight he 
told them i would summarize it in a single word unity 
he urged the delegates to go forth from this convention united 
behind out candidates and our ideals 
carter could still remember vividly the 1980 democratic 
convention when he was nominated for a second term only after a 
bitter fight with sen edward m kennedy of massachusetts that 
convention ended with carter and kennedy circling each other on the 
podium the senator trying to avoid a peacemaking embrace with his 
victorious rival 
the memory of the 1980 campaign in which republican ronald 
reagan carried 44 states to sweep carter out of office and help 
propel the gop to control of the senate sent carter into a 
political exile during which he rarely appeared at party functions 
he spoke on the opening night of the 1984 convention but his 
appearance was little noticed in the acclaim given the keynote 
address that year by gov mario cuomo of new york 
maxine goldstein of milledgeville ga who was a member of the 
site selection committee for the 1988 convention said people would 
ask when they heard the meeting might be held in georgia what 
are you going to do about president carter 
were going to pull him out and put him on a pedestal and let 
everyone appreciate him like we appreciate him she said 
describing her reply 
but the georgia peanut farmer who burst from obscurity in 1976 
to win the presidency still had to compete with the keynote speaker 
this time texas state treasurer ann richards 
and by the time he spoke many of the seats that were filled for 
her speech had emptied 
former secretary of state edmund s muskie reminded delegates of 
some of carters finer moments 
let us remember him clasping the hands of anwar sadat and 
menahem begin said muskie recalling the camp david accords that 
brought peace between egypt and israel 
he told the truth he made his country strong added muskie 
republicans ridiculed carter for an administration during which 
americans were held hostage in iran and inflation and interest 
rates hit double digits 
republican george bush continues to push that image of the 
carter years in his campaign a tactic that the former president 
derisively noted monday night 
i have one announcement to make he said my name is jimmy 
carter and i am not running for president did you hear that

democratic keynoter ann richards drew laurels 
and laughter for a speech that used an easy homey tone and 
wicked humor to talk about what the democrats can do for american 
families and what the republicans have not 
this republican administration treats us as if we were pieces 
of a puzzle that cant fit together the texas state treasurer 
said in her monday night speech that departed in style and tone 
from the traditional stemwinder that opens political conventions 
new york gov mario cuomo whose democratic keynote address four 
years ago propelled him to hero status in the democratic party 
called ms richards effort great adding she lit their fuse 
tonight 
ms richards who is texas state treasurer and a 54yearold 
divorced mother of four grown children saved her most pointed 
quips for vice president george bush the gop presidential 
nomineetobe 
the omni audience interrupted the speech at least 50 times with 
applause and laughs afterward delegates said they were taking 
their favorite richards lines home with them 
george bush is going to live for a long long time with a 
silver foot in his mouth that one will stick said delegate 
florence peterson of grand rapids mich 
the silver foot line an instant classic among delegates 
was interrupted twice in the midst of it and ended with a roaring 
response from delighted delegates 
poor george ms richards said grinning broadly he cant 
help it he was born with a silver foot in his mouth 
bush was barbecued early and often by the treasurer from the 
state where he has a houston hotel suite that he calls home 
i am delighted to be here with you this evening because after 
listening to george bush all these years i figured you needed to 
know what a real texas accent sounds like ms richards who 
plans a 1990 race for texas governor said in an opening line that 
quickly got the crowd on its feet 
ms richards was emotional too she talked about a woman from 
lorena texas who had written her a letter that complained that 
life has become difficult despite a family income of about 50000 
i believe people like us have been forgotten in america the 
mother of three said in her letter 
of course you believe youre being forgotten because you have 
been ms richards said blaming the reagan administration 
she excited both major factions at the convention by heaping 
praise on presidential nomineetobe michael dukakis and runnerup 
jesse jackson 
the jesse jesse chant rang out after ms richards called 
him a leader and a teacher who can open our hearts and minds and 
stir our very souls 
dukakis backers chanted duke duke when ms richards said 
the best traditions of straighttalking democrats live today in 
michael dukakis 
and she had warm words for another texan sen lloyd bentsen 
dukakis designated running mate 
he knows how to bring us together by region by economics by 
example she said of bentsen and hes already beaten george 
bush once 
bentsen defeated bush in a 1970 us senate race 
delegates from around the nation and dukakis himself called 
the richards speech a winner 
he said he thought it was great ms richards said after 
talking by telephone to dukakis he wanted to know what he could 
say now because id taken all his good lines 
charlene shores of california one of many delegates who said 
they knew little about ms richards before monday said the speech 
caught our attention and our hearts 
delegate sue rockne of minnesota said the talk even topped 
cuomos 1984 keynote 
i love hearing a feminist with a southern accent ms rockne 
said 
i had never heard of her said delegate rudy clay of 
indiana you can become a star overnight in this ball game

doctors at military hospitals will not perform 
abortions starting oct 1 unless the mothers life is in danger 
doctors have been barred since 1979 from performing abortions 
paid for by the government unless the life of the mother is 
endangered but were allowed to perform socalled prepaid 
abortions in certain countries in which quality medical care 
may not be locally available 
a memo obtained monday signed by dr william mayer assistant 
defense secretary for health affairs changes the policy it says 
it might suggest insensitivity to the spirit of the 
congressionally enacted policy of withholding government 
involvement in the provision of abortions 
there were 10829 abortions performed at military facilities in 
1980 and 88 in 1980 after congress passed the prohibition

regulations in the handling of this matter the air force said in

here is a transcript of the keynote address as 
delivered by texas treasurer ann richards at the democratic 
national convention monday night 
good evening ladies and gentlemen 
buenas noches mis amigos 
i am delighted to be here with you this evening because after 
listening to george bush all these years i figured you needed to 
know what a real texas accent sounds like 
twelve years ago barbara jordan another texas woman made the 
keynote address to this convention and two women in 160 years is 
about par for the course 
but if you give us a chance we can perform 
after all ginger rogers did everything that fred astaire did 
she just did it backwards and in high heels 
i want to announce to this nation that in a little more than 100 
days the 
reaganmeesedeavernofzigerpoindexternorthweinbergerwattgorsuchlavellest 
ockmanhaigborknoriegageorge bush will be over 
you know tonight i feel a little like i did when i played 
basketball in the eighth grade i thought i looked real cute in my 
uniform and then i heard a boy yell from the bleachers make that 
basket bird legs 
my greatest fear is that same guy is somewhere in the audience 
tonight and hes going to cut me down to size 
where i grew up there really wasnt much tolerance for 
selfimportance people who put on airs 
i was born during the depression in a little community just 
outside waco and i grew up listening to franklin roosevelt on the 
radio 
well it was back then that i came to understand the small 
truths and hardships that bind neighbors together 
those were real people with real problems 
and they had real dreams about getting out of the depression 
i can remember summer nights when wed put down what we called a 
baptist pallet and we listened to the grownups talk 
i can still hear the sound of the dominoes clicking on the 
marble slab my daddy found for a tabletop 
i can still hear the laughter of the men telling jokes you 
werent supposed to hear telling about how big that old buck deer 
was laughing about mama putting clorox in the well when the frog 
fell in 
they talked about war and washington and what this country 
needed 
they talked straight talk 
and it came from people living their lives as best they could 
and thats what were going to do tonight 
were going to tell how the cow ate the cabbage 
i got a letter last week from a young mother in lorena texas 
and i want to read a part of it to you 
she writes our worries go from pay day to pay day just 
like millions of others and we have two fairly decent incomes but 
i worry about how im going to pay the rising car insurance and 
food

i pray my kids dont have a growth spurt from august to 
december so i dont have to buy new jeans we buy clothes at the 
budget stores and we have them fray and fade and stretch in the 
first wash 
we ponder and try to figure out how were going to pay for 
college and braces and tennis shoes we dont take vacations and 
we dont go out go out to eat 
please dont think me ungrateful we have jobs and a nice 
place to live and were healthy 
were the people you see every day in the grocery store we 
obey the laws we pay our taxes we fly our flags on holidays 
and we plod along trying to make it better for ourselves and 
our children and our parents we arent vocal anymore i think 
maybe were too tired 
i believe that people like us are forgotten in america 
well of course you believe youre forgotten because you have 
been 
this republican administration treats us as if we were pieces of 
a puzzle that cant fit together 
theyve tried to put us into compartments and separate us from 
each other 
their political theory is divide and conquer 
theyve suggested time and time again that what is of interest 
to one group of americans is not of interest to anyone else weve 
been isolated weve been lumped into that sad phraseology called 
special interests 
theyve told farmers that they were selfish that they would 
drive up food prices if they asked the government to intervene on 
behalf of the family farm and we watched farms go on the auction 
block while we bought food from foreign countries well thats 
wrong 
they told working mothers its all their fault that families are 
falling apart because they had to go to work to keep their kids 
in jeans tennis shoes and college and theyre wrong 
they told american labor they were trying to ruin free 
enterprise by asking for 60 days notice of plant closings and 
theyre wrong 
and they told the auto industry and the steel industry and the 
timber industry and the oil industry companies being threatened 
by foreign products flooding this country that youre 
protectionist if you think the government should enforce our trade 
laws and theyre wrong 
when they belittle us for demanding clean air and clean water 
for trying to save the oceans or the ozone layer thats wrong 
no wonder we feel isolated and confused we want answers and 
their answer is that something is wrong with you 
well nothings wrong with you nothings wrong with you that 
you cant fix in november 
weve been told weve been told that the interests of the 
south and the southwest are not the same interests as the north and 
the northeast 
they pit one group against the other theyve divided this 
country and in our isolation we think government isnt going to 
help us and that were alone in our feelings we feel forgotten

well the fact is that we are not an isolated piece of their 
puzzle 
we are one nation we are the united states of america 
now we democrats believe that america is still the country of 
fair play that we can come out of a small town or a poor 
neighborhood and have the same chance as anyone else and it doesnt 
matter whether we are black or hispanic or disabled or a woman 
we believe that america is a country where small business owners 
must succeed because they are the bedrock backbone of our economy 
we believe that our kids deserve good day care and public 
schools we believe our kids deserve public schools where students 
can learn and teachers can teach 
we want to believe that our parents will have a good retirement 
and that we will too 
we democrats believe that social security is a pact that cannot 
be broken we want to believe that we can live out our lives 
without the terrible fear that an illness is going to bankrupt us 
and our children 
we democrats believe that america can overcome any problem 
including the dreaded disease called aids 
we believe that america is still a country where there is more 
to life than just a constant struggle for money 
and we believe that america must have leaders who show us that 
our struggles amount to something and contribute to something 
larger leaders who want us to be all that we can be 
we want leaders like jesse jackson 
jesse jackson is a leader and a teacher who can open our hearts 
and open our minds and stir our very souls 
and he has taught us that we are as good as our capacity for 
caring caring about the drug problem caring about crime caring 
about education and caring about each other 
now in contrast the greatest nation of the free world has had 
a leader for eight straight years that has pretended that he cannot 
hear our questions over the noise of the helicopter 
and we know he doesnt want to answer but we have a lot of 
questions and when we get our questions asked or theres a leak 
or an investigation the only answer we get is i dont know 
or i forgot 
but you wouldnt accept that answer from your children i 
wouldnt dont tell me you dont know or you forgot 
were not going to have the america that we want until we elect 
leaders who are going to tell the truth not most days but every 
day leaders who dont forget what they dont want to remember 
and for eight straight years george bush hasnt displayed the 
slightest interest in anything we care about 
and now that hes after a job that he cant get appointed to 
hes like columbus discovering america hes found child care hes 
found education 
poor george he cant help it he was born with a silver foot 
in his mouth 
well no wonder no wonder we cant figure it out because the 
leadership of this nation is telling us one thing on tv and doing 
something entirely different

they tell us they tell us that theyre fighting a war against 
terrorists and then we find that the white house is selling arms 
to the ayatollah 
they tell us that theyre fighting a war on drugs then people 
come on tv and testify that the cia and the dea and the fbi knew 
they were flying drugs into america all along and theyre 
negotiating with a dictator who is shoveling cocaine into this 
country like crazy i guess thats their central american strategy 
now they tell us that employment rates are great and that 
theyre for equal opportunity but we know it takes two paychecks 
to make ends meet today when it used to take one and the 
opportunity theyre so proud of is lowwage deadend jobs 
and there is no major city in america where you cannot see 
homeless men sitting in parking lots holding signs that say i 
will work for food 
now my friends we really are at a crucial point in american 
history under this administration we have devoted our resources 
to making this country a military colossus but weve let our 
economic lines of defense fall into disrepair 
the debt of this nation is greater than it has ever been in our 
history we fought a world war on less debt than the republicans 
have built up in the last eight years 
you know its kind of like that brotherinlaw who drives a 
flashy new car but hes always borrowing money from you to make the 
payments 
lets take what they are proudest of that is their stand on 
defense we democrats are committed to a strong america and quite 
frankly when our leaders say to us we need a new weapons system 
our inclination is to say well they must be right 
but when we pay billions for planes that wont fly billions for 
tanks that wont fire and billions for systems that wont work 
that old dog wont hunt 
and you dont have to be from waco to know that when the 
pentagon makes crooks rich and doesnt make america strong that 
its a bum deal 
now im going to tell you im really glad that our young 
people missed the depression and missed the great big war but i 
do regret that they missed the leaders that i knew 
leaders who told us when things were tough and that we would 
have to sacrifice and these difficulties might last awhile 
they didnt tell us things were hard for us because we were 
different or isolated or special interests they brought us 
together and they gave us a sense of national purpose 
they gave us social security and they told us were setting up 
a system where we could pay our own money in and when the time came 
for our retirement we could take the money out 
people in rural areas were told that we deserved to have 
electric lights and they were going to harness the energy that was 
necessary to give us electricity so my grandmama didnt have to 
carry that old coal oil lamp around

and they told us that they were going to guarantee that when we 
put our money in the bank that the money was going to be there 
and it was going to be insured 
they did not lie to us 
and i think one of the saving graces of democrats is that we are 
candid we talk straight talk we tell people what we think 
and that tradition and those values live today in michael 
dukakis from massachusetts 
michael dukakis knows that this country is on the edge of a 
great new era that were not afraid of change that were for 
thoughtful truthful strong leadership 
behind his calm theres an impatience to unify this country and 
get on with the future 
his instincts are deeply american theyre tough and theyre 
generous and personally i have to tell you that i have never met 
a man who had a more remarkable sense about what is really 
important in life 
and then theres my friend and my teacher for many years sen 
lloyd bentsen 
and i couldnt be prouder both as a texan and as a democrat 
because lloyd bentsen understands america from the barrio to the 
boardroom he knows how to bring us together by regions by 
economics by example 
and hes already beaten george bush once 
so when it comes right down to it this election is a contest 
between those who are satisfied with what they have and those who 
know we can do better 
thats what this election is really all about 
its about the american dream those who want to keep it for the 
few and those of us who know it must be nurtured and passed along 
im a grandmother now and i have one nearly perfect 
granddaughter named lily and when i hold that grandbaby i feel 
the continuity of life that unites us that binds generation to 
generation that ties us with each other 
and sometimes i spread that baptist pallet out on the floor and 
lily and i roll a ball back and forth 
and i think of all the families like mine like the one in 
lorena texas like the ones that nurture children all across 
america 
and as i look at lily i know that it is within families that we 
learn both the need to respect individual human dignity and to work 
together for our common good within our families within our 
nation it is the same 
as we sit there i wonder if shell ever grasp the changes ive 
seen in my life if shell ever believe that there was a time when 
blacks could not drink from public water fountains when hispanic 
children were punished for speaking spanish in the public schools 
and women couldnt vote 
i think of all the political fights ive fought and all the 
compromises ive had to accept as part payment 
and i think of all the small victories that have added up to 
national triumphs and all the things that never would have 
happened and all the people who would have been left behind if we 
had not reasoned and fought and won those battles together

and i will tell lily that those triumphs were democratic party 
triumphs 
i want so much to tell lily how far weve come you and i 
and as the ball rolls back and forth i want to tell her how 
very lucky she is that for all our difference were still the 
greatest nation on this good earth 
and our strength lies in the men and women who go to work every 
day who struggle to balance their family and their jobs and who 
should never ever be forgotten 
i just hope that like her grandparents and her 
greatgrandparents before that lily goes on to raise her kids 
with the promise that echoes in homes all across america 
that we can do better 
and thats what this election is all about 
thank you very much

here is a transcript of the speech by former 
president jimmy carter to the democratic national convention monday 
night 
when we left washington 7 years ago i invited all my 
democratic friends to come to georgia to see us but i never 
expected that you would all come and at the same time 
well this is a grand gathering of democrats but theres going 
to be an even greater one in january when we all meet in washington 
to celebrate the inauguration of michael dukakis as president and 
lloyd bentsen as vice president 
oh yes i almost forgot i have one announcement to make 
which like a lot of other things this year may come as a bit of a 
surprise to the incumbent vice president my name is jimmy carter 
and i am not running for president did you hear that george 
well i have to admit there are some parallels with both of our 
final candidates im a southerner im a baptist some people even 
like to say i love to preach and my political career was made 
possible by the civil rights movement that does sound familiar 
there have been a lot of comparisons made between mike dukakis 
and myself but i know one thing for sure mike dukakis is also 
going from the state house to the white house 
our party has been blessed with good candidates this year and 
not just this year wouldnt ed muskie have made a great president 
jesse jackson has stirred the soul of our country hes given 
hope to millions and hes healed wounds that have too long divided 
us one from another he is an inspired leader he is destined for 
further greatness jesse we salute you 
mike dukakis ran a brilliant campaign of substance and respect 
for the intelligence of the american people hell be a great 
leader for our country 
mike is being compared to john f kennedy he is from 
massachusetts he has chosen a running mate from texas and hes 
going to defeat an incumbent republican vice president 
mike dukakis deserves that comparison but he reminds me of 
other great leaders of our party as well like woodrow wilson hes 
an idealist who believes we can be true to our own best selves in a 
brutal world 
like harry truman hes a tough fighter 
like franklin delano roosevelt hes an innovator with the 
courage to experiment and the confidence to find solutions 
and lets be clear about one thing 
we want mike dukakis and lloyd bentsen to be elected not just 
so democrats can take office in washington but because we know 
that change is long overdue we want a federal deficit brought 
under control we want a coherent foreign policy and we want to 
bring back to washington people who are more interested in public 
service than they are in private gain

each of us pauses on occasion to reassess our own lives to look 
at what we have become the mistakes weve made and to decide what 
we would like to be 
i think as a nation we make this same kind of reassessment 
when we elect a president now is the time to reconsider our 
opportunities and our challenges to make a change and to decide 
what we want for the future especially to decide what we want for 
the future 
a democracy is always an unfinished creation each generation 
must rediscover the meaning of americas dream 
tonight im thinking not only about the next president but 
about our nations children and how they will live in years to 
come rosalynn and i have six grandchildren what kind of world 
will we leave to them and to other young people 
in thinking about the past eight years and looking ahead lets 
recall the words of a great american president franklin roosevelt 
listen to what he said 
governments can err presidents do make mistakes butbetter 
the occasional faults of a government that lives in a spirit of 
charity than the consistent omissions of a government frozen in the 
ice of its own indifference 
for the sake of our children for the sake of our future we 
must melt that ice 
its time to reach out for the homeless to families broken by 
drug addiction and disease 
its time to clean up those pentagon scandals and build a lean 
tough competent military force 
its time to have a justice department that fights for civil 
rights 
its time to quit living on credit and expecting our children to 
pay the bills some day 
its time to tackle the continuing problems of poverty of a 
decaying environment of the bankruptcy of family farms 
and its time to invest in the education and care of our 
children 
because thats the kind of nation we are thats the kind of 
people we are 
in some ways america is a big family a family does not ignore 
the sickness or pain of any of its children a family gives all its 
members help and love that is the kind of families we have and 
thats the kind of nation we want 
and a good family plans for its childrens future and that 
means education eight years ago no american student was deprived 
of a college education because of financial reasons but now for 
many young americans these opportunities have been wiped out 
starting in 1989 that is going to change 
we democrats do not fear change we welcome it because change 
means hope change means life above all change means opportunity 
and no changes are more profound than those taking place in the 
soviet union the world is fascinated with the news from moscow 
general secretary gorbachev has made move after move that would 
have seemed unthinkable a decade ago

<TEXT>
it is still too early to assess the permanence or sincerity of 
these changes we must never forget that mr gorbachevs actions 
are designed to help his own country not ours certainly the 
competition between our superpowers will remain but it can become 
more peaceful and more constructive and in that kind of 
competition the united states of america has all the advantages 
we have a free and creative system of government we are strong 
economically our farm lands are highly productive we espouse 
basic human freedoms and democracy we are a religious people we 
are on the cutting edge of technological and scientific progress 
our neighbors are our friends and not our slaves 
building on these foundations our next president must regain 
americas world leadership as the acknowledged champion of peace 
of arms control of human rights and of justice 
the free world looks to us for leadership but we cannot lead by 
using military force to impose our will on other people we can 
best fight communism in central america by joining with other 
democratic nations to make sure that the sandinistas and the 
contras carry out all the provisions of the arias peace plan and 
that the people of central america have freedom from both 
oppression and war 
we have other responsibilities far from home 
camp david is not just a weekend retreat it is a symbol of the 
courage and determination of two great leaders an egyptian and an 
israeli to make peace arabs and jews still cry out for peace 
but without a strong and persistent involvement of the president of 
the united states they will not have peace starting in 1989 that 
will change 
its time to renew our environmental commitments the greenhouse 
effect the destruction of the ozone layer acid rain are no longer 
just theoretical possibilities they are immediate threats to all 
of us beginning in 1989 a new democratic president will work 
other leaders on earth to ensure our children and to ensure us a 
decent planet on which to live 
this nation deserves a foreign policy based on the values that 
unite us as americans a foreign policy that can win the support 
for a change of both political parties the consequences of 
unilateral decisions made in the white house bring back to us vivid 
and unpleasant memories us marines dying in lebanon harbors 
illegally mined and contras illegally armed ransom paid to the 
ayatollah in weapons appeasement in the face of apartheid in south 
africa 
starting in 1989 that is also going to change 
ours is the strongest nation on earth but sometimes we forget 
what measures our strength america is strong when we are for peace 
instead of belligerence america is strong when we are the leading 
defender of human rights america is strong when we reach out to 
the suffering america is strong when we work with other nations to 
reduce nuclear arsenals and to curtail the worlds horrendous trade 
in deadly weapons america is strong when we protect the green 
planet that gives us life 
my fellow democrats our party is best equipped to meet the 
challenge of change because we are the party of change 
we are the party of diversity just look around this hall 
youll see all the beautiful variety that makes america strong and 
special and great 
because we are so inclusive many of the conflicts of american 
life are fought and creatively resolved within our ranks 
that is our strength but it is also our danger 
that is why if i had to give you just one special message 
tonight i would summarize it in a single word 
unity 
one more time one more time so you wont forget unity 
let us go forth from this convention united behind our 
candidates and our ideals and with our eyes on the prize 
united united we democrats will bring a great future to 
america 
our grandchildren and yours will be grateful 
thank you god bless you good night on to victory thank you

from tripledigit inflation to a crushing 
104 billion foreign debt presidentelect carlos salinas de 
gortari faces a series of challenges that would have made some of 
his 60 predecessors wince 
horrendous unemployment a ballooning population and growing 
discontent with the political party that has run mexico since 1929 
further threaten to make salinas inaugural term something less 
than a picnic in the park 
by the time salinas leaves office in six years mexicos 
population is expected to have grown by about 10 million to 91 
million all crammed in an area three times the size of texas 
unless he can reverse the trends that growth will mean more 
people for fewer jobs 
with about half the current population under age 16 it is 
estimated that by the time salinas term ends about 1 million 
young people a year will be looking for work for the first time 
a recent study by the national manufacturers chamber showed that 
only 350000 jobs were created last year a drop from the previous 
year 
another study by salinas institutional revolutionary party 
said roughly 28 percent of mexicos labor force of 47 million 
people lack steady jobs and 14 percent are jobless a total of 42 
percent 
inflation which reached a 1592 percent annual rate last year 
has eroded the average purchasing power of wages by more than half 
salinas says one of his priorities will be to restore the value 
of earnings 
we will have to provide that and also housing education 
health care and other basic services not only to cut deficits 
but also for the 6 million new jobseekers who will emerge during 
his administration salinas said in a recent interview with the 
television network televisa 
if foreign debt payments become too burdensome they will be 
renegotiated or suspended altogether he added 
a survey by the governing party think tank the institute of 
political economic and social studies indicates that gross fixed 
investment has been dropping by an annual average of nearly 5 
percent with a drop of 12 percent in 1986 
for decades illegal emigration of millions of mexicans to the 
united states acted as an escape valve for the population problem 
but a 1987 law in the united states that fines employers who 
knowingly hire illegal aliens could shut or narrow the aperture 
as budget and planning secretary for five years in outgoing 
president miguel de la madrids administration salinas was 
associated with belttightening and other unpopular measures 
both the governing partys labor wing and its old guard strongly 
opposed his nomination so salinas is now busy trying to mend 
fences especially with fidel velazquez the 88yearold leader of 
the mexican labor federation 
the centrist institutional revolutionary party or pri has won 
every major election since it was founded in 1929 its critics 
claim it often resorts to ballot fraud 
charges of vote fraud were louder than ever this year as the 
government delayed release of results until a week after the july 6 
balloting and then said salinas won with just over 50 percent of 
the vote 20 percent less than previous pri presidential victories 
the pris patronage system still goes deep into the countrys 
grass roots but its power base has been eroding under pressure 
from growing forces on both the left and right 
many say the party has been unable or unwilling to meet 
mexicos increasingly greater demands for more orderly government 
less corruption greater economic development and more efficient 
state services 
the disillusionment cuts across social and political lines 
people are clamoring against everything from a selfmuzzled press 
to deficient law enforcement to lack of environmental protection to 
neglect for womens rights 
the conservative national action party and the leftist coalition 
national democratic front have been addressing these issues and 
picking up votes 
for the first time in decades the governing partys 
presidential candidate actually had to campaign on the basis of 
concrete solutions to specific issues from smog in mexico city to 
the drug problem to a growing crime rate 
salinas acknowledges these challenges saying reforms and 
modernization will be the priorities of his administration 
hell begin trying on dec 1 the date he officially takes 
office

the 50th anniversary celebration of 
the war of the worlds broadcast orson welles radio play about 
an alien invasion that terrified america was launched with 
martian punch and a song 
welles and his mercury theater created a sensation the night of 
oct 30 1938 with their broadcast based on hg wells tale of a 
martian invasion of earth despite disclaimers it was fictitious 
the realisticsounding broadcast on cbs created a nationwide panic 
the invasion began at grovers mill chosen at random by 
scriptwriter howard koch and residents of the hamlet in west 
windsor township near princeton have been reminded annually of its 
dubious place in radio history 
in the coming months the group organizing the celebration hopes 
to remind the world of the broadcast heard by an estimated 6 
million people and the role it played in redefining radios power 
the fiftieth anniversary commemorative committee for war of the 
worlds inc began the festivities monday with the debut of over 
the airwaves the ballad of grovers mill 
the song written locally opens with a brief excerpt from the 
halloween broadcast then relates the blurring of the line between 
reality and fantasy that brought panic in the streets 
on the other side of grovers mill theres a pond where the 
water glows what landed on that jersey site im sure nobody 
knows four women in leotards sang as reporters listened 
the song is to be released to radio stations around the country 
this week and will be the subject of a music video according to 
the committee 
participants were offered martian punch an eerie green 
concoction of vodka fruit juices and liqueur with melon balls 
bobbing on top 
committee chairman douglas forrester who was born 15 years 
after the broadcast said he used to hear only secondhand accounts 
of the terror the show evoked but says people are finally 
fessing up to being scared as word of his groups work gets out 
i think one of the acid tests of our credibility is we are 
finally getting firstperson accounts from people who had the 
bejabbers scared out of them said forrester director of 
pensions for new jersey and a former mayor of west windsor 
according to news accounts of the 38 panic thousands of people 
headed for the hills causing massive traffic jams and panicked 
listeners jammed phone lines to police in grovers mill farmers 
unfamiliar with local landmarks fired buckshot into a water tower 
believing it was a giant martian war machine 
forrester said a man who was on a hunting trip in upstate new 
york when war of the worlds was broadcast said some members of 
his hunting party grabbed their guns and headed home to fight the 
martians others deciding it was too late to save their families 
headed for the canadian border 
by oct 30s closing ceremonies the committee plans to have 
installed a bronze relief at the site of the martian landing 
depicting welles the martians and an american family huddled 
around a radio 
the sculpture is being funded with a 15000 state grant 
the group plans to sell souveniers including buttons and bumper 
stickers warning the martians are coming again forrester said 
also planned is a dinner to raise money for the commemorative 
effort the restoration of the pond at the landing site and a 
scholarship fund named for scriptwriter koch who lives in 
woodstock ny

stock prices took the largest drop of the year 
tuesday on the tokyo stock exchange and the dollar also dropped 
sharply against the japanese yen 
the nikkei stock average of 225 selected issues which lost 
25167 points monday took another major drop of 51309 points or 
189 percent tuesday closing at 2714903 
it was the largest oneday decline of the index since december 
26 1987 when the index fell 58750 points 
in the foreign exchange market the us currency a 175 yen 
winner monday closed at 13385 yen down 130 yen from mondays 
close 
after opening at 13430 yen the currency moved in a range of 
1337013438 yen 
the last time the nikkei average posted such a sharp drop was on 
dec 26 when it had a 58750point decline for the entire session 
stock brokers attributed the sharp decline in the key market 
barometer to drops in steel shares following an overnight fall in 
new york 
they also noted that oil prices rose sharply in overseas markets 
because irans announcement that it would accept a united nations 
call for a ceasefire in its nearly 8yearold war with iraq 
steel shares which had been propping up the market could not 
hold their position any more and finally went down today tuesday 
and that put the entire market on a decline said kiichi nishida 
of kidder peabody in tokyo but shares directly related to the 
gulf situation have not moved too much so far 
another broker at a major japanese securities firm said the 
market has entered a transitional period 
on todays tuesday market a 500point drop is within the 
range of adjustment he said speaking on condition of anonymity 
from here investors will find other shares which they can depend 
on in place of steel shares heavy electronic shares are likely to 
be a new target 
on the foreign exchange market the dollar opened lower and 
continued declining against the yen throughout the morning session 
the dollar which was up by 175 yen on monday opened at 13469 
yen down from mondays 13515 yen and traded mainly in the 13395 
yen to 13438 yen range during the morning session 
currency dealers said the dollar declined mainly because of 
early morning speculation on whether the bank of japan would 
intervene in the market and sell dollars 
the speculation lead to a onesided selling of the dollar 
said a exchange dealer at a major us bank in tokyo speaking on 
condition of anonymity and the situation in new york also helped 
the dollar go down further

a controversial 
hardliner in the guerrilla war against nicaraguas leftist 
government has become the first military man to win a key role in 
the rebel leadership 
col enrique bermudez who survived an ouster attempt in april 
joins a sevenmember contra directorate that oversees the 
usbacked insurgency against the sandinista government 
the 56yearold professional soldier a former colonel in the 
nicaraguan national guard under exdictator anastasio somoza was 
elected by a 442 vote monday by an assembly of rebel delegates 
meeting here 
three of the 54 assembly members abstained and five were absent 
when the vote was taken on the second day of the assemblys 
threeday meeting in this caribbean capital 
bermudez ran unopposed as an independent candidate for a 
oneyear term on the directorate which sets overall policy for the 
nicaraguan resistance 
he pledged to unify the exiled movement which has been split by 
infighting and has struggled to stay financially afloat since 
congress halted military aid in february 
today more than ever i offer my spirit and goodwill to 
strengthen our movement bermudez said to our marxistleninist 
enemy we promise a hard battle 
the contras have been fighting a sevenyear war to overthrow the 
government of nicaraguas president daniel ortega 
bermudez insisted he would confine himself to military affairs 
although all seven directors have equal power under assembly 
rules senior director adolfo calero had been widely regarded as 
the movements de facto political head 
calero was reelected with 36 votes to 16 for his conservative 
rival fernando aguero rocha with two abstentions there had been 
some speculation that he could lose his seat in a power struggle 
with bermudez 
calero 56 said he expected bermudez to confine himself to 
military matters and said he was satisfied with the election 
results 
bermudez position was strengthened with the defeat monday night 
of incumbent director pedro joaquin chamorro who lost his seat by 
a 3120 vote with three abstentions to wilfredo montalvan 42 
chamorro and calero tried but failed to strip bermudez of his 
military command in april when bermudez fired six regional contra 
commanders for mutiny 
chamorro said talk of making bermudez a defense minister for the 
directorate was a mask for the military chiefs ambition to 
gain absolute control of the movement 
i dont think he has total control yet but that is clearly 
his intention chamorro said after the election 
bermudez closest ally on the directorate aristides sanchez 
was reelected along with alfredo cesar who has supported the 
military leaders candidacy 
the other newly elected directors were roberto ferrey replacing 
his sister azucena who decided not to seek reelection and 
wycliffe diego who fills a vacant seat representing the atlantic 
coast miskito indians and creoles

rebels fired rockets into the afghan capital of 
kabul this morning and one missile blast killed eight people and 
wounded nine the soviet news agency tass reported from afghanistan 
it was the second reported bombardment of kabul in five days 
tass said rockets rained down on city streets and crossroads as

rocket that exploded in the citys khairkhan district it said 
on friday 21 rockets were fired into residential areas of 
kabul killing 20 people wounding 34 and damaging a mosque and 
other buildings tass reported 
it blamed the attacks on insurgents fighting the moscowbacked 
government of president najib 
but abdul haq a rebel leader in peshawar pakistan denied that 
guerrillas target civilian neighborhoods and said the soviets 
themselves might have staged the bombardment to sap support for the 
rebels 
the soviets began withdrawing their more than 100000 troops 
from afghanistan on may 15 under terms of unbrokered accords 
all are to be home by february 
both afghan and soviet media have said the guerrillas are

a conservative christian group 
says it jammed telephone lines at universal pictures to protest 
the last temptation of christ while another organization hopes 
to raise 10 million to buy the fictional film of jesus life and 
destroy it 
universal received about 10000 telephone calls monday in 
response to a drive to flood the studio with messages seeking to 
stop the distribution of the movie said donald e wildmon 
executive director of the american family association 
there was no independent way to confirm wildmons statement but 
the main number for mca inc the parent company of universal 
pictures remained busy throughout monday a call to the 
switchboard normally goes through 
i know that god protects his own reputation but i feel its 
the duty of christians to speak out said leonard smith a 
sacramento machinist affiliated with the church of the nazarene an 
evangelical denomination 
smith said he feared moviegoers might see the films message as 
a christian one even though director martin scorsese has 
emphasized the movie is fictional and not based on the bible other 
scorsese films include taxi driver and raging bull 
the film based on the 1955 novel of the same name by nikos 
kazantzakis depicts a speculative last temptation of a dying jesus 
christ who hallucinates that he abandons his godliness to live as 
a man and make love to mary magdalene 
those who have seen a rough cut of the movie said christ then 
decides to reject the temptation and fulfill his destiny as 
redeemer by dying on the cross 
christian leaders who viewed the film are divided about its 
meaning while conservative groups who refused to attend a 
screening condemned it outright the movie will be codistributed 
by universal and cineplex odeon films 
a spokesman for universal refused monday to comment on a 
demonstration held saturday at the studio gates and another planned 
for wednesday at the home of universal chairman lew wasserman 
opponents of this film are calling for its destruction this 
is censorship the studio said in a statement people have a 
right to choose for themselves whether or not to see this movie and 
form their own opinions about it 
the move stars willem dafoe as jesus barbara hershey as mary 
magdalene and harvey keitel as judas iscariot 
universal will proceed with plans to distribute the movie in 
september the studio spokesman said 
an offer to buy the film for 10 million and destroy it was made 
by the san bernardinobased campus crusade for christ 
the organization which spreads the christian gospel on college 
and universities worldwide said it did not have the money on hand 
but would gather it through fundraising 
i anticipate that the money will be provided by concerned 
individuals across america who will pool their resources in order 
to cover your costs evangelist bill bright said in a letter sent 
late friday to wasserman 
dr brights rationale for the letter is in the sprit of 
christian love and forgiveness he has offered to help pay for 
universals decision to make a film that demeans jesus campus 
crusade spokesman don beehler said monday

canada is restoring diplomatic ties with iran that 
were severed when canadian embassy officials spirited six american 
diplomats out of tehran in 1980 
the canadian government said monday it decided to revive 
relations after iran dropped a demand that it apologize for 
smuggling the americans out of iran 
there were no conditions there was no apology a foreign 
ministry official told a news conference the official spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
the agreement was reached before irans announcement monday that 
it would accept a un security council resolution for a ceasefire 
in its 8yearold war with iraq 
canada closed its embassy in tehran after ambassador ken taylor 
sheltered the americans and then spirited them out of iran during 
the hostage crisis at the us embassy that began in november 1979 
since 1980 canada maintained diplomatic contact through the 
danish embassy in tehran while the iranian government was 
represented by a charge daffaires in ottawa 
under an agreement reached in tehran last week ambassadors will 
be exchanged and a canadian embassy reopened by october officials 
said 
in a formal statement both governments said restoration of full 
diplomatic relations will lead to increased exchanges in all 
fields to the mutual benefit of canada and the islamic republic of 
iran 
foreign minister joe clark said sunday that moves to improve 
diplomatic ties did not mean canada was endorsing the present 
iranian government 
but they are a significant country significant force in 
international events and it would be useful we think on the 
appropriate terms to have normal relations clark said 
he said talks on restoring relations began about a month ago as 
iran resumed normal ties with france and increased contacts with 
britain 
irans parliament speaker hashemi rafsanjani said this month 
that iran would try to cultivate better international relations 
despite the eightyear diplomatic chill canada and iran have 
remained trade partners and exchanged goods worth 228 million in 
1987 including 83 million in canadian wheat 
more than 3000 iranians received immigrant visas for canada in 
1987

consumer prices jumped 19 percent in the past 
year the government announced today acknowledging the biggest 
such rise since china introduced market reforms a decade ago 
zhang zhongji a spokesman for the state statistics bureau 
blamed the economys inability to satisfy consumer demand for the 
rise but he said middlemen who hoard goods and control their 
distribution also are responsible 
zhang also told a news conference that grain production 
stagnant for the past two years is not expected to improve this 
year 
he said workers in chinas 32 major cities including beijing 
shanghai and wuhan were hardest hit by inflation and that food 
prices increased the most 
prices last month were 19 percent higher than those of june 
1987 he said but chinese economists do not consider that the 
countrys inflation rate which they calculate differently than in 
the west 
in china the annual inflation rate is calculated by averaging 
price increases over 12 months rather than measuring the gap 
between prices from a given date to the same date 12 months later 
using this system zhang said consumer prices during the first 
six months of this year were an average of 13 percent higher than 
during the first six months of last year this is what the 
government considers the inflation rate 
china says inflation was 72 percent last year and 11 percent in 
the first quarter of 1988 
china has not previously released an inflation figure calculated 
by the western method as is the 19 percent figure so this could 
not be compared against last year 
zhang said food prices during the sixmonth period were an 
average of 169 percent higher than in the same period last year 
and clothing prices were up about 10 percent 
prices in chinas 32 major cities were an average of 144 
percent higher than in the first six months of 1987 but were 19 
percent higher in canton and 20 percent higher in hefei 
in major cities zhang said wages of onefifth of the 
population have failed to keep pace with inflation leading to a 
decline in living standards 
zhang did not link the high inflation to the nations 11 percent 
economic growth rate during the first half of the year and its 172 
percent industrial growth rate 
some chinese economists believe this pace of growth is fueling 
inflation by creating too high demand for raw materials 
transportation and energy 
inflation is one of chinas biggest economic problems under the 
reform program introduced in 1978 by senior leader deng xiaoping 
china is moving away from a system where the state sets prices and 
is allowing the market to determine prices 
a twotier price system has developed with key items such as 
grain and pork sold both in state stores at artificially low prices 
and on the free market at prices set by supply and demand prices 
of many other goods such as fruit are completely decontrolled

small arms ammunition which poses no threat to shipping said 
coast guard chief petty officer ken freeze 
the explosions also were seen by those on board the lovely 
martha a salmon fishing boat pete giddings a kgotv weatherman 
who was aboard the boat said all of a sudden i saw a puff of 
smoke eleven seconds later we heard the first explosion four 
or five seconds later we heard the second explosion 
the coast guard closed the golden gate to ships for about half 
an hour after the explosions while two navy helicopters and two 
coast guard choppers joined the blackhaw two smaller coast guard 
vessels and the northern lights in the search 
the helicopter which was conducting a routine mine 
countermeasure exercise was attached to mine countermeasures 
squadron 15 based at alameda naval air station on the eastern 
shore of san francisco bay said navy spokeswoman virginia felker 
the mh53e sea dragon along with its sister aircraft the 
ch53e super stallion is the largest helicopter in the west navy 
officials said the helicopter is 99 feet long with the rotors 
turning weighs 73500 pounds and can travel at 150 knots the 
minesweeping version the mh53e has a larger fuel capacity than 
the ch53 allowing it to fly farther and faster

la repubblica national liberal 
the struggle between jesse and the duke seemed a little 
tactical and artificial until yesterday today what seems 
artificial is the sudden agreement among a new trio lloyd 
bentsen conservative michael dukakis liberal but moderate 
jesse jackson leftist radical 
the truth is that in the democratic party as in any other 
party in the world there are at least three tendencies they are 
divided and different but they must fight together to defeat the 
republicans and george bush for the run to the white house 
corriere della sera of milan conservative behind jacksons 
intemperances and behind his rhetorical speeches there was a 
calculation power for himself and for the blacks that in this 
convention are represented by a fourth of the delegates 
not all the blacks are supporting jackson but they are all 
looking for the confirmation of a national political power that 
they should get through their influence though this power does not 
exist yet 
il messaggero of rome 
dukakis and jackson recognized that they need reciprocal 
support but they did not announce the stipulation of a solid 
agreement 
dukakis does not like the jacksonstyle which fascinates 
crowds and which is more similar to a demagogue than to a 
professional of politics and jackson does not like the coldhearted 
dukakis who seems more a manager than a leader 
</TEXT>

the herald government 
mr dukakis problems with rev jesse jacksons camp were 
being sorted out last night the leader of the rainbow coalition 
had every reason to feel angry with mr dukakis for not personally 
informing him in advance of the press of his choice of lloyd 
bentsen as running mate 
mr jackson has a large share of democratic voters behind him 
some 20 percent of them their voters may make or break the 
democratic candidate however in agreeing to make up mr jackson 
shrewd as he is is likely to exact a price from mr dukakis for 
his endorsement 
the prize could be a package part of which may have to do with 
punitive sanctions against the racist south african regime the two 
democrats are both agreed anyway that more should be done by 
america to bring about an end to apartheid their differences may 
be in how to go about it mr jacksons recipes can only be 
described as radical 
by the same token mr dukakis promise not only to intiate 
american sanctions upon his election but also to drag mrs margaret 
thatcher into doing the same is certainly sending alarming signals 
to the british conservatives 
britain cannot afford to stand up to america on sanctions 
against south africa 
it is for that reason that mrs thatcher should be working 
hard to modify her stance on sanctions she can be counted upon to 
do something dramatic to pull the carpet from under mr dukakis 
feet 
the most likely action she could take is to start a south 
african initiative of her own

french newspapers reported prominently today on the agreement 
between dukakis and jackson to work together in this falls us 
presidential campaign 
in a sidebar headlined a high mass tailored for the small 
screen the leftist morning daily liberation explained the 
extensive efforts being made to accommodate television coverage in 
the scheduling of events and the color scheme of the convention 
hall in atlanta 
the newspapers correspondent also noted the provisions made for 
the press covering the events including aspirin tablets and 
assurances that the reporters committee for freedom of the press 
would help any journalists arrested while covering demonstrations

it was cash cold and hard and it 
nearly got tossed out in the trash all 15122 of it 
the money has been stashed in three freezers wrapped in white 
butcher paper packages labeled cold compresses by a woman who 
died in may 
a volunteer for the salvation army found the money mostly in 
20 50 and 100 bills while sorting through the contents of the 
freezers which had been donated by the womans family 
we had thrown them over on the floor because we couldnt use 
them said salvation army capt charles mccarty said of the 
cold compress packages that money could have very easily 
been thrown in the trash can 
the cash had been stored among the frozen food by sarah bonar 
who died in may at the age of 77 and her husband lyle relatives 
had earlier discovered about 400 in an envelope when an ice cube 
tray was removed 
she had money in three banks and four savings and loans 
said joyce bonar a stepdaughterinlaw so why she would go off 
and put some in the freezer i dont know 
the freezer money was turned in to police who eventually traced 
it back to the bonar family 
we plan to give a reward to the person who found the money 
joyce bonar said and make a contribution to the salvation army 
the balance will go to mrs bonars husband who now lives with 
relatives

a woman who hid her pregnancy from her 
husband had only a short time to decide what to do when she gave 
birth unexpectedly and secretly in a jetliner restroom her lawyer 
said 
in 20 minutes she had to make some decisions not only 
physically how to deliver a baby in a dc10 but how does she 
resolve the dilemma shes created for herself by not telling 
anyone john l williams said monday 
but she never tried to harm the child all she tried to do 
was hide the child the way she tried to conceal the pregnancy he 
added 
williams lawyer for christina locasto of staten island ny 
spoke at a news conference after a juvenile court commissioner 
ruled that her 5dayold daughter would remain in the temporary 
custody of san mateo county 
mrs locasto pleaded innocent last week to a felony charge of 
child endangerment the 24yearold woman who is free on 50000 
bail is accused of abandoning her newborn daughter under the sink 
of the jet restroom on a crosscountry flight 
commissioner patricia bresee decided the infant will stay in a 
foster home at least until friday when county social workers 
present a report on the homes of locasto relatives as to their 
fitness as a home for the baby 
but until then the locastos will be allowed to visit their new 
daughter alyssa frances locasto under county supervision bresee 
ruled 
in making her decision bresee rejected a plea by mrs locastos 
husband louis locasto 26 to grant him custody of the infant 
locastos right to his daughter is not in dispute but the couples 
decision to remain together was one reason for bresees decision 
his lawyer said 
they are determined to remain united as a family unit and have 
their daughter with them as soon as possible attorney vicki 
yeley said 
the locastos and relatives rushed out a back door of the 
courthouse and declined to talk with reporters 
williams said it was still uncertain why his client denied she 
was pregnant to herself as much as others 
the locasto had been having domestic problems at the time alyssa 
was conceived less than a year after the birth of their second 
daughter tina now 18 months old williams said the couple also 
has a 6yearold daughter janine 
mrs locasto denied she was pregnant when her husband asked her 
lawyer said 
once having told a lie of that magnitude it became more 
difficult to tell the truth he said as it became 
progressively more difficult to tell the truth the lie got bigger 
literally and figuratively 
mrs locasto who had not sought medical care was not aware she 
was about to give birth when she her husband and two daughters got 
aboard a united airlines jet in newark nj wednesday for a family 
vacation williams said 
after the birth mrs locasto told her husband she was sick 
williams said the flight crew seeing blood in the restroom 
sealed it during the flight and the newborn was found only after 
the plane landed in san francisco 
the brownhaired blueeyed girl is now in a foster home 
alyssa is fine she is healthy she appears to be a normal 
5dayold infant suffering no ill effects of what occurred 
said gerry hilliard the babys courtappointed lawyer

housing construction partially recovered in 
june rising 51 percent after plummeting 126 percent in may the 
government said today 
the commerce department said the increase the steepest in four 
months pushed construction activity to a seasonally adjusted 
annual rate of 145 million units 
economists had been expecting the upturn because mortgage 
interest rates which climbed steadily through april and may eased 
as much as a quarter of a percentage point in june 
however interest rates began edging up again in july and most 
analysts expect the housing slump to continue through the end of 
the year the sector this year has been one of the weakest in the 
economy which has drawn its strength from exports and manufacture 
of equipment for businesses 
during the first six months of this year builders began work on 
738900 housing units down 109 percent from the same period a 
year earlier 
all of the housing strength in june came in a rebound in the 
construction of singlefamily homes which jumped 102 percent to 
11 million units after falling 89 percent in may and 67 percent 
in april 
apartment construction which has been in the doldrums since the 
new tax law took effect at the start of 1987 fell 82 percent in 
june to 356000 units this followed an even steeper nosedive of 21 
percent in may and a sharp jump of 375 percent in april 
the june rate for buildings with five or more units was 296000 
units the lowest in six years 
housing permits considered a good sign of future construction 
activity rose 37 percent in june following a 09 pecent drop in 
may 
the june increase was led by a 176 percent jump in the 
northeast rebounding from a 226 percent drop in may however in 
the midwest which also suffered a 226 percent decline in may 
housing starts dropped 37 percent in june 
construction activity rose 79 percent in the west and 29 
percent in the south

us park rangers say a vertical scratch has 
been discovered in the vietnam veterans memorial that is deeper 
than scars detected earlier this year 
the latest scratch four inches long and an eighth of inch wide 
does not touch any of the 58156 engraved names the highly 
polished granite wall is so hard that national park service 
officials said the damage only could have been inflicted 
deliberately 
park ranger james lance who served in vietnam in a noncombatant 
role discovered the damage sunday morning but said he was not sure 
when the damage occurred 
officials said vandalism is a difficult security problem for 
rangers and us park police because people routinely touch the 
wall and make rubbings of names 
the memorial is the most popular in washington and has been 
since it opened in 1982 attracting 12000 to 15000 visitors daily 
the problem is the nature of the memorial said jan scruggs 
president of the vietnam veterans memorial fund that jointly 
administers the memorial with the park service 
what makes it successful is the feeling people get from 
touching it from touching the names we would never consider 
covering it with glass to protect it 
sandra alley of the national park service and scruggs said 
they want volunteers to form a memorial watch similar to a 
neighborhood watch to assist us park police in patrolling at 
night

about 2000 arab americans have moved out of 
the occupied territories because the palestinian uprising has 
threatened their safety and the education of their children a us 
official said today 
us consulate spokesman david good said the 2000 arab 
americans represent about onequarter of those who lived in the 
west bank and east jerusalem before the uprising began dec 8 
on monday night some 3000 palestinians in beit sahour village 
turned a funeral into an antiisraeli demonstration after 
17yearold admon elias hilal was killed by a brick that fell from 
a fourthfloor army lookout post 
earlier in the day dutch foreign minister hans van den broek 
toured the kalandia refugee camp north of jerusalem setting off a 
protest by arab youths who chanted slogans and hurled rocks at 
reporters 
after van den broek left troops fired rubber bullets to break 
up crowds who raised outlawed palestinian flags and pictures of 
yasser arafat chairman of the palestine liberation organization 
good said the main reason the arab americans are leaving the 
occupied lands is the unsettled conditions caused by the 
palestinian rebellion many people are concerned about their 
childrens education or about them being caught up in violence 
he told the associated press 
the israeli military administration closed arabs schools in the 
west bank for four months during the uprising and cut short the 
school year by about a month the administration believes the 
schools are centers of unrest 
many of the 224 palestinians who have been killed since the 
unrest broke out are teenagers four israelis also have died 
faris bouhafa spokesman for the washingtonbased american arab 
antidiscrimination committee said some departing arab americans 
planned to return once conditions are calmer in the occupied 
territories 
bouhafa who said his 8yearold organization has 61 chapters 
and 20000 members in the united states is in israel to expand the 
role of the groups east jerusalem branch which was established 
three months ago

it downed two iranian jet fighters 
iran said the nuclear power station in the gulf city of bushehr 
was damaged in the iraqi raid but the report from the official 
islamic republic news agency did not provide details the 
unfinished plant was bombed last november and 11 people were 
killed iran at the time claimed fissionable material was stored at 
the site but the report was never confirmed independently 
the iraqi fighters also damaged a petrochemical plant and other 
industrial targets in bushehr according to the irna report 
monitored in cyprus 
the unfinished petrochemical plant is a joint japaneseiranian 
project irna said japan announced today it was willing to begin

iraqi attacks 
the iraqi military claimed it shot down two iranian f14 jet 
fighters one in a dogfight over the gulf near the iraqi port of 
ammiq and another over iraqi territory in the northern oil

iranian planes were lost irna said iran shot down three iraqi 
planes two in dogfights over the gulf and one by antiaircraft 
guns it did not say where the third plane went down 
us navy officials in the gulf declined to comment on the

missiles in britain under the superpower treaty that is to 
eliminate mediumrange nuclear weapons from europe 
twenty soviet inspectors landed at greenham common 50 miles 
west of london early this afternoon aboard an aeroflot jet the 
soviets were welcomed by a delegation of us and british officers 
the inspection visit is one of the terms of the 
intermediaterange nuclear forces treaty signed in moscow on dec 8 
by soviet leader mikhail gorbachev and president reagan 
the treaty provides for the elimination within three years of 
all nuclear missiles with ranges of 340 miles to 3000 miles and 
includes stringent inspection provisions to guard against cheating 
greenham common is one of two us cruise missile bases in 
britain the other is at molesworth 50 miles north of london both 
bases are run by us air force personnel but are technically 
british royal air force bases 
greenham common has 96 operational missiles and five backup 
missiles while there are another 16 operational missiles at 
molesworth according to the us military 
at greenham common a customs and immigration post was set up to 
receive the soviets and check the cameras geiger counters and 
other equipment they were allowed to bring for the inspection 
they are to stay overnight in converted servicemens 
accommodations at greenham common and are to eat meals at a 
cafeteria on the base 
under the treaty the inspectors may check the missiles and 
their mobile launchers which are to be taken back to the united 
states and destroyed but not the warheads 
at the bases the soviets may also place security men at all 
entry and exit roads to ensure no missiles are surreptitiously 
moved out the defense ministry said 
were entirely in the soviets hands said defense ministry 
spokesman martin helms they will say where they want to go 
the inspectors who will be flown to molesworth from greenham 
common will not be allowed to step outside the bases during their 
stay which is expected to last up to 4 days or until the 
inspection is completed 
us officers mostly from an onsite inspection agency based in 
west germany will accompany the soviets as they examine the 
missiles and launchers soviet inspectors first checked missiles in 
western europe on july 1 at two west german sites housing 
pershing2 rockets 
the current inspections are part of a 60day period of 
baseline inspections to determine the accuracy of data 
exchanged by the two sides the soviets are visiting 30 sites in 
the united states and western europe while us inspectors are

city health officials have lowered their 
estimate of the number of new yorkers infected with the aids virus 
by nearly half to 250000 according to a report published today 
the new estimate is based mainly on a reduction in the estimated 
population of homosexual and bisexual men living in the city the 
new york times reported 
the new estimates were to be presented tonight to a panel headed 
by health commissioner stephen c joseph the times attributed the 
250000 estimate to an epidemiologist who worked on the figures 
the previous estimated number of infected new yorkers was 
400000 or one in every 18 city residents thenhealth 
commissioner david sencer released that figure in 1985 and called 
it conservative 
in the earlier projections health officials estimated there 
were half a million gay and bisexual men in the city with 60 
percent believed to be infected the new estimate is expected to be 
cut roughly in half with the percentage infected to remain the 
same the times said 
the number of infected intravenous drug users who now account 
for more new cases in the city than any other group is not 
expected to change 
there is no known cure for acquired immune deficiency syndrome 
which is caused by a virus that attacks the bodys immune system 
timothy sweeney deputy director of the gay mens health crisis 
told the times he believes the figures undercount the gay 
population 
everybody knows that big cities and new york in particular 
act as a magnet and that there has been a great migration of 
gays he said

jesse jacksons campaign said today common ground 
had been reached with michael dukakis forces on most of jacksons 
minority platform planks but the jackson camp will press floor 
debate on three issues todays democratic convention session was 
moved up to allow more time for debate 
jackson officials in a written notice said today there would 
be debate on three planks for which he had filed minority versions 
higher taxes on the wealthy no first use of nuclear weapons and 
palestinian selfdetermination in the middle east 
however they said they would not press the middle east issue to 
a vote 
the dukakis delegates were expected to easily defeat jackson on 
the highertaxes and nuclearweapons issues but todays convention 
starting time was moved up from 430 pm to 3 pm edt to allow 
time to air the issues 
the jackson campaigns major concession was to drop a call for a 
fiveyear freeze on pentagon spending 
eleanor holmes norton jacksons chief platform negotiator told 
a news conference jackson has had a grater impact on this 
platform than any candidate other than a nominee in memory 
she said of the palestinian homeland issue on cbstv today 
our supporters were anxious to have the issue debated not 
necesssarily voted what was sought was an agreement that would 
keep our party together and avoid the dissonance 
but she said in regard to the jackson plank that would pledge no 
first use of nuclear weapons we are going to the floor on that 
the soviet union has said it its much more in the american 
tradition to say that 
current us and nato policy would allow first use in the event 
of a soviet invasion of europe 
the jackson campaign in its written update said we have 
reached common ground on nine of the minority planks advocated by 
our campaign including acceptance of jacksons minority plank on 
the budget 
that plank says investing in america and reducing the deficit 
requires that the wealthy and corporations pay their fair share and 
that we restrain pentagon spending 
other jackson proposals will be included in the platform 
compromise language including expanded support for prenatal care 
head start and education 
the platform negotiators resumed their talks monday after a 
sixday hiatus caused by tension between jackson and dukakis 
the jackson campaign said that our major impact on the 
platform has been in the document itself which already reflects 
the guiding principles of our campaign declaring south africa a 
terrorist state our fivepoint program to fight drugs political 
empowerment and many more 
campaign lieutenants negotiated late into the night over the 
details of resolving the minority positions jackson wanted in the 
streamlined 4500word platform 
i expect we wont have a marathon session michigan gov 
james j blanchard chairman of the platform committee said monday 
blanchard says the platform shorn of the usual specialinterest 
rhetoric is compact enough to fit on a poster 
the agreement not to wage a drawnout platform fight followed a 
monday morning meeting in which jackson pledged party unity and 
michael dukakis promised to increase jacksons role in the party 
the platform talks had been suspended last tuesday when dukakis 
failed to give jackson early notice of his selection of lloyd 
bentsen as a running mate 
both dukakis and jackson said they anticipated some issues would 
be left to the 4162 delegates to decide 
jackson said monday night on the cable news network there 
will be key planks to be debated tomorrow night we are 
committed to having new budget priorities 
rep bill richardson of new mexico a cochair of the platform 
committee said early today he thought there would be just a 
slight floor fight 
richardson said defense was where the jackson forces had the 
chance to make the most inroads on dukakis majority 
in a platform committee session in denver june 25 the dukakis 
forces rejected several cornerstone jackson campaign positions 
including his call for higher taxes on the wealthy a pentagon 
budget freeze palestinian selfdetermination and a us policy of 
no first use of nuclear weapons 
actor ed begley of televisions st elsewhere a dukakis 
delegate from california was among many delegates sporting no 
first use stickers at monday nights opening session 
other jackson minority planks called for full funding of head 
start and the women infants and children nutrition program and 
doubling the education budget 
aflcio president lane kirkland told the 751 labor delegates 
they were free to dance with the candidates you came with on 
platform fights the national education association which has 291 
delegates voted sunday to take jacksons side on the education 
plank 
the 4500word proposed platform is the democrats shortest in 
five decades 
borrowing a phrase from republican nomineetobe george bush it 
promises to reverse the voodoo economics of the reagan 
administration bolster programs for the needy and maintain more 
stable defense budgets tailored largely to dukakis 
specifications it includes many of jacksons positions as well 
including a condemnation of south africa as a terrorist state 
the platform is the main order of convention business today 
before a primetime speech by jackson

the brown recluse spiders in the parsonage 
of the first united methodist church have become far too 
gregarious and the congregation has decided to surrender 
the rev neal glass moved his family out last week after finding 
the aggressive spiders crawling on curtains laundry and bathroom 
towels 
most everybody we talked to had a relative or friend who had 
been bitten with serious repercussions glass said however he 
said the spiders left his family alone 
the congregation voted to sell the house just after it paid an 
exterminator 4725 to seal the house in plastic and fumigate it 
glass said the spiders survived 16 previous treatments 
we feel like we definitely could get more for the parsonage 
after it was treated and we could say it positively was free of the 
spiders glass said it would be a fire sale otherwise 
pest control company officials said three mild winters and this 
years dry hot summer have favored the brown recluse population 
the spiders poison causes painful itchy welts

george bush probably didnt catch democratic 
keynoter ann richards barb that he had a silver foot in his 
mouth but a campaign spokeswoman said today americans are more 
interested in leadership than laugh lines 
her audience liked it im not sure how well it will play 
everywhere else i dont think nastiness ever plays very well 
said bushs press secretary sheila tate 
bush fishing in wyoming with treasury secretary james a baker 
iii had no plans to watch or listen to the democratic national 
convention and thus likely missed monday nights keynote address 
ms tate said 
in that speech ms richards who is texas state treasurer 
brought roars of delight from democrats with her silver foot 
line 
i do think it played well to that liberal convention crowd 
but i thought it was thin on substance thinner on facts and i 
thought it was thinnest on any vision ms tate said 
it seems to me that people are more interested in leadership 
than in laugh lines she added 
the spokeswoman said that while bush likely didnt hear any of 
the speech im sure well tell him about it 
he wanted to stare at a fish eye not the cbs eye or the nbc 
peacock ms tate said

mikhail s gorbachev accused leaders of the 
armenian unification movement of exploiting a territorial dispute 
to hide their hostility to his drive for reform radio moscow 
reported today 
the soviet leader spoke monday to the countrys highest 
executive body the supreme soviet which rejected the movement to 
unite the nagornokarabakh region of the azerbaijan republic with 
neighboring armenia 
he charged that leaders of the campaign were conservative and 
corrupt and had stuffed their wallets before he came to power 
radio moscow said 
an armenian journalist said today that the campaign of civil 
disobedience was continuing in the southern republics despite the 
supreme soviets decision monday 
most of nagornokarabakhs residents are armenian although the 
enclave has no common borders with armenia 
since february armenians have been waging a sometimes violent 
campaign for transfer of nagornokarabakh from azerbaijan which is 
mainly moslem and has had control of the disputed region since 1923 
many voiced hopes that the greater democratization and openness 
under gorbachev would lead to the kremlins acceptance of their 
demands 
in massive demonstrations that began in yerevan armenias 
capital in late february many participants carried portraits of 
gorbachev to emphasize their faith in the communist party chief 
but radio moscow said gorbachev told the presidium monday that 
he favored the need to reaffirm the existing realities 
he also said the socalled karabakh issue was being used as a 
smokescreen by opponents of perestroika by conservative and 
corrupt people who stuffed their wallets in the period of 
stagnation radio moscow reported in its international 
englishlanguage service 
gorbachevs harsh remarks and the presidiums ruling which the 
official tass news agency said was unanimous seemed certain to 
fuel more unrest among armenians who consider nagornokarabakh 
part of their historic homeland 
tass today distributed the first detailed summary of the 
presidiums decision which said a change of nagornokarabakhs 
status was impossible under the soviet constitution 
under article 78 of the 1977 soviet constitution the territory 
of a constituent republic may not be altered without its consent 
the presidium noted a different decision would contradict the 
fundamental interests of the peoples of both republics and cause 
serious harm to interethnic relations in the region it said 
the presidium also ordered authorities in armenia and azerbaijan 
to take measures to halt the strikes and the protest campaign 
sparked by the nagornokarabakh dispute 
a journalist with the gostelradio state broadcasting authority 
in stepanakert nagornokarabakhs capital said the kremlins 
refusal to change the regions status would not halt the annexation 
campaign 
the general strike is continuing the journalist said the 
armenian people will continue their struggle for nagornokarabakh 
until the bitter end 
the presidium which is headed by soviet president andrei a 
gromyko has more than 30 members including top leaders from each 
of the countrys 15 constituent republics 
he said he did not believe that armenias representative on the 
supreme soviets presidium had voted to keep nagornokarabakh part 
of azerbaijan 
on monday night mofsis gorgisyan an advocate of the 
unification campaign who lives in yerevan estimated the number of 
security troops patrolling the city of 11 million people swelled 
to 200000 in the previous 24 hours 
i knew earlier what the decision would be from the number of 
troops here gorgisyan said i knew there would be no 
compromise 
however a police officer at the republics ministry of internal 
affairs said by telephone today that there were no troops on 
yerevans streets 
everythings quiet here there are no soldiers and 
everybodys working said the policeman who hung up before he 
could be asked his name 
a general strike was called in may in nagornokarabakh to press 
armenians demands over the annexation issue a sympathy strike 
began on july 4 in yerevan but speakers at a weekend rally urged 
people to return to work in expectation of the presidium meeting 
tensions caused by the territorial dispute also led to ethnic 
rioting in the azerbaijani city of sumgait on feb 28 officials 
said 32 people 26 of them armenians were killed

texas oilman gp cokinos watched in joyful 
reverie as a roomful of his fellow dukakis fundraisers danced to a 
blaring band i am having one of the finest times of my life 
he yelled over the din 
the michael dukakis campaign wouldnt have it any other way the 
financial juggernaut of the primary season is greasing the wheels 
this week for a 50 million effort this fall by courting big money 
with a fervor rare in democrats 
i have 14 events today five dinners and im trying to lose 
weight said robert farmer mastermind of the dukakis money 
machine its like a sixday party where everybody you ever met 
is there and youre the host 
this host wants the most the democrats long have lagged in fund 
raising relying instead on their political networks no more said 
farmer were going to create a level playing field with the 
republicans for the first time in my lifetime 
to even come close the effort requires platoons of wealthy 
motivated fundraisers so in atlanta with a barrage of 
celebritypacked parties the campaign is courting monied men and 
women for all theyre worth 
for starters there are the 1100 dukakis backers who each 
raised at least 10000 and some more than 50000 in the 
primaries there are oldline fat cats from the financial capitals 
and there are scores of supporters of the vanquished democratic 
candidates 
they have taken all of the gore people all of the gephardt 
people said howard glicken formerly a top money man for rep 
richard gephardts florida campaign when gephardt dropped out of 
the democratic race glicken said he didnt call the dukakis 
people they called me 
that kind of organization is farmers hallmark fundraisers are 
thanked with notes calls personal visits the campaign arranged 
their flights and hotel rooms for convention week each has a full 
schedule of strategy sessions 
and there are the parties 
theres something every day social as well as business 
said frank salafia a lawrence mass chiropractor this is part 
of what michaels all about he doesnt forget people hes not 
afraid to say thank you 
one of the first events billed as a greek festival was a 
classic of political stroking dukakis wasnt in town but his son 
and daughterinlaw greeted the crowd at a downtown mall with the 
news that she was pregnant 
cheers then sen edward kennedy dmass announced 
actually im greek more cheers 
then alpha omega sound started spinning out the dance tunes the 
costumed dancers of troupe hellas hit the floor the wine and beer 
and soft drinks flowed heaps of souvlaki were served farmer 
worked the crowd 
it is very pleasing to be made to feel a part of the family 
said atlanta computer consultant krishna srinivasa i am not 
greek but i feel greek here getting greek food listening to 
greek music they are turning us all into greeks 
not that indians wont do nicely two friends of srinivasa 
rameshwar singh of san jose calif and himmat kulharya of dallas 
said theyd raised 90000 for dukakis in the indianamerican 
community 
chiropractor salafia said hed come up with sizable 
donations cokinos an effusive beaumont texas oilman proudly 
pulled a photocopied 10000 check from his wallet and said hed 
raised more than 25000 in all 
when cokinos calls they give me some attention he said of 
the dukakis campaign they could not treat me nicer i asked for 
some press credentials and they turned me down so nicely i was 
almost sorry i asked 
as well as theyve done for dukakis these men will have to 
increase their production vastly to reach the big leagues 
farmer so far has recruited 135 people to raise or donate 
100000 each for the general election he wants 20 million from 
that effort another 20 million is supposed to come from 30 
traditional fundraising dinners that dukakis will attend around 
the country and 10 million is sought through smaller mailin 
donations 
the law says only that 83 million of the total can be used 
directly for dukakis the rest of his hard money is 46 million 
in federal financing the vast bulk of the cash that farmer is 
seeking is soft money earmarked for general partybuilding 
activities in each state 
party officials said monday they already had collected 12 
million toward their goal 
while the democrats like to stress their reliance on small 
donations the focus this week is on the bigticket givers the 
poshest parties include one held by atlanta developer john portman 
and another honoring former president carter is being hosted by 
longtime fundraiser walter shorenstein of san francisco 
at each event lavish or not is the everattentive bob farmer 
he even got in a plug at the biggest gathering of all the 
convention itself 
if youll excuse me now he told the delegates after a short 
speech monday night i have a few fundraising calls to make for 
gov dukakis

when an elderly mans car careened onto a sidewalk have persuaded 
authorities not to prosecute the man 
but stanley dlugolenski will have to give up his car and 
drivers license in the interest of public safety said kent county 
prosecutor william forsyth 
dlugolenski 79 told police he lost control of his car when the 
brakes failed but authorities concluded last week the cadillac 
involved in the july 8 accident didnt have any mechanical defect 
the decision not to prosecute was heavily influenced by the 
victims families who are dlugolenskis neighbors forsyth said 
its unusual for a family to feel this way and its a factor 
we had to give a lot of weight to forsyth said 
jody murray mother of 1yearold rj murray who was killed 
in the crash said she believes dlugolenski did everything in his 
power to avoid the accident 
the other two children killed in the crash were jason northrup 
9 and his sister marlene 7 the three were struck as they played 
on the sidewalk in front of their homes 
he feels horrible about what happened forsyth said im 
sure hed love to undo what happened 
dlugolenski has had three prior accidents and told authorities 
his accelerator stuck in at least one of those accidents forsyth

krasnoyarsk radar station in siberia is aimed at monitoring space 
objects and is thus not covered by the 1972 treaty the pact 
restricts both superpowers defenses against nuclear missiles 
some advisers to president reagan are said to be recommending 
that he accuse the soviet union of committing a material breach 
of the treaty by operating the phrasedarray radar station they 
reportedly want him to abrogate the pact 
other reagan advisers have suggested reagan try to persuade the 
soviets to level the facility in the interest of preserving the abm 
treaty 
according to the pentagon a phrasedarray radar is able to 
track many object accurately meaning it could detect ballistic 
missiles and could potentially contribute to abm battle management 
karpov told a news briefing that construction work at the radar 
station has been stopped as a sign of good will 
this moratorium is still in force said the diplomat who 
once headed the kremlin negotiating team at the geneva arms talks 
superpower representatives are now negotiating a 50 percent cut in 
strategic nuclear weapons 
karpov said soviet envoys were seeking an agreement that would 
commit the superpowers to observing the abm treaty for at least 10 
years he called that commitment the necessary element for 
reaching an accord on halving superpower strategic arsenals 
in this framework we are prepared also for a radical solution 
to the krasnoyarsk radar issue raised by the americans karpov 
said 
if an understanding to abide by the abm treaty as signed in 
1972 is reached the soviet union will be ready to dismantle the 
krasnoyarsk radar in a verifiable way that would leave no doubts on 
the part of the united states he said 
the abm treaty limits how fast and far the united states can go 
in its search for a spacebased defense against ballistic missiles 
the socalled star wars program is being carried out under what 
the reagan administration describes as a strict interpretation 
of the treaty 
a broader interpretation would provide more leeway and 
scrapping the treaty would remove all legal restraints on the us 
program which the soviets oppose as a new and dangerous turn in 
the superpower arms race

michael dukakis is promising jesse jackson a 
substantial role in the fall campaign and the money to carry it 
out in what jackson supporters say is a step toward bringing 
jacksons constituency into the fold 
meanwhile a senior dukakis aide said today there was no 
tiptoeing around major issues when the two candidates finally met 
monday to work out the agreement 
i will say it was one of the most frank and candid discussions 
ive ever been involved in said the aide who commented only on 
condition his name not be used it was a very open discussion 
with both sides agreeing as the rev jackson put it that it would 
serve no good to allow their ships to pass in the night 
the aide said sen lloyd bentsen dukakis running mate 
participated only in only last few minutes of the talks but that 
the others made sure he agreed with everything that had been worked 
out 
the bottom line from the meeting jackson backers said was that 
the challenger will get the respect he thinks he earned in winning 
7 million votes in the primaries and registering thousands of 
voters along the way 
the two men along with bentsen forged a unified front for the 
november election publicly ending days of tension between the 
campaigns that followed dukakis selection of bentsen a week ago 
today and the governors failure to give jackson advance word 
today at a civil rights breakfast jackson said we cant 
just join the circle we got to keep pushing the circle back 
later jackson worked privately with advisers on his 
convention speech for tonight were still trying to put it 
together he said 
bentsen too addressed the audience at the civil rights 
breakfast praising jackson for doing more on his own for the 
cause of freedom and justice more than the reagan administration 
has been able to achieve in the last eight years 
bentsen also said no one can doubt michel dukakis commitment 
to civil rights no one can doubt my commitment 
in the dukakisjackson news conference monday and in a later 
briefing by their top aides these details of the two camps 
agreement were revealed 
jackson will keep much of his organization intact paid for by 
party funds and will continue to campaign for the democratic 
ticket 
his travel costs will be paid if the mans got to travel 
were not going to let him fly commercial said joseph warren a 
longtime dukakis supporter who has been involved in the 
negotiations make no mistake about it what jesse needs jesse 
will get 
members of jacksons team will be integrated into the dukakis 
campaign at all levels although dukakis aide paul brountas 
indicated it was not automatic everyone would have a job 
jackson supporters will get close to half the 25 atlarge 
members of the democratic national committee to be appointed 
friday and a new dnc vice chair 
the dramatic news conference just hours before mondays kickoff 
of the democratic national convention came after a meeting that 
started with breakfast and moved in phases through a review of the 
campaign discussion of the rift and then an agreement on a new 
relationship 
hours later jackson said that while he would be involved in the 
campaign dukakis must reach out to his followers as well 
gov dukakis must convey to those persons that he cares 
for them that they are on his agenda when it is all said and 
done the nominee must convince people jackson said 
both camps said specifics are still to be worked out now that 
the principals have reached agreement on what jackson called a 
relationship of substance and support and candor 
that was something the jackson forces had said their leader was 
not getting from dukakis in previous discussions which were 
characterized as cordial but superficial 
a top jackson adviser ron brown who attended the meeting with 
the candidates and with dukakis aide paul brountas said that 
although the candidates had met many times i doubt very much 
whether any conversation of the depth of the one held this 
morning had previously occurred 
jacksons close ally rep ron dellums dcalif said the 
agreement would give dukakis more credibility with jacksons 
supporters but added it remains to be seen whether the people 
who have been turned off over the past few days can be turned on 
again 
dukakis was asked if his embrace of jackson carried a risk of 
alienating some of the important conservative southern swing voters 
that his campaign is seeking through the selection of bentsen 
that never really has been a problem he replied 
jackson said he wanted no salary no title and no job out of 
the arrangement he said he is better off not to take a formal 
position because then i would be in the employ thats not a good 
role for me to play 
he is going to be involved actively and fully in a way that 
will bring us together said dukakis who praised jackson for 
registering more voters than anybody in this country 
pledging to work for the democratic ticket jackson did not 
formally endorse the dukakisbentsen team saying he still plans to 
place his own name in nomination for president against dukakis

us agriculture secretary richard lyng had 
to dodge raindrops today as he got a firsthand look at how ohio has 
been affected by the drought 
lyng gov richard celeste and state agriculture director steve 
maurer visited john scherers farm in this northcentral ohio 
community where nearly an inch of rain had fallen by morning 
it was the first stop on a threeday tour that will take lyng to 
ohio indiana missouri iowa south dakota north dakota 
minnesota wisconsin and michigan 
lyng said he expected the drought to seriously damage crops 
across the country and estimated the corn precline 
by at least 25 percent 
higher than average losses are anticipated in ohio lyng said 
this has always been a reliable production area lyng said 
adding that might account for the low oduction would dpercentage of farmers 
with 
federal crop insurance the insurance is required to benefit from a 
disaster declaration lyng signed last week for farmers in ohio and 
missouri 
scherer whose primary crop is corn said lyng seemed warm and 
receptive to the plight of farmers 
the corns over the hill even with more rain scherer said 
but with the bills theyre working on if they can work together 
i think we can get some relief 
scherer said lyng and on this 
issue said stuart comstockgay director of the maryland chapter 
of the american civil liberties union which filed a 
friendofthecourt brief arguing that the use of gloves justified 
a new trial 
its like requiring a defendant to wear a prison uniform 
before a jury he said we argued that the use of gloves starts 
to stack the deck in the jurys mind toward a presumption that 
the defendant is bad or different and therefore guilty of 
something 
a lot of courts and administrators are trying to formulate a 
policy on how to deal with aids defendants and so there is a lot 
of use of the gloves in courtrooms around the country right now 
said nan hunter head of the national aclus aids and civil 
liberties project in new york 
the virus that causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome is 
transmitted through sexual acts or the sharing of hypodermic 
syringes medical authorities say it is not transmitted through 
casual contact 
as the trial began judge jacob s levin gave the court clerk 
and bailiff permission to wear gloves

a fire that damaged two floors of a 38story 
downtown bank tower was caused by vapors from a furniture 
refinishing project officials said today 
the blaze started monday night on the 34th floor of the union 
bank tower and spread to the 35th said fire department spokesman 
jim wells he estimated the damage at 350000 it forced the 
evacuation of two dozen workers but was quickly extinguished 
it was accidental said wells chemical vapors made 
contact with an electrical outlet causing a flash fire 
two of the 150 firefighters who responded monday night were 
treated by paramedics at the scene for exhaustion and heat 
exposure but there were no other injuries 
firefighters responding to the union bank fire used lessons 
learned in a may 4 highrise fire which killed one person and 
injured 40 people as it tore through five floors of the 62story 
first interstate bank tower 
firefighters used advanced communications gear and left 
equipment at two staging areas inside the building instead of the 
one used during the previous blaze 
they also lugged hoses and other equipment weighing as much as 
100 pounds per person up the 34 flights of stairs until it was 
determined the elevators could be used safely said fire battalion 
chief bob defeo 
the fire extinquished in 43 minutes was contained to a pair of 
office suites on both the 34th and 35th floors he said smoke 
damage in other areas of the floors was minor said fire inspector 
ed reed 
the cause of the fire was undetermined and officials said they 
had not determined the dollar value of the damage 
michael turner was doing legal research on the 35th floor of the 
building when the fire alarm went off monday night he said he 
immediately alerted a coworker 
we looked out one of the windows and saw flames coming up and 
we got the heck out of there he said 
i was jumping three steps at a time said bradley franks 
who was among about 20 asbestos removal workers on the 28th floor 
when he heard an evacuation call on an intercom a few people 
were following and some stumbled and fell i was on the 16th floor 
when i saw firefighters coming up the stairs 
like the first interstate bank tower the union bank tower was 
not equipped with sprinklers officials said although they were 
being installed both buildings were built before a 1974 city 
ordinance required sprinklers in highrises

the government on tuesday lifted a 
decadesold ban on the publication of literary works by about 120 
south korean writers who defected to north korea during the korean 
war government officials said 
officials at the cultureinformation ministry said the action 
was in line with south koreas continuing efforts to reconcile with 
north korea and promote contact between the two koreas 
the literary works were written before the authors defected but 
south korea had banned their publication under its antinorth korea 
policy 
the government action left only five writers on the blacklist 
including paek injun a former south korean film scriptwriter who 
currently serves as head of north koreas literary arts league the 
officials said 
in april the government permitted publication of books by two 
prominent south korean poets who switched loyalty to north korea

a unit in the justice department has launched 
an ethics inquiry of attorney general edwin meese iii the lobbying 
group common cause disclosed today and the 814page report of 
independent counsel james mckay will provide the basis for the 
review 
common cause had pressed for the examination on july 6 asking 
that the justice departments office of professional responsibility 
look into whether meese may have violated a 1965 executive order 
spelling out standards of ethical conduct for government employees 
we have initiated an inquiry into your complaint and we will 
advise you of the results upon its conclusion opr counsel 
michael shaheen said in a oneparagraph letter to common cause 
which publicly released copies 
common cause also asked opr to examine whether meese violated 
provisions of a federal law the code of ethics for government 
service 
common cause filed its request the same day mckay referred his 
lengthy report detailing meeses activities to the justice 
department a step that was expected to lead to an inquiry by 
shaheens office 
meanwhile meese said theres no question im vindicated of 
charges of wrongdoing despite an independent counsels conclusions 
that he probably broke two tax laws and twice violated a 
conflictofinterest law 
meese mounted a strong counterattack to the report by 
independent counsel james mckay saying the reports accusations 
against him absent criminal action were absolutely wrong and its 
absolutely unfair 
the attorney general interviewed on abctvs good morning 
america said mckay found meese had no criminal intention to 
violate the law 
when theres no intent to violate the law there can be no 
violation meese said intent is an absolutely critical 
ingredient and when that is absent then there cant be any 
violation of the law 
meese said that when the report is seen together with the 
response of his attorneys when you look at all the facts you 
see that in fact i am vindicated theres no question im 
vindicated 
mckay said monday that the toughest calls we made were not to 
proceed with criminal charges against the attorney general 
it was not a close call to find that there were probable 
violations mckay said on the macneillehrer newshour public 
television program 
mckay said meese and his wife ursula probably violated two 
sections of the internal revenue code by failing to report and 
promptly pay tax on a net capital gain of 20706 on the sale of 
54581 in securities in 1985 
mckay noted that meese filed an amended return on feb 6 of this 
year shortly after the scheduling of the grand jury appearances 
for the meeses accountants in connection with mckays criminal 
investigation of the matter 
the meeses paid 2875 in overdue federal tax payments and 
interest with the amended return and according to mckay 
apparently may owe an additional 600 because of an error made by 
his accountants in underestimated capital gains 
mckay said we had a situation where theres no pattern of 
violation of the tax laws and that meese in effect you might 
say is a first offender 
saying he was outraged and appalled by mckays findings meese 
said that in every matter under investigation by the independent 
counsel i have always acted legally ethically and properly 
and any implication by the independent counsel that i have in any 
way violated any law is absolutely false 
meese said that if justice department lawyers had issued such a 
document theyd be fired 
washington tax lawyers cono namorato and richard timbie offered 
their opinion at the request of meeses lawyers concluding that 
the facts do not describe a violation of any criminal 
provision of the internal revenue code 
the tax lawyers said meese candidly disclosed the securities 
transactions to his accountant john mckean and that he followed 
mckeans advice on how to file a return in the absence of the 
necessary records needed to compute the original cost of the 
securities 
mckays report found that meese probably twice violated the 
conflictofinterest law in connection with his holdings of 15000 
in regional bell telephone stock 
mckay said meese owned the stock in the regional bell companies 
in 1985 and 1986 when he set in motion a review process that led 
to a reversal of justice department policy mckay also found that 
meese participated in discussions of proposed legislation to shift 
regulatory responsibility for the breakup of atampt from a federal 
court and the justice department to the federal communications 
commission 
our conclusion was that although there was a probable 
violation there was no venality involved mckay said mr 
meese was not lining his own pocket so to speak had he not 
participated in these matters the decisions of the department of 
justice probably would have been the same 
meeses lawyers have characterized his meetings with executives 
of four regional bell companies which were seeking a reversal in 
justice department policy in 1985 and 1986 as courtesy calls but 
mckay disagreed 
the common theme was to protest the restrictions imposed on 
the companies under the consent decree and to advocate that the 
department of justice improve the situation said the independent 
counsels report the meetings cannot be characterized as 
nonsubstantive at the same time according to witnesses at the 
department of justice nothing of significance resulted from the 
meetings 
meese participated in the matters after signing an agreement to 
transfer the regional telephone stock to his financial manager w 
franklyn chinn who is under indictment for alleged racketeering in 
the wedtech corp scandal 
meese had pledged to the senate and the office of government 
ethics that he would sell the stock in 1985 he said he signed the 
transfer agreement because he couldnt find the stock certificates 
reclaimed the stock from chinn last summer and then sold it 
reid weingarten a washington attorney who offered a legal 
opinion at the request of meeses lawyers said he concluded that 
meese believed that he had made a bona fide transfer of the stock 
in question to mr chinn and that the evidence therefore would 
not be sufficient to support a prosecution 
the independent counsels report also dealt at some length with 
meeses activities on behalf of wedtech and a 1 billion iraqi 
pipeline project but concluded there was no evidence that his 
actions were for personal gain 
sen strom thurmond of south carolina ranking republican on the 
senate judiciary committee said mckays report indicates the 
attorney general did not exercise good judgment in a number of 
instances the attorney general has announced his pending 
resignation and i hope this report finally puts this matter to 
rest 
sen carl levin dmich chairman of a senate subcommittee that 
investigated meeses involvement in the wedtech scandal said of 
the mckay report the findings i believe are devastating to mr 
meese to his claim that he has been ethical how anyone other than 
ed meese could claim that this report vindicates him is beyond me 
mckay said his investigation had cost some 17 million as of 
the end of june meese said he intends to seek reimbursement of his 
legal costs from the taxpayers which since he has not been 
indicted he is entitled to do under the 1978 ethics in government 
act those legal costs are expected to exceed 250000 based on 
estimates on meeses newly issued financial disclosure form for 
1987 
mckays investigation has been completed but is not necessarily 
closed permanently 
last december mckay said it was possible an investigation of 
meese might be revived in connection with the wedtech matter 
depending on the outcome of the prosecution of longtime meese 
confidant e robert wallach as well as chinn and former wedtech 
consultant r kent london all three are under indictment in the 
wedtech scandal and invoked their fifth amendment right against 
selfincrimination in mckays probe 
two defense attorneys in the mckay probe referred to the 
possibility the investigation could be revived in connection with 
another matter the 40000ayear job for meeses wife ursula 
mckay said he found serious conflicts in the testimony of key 
witnesses concerning the extent of wallachs involvement in the 
effort to persuade the bender foundation to underwrite a job for 
mrs meese and lawyers for the foundation urged that the report 
therefore not be made public 
it appears that no final conclusions with respect to that 
matter will be made public until such time as e robert wallach 
becomes available as a witness said the brief by washington 
lawyers seymour glanzer and justice simon representing the bender 
foundation

house speaker jim wright believes his ethics 
problems are fading into the background as he takes the gavel at 
the democratic national convention but republicans are continuing 
to pester him about the issue 
a conservative washingtonbased gop group citizens for reagan 
filed a new complaint with the federal election commission as the 
convention began and a republican truth squad hit wright at a 
news conference in the convention city 
i think its devastating to have jim wright on the platform 
said rep don sundquist rtenn i think that if they had any way 
to get him off the platform without embarrassing him they would 
but wright offered a spirited selfdefense in an interview 
monday 
so what says wright i think thats basically the 
attitude of the public 
wright was formally installed as convention chairman monday 
night and is scheduled to deliver a 10minute speech tonight that 
will boast of congress accomplishments this year under his 
leadership 
as he wielded the chairmans gavel wright seemed as at ease as 
if he were in his home perch presiding over the house of 
representatives after one interlude when delegates danced to a 
rock n roll tune he encouraged the audience in the omni arena 
were going to look good on television tonight 
the mood seemed far away from some democrats preconvention 
worries that wrights problems might taint the proceedings and 
tarnish the image the party is trying to project in its bid to 
regain the white house 
rep tom delay rtexas a member of the gop hit team said the 
silence on the conflictofinterest allegations against wright did 
not mean the issue had evaporated he said republicans would rather 
focus on their charges that democrats are trying to hide from their 
liberal records 
that message has overshadowed jim wrights problems delay 
said he hinted that harsh criticism of outgoing attorney general 
edwin meese iii in an independent counsels report monday may also 
have blunted the issue 
theres enough sleaze to go around and i think everybodys 
trying to stay away from that delay said in an interview 
vice president george bush the gop presidential candidate has 
used wrights problems as a theme in campaign speeches but has 
eased the attacks since meese announced plans to resign 
id say before its all over there will be a few more shots 
taken at jim wright said lee atwater bushs spokesman easing 
the attacks doesnt mean hes out of our crosshairs 
wright said the citizens for reagan effort to revive the ethics 
issue would backfire the groups complaint filed monday with the 
fec charged that wright used a book he wrote as a way to circumvent 
limits on campaign contributions 
it is an absolutely baseless politically motivated effort 
wright said the obvious repetition of the very same baseless 
things reveals the bankruptcy of their claims 
he said the complaint was obviously timed to embarrass him at 
the convention 
wright said he had not shied away from the convention podium 
because of the criticism nobody likes for people to be saying 
unkind things about him he said but the only way around it is 
right straight through it i will be stronger because of it 
the house ethics committee has been probing charges that wright 
made unduly large royalties on his book reflections of a public 
man the book was printed by a longtime campaign contractor for 
the speaker and edited by a member of wrights congressional staff 
also under investigation are charges that wright improperly 
intervened with federal regulators on behalf of texas businesses 
wrights attorney william oldaker said he believes the panel 
will appoint an independent counsel soon and complete its 
investigation relatively quickly at most they have half a dozen 
people to talk to a trip to fort worth where the book was 
published would do it oldaker said

south africa was quiet on 
nelson mandelas 70th birthday showing once again the governments 
ability to defuse potentially explosive events and its refusal to 
bow to world opinion 
dozens of governments including the united states appealed 
for mandelas release thousands of people held rallies in world 
capitals to mark the birthday monday of the african national 
congress leader who has been imprisoned since 1962 
in south africa even the progovernment afrikaanslanguage 
newspaper beeld said it now would be better to free mandela rather 
than further enhance his stature as a martyr 
but the government responded in its customarily blunt fashion 
no birthday celebrations and no freedom for mandela until he 
renounces violence 
mandelas birthday passed in south africa without a major public 
celebration or an outburst of violence 
this day turned into what the government wanted to be made of 
it the leaders wife winnie mandela said monday 
the government banned all celebrations including concerts 
festivals sports events and even a private tea party more than 30 
people involved in organizing the events were detained 
the southern african catholic bishops conference said 
government authorities were making themselves look quite 
ridiculous 
but minister of information stoffel van der merwe said monday on 
national television no matter how much international pressure is 
brought upon us we must do what is right from our own 
perspective 
van der merwe said that as far as the government is concerned 
mandelas punishment has already been met but he added that 
political and security considerations keep the black leader in 
prison 
his imprisonment serves to ensure that this type of political 
unrest does not recur in the society van der merwe said 
mrs mandela said it was unlikely her husband would be released 
soon 
there appears to be no climate in the country for the release 
of mandela she said there does not seem to be anything on the 
cards for the next few years 
mrs mandela said she was disappointed with the bans placed on 
the events planned for her husbands birthday but she said it was 
wrong to interpret the day as evidence of the governments ability 
to stifle black resistance 
we wanted this to be a peaceful day she said its our 
own way of focusing on the crimes of apartheid 
mandela was jailed in 1962 for inciting unrest and fleeing from 
the country while serving a fiveyear term he was sentenced to 
life imprisonment in 1964 for sabotage and plotting the overthrow 
of the government 
the government maintains that mandela must renounce supporting 
violence before he is freed he has said he will do so only if the 
government lifts its ban of the anc and dismantles its policy of 
apartheid 
an estimated 30000 people have been detained without charge for 
varying periods of time since the government imposed a nationwide 
state of emergency in june 1986 all leading antiapartheid 
organizations have been banned including the anc which is the 
main guerrilla group fighting the government 
since the government silenced 17 leading antiapartheid groups 
in february it has not tolerated even relatively minor 
demonstrations

the presence of the endangered texas bitterweed 
has left a bitter taste in the mouths of officials whose plans for 
a golf course were halted by the us army corps of engineers 
harris countys application to build the course on corps land 
was refused because of the need to protect the plant formally 
called hmenoxys texana 
the corps action prompted efforts by county commissioner 
elizabeth ghrist to nullify a concession contract for the proposed 
golf course and free up 750000 in funds 
officials hope to look for a new golf course site but that 
could be delayed until at least next year said molly pryor an 
aide to ms ghrist 
you cant pick out another location until february when it 
bitterweed blooms and you can find it ms pryor said isnt 
that incredible 
the corps has promised to help the county find another spot on 
its land for the golf course

sen lloyd bentsen seen by some as a 
conservative counterpoint to michael dukakis played up his civil 
rights record today saying no one can doubt his commitment to 
that cause 
on a day that began with a salute to the civil rights movement 
bentsen praised jesse jackson saying he has acted more on his 
own for the cause of freedom and justice more than the reagan 
administration has been able to achieve in the last eight years 
bentsen continued to brush aside any differences between him and 
the democratic presidential nomineetobe stressing their common 
views on such issues as civil rights 
no one can doubt michael dukakis commitment to civil rights 
no one can doubt my commitment bentsen told a civil rights 
breakfast hosted by house speaker jim wright 
later he told texas delegates that the convention is showing 
unprecedented democratic party unity 
as i visited with jesse jackson this morning as i talked to 
mike dukakis time and time again yesterday and i listened to 
keynote speaker ann richards last night i have never never seen 
this democratic party more united than it is now bentsen said 
in a series of television interviews earlier today bentsen 
emphasized his civil rights credentials 
i can say ive been fighting for civil rights as far back as 
the 40s bentsen said on nbctv im no latecomer to that 
process i wouldnt be sitting here today as michael dukakis 
running mate if i didnt have a civil rights record 
the texas senators record on some issues is at odds with stands 
now advocated by dukakis including aid to insurgents in nicaragua 
and support for the tax cuts advanced by president reagan in 1981 
on abctv bentsen acknowledged differences but added there are 
a lot more similarities than you have in the way of differences 
on the major theme of the democratic campaign he said he and 
dukakis are together we are talking about economic growth jobs 
education health care housing 
bentsen spent a good part of monday wooing delegates who dont 
know him or his record some found their fears about him 
evaporating 
he doesnt frighten me said harry meshel minority leader 
of the ohio senate you dont expect him to be a loose cannon 
thats the kind of thing youre looking for stability 
hes smooth like pouring honey and i mean that in a 
complimentary way if he walked on water he wouldnt stir it 
said richard daschbach a new hampshire legislator 
some delegates made no secret of their disappointment in 
dukakis choice for a running mate jackson supporters threatened 
to challenge bentsen but such talk may have been muted by the 
outcome of mondays dukakisjackson meeting which ended with 
pledges of unity 
aides say bentsen did not take part in the talks between dukakis 
and jackson although he did have two candid telephone 
conversations with jackson last week that aides say enabled jackson 
and bentsen to establish a good rapport jackson told bentsen after 
one call that you understand grits talk said bentsen spokesman 
jack devore 
bentsen arrived in time fr the trio to hold a press conference 
monday afterward he told a meeting of ohio delegates i just 
left a meeting with gov dukakis and jesse jackson and we have put 
it all together 
he was well received by the ohio crowd despite their hopes that 
ohio sen john glenn would get the nod for the tickets no 2 spot 
meshel the ohio senate leader called the choice very 
practical 
when you analyzed the political landscape it seemed more 
important to have bentsen in terms of winning texas than it was to 
have glenn because i think were strong in ohio and the 
midwest said meshel 
at the new jersey delegation bentsen was greeted by an ovation 
but also some jackson placards the jackson supporters said later 
they were still committed to their candidate but that bentsen 
should not take it personally 
wayne bryant a new jersey assemblyman from camden said he 
remained concerned about what role jackson will have in the 
campaign but called bentsens civil rights record very 
distinguished

the iraniraq war could be halted within a 
week secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar predicted after 
iran accepted a un ceasefire plan but the belligerents were 
fighting again today 
iraqi warplanes attacked a nuclear plant and other iranian 
industrial targets today iran said a day after reversing itself in 
announcing it would accept a yearold un resolution calling for a 
truce in the 8yearold war 
the conflict has killed or wounded an estimated 1 million people 
iran said it shot down three iraqi jet fighters today and iraq 
said it downed two iranian warplane but both sides claimed their 
planes all returned safely to base 
irans official islamic republic news agency also said iraqi air 
raids near the city of ahvaz in khuzestan province killed and 
injured an unspecified number of people and inflicted some damage 
iraq which already has accepted terms of the resolution on 
monday expressed skepticism about its rivals abrupt aboutface 
baghdad said the reversal may have been prompted by tactical 
reasons irans recent battlefield defeats rather than by a 
desire for peace irans economy has also suffered deeply 
world leaders generally praised irans announcement and 
expressed hope it would lead to an end to the conflict that has 
endangered commercial shipping in the gulfs busy waters and 
heightened the us military presence in the region 
in light of todays fighting perez de cuellar spokesman 
francois giuliani said the un leader considers the continuation 
of hostilities in the area a clear sign that the ceasefire should 
come into place as soon as possible and he is extremely anxious 
that this should be the case 
perez de cuellar told a news conference monday he would assemble 
a 10member team and another force of at least 250 un military 
observers to monitor a prospective truce 
if im lucky i may have a ceasefire in a week to 10 days 
he said 
the peruvian said he also would dispatch un teams to both 
countries at the end of the week to work on an early prisoner 
exchange 
perez de cuellar whose peace mission to both countries in 
september ended in failure said acceptance of the resolution by 
both combatants is a breakthrough 
the resolution is a peace plan he said and it covers all 
aspects if it is fully implemented i think it means an end of the 
conflict 
the tehran government battered by a string of recent military 
defeats and seeking a security council call for the withdrawal of 
the us navy from the gulf said monday it would accept the truce 
resolution without condition 
the security councils scheduled meeting this morning was called 
off and no explanation was immediately forthcoming however the 
members of the council held private talks late monday and early 
today 
the council was to hold private consultations this afternoon on 
irans acceptance of the un ceasefire plan it was also 
scheduled to discuss a us warships downing july 3 of an iranian 
airliner which killed 290 people 
iran contends the us navys presence in the gulf made the 
disaster inevitable but has been unable to collect enough votes to 
condemn washington 
us officials say the plane was shot down in selfdefense 
because the crew of the uss vincennes thought the a300 airbus was 
an iranian jet fighter 
during debate last week the united states soviet union 
britain france china and others all told iran that its failure to 
accept the ceasefire resolution caused the hostile atmosphere that 
led to the jetliner disaster 
security council resolution 598 which was adopted july 20 
1987 demands an immediate ceasefire in the war a troop 
withdrawal a prisoner exchange and the creation of a comprehensive 
peace plan 
it also calls for formation of an impartial commission to 
determine responsibility for the conflict iraq invaded iran in 
september 1980 after several border skirmishes 
perez de cuellar met separately monday with iranian ambassador 
mohammad jaafar mahallati and iraqi ambassador ismat t kittani 
there was no word on the results of the talks 
president ali khamenei of iran in his letter to perez de 
cuellar accepting the resolution cited the airliner downing and 
said the gulf war is engulfing innocent civilians 
in this context we have decided to officially declare that 
the islamic republic of iran because of the importance it 
attaches to saving the lives of human beings and the establishment 
of justice and regional and international peace and security 
accepts the un resolution it said 
despite accepting the resolution irans military command said 
its troops would remain at the front 
hashemi rafsanjani iranian parliament speaker who was promoted 
to military commanderinchief by iranian leader ayatollah ruhollah 
khomeini last month said in an interview on iranian television 
monday that khomeini had decided to accept the truce 
iran had been saying that it would not accept the resolution 
unless iraq were branded the aggressor in the war

the world may celebrate the end of the 
iraniraq war but israel will not 
prominent israelis say the 8yearold war nearly eliminated the 
possibility of united arab military action against israel but 
peace in the persian gulf could make iraqs huge military machine 
available for such a campaign 
the moment this army becomes free theres a fear of war 
maj gen yehoshua saguy a former head of military intelligence 
said tuesday on israel radio 
brig gen aharon levran said in an interview as long as the 
gulf war was raging israel could rest assured that the chances for 
a war here were almost nil this security bonaza which israel 
enjoyed up to now is probably coming to an end levran retired 
from the military is an analyst at the jaffee center for strategic 
studies in tel aviv 
statements of government leaders have been cautious but often 
laced with suspicion 
defense minister yitzhak rabin said on israel television he did 
not believe iraq or iran was eager for a new war in the immediate 
future 
prime minister yitzhak shamir head of the rightwing likud 
faction of the coalition government told reporters we must be 
very cautious from this moment 
foreign minister shimon peres leader of the centerleft labor 
party and shamirs political rival declared iraq has built a 
very large army with over 50 divisions with an air force the 
question is whether it will turn to rehabilitating its country or 
be tempted to recapture its standing in the arab world by 
attacking israel 
the daily newspaper hadashot said israeli generals plan meetings 
this week to assess the possibility of iraq or iran turning its 
military forces against israel 
it quoted unidentified foreign ministry sources as suggesting 
official concern that iran might increase support for hezbollah 
its guerrilla ally in lebanon and encourage attacks on northern 
israel 
largely because two hostile regional powers were fighting each 
other israel has been able to reduce annual military spending by 
600 million in the past three years 
iraq moved closer to moderate jordan and egypt during the war 
and sent word through diplomatic channels that it would abandon 
opposition to a negotiated settlement of the arabisraeli conflict 
analysts in israel feel peace could change all that 
iraqs peaceful intentions are considered suspect because of its 
history of sending troops to fight in past arabisraeli wars 
including three of its seven army divisions in 1973 
i dont remember positive statements saguy said i 
remember all through the years that iraq was a country which never 
signed a ceasefire with israel and iraq took part in all the wars 
so far 
expensive new defenses may be needed to counter the threat of 
chemical weapons and longrange missiles widely used in the 
iraniraq war 
israel and the united states are considering a 13 billion 
program to develop the arrow a missile designed to bring down 
incoming rockets carrying chemical or conventional warheads 
zeev schiff a leading military commentator writing in the daily 
haaretz criticized israeli leaders for not taking advantage of 
iraqs new moderation 
iraq was ready for approaches on israels part he wrote 
egypt was willing to act as a bridesmaid due to one excuse or 
another most of the israeli leadership totally rejected this 
possibility 
some observers feel israel also missed a chance to develop a 
diplomatic initiative with moderate jordan while much of the arab 
world was preoccupied with the persian gulf war instead israel 
sold weapons to iran 
although the extent of the dealing is unknown the sales 
reflected the predominant israeli view that nonarab iran posed 
less of a threat than iraq a traditional enemy 
we had an interest in selling for economic reasons and because 
we were worried about the fate of 30000 jews still living in iran 
not to mention iraq being an enemy said yaacov nimrodi an 
israeli arms dealer and former mossad intelligence official 
joseph alpher acting director of the jaffee center said in an 
interview that one beneficial effect of peace in the persian gulf 
could be a slowing of the middle east arms race 
countries like saudi arabia that have been seeking missiles 
and stateoftheart combat aircraft will perhaps scale down their 
arms purchasing maybe not tomorrow but after a few years he 
said

a public school teacher was only doing what the 
doctor ordered when she took a day off and played golf a review 
panel decided in granting her request for sick pay 
we find it unbelievable said school district attorney jose 
gonzalez who last week filed a request for a rehearing in superior 
court 
the threemember review panel known as the commission on 
professional competence ruled last month that teacher ethel h 
williams could file for sick leave for her june 12 1987 golf 
outing 
the panel said the outing was related to the respondents 
health it found that williams was under an unusual amount of 
jobrelated stress while working as a special education elementary 
school teacher at walker elementary school 
williams who has been teaching for 17 years had been advised 
by her physician to take a day off when she was bothered by stress 
her physician thinks golf serves this mental health purpose 
well the ruling said 
the matter went to the panel after school officials received a 
tip about the golf outing williams denied going until confronted 
with her score card 
the district sought to have her suspended for 10 days for 
unprofessional conduct for abusing the sick leave policy and for 
denying she had spent the day playing golf 
we didnt feel that going out and playing golf is adequate 
medical therapy said george flanigan the districts director of 
certificated personnel 
the panels ruling notes that williams has been evaluated as a 
very effective teacher it also says she has a handicap of 12

there were expectations on this july 19 that we were going to 
declare outselves socialists the president wearing a plaid 
cowboy shirt said in the nationally broadcast speech they 
havent understood yet that we are socialists and theres 
socialism in nicaragua since 1979 
it was believed to be the first time that he or any of the 
sandininista leaders described themselves as socialists recently 
sandinista leaders have said that the country had a mixed economy 
with socialist orientation 
ortega spoke to a crowded stadium in the central city of 
juigalpa 85 miles east of the capital 
he also urged the united states to renew bilateral talks last 
held in 1984 to normalize relations 
the president called on the usbacked rebels known as 
contras to reopen stalled discussions on a definitive ceasefire 
he also said government troops would extend a truce until aug 30 
the current ceasefire was due to expire at the end of this month 
the anniversary marks the day sandinista guerrillas arrived 
triumphantly in managua the capital after a 1year civil war 
that ended four decades of dictatorial rule by the somoza dynasty 
troops on monday conducted searches at roadblocks along the road 
to the site of the festivities in juigalpa 85 miles east of 
managua also the interior ministry banned alcohol sales for 24 
hours in chontales province where anniversary festivities also are 
being held 
the measures followed three days of military exercises that 
ended sunday the armed forces using tanks helicopters and guns 
joined civilians to act out air strikes and land attacks 
also sunday thousands of youths attended dances to celebrate 
the day of happiness marking the day in 1979 when president 
anastasio somoza left the country 
the celebrations come as a quick and permanent end to the 
governments 7year war with the contras remains elusive 
negotiations broke down in june for a lasting peace to the 
conflict that has claimed 26000 lives the rebels in recent weeks 
have staged almost daily ambushes despite a ceasefire agreement 
signed march 23 
the defense ministry said monday five rebels had been killed in 
two attacks on troop positions the statement said rebels kidnapped 
10 civilians friday and saturday 
the government last week expelled us ambassador richard melton 
and seven other american diplomats it accused the us embassy of 
being behind a plan to incite domestic unrest 
also last week courts sentenced to six months in jail three 
dozen opposition figures who attended an antigovernment 
demonstration that police broke up with tear gas and beatings 
the sandinistas also shut down the roman catholic radio station 
and a private news show and suspended the only opposition 
newspaper la prensa for 15 days citing economic reasons the 
government nationalized the largest private enterprise the san 
antonio sugar refinery 
lawmakers in washington are discussing resuming military aid to 
the contras which congress cut off in february in hopes the 
sandinistas would deliver on promises of democratic reforms 
the government claims most of nicaraguas problems center on the 
war with the contras which it says has caused 36 billion in 
damage to the economy 
the threat of renewed fighting means thousands of displaced 
people cannot return home in north and central regions meanwhile 
the unpopular military draft continues 
the war has stifled promises of social programs scores of 
schools and clinics built after 1979 have been destroyed the 
countrys more than 3 million people suffer shortages of rice 
beans water and gasoline 
most of the blame has been placed on the united states which 
financed the contras cut off economic aid in 1981 and established 
a trade embargo in 1985 
but the sandinistas express pride in having survived to their 
ninth anniversary without the us invasion they have always said 
they expect 
on monday a cartoon in the sandinista newspaper barricada 
depicted a baseball game the nations most popular sport between 
the united states and nicaragua it showed a score board noting 90 
and a disheveled uncle sam

president reagans national security adviser 
said today the administration has improved its relations with 
congress in the aftermath of the aberration of irancontra 
in an address to the los angeles world affairs council however 
lt gen colin d powell said he hoped that congress would not be 
tempted to try to limit presidential power 
powell said that divided shared and countervailing powers are 
the hallmarks of our system by design of the founding fathers 
weakening the presidency also weakens the country 
the national security adviser did not say specifically what 
improvements had been brought about in administration dealings with 
congress on foreign affairs issues nor did he touch on the ongoing 
dispute with some lawmakers over reagans failure to invoke 
provisions of the war powers act giving capitol hill a say in the 
use of us military force in the persian gulf 
powell did say that the executive branch has an obligation to 
keep its own house in order there must be an adherence to law and 
to the constitution and a willingness to consult and deal openly 
and respectfully with the congress taking legislative leaders into 
its confidence on the most sensitive matters 
i believe this administration after the aberration of 
irancontra has reestablished and enjoys such a coherent and 
cooperative process internally powell said it has served the 
president and the country well 
two white house aides john m poindexter and oliver l north 
were ousted in the fall of 1986 as the irancontra affair became 
public it involved the clandestine sales of us arms to iran and 
the subsequent diversion of proceeds to the nicaraguan rebels 
reagan has persistenly maintained that no laws were broken even 
though congressional investigations and hearings produced evidence 
that members of congress were widely deceived by administration 
figures 
north goes on trial sept 20 in washington on an array of 
charges related to the armstoiran affair

in indiana years of genetic work on new strains of corn and 
soybeans withered in the field in ohio crop failure halted 
research on stalk rot and other corn diseases in georgia a 
parched pasture killed a grazing test and put 67 cows on the 
auction block 
across droughtscorched sections of the united states 
universities have abandoned or cut back on millions of dollars 
worth of experiments aimed at breeding tastier healthier crops and 
beefier cattle 
it not only wipes out the whole year longrange research may 
be ruined which means well have to start over it may have 
effects that carry over for years said william baumgardt 
director of agricultural research for purdue university in arid 
west lafayette ind 
however researchers who study drought hope to learn lessons 
which will help during the next dry spell 
were getting information we wouldnt otherwise get it 
enhances our stress testing said plant physiologist jerry easton 
of nebraska university who is experimenting with genetics and 
crossbreeding for droughtresistant sorghum 
purdue scientists were breeding diseaseresistant soybeans and 
hardier corn but the hot dry weather destroyed crops and produced 
no seeds from the test strains baumgardt estimated the loss in the 
millions of dollar plus the time invested in selecting the best 
varieties from year to year 
all the progress weve made up to now is being set back two to 
five years genetic studies are being devastated baumgardt said 
a staggering combination of dry weather and high temperatures 
has created drought conditions in parts of the midwest and south 
that are the worst since the dust bowl of the 1930s 
its a double blow for the agriculture schools which also sell 
crops and livestock to help support research programs 
at ohio state university plant pathologist patrick lipps 
canceled five experiments using plowing methods and crop rotation 
to stem root rot stalk rot leaf disease and other corn disorders 
all my corn plots are shot lipps said if you have no 
corn you have no way of assessing your yield or crop development 
you have no data it wipes out a years worth of research 
at another ohio state experimental station in custer ohio 
performance trials on hybrid corn and fertilizer are worthless 
because the thirsty crop is so meager 
about all of our projects are terminated or soon will be 
said gerold reid assistant manager of the farm station you 
chalk it up to experience and hope it doesnt happen again for a 
long long time 
in the hybrid test 240 types of corn from various seed 
companies are planted side by side at random to give farmers an 
unbiased comparison on yield and sturdiness only 25 percent to 30 
percent of the seared stand is growing 
weve essentially lost a lot of the corn all the rain in the 
world isnt going to help it reid said 
each year ohio state showcases its work on field crops day 
taking farmers and dignitaries around its bountiful fields in 
wagons but not this year 
instead of taking people on wagon tours we may have speakers 
under shade trees talking about the drought theres nothing to 
show them said martha carroll spokeswoman at ohio state 
at the university of georgia 67 head of hungry cattle were 
auctioned in the second year of a threeyear grazing study because 
the pasture burned out researchers wanted to see what types of 
grasses would add the most beef to cattle so feeding them grain 
would have defeated the experiment 
the grasses quit growing said ed worley superintendent of 
an experimental station near calhoun ga the drought has been so 
severe we ran out of cattle feed there was nothing else we could 
do really 
in another georgia experiment agronomy professor phil banks 
plowed under two fields of soybeans after a test for herbicides 
failed the reason it was too dry for weeds to grow 
it just means starting over next year banks said 
oklahoma state university must spend an extra 100000 to 
200000 to feed livestock because the grazing range and 
schoolgrown hay and grain are so skimpy tests were also cut back 
on plots that arent irrigated 
in some cases well lose a whole years work you never make 
it up thats a years progress in scientific development said 
ronald johnson associate director of oklahoma states agricultural 
experiment station

maronite catholics in north lebanon on 
tuesday repulsed fierce attacks on their town by shiite moslem 
gunmen and police said five people were killed and 25 wounded in 
the fighting 
the attacks raised the casualty toll to 11 dead and 45 wounded 
since fighting began sunday between the shiite jaafar clan and 
residents of the catholic town of qoubaiyat 70 miles northeast of 
beirut 
a police spokesman in tripoli the provincial capital of north 
lebanon said residents of qoubaiyat repulsed three attacks tuesday 
by 2000 jaafars before a ceasefire was called 
he said the jaafars launched the attacks with a fierce barrage 
from rocket launchers howitzers and mortars the shells slammed 
into qoubaiyat at the intensity of 10 rounds per minute at one 
point the spokesman said 
he said several mortar rounds fell into the courtyard of 
qoubaiyats ancient stone church causing some damage but the six 
monks and 20 nuns sheltered there were not hurt 
the jaafar clan estimated at 35000 people is based in the 
central bekaa valley on the western edge of the akkar plateau a 
region traditionally dominated by maronite catholics and sunni 
moslems 
syria the main power broker in lebanon maintains 25000 troops 
in the bekaa valley and north lebanon under a 1976 peacekeeping 
mandate from the 21nation arab league 
the spokesman who requested anonymity said brig gen ghazi 
kenaan chief of the syrian armys military intelligence in 
lebanon drove to qoubaiyat shortly after midday to supervise 
implementation of the ceasefire 
the syrian army is to control a buffer zone separating 
qoubaiyats fighters from the jaafars the spokesman said 
he said the clashes started sunday one day after armed 
shepherds from qoubaiyat and the jaafars engaged in a brief 
firefight over sheep grazing terrain in the hamlet of shanbook on 
the towns western edge 
two people were killed in the original fight for pastures but 
it seems the incident has developed into a shiitemaronite war 
the spokesman added 
tuesdays attack on qoubaiyat shattered a syriansponsored 
ceasefire declared on monday 
qoubaiyat population 25000 is the fourth largest catholic 
town in north lebanon about onefourth of qoubaiyats residents 
serve in the lebanese army

people the world around are following events at 
the democratic national convention here but their interest level 
often is tied directly to their distance from atlanta 
were watching from afar figuratively and literally says 
francois champey a reporter covering the convention for the french 
television station la cinq 
allan hogan of the australian broadcasting company says his 
countrymen are interested but not intensely so were just 
concentrating on the highlights things like the platform and the 
jacksondukakas fracas he says 
on the other hand the mexican and canadian reporters at the 
convention are giving their readers a blowbyblow account they 
say the folks back home are especially eager to know what positions 
the democrats will take on issues such as acid rain trade barriers 
and funding for the contras in nicaragua 
the democratic platform hints of being very protectionist on 
trade issues which could hit us hard says jose carreno a 
washingtonbased correspondent for the mexican news agency 
carreno says he thinks most mexicans would rather see a democrat 
become president this time around 
if the republicans win it probably will mean political 
problems for us he says if the democrats win it may mean 
economic problems but nonetheless the mexican people for one 
reason or another tend to think the democrats are better for 
mexico then too most mexican americans lean toward the 
democratic party 
christopher thomas and michael finley of the canadian 
broadcasting corporation also say they think the canadian people 
want to see a democrat in the white house next year 
people in canada think its time for a change says the 
torontobased finley theres an intense interest in this 
convention and in how the election works out in the fall well be 
covering it all the way 
the democratic national committee estimates as many as 3000 
foreign reporters are covering the convention they say 319 foreign 
news organizations from 51 countries have registered to attend the 
big show at the omni 
many of these reporters are especially interested in jesse 
jackson whom carreno calls easily the bestknown american 
politican in the world after ronald reagan 
john magnus of vg norways largest newspaper says he has 
interviewed members of the minnesota many of whom are of norwegian 
descent but he says his readers also are very interested in 
jacksons convention activities 
norwegians like the fact that he speaks about racism and 
challenges the establishment says magnus also jacksons 
social programs reflect the thinking of many people in our country 
hed be a mainstream politician in norway 
no so in taiwan says norman fu of the china times 
ive been focusing on gov michael dukakis and whether he will 
be able to win says fu this convention is a big story in our 
country because it touches foreign policy and the reagan 
administration which has been a good friend to us 
for ingo pressler of the east german wire service adn a big 
problem has been explaining the convention process to his readers 
im describing the debates and touching on the issues he 
says but frankly its hard for our people as it is for many 
americans to see a real difference in your political parties 
many of the foreign journalists file their stories at the us 
information agency foreign press center they complain of being 
stuck in motels far from the omni and of the lack of access to the 
conventions leading figures who are dominated by the domestic 
media 
for lily chaves of the daily newspaper excelsior in mexico city 
major problems have been the language barrier and grasping the us 
nomination process 
ive been concentrating on the hispanic caucus she says 
speaking in halting englishthis is my first american convention 
and its so different from mexico where the same party has been in 
power for 59 years and everyone thinks the presidential election is 
just for show

a federal magistrate has given the 
government 10 days to appeal his order releasing three search 
warrants and other documents related to an investigation of alleged 
fraud in pentagon procurement 
us magistrate james kenkel on monday directed the public 
release of the warrants used to search the homes of a senior air 
force procurement officer and two consultants as well as the 
inventory of items taken by agents 
kenkel said the more sensitive affidavits used to support the 
request for the warrants could remain sealed another 45 days 
also monday the government released documents in los angeles 
showing that wiretaps were used to gather information on teledyne 
electronics northrop corp and litton industries no details of 
the wiretaps were disclosed 
us district judge david kenyon ordered the release of four 
search warrants at the request of the los angeles times and other 
media organizations who sought to unseal affidavits supporting the 
warrants the government said it would also release a description 
of all premises searched but three attorneys representing 
unidentified employees of the defense contractors objected on 
grounds that disclosure might lead to identification of their 
clients 
meanwhile the hartford conn courant argued in papers filed 
in us district court in bridgeport conn that documents related 
to norden systems a united technologies corp subsidiary should 
be unsealed 
the courant asked for the release of warrants and other 
documents related to a june 14 of norden offices and bridgeport 
trumbull and norwalk conn and a june 15 search of the shelton 
home of senior vice president james e rapinac 
norden a combat systems manufacturer is suspected of 
benefitting from inside information to build a battlefield 
communication system for the marines according to other documents 
already released in the investigation 
the probe centers on allegations that defense contractors and 
consultants many of them former military men bribed pentagon 
officials for contracting details that could be vital in winning 
bids worth billions of dollars 
the very scope of this investigation has overriding and 
broad public interest kenkel said suggesting the public would 
be better served if news stories on the subject were based on the 
legal documents instead of rumor 
joseph j aronica assistant us attorney for the eastern 
district of virginia where the probe is centered said no decision 
had been made on whether to appeal kenkels decision which 
requires the unsealing of the warrants and inventory documents 
within 10 days if no appeal is filed 
the request to unseal the documents was made in a petition filed 
by the washington post which argued that a month already had 
passed since the documents were put under seal and there has been 
considerable public interest in the investigation 
federal prosecutors argued that disclosure of information 
contained in the documents would hinder their continuing 
investigations 
the documents including the list of items taken by police 
would give a broad outline of what the government is looking for 
what the government has found and more important what the 
government doesnt have aronica said 
he suggested that other targets of the investigation could use 
the information to fashion future testimony or to destroy documents 
the documents involved pertain to victor cohen deputy assistant 
air force secretary in charge of buying tactical command control 
and communications systems william sanda a defense industry 
consultant and richard seelmeyer the operator of an air charter 
service and former congressional staffer involved in defense 
appropriations

thomas p tip oneill jr the former house 
speaker who not long ago was the leading voice of the democratic 
liberal wing said tuesday the party had been too liberal for too 
long and applauded efforts to bring the party closer to the 
political center 
we really got too far off to the left to be perfectly 
truthful and i was one of those who were out there oneill said 
for years the old liberal wing of the party tried to control 
the party lock stock and barrel and because of that we lost an 
awful lot of people the massachusetts democrat said politics 
is the art of compromise you have to have a voice on both sides 
today oneill said the democratic party is much more 
diversified we have everybody from every element 
economicwise ethnicwise regionalwise and thats the way it 
was back in the 30s when we were developing america 
oneill 75 who retired in 1986 after 50 years in politics the 
last 34 in the house is here as a superdelegate from massachusetts 
speaking informally to reporters at a massachusetts delegation 
breakfast sponsored by sen john f kerry dmass oneill said he 
is confident michael dukakis would win in november 
i have never at least in 28 years since jack kennedy seen 
the party as united as we are right now the former speaker said 
theres no question this ticket is going to bring us victory 
although he has been out of office for 1 12 years oneill 
remains the consummate politician stopping to chat with dozens of 
fans and have his photo taken with them treating each like a 
longlost friend with a genuine how are you dear 
some other convention insights from oneill 
on jesse jackson he knows hes made a place in history 
on platform fights you need these to stimulate the 
convention not only that they bring out the minority views that 
are expressed and the people should know about them 
on keynote speaker ann richards i dont think a man could 
get away with saying what she said to be perfectly truthful but 
she said it beautifully she was great absolutely fantastic

james butler is due in court wednesday morning 
back home in stuart fla but he thought it important that he be 
here to peddle his unique product at the democratic national 
convention 
the product to put it delicately is a filter to keep from 
being choked to death by verbal and visual pollution its name 
has two initials that could stand for beneath sanity but they 
dont 
butler could be found on day two of the convention hawking his 
product in a blocklong parking lot near the convention hall set 
aside for speechmaking a sort of atlanta hyde park 
this convention is all beneath sanity said butler a 
lawyer he used the initials but this way it gets cleaned up 
his filter wasnt needed right at that moment the speaker at 
the mike was addressing an audience of 17 outnumbered better than 
twotoone by 40 portable johns and more than evenly matched by 
more than two dozen bored hot riot police 
butler is an oddity among the 35000 people attracted to atlanta 
for the convention because he doesnt want to get into the omni 
which he regards as a megasource for blue smoke which is also not 
the words he used 
im trying to avoid it he said my filters would stop me 
at the door 
the filters according to the instructions work best when 
placed between the user and the source of the pollution its uses 
include filtering out politicians saying they are for the common 
man and lawyers asking you to trust them 
ten bucks but free to reporters looking for bully stories 
while butler was touting his product a mock trial was being 
held for house speaker jim wright on the cityprovided podium 
repeatedly jim wright disobeyed the law said lisa 
williams a student at the university of georgia the facts speak 
for themselves and they make a liar out of jim wright 
her reasoning is that wright who is chairman of the convention 
took foreign policy in his hands by negotiating with central 
american leaders to advance his own peace plan and violated 
campaign finance law by having associates buy his autobiography 
a young man named james bieber stepped forward i represent 
jim wright and the evidence is so overwhelming my client pleads 
guilty and we throw outselves on the mercy of the court bieber 
from costa mesa calif is orange county chairman of the 
rightwing young americans for freedom 
he came to atlanta he said because the streets are full of 
red flags and communists 
the trial ended with the judge eugene delgadio shouting 
into the microphone i ask for jim wright to come forward i seek 
any delegate within the sound of my voice to come forward and 
defend jim wright 
nobody came its a crying shame said delgadio

jesse jackson on tuesday praised lloyd bentsen 
the texas senator tapped for the democratic runningmate spot 
jackson wanted as a person who has a perceptive understanding of 
how to reach out to minorities 
when bentsen joined jackson and presidential nomineetobe 
michael dukakis for their summit meeting on monday the senator 
immediately grasped the focus of the situation jackson told the 
associated press in a brief interview 
jackson said he and dukakis told bentsen what they had discussed 
regarding the relationship they had agreed upon they told him they 
wanted him to join them and speak to a news conference in an effort 
to put out a public message of democratic unity 
what was significant was his perception his understanding of 
what had to be done to broaden the base for inclusion jackson 
said 
coming out of texas where you have to reach out to become a 
us senator you necessarily have to deal with the blacks browns 
the farmers and ranchers the workers jackson said your 
orientation becomes inclusive and expansive because it is the only 
way to win and the way he relates is indicative of his 
experience 
jackson has declined to say much about bentsen since dukakis 
picked him a week ago other than to note that bentsen represents 
the conservative wing of the party the other extreme from 
jacksons more liberal constituency 
jacksons comments about the senator contrast with the 
statements of many jackson aides who had criticized bentsen for a 
lack of understanding about minorities 
jackson said the understanding between himself and dukakis was 
worked out before they called bentsen over on monday to fill him in 
and include him in their press conference 
his presence certainly sent a balance message jackson said

the democratic platform is a gloomy document that 
doesnt acknowledge there are good times in america republican 
critics charged tuesday 
last night i listened to the speeches and i also read the 
democratic platform frankly i dont know what country theyre 
talking about said james miller head of the reagan 
administrations office of management and budget it seems to me 
theyre either deceiving the american people or theyre in the 
twilight zone somewhere 
the democratic party is pulling together to help perpetuate 
the fraud said south carolina gov carroll campbell 
thats the traditional philosophy said new hampshire gov 
john sununu it is the tax and spend wing that is in control 
they have written a platform that attempts to hide that 
on the day the convention took up the platform a gop truth 
squad took aim at the document arguing that it demonstrates that 
certain nominee michael dukakis is cast in the traditional liberal 
mold 
they can hide from the l word all they want campbell 
said its a fact of life there is a fraud being perpetuated on 
the american public 
rep jerry lewis rcalif said republicans must make it clear 
that dukakis is cut from the liberal mold despite his efforts to 
dodge the label 
his history has been a history of public service that involves 
tax and spend lewis said the democratic party intends to be a 
party without principle practicing the politics of deception 
miller argued that while democrats are trying to softpedal the 
question of tax increases they would be inevitable in a democratic 
administration 
i know you cant do all those things the democrats here in 
atlanta are talking about without raising taxes miller said i 
think somebody ought to make that point and i think the democrats 
ought to be held accountable for it 
rep don sundquist rtenn attacked house speaker jim wright 
who chairs the democratic convention and is under investigation for 
allegations involving a book written by a staffer 
i think its devastating to have jim wright on the platform 
sundquist said i think if they had any way to get him off the 
platform without embarrassing him they would

he bought in dublin in 1938

monday to mark the 50th anniversary of the flight that he still

brought it when he revisited the shop and received a matching shirt 
as a gift 
earlier tuesday corrigan had breakfast with us ambassador 
margaret heckler then called on the lord mayor of dublin ben

enrique bermudez newly elected to the 
rebels directorate is portrayed here as the man personally 
responsible for murdering civilians and the epitome of president 
reagans antisandinista policies 
leftist government publications constantly refer to the 
56yearold former colonels position in anastasio somozas 
national guard to evoke the memories of an often brutal 
dictatorship deposed by the sandinistas nine years ago 
somozista guard controls the directorate read a headline 
tuesday in the sandinista newspaper barricada the united states 
believes in a new somoza said el nuevo diario also 
progovernment 
staterun television showed pictures of bermudez in his uniform 
during the 197879 revolutionary war combined with shots of bodies 
of burned babies 
he is described in nicaragua as a cia pawn and the head of the 
mercenaries as the sandinistas call the rebels the rebels or 
contras have been backed by the united states since they began 
fighting the government in 1981 
recent defense ministry bulletins reporting military actions by 
the contras begin mercenary groups loyal to the somozista 
excolonel 
bermudez the military chief of the contras was elected monday 
to the political directorate of the exile nicaraguan resistance 
assembly which was meeting in the dominican republic the election 
marked the first time the rebel combatants have had direct 
representation on the political directorate 
bermudez was one of the founders of the first rebel groups in 
1981 and then of the nicaraguan democratic force the largest 
contra fighting force whose core is disgruntled former guardsmen 
he is known among his followers as commander 380 a reference to 
his number at military school he graduated in 1952 bermudez also 
studied military engineering in brazil and spent time at the school 
of the americas in panama 
the former colonel took part in the us actions against the 
dominican republic in 1965 from 1976 until the sandinistas came to 
power in 1979 he served as somozas military attache in washington 
the nicaraguan democratic force joined with southern front 
groups and atlantic coast indian rebels in 1985 under the name the 
united nicaraguan opposition and was known by its spanish acronyn 
as uno which means one but the varied contra groups never were 
seen as united 
the only thing they have agreed on is that the sandinistas whom 
they view as hardened marxists must be ousted 
the contras reorganized again in 1987 as the nicaraguan 
resistance 
representatives of that group made up of politicians most of 
whom live in miami signed the march 23 ceasefire agreement with 
the sandinistas after three days of meetings at the southern border 
post at sapoa 
the contras in recent weeks have staged scores of attacks in 
violation of the ceasefire the leadership claims that the actions 
are by individuals acting on their own the rebel ranks suffer deep 
splits 
in may a group of seven contra field commanders were expelled 
from honduras to the united states for speaking out against 
bermudez 
contra leaders who remain loyal to bermudez told the 
associated press that pedro joaquin chamorro would lose his 
position on the directorate because he backed the young officers 
against bermudez 
chamorro was voted off the board monday

the atlanta chamber of commerce believes 
democrats and media representatives are rather voracious 
consumers it seems 
the group predicted the democratic national convention would 
produce 60 million for the local economy half of it in direct 
spending by visitors and another 30 million in rollover spending 
by local businesses and employees 
the chamber figures for example that each of the 35000 
visitors estimated to be here for the political gathering will eat 
and drink his or her way through 300 over five days and spend 86 
a piece at retail stores not counting tshirts purchased on the 
street 
democrats are doubling up in hotel rooms the chamber says a 
figure of 17200 rooms was used in the calculations at more than 
100 a night each 
all told atlanta is counting on 857 from each of the 35000 
people 
so are the estimates coming true convention organizers arent 
saying the hotel reservations office says it cant release the 
number of rooms actually in use

an air force proposal to end hurricane 
reconnaissance flights as part of a belttightening plan would 
strip coastal areas of their most reliable earlywarning storm 
defense forecasters said 
air force officials have decided to eliminate the wc130 flights 
that complement weather satellites and landbased radar used to 
track storms in the atlantic and gulf of mexico said rep tom 
lewis rfla 
we feel strongly that the aircraft reconnaissance is important 
to us mark zimmer chief of the tropical satellite analysis 
center at the national hurricane center said monday when you 
get down to warning the coastal population we feel that we need 
the precise information of the aircraft 
weather satellites provide a broad picture zimmer said but 
when we get down to actually trying to measure the wind velocity 
and the pressure we feel that the aircraft can best do that 
the proposal to end the reconnaissance flights would take effect 
oct 1 1989 just after the height of next years atlantic 
hurricane season 
it would save about 25 million a year said lt col john olsen 
of the military airlift command headquarters at scott air force 
base in illinois 
tracing hurricanes can be done other ways cheaper and 
faster added air force spokesman capt mike laughlin in 
washington who said tests with new technology in the pacific 
where the flights have already been eliminated were successful 
he also said sending a plane and crew into the eye of a 
hurricane was dangerous 
but lewis disagrees that the flights can be eliminated 
this is illadvised and if carried out would literally leave 
florida naked and defenseless in the path of a fastmoving killer 
hurricane lewis said 
lewis said he has talked to air force secretary edward c 
aldridge and hopes to meet with him soon 
if he cannot dissaude aldridge lewis said he hopes to unite the 
florida congressional delegation along with legislators from 
states along the gulf coast against the cut

nearly a year after she won reinstatement army 
reserve sgt miriam benshalom asked a federal judge tuesday to 
prohibit the army from denying her reenlistment because she is a 
lesbian 
i dont want to stand up waving a banner and screaming im 
gay all i want is to serve the country i love and to be a good 
soldier benshalom said after the court hearing 
benshalom 40 who won reinstatement last year after a federal 
appeals court ruled that she could not be discharged for admitting 
her homosexuality said she was informed she will not be allowed to 
reenlist when her term expires aug 11 
her attorney patrick t berigan asked us district judge 
myron l gordon for a temporary injunction preventing the army from 
considering her sexual preferences when deciding on her request to 
reenlist 
he also sought a permanent injunction that would effectively end 
the armys ban on homosexuals 
she has been denied solely because of her sexual preference 
and if the army is denied to consider that issue then im confident 
she will be reenlisted she is an outstanding soldier 
berigan told the court 
gordon said he would try to rule on the preliminary injunction 
before aug 11 and then move quickly to consider the other motions 
berigan said he was appalle that army reserve regulations ban 
admitted homosexuals from reenlisting even if there is no proof 
as in this case that any homosexual acts were performed in the 
service 
here is an individual who has received nothing but high 
accolades from her superior she gets along with everybody and her 
homosexuality has not been a problem and i dont see any reason why 
she shouldnt be allowed to reenlist berigan said 
berigan cited a february ruling by the 9th circuit court of 
appeals which extended the constitutions equal protection clause 
to protect homosexuals from government discrimination 
kenneth kohl a us justice department attorney representing 
the army said the 9th circuit case has been scheduled for 
rehearing and that three other federal appeals courts have upheld 
the armys ban on homosexuality 
he said courts have allowed the army to arrest soldiers for 
homosexual conduct and if they are allowed to arrest someone for 
homosexual conduct then certainly they can deny someone a job 
because they are homosexual 
kohl said the army believes homosexuals are not only a risk to 
national security but undermine discipline morale and recruiting 
kohl asked gordon to consider precedents in which courts have 
decided against involving themselves in internal matters because 
they found the army is better left to make its own decisions 
benshalom enlisted in the 84th division of the army reserves in 
1974 and was promoted to sergeant in 1976 before she was discharged 
later that year after she told a superior she was a lesbian 
she appealed her discharge and in 1980 us district judge 
terence t evans ruled she could not be discharged for admitting 
her homosexuality 
the decision was appealed and benshalom was prohibited from 
finishing her threeyear term until august 1987 when a federal 
appeals court in chicago upheld the lower courts ruling that she 
was protected under the first amendment 
the appeals court ruling did not address the issue of 
reenlistment

gov michael dukakis peace accords with jesse 
jackson marked a fair conclusion of their political jockeying and 
jackson now should yield to his partys nomineeelect some dukakis 
delegates say 
jesse likes the center stage and thats fine said irving j 
stolberg speaker of the connecticut house at this point 
however were in the process of having mike dukakis become the 
captain 
stolberg like several other dukakis delegates interviewed about 
the dukakisjackson truce expressed no resentment at jacksons 
demands for influence for his supporters within the campaign and 
the democratic party 
everybodys doing what you would expect them to do posturing 
for position said state sen david karem of louisville ky 
its typical what youd expect of bargaining said edward 
smith of cairo ill 
some delegates said jackson took advantage of dukakis failure 
to notify him of his rejection as vice presidential running mate 
last week when sen lloyd bentsen was selected but they did not 
fault jacksons approach 
tactically last week dukakis gave rev jackson an opportunity 
and we all seize our opportunities politically said edward 
treacy a delegate from indianapolis when someone does something 
thats not by the book you seize the moment 
while the dukakis gaffe gave jackson something of an upper 
hand treacy said he has to remember who the nominee will be 
dukakis and jackson met monday and emerged pledging cooperation 
aides said jacksons gains included about half of 25 new democratic 
national committee seats campaign jobs for jacksons aides and 
rules changes for 1992 
the delegates expressed satisfaction with dukakis effort 
hes not allowing himself to get jerked around theres 
definitely an attempt at it but its not successful said laurie 
donnelly of louisville 
there was a little bit of gamesplaying said carol barr of 
decatur ill i dont think its going to hurt the fall 
campaign 
other dukakis delegates were sympathetic to jacksons purposes 
jesse had to make a point said john b larson connecticut 
senate president pro tem 
barr said she was not bothered by jacksons name being placed in 
nomination wednesday night thats what he ran for but she 
like other dukakis delegates also said the time was at hand for 
jackson to drop his candidacy and take up the dukakis cause 
jesse in the next couple of days has his last moments of 
negotiating the role hes going to play said stolberg the 
connecticut house speaker after that point hes one of the 
lieutenants in the dukakis campaign and i think hes going to be 
an important one

wisconsins squeakyclean image has been 
shaken by accusations that a top madison lobbyist bought meals for 
legislators and paid for travel in a possible violation of state 
law 
some legislators and others say the the infractions are minor 
one of the meals cost 5 or 6 especially when compared to states 
with a greater history of government scandal 
but the state director of common cause the selfstyled citizen 
lobbying group said wisconsin should judge itself by its own 
standards not by those of states where such infractions would 
barely leave a ripple 
by wisconsin standards he said weve got some problems 
here 
wisconsins lobbying law believed to be tougher than most 
prohibits public officials from accepting anything of value from 
lobbyists except limited campaign contributions after june 1 of 
election years common cause is pushing for an even tougher law 
lobbyist gary goyke a former state senator filed lawsuits last 
week in a sofar unsuccessful attempt to stop milwaukee magazine 
from publishing an article about his lobbying practices that he 
contends were based on office files taken by a former employee the 
article is to appear late this month in august editions 
goyke also asked for a state investigation into his activities 
predicting it would show he had violated no laws 
the us attorneys office disclosed it already was 
investigating and state attorney general don hanaway said tuesday 
he would launch an investigation after secretary of state douglas 
la follette announced he would drop his probe to avoid any 
appearance of conflict of interest or political use in his bid for 
the democratic nomination for the us senate 
goyke contributed to la follettes campaign for secretary of 
state in 1986 and the two are acquiantances 
its like a witch hunt said state rep david travis whose 
name has not been linked to any questionable activity weve all 
been tarred and feathered already and theres not a heck of a lot 
thats come out 
goyke had a reputation as a clean politician when he was in the 
state senate especially after waging a campaign against secrecy in 
government 
kevin millikin a madison lawyer said he thought the incidents 
didnt amount to much its friendships a few nights in a hotel 
room a few drinks 
but millikin said that means a lot in wisconsin 
the citizens expect a clean government he said it 
certainly had the appearance of impropriety if what you read is 
true people in wisconsin arent going to like it 
william e hauda wisconsin director of common cause said the 
incidents are serious for wisconsin whose reputation for honest 
government dates to the turnofthecentury progressive movement 
wisconsin hasnt had a major government scandal this century 
since gov robert m fighting bob la follette ended the 
railroad lobbys stranglehold on the legislature in 1903 the state 
secretary of state says he is a distant relative of the former 
governor 
were not quite as clean as people would like to have you 
believe hauda said you have to judge things based on 
community standards just like obscenity based on wisconsins 
standards weve got some problems here 
haudas group said goykes wife attorney nancy rottier gave 
thousands of dollars to more than 30 legislators campaigns which 
she defended as her right hauda argued that was a method used by 
lobbyists to circumvent lobbying restrictions 
milwaukee magazine has not said what its article will say but 
some legislators have admitted taking favors from goyke 
state rep gordon bradley accepted a 5 or 6 fish dinner from 
carl otte a former legislator and employee of goyke 
wausau mayor john robinson a former state representative 
failed to report 247 in air fares for members of his family 
accepted from pfizer inc one of goykes clients to a chicago 
healthcare conference at which robinson spoke 
several legislators attended a green bay packerchicago bears 
game in green bay possibly at goykes expense 
state sen jerome van sistine acknowledged accepting two nights 
of lodging in los angeles during his honeymoon as a present from 
goykes wife a family friend 
goyke says he intends to reclaim his image 
i believe in being a nice guy i like the legislative process 
i respect it he said i think that we have a very very clean 
state i honestly do

a leftist guerrilla group claimed 
responsibility tuesday for an attack that injured six us soldiers 
in a communique distributed to local newspapers the cinchonero 
peoples liberation movement said the lempira command attacked 
the soldiers in memory of the first honduran war chief who led an 
armed resistence against foreign invaders 
the six soldiers were in good condition tuesday at palmerola air 
base headquarters for us operations us embassy spokesman 
charles barclay said 
they were among a group of nine soldiers who were leaving a

in a rented van sunday when assailants hurled a grenade and opened 
fire on them from another vehicle 
one of the six injured was treated and released sunday the 
other five were hositalized 
as long as there is a yankee military and nicaraguan 
counterrevolutionary presence here there will never be peace the 
guerrilla groups communique said said peace will not be 
achieved while the puppet army defends the rich exploiters of our 
people 
we tell our peole that the gringos are not invincible bullets 
also pierce them which has alrady been demonstrated by the heroic 
peoples of vietnam cuba and nicaragua it said 
col lazaro avila soleno commander of the honduran armys 105th 
infantry brigade in san pedro sula said on tuesday officials had 
no leads in the case we consider the attack an isolated action 
whose investigation will follow the course of the law to provide 
tranquility to the citizens avila soleno said 
however newspapers reported tuesday that the secret police had 
arrested six people in the case military intelligence sources said 
fbi agents were in san pedro sula to work on the case 
the cinchonero guerrillas emerged in 1979 as the first armed 
group of the honduran communist party which has operated 
underground since it was founded in 1950 lempira was a maya indian 
chief who fought against spanish conquerors 
authorities blame the group for more than 10 terrorist attacks 
againt us companies in honduras the hijackings of three 
commercial airliners between 1979 and 1983 and the kidnappings of 
businessmen 
president jose azcona hoyo told reporters tuesday the government 
was worried about the attack we believe that action apparently 
is part of a destabilizing plan of the international left

dick howe paid out nearly 60 and a lesson 
in human nature to students in his remedial math class this summer 
in return he got his students attention and that was worth 
every penny howe says 
when howe walked into his summer school class of fourth and 
fifthgraders at southside elementary school last month he knew 
that motivating 18 students in the heat of summer would be 
difficult 
i thought why not pay them im getting paid to be here so 
why not them howe said 
the students were told they would be paid up to 20 cents per 
day depending on attendance behavior and performance 
it gives them a purpose for being here students have to have 
goals to achieve and this gave them something as a goal howe 
said 
the change in attitude was almost immediate 
they were aware of it when i put their name on the board for 
misbehaving they knew they were losing money the teacher said 
payday was friday the end of the term students were paid 470 
down to 170 no one got the maximum 5 for the sixweek session 
they left a little richer than they came in in one way or 
another if that makes a lasting impression then it was worth

there is a notable lack of enthusiasm among jesse 
jackson backers about his solidarity agreement with michael dukakis 
even as they express hope the relationship could bring tangible 
victories in the future 
the official jackson campaign line on the jacksondukakis 
agreement is a positive one emphasizing the agreement in which 
dukakis will involve jackson and his staff in the general election 
providing resources for jackson to campaign for the democrats 
but many jackson supporters who wanted their candidate on the 
ticket are disappointed in the agreement campaign aides 
acknowledged 
the important thing here is that reverend jackson who was 
disturbed over feeling that he was not being properly courted by 
the dukakis people is now satisfied said rep louis stokes 
dill 
but even among some who were putting out the positive spin 
there was at times as much resignation as enthusiasm in the 
reaction and acknowledgement that jacksons constituency might not 
buy into it 
rep ron dellums dcalif said the agreement would give 
dukakis more credibility with jacksons supporters but added 
it remains to be seen whether the people who have been turned off 
over the past few days can be turned on again 
there is nothing really to be happy about said rep charles 
rangel dny a key jackson adviser the only thing we have 
gained is entering an atmosphere where the two campaigns can work 
out a strategy to win in november 
rangel said that was how it should be among members of the same 
political party so the jacksondukakis arrangement really puts 
them at what he considers the starting gate for that reason he 
said he would hardly consider mondays agreement a victory 
jackson has mentioned the agreement only fleetingly in speeches 
since he and dukakis announced it focusing instead on his future 
agenda and the issues he has highlighted throughout his campaign 
in answer to the question what did jesse get some of his 
supporters see only crumbs from the agreement announced with 
dukakis 
the only thing dukakis gave up was the opportunity to lose 
without jacksons support said rangel as to the agreement that 
jackson staff members would be integrated into the dukakis team 
rangel said i dont see why if you sacrifice your advisers and 
time to help another candidate that this is a great 
accomplishment 
officially key advisers say the new attitude and respect shown 
by dukakis is what is most important and specifics can follow from 
there 
the future will tell if the new relationship pans out into real 
access and influence by jackson in dukakis politics they said 
we have to take him for his word that he will include jesse 
jackson in a very substantial and meaningful way said 
assemblywoman maxine waters of california 
an aide to one jackson congressional adviser said his boss was 
very disappointed and felt the concessions to jackson were not 
particularly meaningful 
dukakis agreed to push for legislation on a number of issues he 
already supports tougher sanctions against south africa 
statehood for the district of columbia simplification of voter 
registration and greater commitment to minority business setaside 
programs 
jackson also won party rules changes so he can get nearly half 
the 25 atlarge members of the democratic national committee and a 
new dnc vice chair 
so what said the congressional aide to all of the above 
mayor andrew young noted however that people dont realize 
you dont get anything at a convention unless you win 
and he added jackson didnt really need anything because 
he has an enthusiastic following and can go his own way outside of 
traditional political bargains 
a close jackson confidant former carter administration official 
bert lance refuses to entertain talk of jackson losing anything in 
light of what he has accomplished with his campaign 
looking out on a street lined with about 250 cheering people who 
gathered tuesday to wait for jackson outside a small unannounced 
breakfast speech lance insisted he won there are no advance 
people putting this on 
and he said of the convention they dont give out door prizes 
down there

the derailment of an amtrak passenger train 
near russell iowa occurred last october after a workman failed to 
restore a track switch to its proper position a federal 
investigation concluded tuesday 
the two locomotives and 11 of 14 passenger cars of amtraks 
california zephyr collided with maintenance equipment on a side 
track injuring 15 crew members and 107 of the 230 passengers 
aboard 
the national transportation safety board concluded in its report 
on the oct 12 1987 accident that a laborer who had used the 
maintenance equipment had parked it on a siding but failed to 
return the switch for throughtraffic use 
blood and urine samples from the burlington northern railroad 
workman later showed small traces of marijuana but the levels were 
so small that the board could not link drug use specifically to the 
accident 
the board also blamed the crane operator and a track forman for 
failing to check the switch and criticized the management of the 
burlington northern railroad which owns the track for inadequate 
training of maintenance crews and not reducing the track speed in 
the work area 
the safety board also said that a signal banner at the switch 
which would have warned the amtrak engineer that he was about to 
head onto a track siding was so rusted that it was difficult to 
see 
the amtrak train traveling about 60 miles an hour went onto 
the side track and plowed into the equipment which included a 
maintenance crane and three flat cars the safety board said 
the eastbound zephyr was traveling on the westbound track at the 
time of the accident because a stretch of the eastbound track had 
been closed for repairs 
the board also said that the severity of some of the passengers 
injuries was increased because items like television sets coffee 
makers and seat cushions broke free inside the amtrak cars during 
the accident

michael dukakis in a spirit of unity yields 
center stage tonight to jesse jackson for a speech certain to 
ignite a thunderous rally at the democratic national convention 
hell deliver an upbeat speech sen lloyd bentsen dukakis 
running mate predicted today 
democratic leaders including bentsen the man who got the no 2 
spot jackson sought were all emphasizing harmony today before 
jackson goes on delegates will debate three platform planks that 
jackson wants changed but agreements to disagree without anger 
apparently have been worked out 
i think its going to be a good debate but i dont think its 
going to be divisive and i dont think it will be rancorous rep 
bill gray a jackson supporter closely involved with platform 
deliberations said on nbctv todays convention starting time was 
moved up from 430 pm to 3 pm edt to allow more time for 
debate but then was pushed back to 415 pm because so few 
delegates showed up 
while unity was the convention byword there was trouble on the 
streets on the third day of demonstrations 
just blocks from the convention site police arrested 134 
antiabortion protesters at a clinic where abortions are performed 
they were charged with criminal trespassing unlawful assembly or 
other counts until today only one arrest had been reported 
meanwhile dukakis visited the gravesite of martin luther king 
jr and praised the slain civil rights leader as a man of action 
a man of inspiration he cared very deeply about some basic human 
values 
kings widow coretta scott king told dukakis we wish you 
well in this effort because we are counting on you to set things 
right again 
bentsen in an interview on cbstv showed no concern about 
platform differences being aired on televison tonight if they 
bring these issues to the floor well thats the way conventions 
are supposed to go he said 
asked on nbc if he expected jacksons address to have a theme of 
unity he said i certainly expect it will be an upbeat speech 
jackson the runnerup reluctant to quit was given 28 minutes 
starting at 1021 pm edt to address the 5372 delegates and 
alternates following a video tribute to his campaign and his cause 
the tone has to do with bold leadership jackson said 
previewing his remarks thats what we need new direction sound 
ideas and america must never surrender to be bigger and be better 
both dukakis and jackson will have their names put in nomination 
for the presidency but it will be dukakis who stands at the podium 
thursday night to claim the prize 
with his rival wielding overwhelming power jackson struck a 
gentlemans agreement on platform disputes agreeing to withdraw 10 
of 13 minority planks he championed his biggest concession was 
dropping a demand for a fiveyear freeze on pentagon spending 
party sources said dukakis would instruct his delegates to vote 
down jacksons call for higher taxes on the wealthy and no first 
use of nuclear weapons and that jacksons call for a palestinian 
homeland would be debated and then withdrawn without a vote 
in a convention fine tuned for television viewers the democrats 
set aside their customary wrangling over rules and credentials 
adopting reports from those committees in a blink of an eye and 
brought forth humorist garrison keillor and a bevy of 
elementaryschool children to recite the pledge of allegiance and 
sing the national anthem 
the convention opened on time with attacks on the record of 
the reagan administration and the competence of george bush the 
certain presidential nominee of the republican party 
texas state treasurer ann richards the keynote speaker said 
bush in eight years as reagans vice president hasnt displayed 
the slightest interest in anything we care about and now that hes 
after a job he cant get appointed to hes like columbus 
discovering america hes found child care hes found education 
poor george he cant help it he was born with a silver foot 
in his mouth she said sending the crowd into roars of laughters 
and applause 
dukakis telephoned her afterwards with congratulations what 
am i going to say on thursday you said it all he told her 
predictably republicans didnt like the barbs sheila tate 
bushs spokeswoman said americans are more interested in 
leadership than laugh lines her audience liked it im not sure 
how well it will play everywhere else i dont think nastiness ever 
plays very well 
no one could accuse the democrats of conducting their business 
in a smokefilled room democratic national chairman paul kirk 
ruled at that outset that smoking was forbidden 
neither dukakis nor jackson made an appearance at the convention 
monday instead watching it on television when they werent on 
television themselves in network interviews 
its a madhouse but i love it state sen paul feleciano of 
wichita kan shouted to a camera crew on the convention floor he 
said the summit meeting between dukakis and jackson earlier in the 
day had put many delegates at ease 
sure people are still loyal to their candidate but were 
sitting hand in hand laughing and joking the animosity is not 
there anymore feleciano said 
not everyone felt that way 
william crawford a jackson supporter from indianapolis said 
george bush is not attractive but i dont think we can say 
dukakis at any price 
former president jimmy carter his hair turned gray exhorted 
the delegates to pursue unity one more time unity 
in a revised version of his 1976 campaign slogan carter said 
my name is jimmy carter and i am not running for president did 
you hear that george it was a pointed jab at bush who often 
holds up the carter years to ridicule 
dukakis and jackson met for nearly three hours monday morning to 
clear up disputes that had threatened to disrupt the convention 
after their talks jackson said he would not challenge dukakis 
selection of texas sen lloyd bentsen as running mate 
in return jackson and his supporters were promised greater 
standing in the party up to half of the 25 atlarge slots on the 
democratic national committee and resources to campaign on behalf 
of the ticket this fall

the soviet union offered tuesday to scrap a radar 
station the united states says is in violation of the 
antiballistic missile treaty if washington will honor the 1972 
pact for at least 10 more years 
viktor p karpov chief of the foreign ministry disarmament 
section also repeated the kremlin contention that the krasnoyarsk 
radar station in siberia is aimed at monitoring space objects 
and thus outside the abm treaty which restricts superpower 
defenses against nuclear missiles 
some advisers to president reagan are said to recommend that he 
accuse the soviets of making a material breach of the treaty 
with the phasedarray radar station and abrogate the agreement 
other advisers have suggested reagan try to persuade the soviets 
to raze the facility in the interest of preserving the abm accord 
according to the pentagon a phasedarray radar is able to track 
many objects accurately meaning it could detect ballistic missiles 
and contribute to abm battle management 
karpov who is in charge of soviet arms negotiations told a 
news briefing that construction work at the radar station has been 
stopped as a sign of good will 
this moratorium is still in force he said karpov once led 
the kremlin delegation to ussoviet nuclear arms talks in geneva 
where negotiators now are discussing a 50 percent cut in strategic 
nuclear weapons 
he said the soviet union wants an arrangement that would commit 
the superpowers to the abm treaty for at least 10 years describing 
that as the necessary element for such an agreement on 
longrange nuclear arms 
in this framework we are prepared also for a radical solution 
to the krasnoyarsk radar issue raised by the americans he said 
if an understanding to abide by the abm treaty as signed in 
1972 is reached the soviet union will be ready to dismantle the 
krasnoyarsk radar in a verifiable way that would leave no doubts on 
the part of the united states the abm treaty limits how fast and 
far the united states can go in its plan for a spacebased defense 
against ballistic missiles 
the strategic defense initiative commonly called star wars 
is being carried out under what the reagan administration calls a 
strict interpretation of the treaty 
broader interpretation would provide more leeway and scrapping 
the agreement would remove all legal restraints on the us 
program which the soviets say represents a new and dangerous stage 
of the arms race

the remains of a soldier believed to be 
an american missing since world war ii have been discovered on a 
remote aleutian island the us fish amp wildlife service says 
our records show that 12 american soldiers were stationed 
there during world war ii and only 11 came home walt steiglitz 
the services regional director said monday after 45 years of 
missing in action the 12th soldier is finally coming home too 
fish amp wildlife biologists on buldir island found a skull leg 
arm and pelvic bones a few yards from their camp earlier this 
month the biologists are studying seabirds on the tiny rocky 
island about 1550 miles southwest of anchorage 
chuck diters an archaeologist at the agencys anchorage 
headquarters said american military boots an m1 rifle with 
bayonet an american coin and a pocketwatch inscribed with us 
were found with the bones 
a wallet also was recovered but diters said its contents were 
deteriorated too much to make an immediate identification of the 
owner 
the body was wedged into some large boulders as if the 
soldier may have been trying to escape from the weather said 
biologist mike boylan the terrain is very rough and disorienting 
there he probably got lost and died of exposure 
the remains were found about four miles from what is left of a 
military camp on the northwest corner of the island the remains 
and personal effects were being taken by boat to the us naval 
base at adak 
military spokesmen in anchorage said tuesday they did not know 
the name of the missing soldier or what would be the next step in 
identifying the remains 
a fish amp wildlife spokesman said the remains were found july 12 
or 13 but radio communications with buldir are difficult and he 
was not sure of the date 
the 5000acre island is halfway between attu and kiska two 
islands occupied by the japanese from 1942 to 1943 an american 
invasion drove the japanese from attu and they abandoned kiska a 
short time later 
no battles were fought on buldir which became the site of a 
12man us military weather station

the allegheny county bar association will 
investigate the treatment of women by the judicial system following 
a federal judges order that an attorney use her married name in 
court the association president said 
but thomas hollander said plans for the investigation were in 
place before the dispute erupted july 8 in the courtroom of us 
district judge hubert teitelbaum 
women have made a lot of progress but there is still a lot of 
ground to gain hollander said monday the same day several 
womens groups called for teitelbaums resignation 
fueling the formation of a bar association committee on women 
and the courts was teitelbaums threat to jail attorney barbara 
wolvovitz for refusing to use her husbands surname while 
practicing in his courtroom 
teitelbaum later apologized to ms wolvovitz and acknowledged 
she was legally entitled to use the name she chose 
hollander said the bar association has 53 committees and 
sections staffed by members of the bar and bench but he said he 
would be willing to have representatives from outside the legal 
profession serve on the new committee

a man convicted in the trailside slayings 
was sentenced to death for the second time tuesday for murdering 
five hikers in 1980 
david j carpenter 58 of san francisco had already been 
sentenced to death for murdering two women in 1981 in santa cruz 
county state parks 
superior court judge herbert hoffman on tuesday imposed the 
sentence recommended june 27 by the jury that convicted carpenter 
of firstdegree murder 
hoffman could have sentenced carpenter to life in prison without 
parole he refused to do so however after recounting carpenters 
criminal history since 1960 which involves at least eight violent 
attacks on women 
mr carpenter is without question a serial killer and a 
habitual criminal likely to commit violent acts against others 
hoffman said two previous periods of incarceration from 196069 
and 197079 had no effect on his criminal activity 
all appeals in capital cases go directly to the state supreme 
court 
marin county public defender frank cox had asked that 
carpenters life be spared arguing that he committed the crimes 
during moments of rage arising from a lifetime of abuse and 
rejection 
deputy district attorney john posey contended that carpenter 
shot the hikers executionstyle after his sexual advances were 
rejected and said carpenter deserved to die for the crimes four 
of the five 1980 victims were women 
carpenter also was convicted of raping two victims and trying to 
rape a third during his sixweek killing spree which left many of 
northern californias popular hiking areas nearly deserted until 
his may 1981 arrest 
his trial was moved to san diego after a judge ruled extensive 
publicity about the case prevented him from receiving a fair trial 
in northern california

agriculture secretary richard lyng beginning a 10state 
inspection of drought damage met tuesday with farmers in ohio and 
indiana who got some relief from nature but are hoping for more 
from washington 
as much as 2 inches of rain fell in the two states on monday 
and tuesday but at lyngs first stop john a scherers farm near 
shelby ohio the cornfields were still bone dry only a halfinch 
below the surface 
in indiana lyng said his department has received all the crop 
data required to assess requests for disaster declarations but 
gave no indication what assistance would be offered 
i dont think it will take very long for us to do an 
evaluation he said at avery sheets farm near west lafayette 
ind i would say in days rather than weeks or months 
at best sheets said he may harvest 30 percent of a normal crop 
from the 1000 acres he planted in corn it might be just all cob 
and no kernels he said showing an ear to lyng 
while the agriculture secretary expressed concern about the 
plight of farmers whose crops have withered under 100degree 
temperatures and a monthslong rainfall shortage several of the 
farmers said interest and aid might be too late 
lyng came knowing there werent any answers said jim 
rieman a farmer from crestline ohio 
in ohio lyng said he anticipated heavier losses than the 
national average 
this has always been a reliable production area lyng said 
and that might account for the low percentage of farmers with 
federal crop insurance the insurance is required to benefit from a 
disaster declaration lyng signed last week for farmers in ohio and 
missouri 
gov richard celeste who left the democratic national 
convention in atlanta to join lyng said ohios corn crop could be 
all but wiped out but he said rain may help some soybean fields 
recover 
we could lose twothirds or more of our corn crop celeste 
said theres nothing the rain can do except maybe for the 
soybeans 
lyng is also visiting farms in tennessee missouri iowa south 
dakota north dakota minnesota wisconsin and michigan

growers of hybrid corn for seed will have the 
option of planting their crop and not have it counted as a feed 
grain under 1988 acreage programs the agriculture department said 
tuesday 
acting undersecretary richard w goldberg said the hybrid seed 
corn may not be grown on acreage taken from production under 1988 
programs or on land enrolled in the longterm conservation reserve 
program 
further the additional acreage used to produce seed will not be 
counted when establishing base acreages for future feed grain 
crops he said farmers who decided to use this option will not be 
eligible for 1988 feed grain program benefits on the acres used for 
the seed crop 
goldberg said the action was taken to help offset the effects of 
drought on seed farms and to ensure that farmers will have enough 
seed for 1989 plantings 
the option is expected to be used primarily in southern areas 
where the growing season is longer interested producers can check 
with local offices of the agricultural stabilization and 
conservation service for further details he said

what if they gave a protest rally and nobody came 
its been happening a lot at the democratic national convention 
where the city took over a twoacre parking lot across the street 
from the convention site for use by demonstrators 
demonstrators with a tub to thump are finding that causes dear 
to their hearts are sometimes of little interest to just about 
anyone else 
sometimes even the demonstrators dont show up 
weeks before the convention groups requesting time at the lot 
were assigned twohour time slots for use of a cityprovided stage 
and sound system 
the lot holds some 35000 people but alternative 88 an 
umbrella organization for a number of protest groups went to us 
district court just before the convention seeking additional lots 
for demonstrators they lost and lost an appeal 
despite the court fights many of the scheduled demonstrators 
are not showing up and most who appear do so to an audience of only 
a few spectators many of them journalists 
an atlantabased conservative group didnt show up monday nor 
did a new york citybased group backing the independent 
presidential campaign of lenora fulani 
when fulani who had said she would bring 10000 supporters to 
atlanta appeared later monday there was a crowd of only about 
1000 many of whom were part of a march organized by civil rights 
leader hosea williams 
that was one of the larger crowds so far to occupy the lot 
legal a gay and lesbian rights organization brought about 2000 
on sunday 
about 15 people easily half of them journalists turned out 
tuesday morning to watch eugene delguardio complete with judicial 
robes stage a trial of house speaker jim wright 
about a dozen onlookers and reporters watched when the family of 
darrell alexander took the podium to urge that he be released from 
a jail in ghana he has been accused of trying to export parrots 
illegally from that west african nation 
several other groups drew tiny crowds and often were outnumbered 
by police assigned to the sweltering lot to ensure order 
there have been minor faceoffs between demonstrators and police 
at the lot and a demonstration by white supremacists was called 
off by the city when the marchers were outnumbered by angry 
counterdemonstrators police also canceled the groups rally on 
the steps of the capitol saying they wanted to avoid possible 
bloodshed 
many of the larger demonstrations have taken place away from the 
designated demonstration area 
police arrested 134 antiabortion protesters at the atlanta 
surgicenter about two miles from the convention hall on tuesday on 
monday about 1200 protesters went through downtown atlanta to 
protest alleged discriminatory lending policies for residents of 
poorer neighborhoods but the demonstrators but did not go to the 
demonstration lot 
tuesday morning when a scheduled demonstration by aids patients 
failed to materialize one group of officers passed the time ogling 
a scantily clad young woman who seemed to enjoy posing in the 
window of the omni hotel across the street from the demonstration 
lot 
doesnt anybody have any binoculars asked one the

the federal government contended tuesday that 
foreign policy and national security interests require a voice of 
america employee who wrote an article critical of the agency to 
submit the article to a censor before publication 
william dempster an assistant us attorney told a us 
district court judge that the state departments prepublication 
regulations are designed to help keep employees from violating the 
law 
substantial foreign policy and national security interests 
support the prepublication regulations he told the court 
such activity writing an unauthorized article could jeopardize 
security disrupt foreign relations and impair the mission of the 
agency 
at issue in the case is an article written by voice of america 
employee carolyn weaver that is scheduled to appear in the 
septemberoctober issue of the columbia journalism review ms 
weaver said in an affidavit that the article details political 
abuses by the voa including the apparent illegal use of voa 
programs for covert activity 
ms weavers attorney stephen m kohn told the court that the 
regulation is too broad goes too far 
ms weaver is a parttime worker a script writer for 
the voa she doesnt deal with secrets he said what they the 
government want to do is take regulations that cover the cia 
central intelligence agency expand the coverage and apply them 
to all employees who work in anything to do with foreign policy 
us district judge thomas penfield jackson took the case under 
advisement he said however he could not guarantee he would make 
a decision on issuing a preliminary injunction declaring the 
regulations unconstitutional in time for ms weaver to make her 
deadline of july 20 with the columbia journalism review 
kohn said afterward that if jackson rules against ms weaver he 
would seek an expedited review before the us court of appeals in 
washington 
ms weaver challenged the state department rules after she was 
ordered to submit the article to a censor 
under state department regulations that also apply to the voa 
employees of the us information agency and the agency for 
international development are required to submit their writings 
speeches or teaching materials on matters of official concern 
for clearance prior to publication 
according to the departments foreign affairs manual an 
employees work can be denied clearance if it discloses classified

policy or can reasonably be expected to affect adversely us 
foreign relations

armed with data which may change national 
estimates of the scope of the aids epidemic city health officials 
said tuesday that 200000 residents are infected with the virus 
half as many as they had estimated earlier 
however city health commissioner dr stephen joseph said the 
lower figure does not mean there will be fewer aids cases than had 
been projected and he said there should be no reduction in funding 
to fight the disease 
joseph said he informed the centers for disease control in 
atlanta of the citys revision tuesday morning since new york 
represents 23 percent of the aids cases nationally if they accept 
our methodology it will make some changes in their estimates 
the cdc which based its estimates on the same data used 
previously by new york estimates that 1 million to 15 million 
americans are infected with the hiv virus 
its really too early to tell if it will affect our figures 
said cdc spokesman charles fallis at this point were sticking 
with what we originally said 
the revision in the new york city estimates came just two months 
after the city released a fiveyear master plan based on the old 
figure the city plans to spend 334 million in aids prevention 
education and services this year 
it would really be a mistake for anybody or any group to take 
these figures and say because of that we can do less or because of 
that we can do differently joseph said at a news conference 
the new estimate today will not affect at all expenditures 
either in prevention or in services he said 
the city estimates there will be 43000 aids cases in new york 
by 1991 joseph said that figure was based on trends of past and 
current aids cases which we are quite confident are accurate 
the same cannot be said of the number of people infected with 
the hiv or human immunodeficiency virus joseph said that figure 
always has been just an estimate and one that at times varies 
widely 
the new figure for the number of new yorkers believed to be 
infected with hiv is based on recent studies in san francisco on 
the number of hivinfected homosexuals there joseph said it is 
assumed that the rate of infection is similar in the two cities 
there are 7499 gay men in new york city with aids and 4071 in 
san francisco using that ratio and data that estimates there are 
27517 homosexual and bisexual men infected with the hiv virus in 
san francisco officials theorize there are an estimated 50000 
hivinfected gay men in new york city rather than the previously 
estimated 200000 to 250000 
the number is significant because most health officials now 
agree that nearly all of those carrying the hiv virus will get aids 
the higher figures which the city has been using for nearly 
three years are based on decadesold data from the reserach of 
alfred charles kinsey that estimated that one out of 10 men engaged 
in homosexual behavior and on sample surveys indicating that there 
was a 50 percent hiv infection rate among homosexual men 
joseph said the san francisco data were considered more valid 
than old data because they are based on a much smaller tighter 
more homogeneous situation in addition he said san francisco 
is further ahead in seroprevalence data than anywhere else in the 
country 
seroprevalence data is based on blood tests that accurately show 
how many people are infected with the hiv virus 
the number of intravenous drug users believed to be carrying the 
hiv virus is unchanged we continue to estimate approximately 
100000 hivinfected people among the citys approximately 200000 
iv drug users said joseph

a judicial panel invalidated the results of 
five alcohol breathtesting machines casting doubt on more than 
1200 drunken driving arrests made over the last two years 
orange countys six traffic judges ruled monday that a state 
agency violated the law by not testing and recertifying the 
machines after they were sent back to the manufacturer for 
modifications two years ago 
about 4400 people have been arrested on drunken driving charges 
in the county in each of the last two years but the unusual mass 
challenge by defense lawyers only covered undecided cases 
prosecutors and defense attorneys disagree on how much the 
ruling will hurt the more than 1200 outstanding cases 
assistant state attorney pam smith had said earlier that the 
state could use other evidence such as videotapes field sobriety 
tests and officers testimony in many of the cases 
but stuart hyman one of two defense attorneys to argue the case 
last week said the machines were crucial to most cases 
unless a guy is fallingdown drunk on a videotape they the 
prosecution are hurting he said its one of their big pieces 
of evidence 
hyman predicted the state would be forced to allow many 
defendants to plead guilty to reduced reckless driving charges or 
that many more cases would go to trial 
sheriffs attorney bill vose said he did not expect the 
sheriffs office to stop using the machines i would expect that 
we would keep testing and ask the state to expedite its 
certification procedure he said 
but hyman said if they go out tonight and start testing 
people its unapproved 
the state health and rehabilitative services department 
certified the intoxilyzer 5000 machine for use in 1984 according 
to testimony at last weeks hearing about 60 are in use around the 
state and similar challenges have been filed in other counties 
however the orange county ruling is not binding on cases in 
other counties

the democratic national convention was supposed 
to open early tuesday to allow for protracted debate on the 
platform but when the starting time came the speakers werent 
there 
as a result the session opened only four minutes ahead of 
schedule at 411 pm 
unfortunately some of those members who desire and deserve be 
heard on these issues have not been able to arrive at this time 
said chairman jim wright at 3 pm 
in the next hour he suggested twice that anyone who wanted to 
address platform issues could come up to the podium microphone and 
do so nobody took him up on it 
he assured the convention that there would be no vote before the 
original starting time so that no advocate could steal a march on 
opponents 
convention officials with the concurrence of the michael 
dukakis and jesse jackson camps had decided earlier in the day to 
open at 3 pm to accommodate what wright called an ad hoc 
discussion 
the hall was only onethird full when wright made his first 
announcement by starting time about threefourths of the 
delegates were in their seats

vapors from chemicals being used in a 
furniture refinishing project caused the fire that gutted two 
office suites in the 38story union bank building fire officials 
said tuesday 
it was accidental said fire department spokesman jim wells 
chemical vapors made contact with an electrical outlet causing 
a flash fire 
monday nights blaze was a haunting reminder of the may 4 fire 
that killed one man and ravaged five floors of the citys tallest 
building the 62story first interstate bank building 
there were no deaths in the union bank fire but two of the 150 
firefighters called to battle flames on the 34th and 35th floors 
were treated by paramedics for exhaustion and heat 
a worker who was refinishing a bookcase on the 34th floor 
sustained minor burns said fire chief donald o manning 
the flames destroyed two office suites and caused slight damage 
to the surrounding area causing 500000 damage officials said 
officials said lessons learned in fighting the earlier fire 
helped fight monday nights blaze even though the union bank 
building like first interstate has no fire extinguishers 
manning said the fire was put out in less than 45 minutes 
because the alarm was sounded quickly also water was available 
and better communications were set up 
in the first interstate fire radios between fire floors and 
command officials outside failed to work but new more powerful 
radios prevented a communication problem monday night 
the union bank blaze gave new impetus to the move to hasten 
implementation of a law requiring sprinklers in highrises the 
union bank tower was built in 1966 prior to the 1974 city 
ordinance requiring sprinklers 
last friday the city council voted to mandate sprinklers within 
four years in 343 pre1974 highrises and sprinklers were actually 
in the process of being installed at union bank 
it is unconscionable to build highrises without sprinklers in 
them councilman marvin braude said after the monday blaze 
councilman nate holden agreed saying dragging our feet has 
already caused two major fires in la 
eightythree people in the union bank building escaped down 
stairwells most tenants were back inside on tuesday and operations 
were described as normal by bank officials 
i was jumping three steps at a time said bradley franks an 
asbestos removal worker who was on the 28th floor when he heard an 
evacuation call over the building intercom 
a few people were following and some stumbled and fell i was 
on the 16th floor when i saw firefighters coming up the stairs 
firefighters lugged hoses and others carried equipment weighing 
up to 100 pounds up 34 flights of stairs 
at midnight the building changed ownership the union bank 
tower became property of california first bank which acquired 
union bank in a 750 million transaction

dozens of vendors who paid up to 1500 for 
booths at the democratic national convention held a news conference 
tuesday to protest their locations in an exhibit hall far away from 
foot traffic in the world congress center 
we were told 40000 to 50000 people would be coming 
downstairs they dont even know were here said dr penny rich 
a california physician trying to sell copies of a book she wrote 
about drug abuse 
she and others demanded refunds and said they should be moved to 
hightraffic areas in other parts of the sprawling complex across 
from the omni convention hall 
mark weiner marketing manager of the convention said vendors 
would be offered full refunds if they wanted to leave or 50 percent 
refunds if they wanted to move to a more centrally located ballroom 
weiner president of a cranston ri company called financial 
innovations said there were about 180 booths at the convention 
with some companies operating more than one licenses cost from 
750 to 1500 per booth 
weiner said he never made any guarantees about how many 
people would find their way to exhibit hall which is in the 
basement of the building in a different wing from the press and 
democratic party operations 
don fowler chief executive officer of the convention issued a 
statement saying the party would try to encourage delegates and 
guests to purchase souvenirs from smallbusiness vendors in the 
exhibit hall the party will do everything possible to publicize 
their location and also relocate some vendors to areas that are 
heavily trafficked fowler said 
a member of the democratic national committee from west 
virginia who didnt identify himself told the protesting vendors 
he was sure other dnc members would sympathize with their plight 
i knew you were there it took me over an hour to find you last 
night he said 
rich said she had sold three copies of the cracked pipe her 
book at 5 apiece since the convention began it cost me 500 
to get them printed she said 
the vendors said they were losing up to 1000 a day in expenses 
and charged that weiner who gets a cut of whatever they make set 
aside 10 souvenir booths for himself in the most heavily traveled 
part of the world congress center 
weiner said those booths are operated jointly by his company and 
atlanta 88 the citys convention host committee we have always 
told everyone that we would have official booths at the congress 
center and around town he said 
a labor dispute may be an embarrassment to the democrats but at 
least one vendor said she disagreed with a protestors threats to 
vote republican this fall 
it wouldnt make me vote for george bush said cartoonist 
susan denison of orlando fla that would be a little drastic

afghan guerrillas fired 15 rockets 
into a residential area of kabul on tuesday killing 11 people 
wounding 23 and destroying several homes afghanistans state radio 
reported 
before the report tuesday the communist government of 
afghanistan said 165 rockets had hit kabul and other cities since 
may 15 when soviet troops began withdrawing under an agreement 
mediated by the united nations 
most attacks have been aimed at the capital where the 
government of president najib said rockets killed 20 people friday 
moslem guerrillas began fighting in afghanistan after a 
communist coup in april 1978 and soviet military forces entered the 
country in december 1979 under the april 14 geneva agreement the 
estimated 115000 soviet soldiers in afghanistan are to be out by 
feb 15 1989 
the insurgents most of whom are based in pakistan deny firing 
rockets into residential areas abdul haq a commander with the 
hezbiislami guerrilla group led by younis khalis said their 
targets in kabul are military installations the soviet embassy and 
the airport 
haq claimed most rockets that hit civilians are fired by the 
soviets or government forces in an attempt to discredit the 
insurgents 
kabul radio said the government had lodged its 53rd complaint 
with the un observer team accusing pakistan afghanistans 
eastern neighbor of violating the geneva accord 
more than 5 million afghans about onethird of the population 
have fled their country in a decade of civil war at least 3 
million live in camps and cities along the frontier with pakistan 
that serve as bases and supply points for the guerrillas 
pakistan and afghanistan signed the agreement it is guaranteed 
by the soviet union and the united states which supports the 
insurgents the guerrillas were not a party to it and have 
continued fighting 
western diplomats in islamabad speaking on condition of 
anonymity said recent bombing raids by the afghan air force in the 
south killed 70 villagers and 16 insurgents 
they reported heavy fighting in the kandahar area of southern 
afghanistan and said guerrillas claimed to have overrun the 
garrison town of shahrisafa 35 miles north of kandahar on the 
strategic highway to kabul last friday 
the diplomats gave these reports of activity in eastern 
aghanistan 
no supply convoys have reached the besieged city of asmar in the 
northeastern kunar province since one got through in midjune from 
jalalabad 70 miles to the south 
most civilians have abandoned the asmar area at the northern 
edge of the kunar valley scene of heavy fighting in july and the 
provincial capital asadabad 18 miles to the south may fall soon 
guerrilla positions in the mountains above the kunar valley make 
resupply by air difficult and soldiers in urgun 18 miles from the 
pakistan border receive air drops only at night the same system 
is used at the besieged city of khost in paktia province

searchers found no sign of eight missing 
navy helicopter crew members on tuesday more than 24 hours after 
their sea dragon crashed outside the golden gate 
a fivemember investigation board began going over pieces from 
the mh53e sea dragon which went down during a minesweeping 
exercise on monday 
the wreckage was recovered by coast guard cutters searching for 
debris and survivors though officials said there was virtually no 
hope left for the crew 
yesterday monday afternoon they were searching about 10 
square miles and today theyll expand the search going farther 
out because of the wind and currents said coast guard petty 
officer dave anderton 
although the coast guard said monday it expected to find no 
survivors anderton said the search would continue as long as there 
was a chance anyone was alive 
navy divers were preparing to explore the chilly 60footdeep 
water 11 miles west of the golden gate for wreckage of the 
helicopter one of four mh53e aircraft based at the alameda naval 
air station on the east side of san francisco bay 
the aircraft is a minesweeping version of the ch53e super 
stallion a cargo and troopcarrying chopper that twice has been 
the object of congressional inquiries 
twenty servicemen have died in previous crashes of ch53e 
copters according to andrew lightbody editorial director for 
international defense images magazine in irvine 
louis franecke a san francisco lawyer representing families of 
service people killed in crashes of the 53e helicopters said in 
tuesdays editions of the san francisco examiner that family 
members have told him crewmen are often asked to sign legal waivers 
before they go up 
a navy spokesman in washington dc said the allegation was 
absolutely false lt bruce cole also said crewmen are not 
asked to sign waivers before going up in any kind of helicopter 
lt elizabeth kerstens a spokewoman for the marine corps which 
also uses 53e helicopters said there was no such requirement 
the captain of the salmonfishing boat lovely martha said he 
heard two distinct explosions several moments after he saw three 
puffs of smoke rise over the fog bank 
there was a tremendous explosion there were a lot of pieces 
of the helicopter pontoons wheels all kinds of things 
floating around it was total annihilation skipper frank rescino 
said 
the captain of another fishing boat northern light said the 
noises didnt sound like a fire or fuel explosion 
it sounded like it hit and bounced and then hit again said 
skipper jim koskela i called it impact it wasnt an explosion 
like wood hitting water just magnified 
navy spokesman valente would not confirm or deny whether there 
were explosions saying it could be detrimental to the 
investigation 
in february 1987 the navy and marine corps grounded all ch53e 
and mh53e helicopters cole said all those models were inspected 
because of problems with part of the power train and then returned 
to operation 
cole said the helicopters described as the largest in the 
western world did not have an abnormally high accident record 
the orange county register using documents obtained through the 
freedom of information act reported in 1987 that in its first five 
years of service the ch53e had the worst safety record of any 
helicopter in the navy or marine corps 
last may the house armed services committee began a special 
inquiry into the aircraft at the request of rep robert badham 
rcalif 
badham said monday the investigation showed there is no 
inherent design or mechanical flaw in the manufacture or design 
the investigation found that the accidents were caused by pilot 
error or a broken piece of equipment not common to the crashes 
badham said

a major association of country banks said 
tuesday it supports droughtaid legislation in congress that would 
pour up to 7 billion into stricken areas to help farmers recover 
from crop and livestock losses 
the independent bankers association of america which says that 
half its members are agricultural banks sent letters to members of 
the senate and house agricultural committees in support of bills 
awaiting final action when congress returns to work on july 26 
a version approved by the senate committee would provide 
payments of up to 100000 to droughtstricken farmers president 
reagan has indicated he would sign such legislation 
association presidentelect o jay tomson charles city iowa 
said a special committee concluded that the legislation deserves 
our full support and prompt enactment 
the legislation would replace a major portion of the income lost 
by crop farmers in 1988 due to heat and drought by reallocating 
money that would otherwise have gone to farmers as deficiency 
payments to compensate them for low commodity prices 
drought has cut production and forced up prices meaning the 
payments will be less thus the savings would be used to 
finance the drought benefits 
in addition livestock dairy and poultry producers would be 
provided financial aid to help cover higher feed costs and help 
them keep their foundation stock

winstonsalem nc ap the stepfather of a man accused of 
four murders said the family tried to have michael charles hayes 
committed to a mental hospital but were told by a sheriffs 
officer to wait until monday 
it seems to me monday was a little bit late said garris 
edwards his stepson hayes is accused of killing four people and 
wounding five others in a roaming 12minute shooting spree on 
sunday so far hayes has been charged with two counts of 
firstdegree murder 
sheriff preston oldham refused comment tuesday pending 
completion of the investigation 
hayes was shot and critically wounded after allegedly opening 
fire on sheriffs deputies 
edwards said monday that family members also tried to have hayes 
committed when he was taken to a hospital earlier saturday hayes 
reportedly injured his hand beating a wall 
however roger rollman a spokesman for north carolina baptist 
hospital said tuesday that there was no apparent effort to seek 
involuntary commitment for hayes rollman said he interviewed all 
medical personnel who came in contact with hayes and his stepfather 
saturday night 
rollman said hayes came to the hospital saturday night with a 
finger injury on the left hand about an hour later rollman said 
he left the emergency room against medical advice and without 
getting his finger treated there was no indication in the record 
that anything was said about having the man committed 
it is routine for us in the course of a year to have people 
come in and say they need to have someone committed on an 
involuntary basis rollman said 
friends and family of hayes told the dispatch of lexington that 
his behavior had changed drastically several days before the 
shootings 
hayes who had been living in a trailer had financial and 
personal troubles friends told the newspaper he moved into his 
moped shop about a week ago after he and his wife who is nine 
months pregnant separated 
edwards told wsjswtqr radio on monday that he had told hospital 
workers saturday that hayes had cracked up and lost it but 
they declined to commit him 
edwards said he also talked to a lieutenant at the forsyth 
county sheriffs department on sunday morning and was told the 
commitment process would take eight hours the lieutenant told 
hayes family members that the commitment could wait until monday 
according to edwards 
rollman said to begin the process for involuntary commitment a 
person would undergo a psychiatric examination followed by 
paperwork detailing the results a clerk of court would review and 
then sign papers if commitment was deemed appropriate 
sheriffs deputies would pick up the person to be committed and 
take him to the specific facility rollman said 
hayes who was shot six times in the back groin and leg was 
listed in critical condition tuesday a hospital spokesman said the 
chances for his recovery was good 
the dead were thomas walter nicholson 24 of winstonsalem 
crystal susan cantrell 16 of winstonsalem ronald lee hull 32 
of winstonsalem and melinda yvonne hayes 21 of lexington 
oldham said miss hayes was not a relative of hayes

a lebanese man on trial for the 
1985 hijacking of a twa jetliner refused to say tuesday if bombs 
seized during his arrest were for terrorist attacks and instead 
denounced the united states and israel 
mohammed ali hamadis rambling denunciation was interrupted by 
chief judge heiner mueckenberger who adjourned the session 
hamadi in a loud agitated voice said he would no longer take 
part in his trial 
the hijackers seized the plane in june 1985 held 39 americans 
captive in beirut for 17 days and killed us navy diver robert 
stethem 
scheduled to testify wednesday is hamadis older brother abbas 
who was convicted of kidnapping two west germans in lebanon 
abbas hamadi was arrested jan 26 1987 at frankfurt airport 
after returning to west germany following the kidnappings of west 
germans rudolf cordes and alfred schmidt schmidt was freed in 
september but cordes remains a hostage 
as the trial entered its third week court officials questioned 
hamadi about a telephone notebook found on him when he was arrested 
also at frankfurt airport on jan 13 1987 
the officials said one of the names in the notebook sounded 
similar to one of the other three alleged hijackers mueckenberger 
indicated without elaboration that some of the names may have a 
connection to bombs or bombings in france 
the court also heard testimony from two customs officials and 
three police experts who described the explosives found in 
hamadis baggage when he was arrested in a random check 
as the days session neared its scheduled end hamadi asked that 
he be allowed to read a statement which he said would explain his 
motives for smuggling explosives into west germany 
it was an evil deed and i condemn it he said speaking in 
arabic through an interpreter i condemn the link brought in this 
court of these explosives with france 
under questioning he refused to say if he knew whether the 
explosives he was carrying were to be used in terrorist attacks 
then hamadi began to give a rambling condemnation of the united 
states and israel mentioning what he called the interference of 
the united states for many years and citing hiroshima and 
vietnam 
at that point mueckenberger interrupted hamadi saying the 
court is not the place to hear world history 
hamadis defense lawyers objected and the judge allowed hamadi 
to continue 
reading loudly from a written statement hamadi went on to call 
the united states israels greatest ally whose military and 
political support for israel is growing he said israel killed 
tens of thousands of my lebanese countrymen and destroyed hundreds 
of homes 
after hamadi began to criticize the united states for shooting 
down an iran air airbus earlier this month the judge again 
interrupted saying he wanted to adjourn the trial 
i see that it is forbidden for me to read my statement i see 
that i am being treated as a criminal and not as political 
hamadi said breaking off the sentence as the judge formally closed 
the session 
hamadi speaking in a very agitated voice then said he would 
refuse to give any more testimony 
earlier tuesday lawyer rainer hamm said twa pilot john l 
testrake of richmond mo chief flight attendant uli derickson 
and flight engineer benjamin zimmermann of cascade idaho had 
joined in the prosecution none of the three was present tuesday 
the procedure is common practice in west german criminal trials 
those permitted to intervene in the case are allowed to ask 
questions during the trial and raise objections much the same as 
prosecutors the procedure also gives them the right to appeal if 
they are unsatisfied with the verdict 
miss derickson is credited with preventing any more passengers 
from being killed by talking to the hijackers and diverting their 
attention 
hamm is representing 11 americans including stethems parents 
and former hostages who have joined in the prosecution

michael dukakis 84yearold mother and rep 
claude pepper the oldest member of congress led senior citizens 
in a rally tuesday for longterm healthcare legislation that 
pepper promises to make a national campaign issue 
unfortunately our present administration has wanted to do as 
little with government applied to peoples needs as possible that 
is not what michael dukakis is going to do said euterpe dukakis 
mrs dukakis who said she had required home care three times 
herself predicted that if her son is elected president he would 
push for passage of legislation for longterm care sponsored by 
pepper that failed in the house this year 
pepper 87 the miami democrat whos attending his 13th 
convention he gave a nominating speech for franklin d roosevelt 
at the 1940 national convention recounted how his bill was 
defeated because of concerns over its costs and a jurisidictional 
battle among committee chairmen 
of course theyre going to have answer to the people this 
fall those who voted callously against the needy american 
people said pepper he has no opposition for reelection to the 
house this year and plans to campaign nationally for his 
healthcare bill 
the bill estimated to cost 27 billion in its first five years 
would provide federally assisted home health care to the 
chronically ill of all ages it would be funded by requiring about 
8 million workers who make more than 45000 a year to pay medicare 
taxes on all their wages not just the first 45000 as under 
present law 
accompanying pepper and mrs dukakis at the news conference were 
two 5yearold atlanta children who would benefit from such 
legislation they were michael perry who has been comatose since 
nearly drowning more than a year ago and coley cooper who 
suffered brain damage in a neardrowning two years ago 
i cant believe the heart of america is unconcerned about

the democratic national convention was supposed 
to open early tuesday to allow for protracted debate on the 
platform but when the starting time came the speakers werent 
there 
as a result the session opened only four minutes ahead of 
schedule at 411 pm 
unfortunately some of those members who desire and deserve be 
heard on these issues have not been able to arrive at this time 
said chairman jim wright at 3 pm 
in the next hour he suggested twice that anyone who wanted to 
address platform issues could come up to the podium microphone and 
do so nobody took him up on it 
he assured the convention that there would be no vote before the 
original starting time so that no advocate could steal a march on 
opponents 
convention officials with the concurrence of the michael 
dukakis and jesse jackson camps had decided earlier in the day to 
open at 3 pm to accommodate what wright called an ad hoc 
discussion 
the hall was only onethird full when wright made his first 
announcement by starting time about threefourths of the 
delegates were in their seats

us officials are in east germany inspecting 
nuclear missile sites in compliance with the superpowers 
intermediate nuclear forces treaty the staterun news agency adn 
said tuesday 
adn in a brief report said that two us inspection teams 
arrived in east germany on monday one team began checking a 
missile site near the town of waren about 70 miles north of berlin 
the same day 
the east german news agency also said the other us inspection 
team started checking a second site tuesday at koenigsbrueck about 
15 miles north of dresden 
according to adn the soviets maintained missiles at the sites 
until february when they decided to remove them early to set a 
positive example in nuclear disarmament 
the inspections in east germany come as two teams of soviet 
inspectors checked nuclear missile sites in britain which also 
fall under the inf agreement 
soviet teams have already conducted inspections at missile sites 
in west germany and the united states this month at the same time 
us inspection teams began deploying to warsaw pact locations 
the inspections fall under the terms of the inf treaty signed in 
washington last dec 8 by soviet leader mikhail gorbachev and 
president reagan 
the treaty provides for the elimination within three years of 
all nuclear missiles with ranges from 340 miles to 3000 miles

the next president likely will face 
accelerating deterioration of stability in central america 
unless us policymakers find a consensus on helping the 
nicaraguan rebels president reagans national security adviser 
said tuesday 
in a rare speaking appearance lt gen colin d powell told a 
foreign affairs audience that the battle over nicaraguan policy in 
the united states is reminiscent of divisiveness in the vietnam war 
era he called central america an area of latent crisis 
in a speech to the los angeles world affairs council powell 
said that when we are united as we have been in support of the 
afghan freedom fighters or of a solid nato or of a new basis for 
ussoviet relations or of a vital commitment in the persian 
gulf we can achieve a great deal 
but recent history also teaches that when we are divided over 
tactics as in central america our policy suffers grievously and 
our national interest does too powell said 
in answering questions after his speech powell said that he is 
encouraged by irans announcement monday that it would accept a 
un ceasefire resolution in its 8yearold war with iraq 
it is a breakthrough in my judgment but it is only a first 
step powell said in answer to questions from the council the 
war goes on it goes on right now today 
asked if the us naval presence would be withdrawn from the 
persian gulf if the ceasefire does stick powell said it did not 
we have had vessels in the persian gulf since 1949 he said 
because of the importance of that waterway and because of our 
strategic interest in the region i do not see us ever removing our 
forces from the persian gulf 
he added that if there were no longer threats to neutral 
shipping in the gulf we could review our force structure and 
adjust it accordingly 
powells comments on central america came in the wake of actions 
by col enrique bermudez to consolidate leadership of the contra 
rebel force and renewed diplomatic tensions between the united 
states and nicaragua who have expelled several of each others 
envoys 
the administration has signaled that it supports a bill 
introduced by senate minority leader bob dole rkan which among 
other things would include 20 million in military assistance to 
be held in escrow for the presidents use against the sandinista 
regime in managua 
in his speech powell said that unless congress and the 
president come to agreement on a program of effective aid for 
the nicaraguan resistance as an adjunct to our diplomatic strategy 
the next president will probably face a situation of accelerating 
deterioration as all the local democracies will come under growing 
strains as nicaragua grows stronger more assertive and more 
aggressive 
last week you all saw the reaction of the sandinista regime 
to legitimate political protest powell said referring to the 
shutdowns of a newspaper and radio station and the expulsion of 
american ambassador richard melton who was accused of engaging in 
activities undermining the state 
can there be any further doubt about the totalitarian nature 
of the ruling junta in managua powell asked 
on other subjects the national security adviser said 
the administration has recovered from the aberration of 
irancontra 
powell said administration officials are working harder to keep 
members of congress informed of sensitive national security matters 
he plans to return to active duty in the army when reagans 
term ends next january 
i expect to go back to a nice quiet foxhole where i can serve 
my country in a more comfortable and perhaps less exposed 
position he said 
the american people clearly do not want to see a repetition 
of the period of military weakness that we went through in the wake 
of the vietnam war

a soviet official said on 
tuesday that inspections in the united states and europe show a 
superpower treaty scrapping intermediaterange nuclear missiles is 
being implemented without cheating 
vyacheslav s lebedev made the remark after he and 19 other 
soviet inspectors landed at this air force base to start counting 
us cruise missiles in britain in accordance with the treaty 
the soviet inspectors arrived at greenham common 50 miles west 
of london aboard a blueandwhite aeroflot ilyushin jet they were 
welcomed by a delegation of us and british officers 
greenham common is one of two us cruise missile bases in 
britain the other is at molesworth 50 miles north of london both 
bases are run by us air force personnel but are technically 
british royal air force bases 
the base has 96 operational missiles and five backup missiles 
while there are another 16 operational missiles at molesworth the 
us military says 
lebedev said that based on similar inspections this month in 
the united states the soviet union and west germany no one seemed 
to be cheating on the terms of the intermediaterange nuclear 
forces treaty signed in washington on dec 8 by soviet leader 
mikhail gorbachev and president reagan 
the experience of the inspections has shown that the ussr 
and united states strictly implemented the treaty signed by them 
and the first steps as to its realization are successful said 
lebedev 
soviet inspectors arrived in the united states july 16 to 
inspect some of the 14 us missile sites training facilities and 
industrial plants these include fort sill in southwestern 
oklahoma which has 37 pershing 2 missiles and redstone arsenal in 
huntsville ala home of the army missile command that manages the 
pershing 1a and pershing 2 nuclear missile programs 
the treaty provides for the elimination within three years of 
all nuclear missiles with ranges of 340 miles to 3000 miles and 
includes stringent inspection provisions to guard against cheating 
at greenham common a customs and immigration post was set up to 
receive the soviets and check the cameras geiger counters and 
other equipment they were allowed to bring for the inspection 
they are to stay at the base overnight in converted servicemens 
accommodations and are to eat meals at a cafeteria on the base 
under the treaty the inspectors may check the missiles and 
their 55foot mobile launchers which are to be taken back to the 
united states and destroyed but not the warheads 
the soviets were to declare wednesday exactly what they want to 
see at the bases they may also place security men at all entry and 
exit roads to ensure no missiles are surreptitiously moved out the 
defense ministry said 
were entirely in the soviets hands said defense ministry 
spokesman martin helms they will say where they want to go 
the inspectors who will be flown to molesworth from greenham 
common will not be allowed to step outside the bases during their 
stay which is expected to last up to 4 days or until the 
inspection is completed 
us officers mostly from an onsite inspection agency based in 
west germany will accompany the soviets as they examine the 
missiles and launchers soviet inspectors first checked missiles in 
western europe on july 1 at two west german sites housing 
pershing2 rockets 
the current inspections are part of a 60day period of 
baseline inspections to determine the accuracy of data 
exchanged by the two sides the soviets are visiting 30 sites in 
the united states and western europe while us inspectors are 
visiting 133 soviet sites 
so far no violations have been discovered us officials say 
and the inspections are about 25 percent complete 
the soviets notified the british of their visit on monday 
officials said under the 16hour noticeofinspection rule 
in november 1983 greenham common was the first western european 
base to accept us cruise missiles under a december 1979 nato 
alliance accord

a federal grand jury began hearing 
witnesses on tuesday in the massive pentagon bribery investigation 
while a major contractor fired all its defensecontract consultants 
and shook up the management of one division 
unisys corp whose offices on long island ny have been 
searched by federal agents announced that its own independent 
investigation begun last fall by former watergate special 
prosecutor henry ruth had uncovered activity contrary to company 
policy 
unisys chairman w michael blumenthal a former treasury 
secretary placed a long island division under new management put 
some employees on administrative leave and terminated all 
consulting contracts with those who represented the company before 
the federal government on defenserelated matters 
meanwhile an attorney for defense consultant and former navy 
official melvyn paisley filed motions to quash 11 subpoenas from 
the grand jury and to be advised if the government conducted any 
illegal electronic surveillance of his client 
in all 275 subpoenas mostly for documents and records were 
due to be answered in alexandria on tuesday sharon dibbley 
spokeswoman for us attorney henry hudson said the government had 
arranged a location which she would not identify where lawyers 
and those under subpoena could deliver records without being 
observed by reporters 
many of the subpoenas are to persons who are only potential 
witnesses in the investigation and not targets of it 
ms dibbley had no comment on the paisley motion to quash his 
subpoenas and said she knew of no objections filed to the other 
subpoenas 
the only recognizable figure to arrive for the morning session 
of the grand jury in the us courthouse was jack a sherman a 
civilian employee of the marine corps who supervised equipment 
purchases shermans office was searched by federal agents in a 
series of coordinated raids on june 14 which brought the nearly 
2yearold probe to public attention 
no one has been charged yet in the probe of the 
150billionayear pentagon purchasing system but government 
documents show that investigators are looking allegations that 
defense contractors and consultants many of them former military 
men bribed pentagon officials for contracting details that could 
be vital in winning contracts worth billions of dollars 
sherman who has been transferred to other duties pending the 
outcome of the investigation was a supervisory negotiator for the 
contracts division of installation and logistics office of the 
marine corps he has been a civilian employee of the marine corps 
since 1971 and was a civilian navy employee from 1957 to 1971 
according to pentagon records sherman is a gs14 making 
between 46600 and 60683 
neither he nor his attorney would comment on his appearance at 
the courthouse it could not be determined if he was actually 
brought before the grand jury 
other witnesses however were seen entering and leaving the 
grand jury room later in the day at a lunch break assistant us 
attorney joseph aronica who is in charge of the grand jury told 
reporters there wont be any luminaries during the first day 
the grand jury is expected to be back in session wednesday 
paisleys attorney e lawrence barcella said he filed a motion 
to quash the 11 subpoenas issued for paisley who served as 
assistant navy secretary for research engineering and systems from 
december 1981 to april 1987 when he became a consultant 
in addition barcella said we asked the government to affirm 
or deny whether they used illegal electronic surveillance even the 
fact that they may have gotten authorization does not mean their 
wiretap was applied for and carried out in a legal matter before 
we comply with a subpoena we want to insure that the government 
has carried out its responsibilities under the wiretap statute in 
an appropriate and accurate manner 
earlier the government released the search warrant for paisley 
which indicated that fbi agents were investigating whether he 
received payments from general dynamics mcdonnell douglas and 
pratt amp whitney while he worked for the pentagon the warrant also 
showed the government is investigating consulting work he has done 
since leaving the government for 10 different defense contractors 
at unisys blumenthal said in a letter to company employees that 
the giant computer company formed by the merger of sperry and 
burroughs had pledged full cooperation with hudsons investigation 
we expect and encourage each of our employees also to 
cooperate fully in responding to the governments inquiries 
blumenthal wrote 
the new management was installed at the former sperry 
surveillance and fire control division in great neck ny 
blumenthal said the government searched unisys offices in great 
neck on june 14 
federal agents also searched offices or homes of charles 
gardner consultant and former general manager and vice president 
at the unisys great neck plant dennis mitchell administrative 
aide at the plant armtec a florida company owned by consultant 
william w roberts who retired after 30 years with sperry william 
galvin a consultant who worked for unisys among other companies 
james kane founder of the long island aerospace political action 
committee and paisley who also did some work for unisys 
mitchell is reported by several newspapers to have handed checks 
to rep roy dyson dmd as campaign contributions during a tour 
he made of the unisys plant a year ago those checks and others 
later mailed totaled 14000 the reports have said the government 
has searched the offices of richard seelmeyer a former 
congressional aide and maryland air charter pilot who is reported 
to have arranged dysons flight to long island 
blumenthal said he was establishing a senior management approval 
process for all consulting agreements and congressional honoraria 
he also announced the hiring of the washington law firm of 
covington amp burling to aid the company in enforcing an ethics 
program introduced a year ago 
although our internal investigation is not concluded 
blumenthal said to date it indicates that certain division 
employees and consultants appear to have had a history of engaging 
at sperry in activities which are contrary to the policies and 
procedures put in place by unisys these practices appear to have 
continued in the new company 
the division employes 2500 of unisys 90000 employees and had 
1987 revenue of 300 million with beforetax profits of 18 million 
blumenthal said the internal inquiry begun without knowledge of 
the governments investigation focused on the use of outside 
consultants and whether any division funds had been diverted for 
improper use

leftist political leader mario 
aguinada carranza says he has canceled his planned return to el 
salvador because of government threats that he will be arrested 
aguinada secretarygeneral of the nationalist democratic union 
party told the associated press by telephone from mexico that the 
threats clearly show the lack of guarantees in the country 
when party leaders last week announced plans to return 
information minister roberto viera told reporters that military 
authorities should take aguinada into custody because there are 
national and foreign press reports saying he is a leader of the 
fmln 
the fmln is the farabundo marti national liberation front the 
coalition of five leftist guerrilla groups that have fought the 
ussupported government since 1980 it is allied with the 
democratic revolutionary front or fdr the lefts legal political 
umbrella organization 
it is one thing that leaders of the fdr can enter the country 
to seek legitimacy and political legality and another that a member 
of the fmln wants to enter the country viera said 
aguinada interviewed monday denied he was ever a guerrilla 
commander he helped found the democratic revolutionary front in 
1980 
he said one reason leaders of his nationalist democratic union 
party want to return is to reactivate its 1969 registration as a 
legal political party

small amounts of medical debris were 
found on beaches in rhode island and massachusetts on tuesday more 
than 100 miles from the new york and new jersey shores where 
larger quantities of medical waste have washed up in past weeks 
the waste poses no specific health risk officials said but 
some states closed the affected beaches 
rhode island officials said they had little doubt the needles 
and syringes catheter bags rubber tubing and respirator parts 
were related to the other finds some waste also was found on 
connecticut beaches last week 
the waste likely is part of a sweeping arc of medical garbage 
that someone has dropped off the eastern shore said rhode island 
health director h denman scott 
health officials in rhode island and connecticut said tests 
revealed little health risks associated with the debris even 
though a handful of vials found in new jersey and new york earlier 
this month contained blood that tested positive for the aids virus 
aesthetically its a problem nobody wants to swim in 
garbage said dr matthew cartter coordinator of the connecticut 
health departments epidemiology program 
but from an epidemiological point of view there has never 
been an outbreak because of disposal of infectious waste he said 
monday 
dr barbara debuono chief of disease control for rhode islands 
health department said tuesday that sun and salt water should have 
effectively removed any infectious material from the items 
its highly unlikely a person stepping on a needle would 
contract hepatitis or the deadly acquired immune deficiency 
syndrome she said 
tests on three syringes found at southern rhode island beaches 
turned up no signs of blood or contaminants the state health 
department said those beaches will stay open officials said 
peter look a health official in edgartown mass said marthas 
vineyard beaches would also stay open despite discovery of some 
empty medical vials and several syringes 
new york city officials meanwhile were waiting for two 
consecutive clean tides before lifting the swimming ban at several 
city beaches shut when medical waste washed ashore said parks 
commissioner henry stern 
about 90 items including syringes and bottles were found on 
beaches in the new york city area monday 
in new jersey a swimming ban remained in effect for some 
beaches in asbury park and ocean grove after water samples 
continued to show high levels of fecal coliform bacteria usually 
associated with human waste 
its coming from somewhere and its very frustrating not to 
know where because were very concerned it will happen again 
said anthony del pizzo head of beach operations in asbury park 
where a fiveday ban on swimming was lifted sunday on all but one 
beach

the most precious commodity in a political 
campaign more than money or endorsements or straw hats with red 
white and blue bunting is what insiders refer to as the body 
this week the body belongs to one michael stanley dukakis 
to see what the democrats want to achieve during convention 
week its instructive to consider how the governor is spending his 
time here his schedule reveals a sharp departure from the strategy 
of nominees past 
the dukakis campaign has junked the nominees ritual 
conventionweek meetings with delegates in the past a fellow like 
walter mondale or george mcgovern would begin his convention day 
with breakfast remarks to say the oklahoma delegation and then 
go on to a brief appearance before for example the upper midwest 
hispanic agricultural caucus 
the dukakis people have changed all that the plans for gov 
dukakis this week have taken the nominee out of his partys 
smokefilled buffets and instead into the community for some 
wellpublicized and carefully considered public events 
ranging from his sunday night family reunion at cousin panos 
restaurant in buckhead to the monday morning unity meeting with 
jesse jackson the democratic nomineetobe is balancing political 
duties with the developing imagery of a common man 
dukakis main events were plotted in advance as symbols of three 
issues he hopes to pursue in his fall campaign against george bush 
his concern with drug abuse his endorsement of plant closing 
legislation and his support for civil rights enforcement 
an eventaday was scheduled to demonstrate the democratic 
position on these issues 
for example on tuesday dukakis traveled over to sweet auburn 
for a tour of the martin luther king center this is a man who 
during his 17month primary campaign traveled to hundreds of cities 
in 40odd states who did events morning noon and night and it 
was rare that he would make his way into the black community 
right or wrong dukakis simply conceded the primary black vote 
to jesse jackson against bush he is conceding nothing so there 
he was with coretta scott king talking about the link between 
greek immigrants and american blacks 
the other major element of dukakis carefully crafted atlanta 
day may be even more significant his schedulers have allotted as 
much as 90 minutes a day for the governor to conduct television 
interviews with local tv stations around the country this is a 
huge chunk of time considering the number of party officials fat 
cats and humble print journalists who would kill for a minute of 
the nominees conventionweek time 
at the hyatt regency a hotel room has been wired for video and 
sound dukakis merely has to walk down the hall from his suite 
while interviewers are shuttled in and out 
of course the best laid plans many of the tv interviews 
have been canceled as other events crowded in and on monday 
dukakis had to scrap a factory gate appearance to find time for the 
dukakis parlay with jesse jackson and at least one special 
interest caucus got a dukakis visit hispanic congressmen 
all business and no pleasure would make mikey a dull boy and so 
interspersed amongst his convention events dukakis has found time 
for his daily power walk an exercise routine no press coverage 
and for latenight family dinners

of course dukakis hasnt got the only body in town sen lloyd 
bentsen the designated running mate has a full plate of 
delegation breakfasts and special interest caucuses

a pay dispute disrupted a coal mines 
operations for two days authorities said tuesday and the 
government said retail price inflation reached 567 percent in the 
first half of the year 
wages went up even more by 638 percent said the report 
published in the government newspaper rzeczpospolita the increase 
would put the national average wage on july 1 at the equivalent of 
about 106 a month compared to 91 on jan 1 
workers in some plants struck in april and may for higher wages 
to offset 27 percent price increases imposed in february since 
then both prices and wages have gone higher than the government 
had planned 
official say they want to analyze economic statistics for the 
first half of 1988 before starting new talks with official trade 
unions on adjusting wageandprice policy 
in one instance of wage pressure the state news agency pap said 
tuesday that two days of labormanagement talks over pay affected 
output at the boleslaw the bold coal mine at laziszka near 
katowice in southern poland 
an official statement issued tuesday after a cabinet meeting 
said the principal goal for next year is to be the radical 
reduction of inflation which is now the most important single 
factor standing in the way of increasing the efficiency of 
industrial production in poland 
next to the statement rzeczpospolita published an interview 
with government economist erwin plichcinski in which he gave new 
inflation figures 
plichcinski said the growth of wages faster than prices has set 
off a worrying inflationary gap 
the 567 percent inflation for the first six months of 1988 
exceeds initial projections for the entire year polands central 
annual plan projected growth in prices of 4044 percent in 1988 
with wages planned to rise 36 percent prices rose 42 percent in 
the first quarter alone 
at laziszka some miners refused to work saturday prompting a 
round of talks with management that evening and the talks 
continued monday pap said 
government spokesman jerzy urban said 800 of 980 miners refused 
to work for several hours monday he said he had no details on the 
number involved saturday 
he referred reporters to the pap report when asked if the miners 
received raises the news agency said only that miners resumed work 
after having accepted explanations and information presented to 
them in the course of the meetings 
a spokesman for the state mining monopoly polish coal speaking 
on condition of anonymity said the workers were promised higher 
pay although negotiations were still going on miners now earn the 
equivalent of 111133 a month 
urban also said a newspaper report on secret us assistance to 
solidarity proves the banned trade union movement is not a polish 
force and accused the united states of interfering in polish 
affairs 
a july 10 report in the new york times said the us government 
has secretly supported emigre efforts to smuggle printing 
equipment radio systems and video cassettes to opposition groups 
in poland it said this was in addition to 2 million to solidarity 
openly appropriated by congress 
we view both these overt and covert actions by the us 
authorities as a significant manifestation of us policy toward 
poland which stands in glaring contrast with the professed us 
principle of nonintervention in our internal affairs urgban 
said 
as for solidarity he said whoever receives a soldiers pay 
from an alien power can neither define itself as an independent 
force nor a polish force

a federal grand jury indicted seven former 
narcotics officers tuesday charging them with a racketeering 
conspiracy and extortion of at least 400000 and large quantities 
of cocaine from drug dealers 
police commissioner willie williams called the latest 
indictments another sad day for the philadelphia police 
department and said he is continuing efforts to root out 
corruption but he added that the corruption involves only a very 
small and insignificant number of officers 
for police officers to take money or other property in 
exchange for allowing drug dealers to continue to deal drugs or for 
the officers to take and to distribute drugs themselves that makes 
other forms of official corruption pale in comparison said 
acting us attorney thomas lee ii 
lee spoke at a news conference where one of the indicted men 
former lt john wilson burst in to proclaim his innocence saying 
i was investigated for seven years fbi agents forcibly ejected 
him 
since a federal inquiry into official corruption here began 
nearly a decade ago about 40 city police officers have been 
convicted mostly for protecting illegal gambling 
six of the officers indicted tuesday are no longer members of 
philadelphias 7000member police department and the seventh who 
had remained on th force but not in a narcotics squad was 
suspended and given a dismissal notification williams said 
two others who were not police officers were also charged one 
with conspiracy to distribute cocaine the police obtained in a 
narcotics search and the other with failing to pay income taxes on 
drug profits 
the indictment alleges the racketeering activity occurred 
between january 1980 and february 1984 when at least 65 narcotics 
searches were conducted by officers assigned to a special drug 
squad that has since been disbanded 
the indictment charged wilson ronald giongo david grove james 
cattalo richard jumper and francis hilt with obtaining money and 
other property including drugs for their personal gain by 
stealing threats and intimidation lee said 
this pattern of activity falls under federal racketeering laws 
lee said enabling the indictment to seek forfeiture to the 
government of about 400000 in proceeds racketeering also carries 
a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison and a 25000 fine 
besides the racketeering charge grove and cattalo are accused 
of distributing and possessing with intent to distribute cocaine 
and methamphetamine grove cattalo wilson and hilt are charged 
with conspiracy to obstruct justice 
another exmember of the special drug squad charles hund and 
civilian scott karasinksi were charged with conspiracy to 
distribute cocaine while karasinksi also was charged with failure 
to file a tax return civilian donald crawford was charged with two 
counts of income tax evasion

prime minister margaret thatcher affirmed her 
opposition to sanctions against south africa during an exchange 
tuesday in parliament where shouting opponents labeled her a racist 
if there were ever to be comprehensive sanctions on south 
africa the number of people who would suffer including children 
would be significantly greater mrs thatcher said to the 
650member house of commons 
the exchange came in a session of the twiceweekly question 
time where the prime minister fields questions and often insults 
from legislators mrs thatcher said sanctions would devastate the 
economies of the countries near south africa 
those countries angola zimbabwe mozambique botswana and 
zambia are dependent on south africa to transport their goods and 
have not imposed economic restrictions themselves she said 
replying to a question from opposition leader neil kinnock mrs 
thatcher said britain already has invested 84 million in foreign 
aid to the surrounding states and has further plans to reduce their 
dependence on south africa 
kinnock leader of the labor party said his visit to southern 
africa last week showed him that strong sanctions were needed 
to end south africas system of apartheid 
under apartheid south africas 26 million blacks cannot vote on 
national affairs the 5 million whites control the economy and 
maintain separate districts schools and health services 
kinnock did not visit south africa 
the leaders of the frontline states call for sanctions 
kinnock told mrs thatcher amid cheers from his party and jeers 
from her governing conservatives 
do you really think you know more about what needs to be done 
than those who live daily with apartheid and its oppression this 
is not only a question of sense but a question of morality 
kinnock said 
as rankandfile labor legislators shouted racist and 
nazi at mrs thatcher and the conservatives she replied 
i totally disagree with you about sanctions and unlike you 
im not prepared to stand here comfortably in this house and impose 
starvation on millions and millions of black south africans and 
black children 
south africas ambassador to britain meanwhile defended the 
imprisonment of nelson mandela leader of the african national 
congress who turned 70 on monday 
speaking to a meeting of the diplomatic and commonwealth 
writers association in london ambassador rae killen said mandela 
could be released if he renounced violence mandela says south 
africa must first renounce apartheid 
he has been imprisoned since 1962 first for inciting unrest and 
later for sabotage and plotting to overthrow the government

democratic congressional leaders took shots 
tuesday at republican presidential contender george bush touted 
their legislative record and promised an allout war against 
drugs 
i want to show you what your democratic congress has done and 
how much more we can do with michael dukakis and lloyd bentsen in 
the white house house speaker jim wright said in prepared 
remarks to the democratic national convention 
democrats have dominated congress for most of the past 35 years 
they last controlled both the white house and the legislative 
branch in 1980 reagan won the presidential election that year and 
the republicans gained control of the senate the democrats 
reclaimed the senate six years later 
wright rattled off a list of bills enacted by congress over the 
past 18 months noting that two the clean water act and a highway 
bill were passed over president reagans veto 
he also pointed to legislation to give american workers 60 days 
notice of impending plant closings the provision which reagan 
cited in vetoing a trade bill congress separated the plant 
closings from the trade bill and sent both issues back to reagan as 
separate bills 
before this summer ends we shall lead a strong initiative 
against our most serious national problem illegal drugs wright 
said sounding a theme that has shown up in national polls as the 
most ripe for political appeals the democratic congress will 
declare an allout war on drugs 
reagans response to the drug problem has been the slogan 
just say no wright observed it does little good when 
the administration is unwilling to say yes to the funding 
necessary to carry on the war 
house democratic whip tony coelho of california turned his guns 
on bush seeking to emphasize what democrats have come to call the 
gop nominees wimp factor 
were prepared to give george bush the licking of his 
political life coelho said noting that bush has spent most of 
the democratic convention week a fishing spot in wyoming with 
treasury secretary james baker iii 
baker who is expected to resign later this summer to head the 
bush campaign is there just in case george is too squeamish to 
bait his own hook coelho said 
and he drew distinctions between the democrats dukakisbentsen 
ticket and bushs candidacy 
it is a race between two vastly different profiles in 
leadership he said a race between a man of action and a man 
of absence between a man with a noble purpose and a man with a 
noble pedigree between a miracle from massachusetts with a real 
texas accent and a fellow who wears cowboy boots over argyle 
socks 
senate majority leader robert byrd of west virginia took a more 
philosophical tone asserting that the reagan administration 
brought greed and arrogance to government and called for a 
restoration of confidence 
we must roll back the shadows that have gathered over this 
administration the mistrust the arrogance the dark dealings 
byrd said national policy cannot be made by wisecrack and 
blunder

secretary of state george p shultz said tuesday 
that washington was ready for talks with iran and welcomed that 
countrys acceptance of a un resolution to end the bloody war 
with iraq 
but he said us warships would remain in the persian gulf until

asia as secretary of state he left japan wednesday for the new 
marshall islands republic completing a ninecountry 2week trip 
through asia and the pacific 
at a news conference following meetings with japans leaders 
shultz said the relationship between the united states and japan 
right now is as good as healthy as it has ever been in my 
observation of it 
on the persian gulf shultz said the increase in us military 
strength in that region last summer was in response to attacks on 
international shipping as part of the iraniraq war which began in 
september 1980 iraq attacks iranian economic targets to cut off 
the oil exports that finance the war and iran retaliates by 
raiding neutral merchant vessels 
if the problems go away the us military ship presence 
will go down shultz said just when that will be apparent 
remains to be seen 
un secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar announced monday 
that iran unconditionally accepted a un resolution calling for a 
ceasefire in the war iraq had accepted the resolution after it 
was passed in july 1987 on condition that iran did so 
shultz said the united states remains prepared for direct 
discussions with them iranians on all manner of issues that 
concern us we want these discussions to be on an official 
authoritative basis 
he said indirect talks had been held earlier through swiss and 
other intermediaries 
asked about japanese offers to help resolve the iraniraq 
conflict shultz said it was a very good development that japan 
was becoming more involved in major international problems 
foreign minister sosuke uno told a news conference tuesday that 
japan should fill civilian posts in a un peacekeeping force if 
one is dispatched to the iraniraq front 
japanese officials also said tokyo would consider resuming 
development assistance to both warring nations once peace was 
attained 
shultz said japan and the united states had resolved a great 
many problems related to trade and other economic issues 
japan he said has agreed to remove quotas on the import of 
american beef and citrus products was proceeding to provide 
american companies better access to public works projects in japan 
and was taking steps to assume more of the cost for maintaining 
about 60000 us troops stationed in the country 
the foreign ministry provided figures showing japans trade 
surplus with the united states had declined by 15 percent during 
the first half of 1988 over the previous year it also cited a 40 
percent rise in imports from the united states

the federal election commission has accused a 
california developer of making contributions exceeding the legal 
limit to the presidential campaigns of former sen gary hart 
commission officials filed papers in us district court on 
monday seeking to force laguna beach developer david stein to 
comply with a subpoena and to testify about fund raising 
contributions and other activities commercial or otherwise 
the election commission said stein invoked his fifth amendment 
right against selfincrimination more than 100 times when he was 
questioned about the matter in april 
the allegations were reported in the washington post in january 
hart said at the time that he knew nothing about illegal 
contributions and he directed his staff to return money improperly 
obtained 
steins attorney paul sullivan of washington dc said his 
client should not be subject to a civil investigation by the 
election commission because he may be the target of a criminal 
inquiry by the fbi 
the commission stated in its court documents that it had reason 
to believe stein may have violated election laws barring 
contributions of more than 1000 to a single candidate and 
limiting total individual contributions to 25000 
the commission contends that stein 40 donated at least 38750 
for the 1980 election of which only 10000 was refunded among 
the contributions were 1000 to harts americans with hart 
committee 25000 to the democratic national committee and 1000 
to the democratic congressional dinner committee along with 
contributions of 1000 and 500 to various individual candidates 
the commission documents state that steins efforts to 
impermissibly aid the hart campaign may have been 
coordinated with campaign personnel 
the orange county register reporting on the documents tuesday 
said stein refused to discuss the matter with register reporters 
monday in atlanta where he is attending the democratic national 
convention as an uncommitted delegate 
the court documents also link stein to newport beach video 
promoter george stuart karl who was indicted last month by a 
federal grand jury on charges that he illegally donated almost 
200000 to candidates including hart 
among the items stein refused to discuss during the april 
questioning was the purpose of a 30000 check he wrote in 1984 to 
karls business and what if any relationship the check had to 
the hart campaign the documents said 
election laws forbid corporate contributions of cash or services 
to campaigns 
the documents also accuse stein of buying a computer from harts 
1984 presidential campaign and leasing it back for an amount far 
below the market rate 
if the commission determines that stein violated federal 
election laws it could impose civil fines up to 10000 and 20 
percent of the amount involved if the violation was found to be 
intentional

of congress a meeting they said dukakis asked for rep albert 
bustamante of texas said they talked about involving hispanics in 
the campaign and in the transition team if dukakis is elected 
he wanted to establish a dialogue with the leadership of the

building accompanying the massachusetts governor was his cousin 
academy awardwinning actress olympia dukakis 
the last threat to convention unity was resolved earlier in the 
day with announcement that aides to dukakis and jesse jackson had 
reached agreement on most platform differences

action he was a man of inspiration 
bentsen was nearby and dukakis said that if elected he and his 
vice president are going to do our very best with your support 
to inspire and uplift this country 
dukakis praised the convention keynote speech by texas state 
treasurer ann richards and noted that neither he nor bentsen have 
ever won any blue ribbons for great oratory 
then he added and after jesse gets through tonight none of 
us will meet the standard ann richards and jesse jackson set for 
this convention

michael dukakis won the platform of his design 
tuesday at the democratic national convention while a parade of 
democrats ridiculed george bush as a toothache of a man and 
worse jesse jackson promised an emotional latenight finale to 
his remarkable primary campaign 
sen edward m kennedy said it was about time for another 
president from massachusetts and scorned bush as a hearnothing 
seenothing donothing vice president who wasnt there or 
cant recall or never heard of the iran arms sale 
on that and other issues kennedy said i think its fair to 
ask where was george 
george bush is the man who is never there and he wont be 
there after the clock strikes noon on jan 20 1989 the senator 
said in a prepared address that kicked off the primetime 
speechmaking 
jim hightower the tarttongued texas agriculture commissioner 
called bush a perpetual preppie and said hes a toothache 
of a man telling us to stay the course and threatening to lead us 
from tweedledum to tweedledummer 
he is a man who was born on third base and thinks he hit a 
triple he said for good measure during what was billed as a 
presentation of platform material 
the verbal abuse came after an afternoon of platform work in 
which dukakis sought to shed the tax and spend republican 
taunt he easily defeated jacksons call for higher taxes on 
wealthy individuals and corporations the vote was 2499 to 1091 
dukakis prevailed as well on jacksons call for a no first 
use pledge of nuclear weapons jacksons call for 
selfdetermination for palestinians was debated and withdrawn 
jackson forces took the inevitable defeats with equanimity there 
was little of the past emotion over democratic ideals 
kennedy was introduced by his 27yearold nephew john f 
kennedy jr son of the late president for a long time i have 
believed that what this country needs is another president from 
massachusetts said the man who tried but failed to win the party 
nomination in 1980 
now its going to happen president dukakis it has a nice 
ring

tamil militants exploded a bomb under 
a patrol car in northern sri lanka killing five indian soliders 
military officials said tuesday they said two soldiers and a rebel 
died in another clash 
sri lankan military officials who cannot be identified under 
briefing rules said the five died monday when the 
remotecontrolled bomb was detonated near the northwestern port of 
mannar they said two soldiers were injured and five others were 
reported missing in the blast 
an official at the indian high commission or embassy confirmed 
the five deaths the official also insisted on anonymity 
a statement issued in the southern india city of madras by the 
liberation tigers of tamil eelam militia claimed 20 soldiers were 
killed in the blast the tigers largest of the rebel groups have 
exile headquarters in madras 
the conflicting reports could not be resolved independently 
indian troops imposed an indefinite curfew on the area to search 
for the missing men the sri lankans said 
mannar is about 135 miles north of colombo 
on tuesday two indian soldiers and a tamil rebel were killed in 
an exchange of fire near the port town of batticaloa in eastern sri 
lanka the military officials said 
more than 500 indian soldiers have been killed since india sent 
an estimated 50000 soldiers to this island nation to enforce an 
indiansponsored peace accord signed in july 1987 
the accord was aimed at ending a fiveyear guerrilla war by the 
tamils for an independent homeland in the north and east of the 
island 
india became involved because 60 million ethnic tamils in 
southern india are sympathetic to the tamil cause in sri lanka 
tamils mainly hindus make up 18 percent of sri lankas 16 
million population they claim they are discriminated against by 
the majority buddhist sinhalese the sinhalese control both the 
military and the government

officials sprayed the herbicide paraquat 
tuesday to destroy marijuana on about 16 acres of private land an 
escalation in the federal drug war that environmentalists attacked 
as dangerous 
a drug enforcement administration agent supervised spraying of a 
remote area about six miles east of this small panhandle town 
about 100 miles northeast of amarillo said wheeler county sheriff 
lonnie miller 
this is the first time that the dea has been involved in a 
spray on private land said phil jordan a dallasbased dea 
supervisor from what i understand there have been some state 
authorities that have eradicated before but never with dea 
using fourwheeldrive vehicles and backpacks authorities 
sprayed paraquat on about 50000 plants growing wild on six private 
tracts miller said the spraying was not done by aircraft to 
protect the environment jordan said 
the spraying was the beginning of a threeday federal operation 
stop crop texas department of public safety spokesman mike cox 
said 
last week us attorney general edwin meese said marijuana has 
become the no 1 cash crop in the united states and called for a 
vast federalstate effort to eradicate the drug 
cox said the owners of the land involved had not cultivated the 
marijuana and have cooperated fully with authorities but he said 
the countys wild marijuana which apparently was planted years ago 
to produce hemp for rope had been discovered by entrepreneurs 
he said signs were posted to warn people of sprayed areas 
hank graddy national chairman of the sierra clubs agricultural 
committee said spraying paraquat is risky even when done manually 
if they are going to go to the trouble of walking the land it 
would seem to me that using a hatchet would be just as easy 
graddy said from his home in midway ky 
the sierra club a private environmental group maintains that 
spraying paraquat is dangerous to humans and animals in the 
vicinity but much of the debate over paraquat has focused on 
evidence that it poses serious health risks to marijuana smokers 
the dea issued a report in 1986 calling the toxic herbicides 
use to kill marijuana safe and reasonable as long as guidelines are 
followed to avoid spraying in the rain or high wind or near 
buildings and to make sure the pot is not harvested before the 
paraquat destroys it

a red army deserter from the war in afghanistan 
went home to the soviet union after complaining in canada of 
homesickness the soviet embassy in ottawa said tuesday 
nikolai golovin 25 left montreal for moscow on monday on an 
aeroflot flight 
tass said he held a news conference after arriving in moscow 
tuesday the offical soviet news agency quoted him as saying he 
wanted to show nothing has happened to me after my return home 
golovin was one of five soviet soldiers who were captured and 
held by afghan rebels then spirited out of afghanistan by canadian 
officials in november 1986 
tass quoted golovin as saying fear of possible punishment in 
the soviet union is keeping his colleagues in canada 
he had been working parttime at a meat processing plant in 
kitchener ontario but complained that he never felt at home in 
canada 
i want to go back to where everyone speaks russian golovin 
said in an interview with the kitchenerwaterloo record i just 
cant get used to life here he said in the interview published 
tuesday 
golovin said he wants to see his sister and ailing mother and to 
find work as an electrician in his home town of ulyanovsk a city 
on the volga river 500 miles east of moscow he said his mother had 
written to him begging him to come home the record said 
when he first reached canada golovin told reporters he could 
never go back home it would be siberia or the firing squad he 
said 
the five red army soldiers earlier rejected an initial offer to 
return to the soviet union extended by gennadi samsonov second 
secretary of the soviet embassy but the deserters received letters 
from the embassy last month offering an amnesty the record 
reported 
golovins decision left his four comrades horrified and too 
upset to talk said maria blagoveshchensky of the russian aid 
society which spent years working to secure their release 
she said vladislav naumov vadim plotnikov igor kovalchuk and 
sergei busov are working in toronto and dont plan to leave canada 
its very hard to believe a deserter will be welcomed with open 
arms she said

a pressure drop detected in january 
might have alerted engineers to the small leak that now threatens a 
long delay in the next space shuttle flight but there is no 
conclusive evidence that workers acted improperly the launch 
director said tuesday 
director bob sieck said a search of paperwork shows that a 
pressure check was made on the oxidizer tank manifold in an engine 
compartment before christmas and a second reading was taken about 
two weeks later 
there was a pressure drop of about 16 pounds per square inch 
between the two data points he said in an interview 
a tiny leak of nitrogen tetroxide gas was detected in an engine 
compartment of space shuttle discovery on the launch pad friday 
engineers have been puzzling over how to fix the leak without 
removing the shuttle from the pad a move that could delay the 
planned early september launch by two months 
the leak is in a fitting on a onehalf inch line leading to an 
oxidizer tank the same area where the pressure drop was detected 
in january 
we wish we had found it earlier forrest s mccartney 
director of the kennedy space center told a news conference if 
we had found it when it was accessible there would have been no 
problem but its in an inaccessible place and we dont know what 
were going to do about it 
weve got people looking at the prudent and safe thing to 
do he said what ever course we take there will be no 
compromise in flight safety 
the odds are 5050 on a rollback of discovery mccartney 
said 
we are reviewing all procedures and documentation and 
equipment associated with that event sieck said of the january 
finding we are looking at the people who performed the test 
he said kennedy space center procedures require that any leak be 
tightened and checked properly 
these two data points may still have been within 
specifications he said and i wouldnt preclude the fact that 
we have other data that says the integrity of the joint was 
confirmed 
until a final review it is pure speculation that a requirement 
was violated and not reported sieck said 
he said engineers are considering a number of options for fixing 
the leak 
were looking at a fix in place if thats possible he 
said but we would have to assess it as safe and reliable 
to do it properly he said probably would require removing the 
22foottall engine compartment a difficult task never before done 
on the pad 
another option would be to take discovery to a hangar and as 
soon as possible replace the compartment with one being prepared 
for a shuttle atlantis flight in november such a move would 
eliminate the need to wait for a leak repair and could cut the 
launch delay time to about a month 
and i wouldnt preclude a quick fix with some oldfashioned 
yankee ingenuity he said 
flying with the leak as is a possibility but we would have to 
assure ourselves that it would be absolutely safe sieck said 
nitrogen tetroxide combines with a fuel to power the steering 
engines in flight 
if the leak continued in orbit it ideally would vaporize and 
drift off into space however the possibility of it hitting a cold 
surface might cause it to vaporize and pool in the engine pod 
where fire could occur if it somehow contacted the fue 
meanwhile nasa moved ahead with a plan to testfire discoverys 
three main engines on the launch pad on july 28 the main engines 
are separate from the steering engine system containing the leak 
discovery is being grooomed to make the first shuttle mission 
since challenger exploded jan 28 1986 killing the seven crew 
members five veteran shuttle astronauts are to make the fourday 
flight during which they will release a communications satellite 
and conduct experiments

a chain of beacons burst into flame across england 
on tuesday night in memory of the fiery warning to the nation when 
the spanish armada was sighted exactly 400 years ago 
spanish ambassador don jose de la bellacasa letting bygones be 
bygones used a longhandled flaming torch to fire the first 
beacon on a damp and drizzly night 
two old countries like ours have to build on our history 
better understanding and friendship in the future he told the 
associated press 
the event was shown live on national tv as the ambassador lit 
the fuel in a big iron brazier atop an oak pole at the kynance 
headland the area near lizard village in the southwest tip of 
cornwall is where local people say the armada was first sighted 
the lighting was followed swiftly by the chain of beacons and 
wigwamshaped bonfires that extended to the scottish border 430 
miles away 
i invited the ambassador to light the first beacon because i 
thought it was about time after 400 years that we buried this old 
hatchet in a symbolic way said bruno peek who organized the 
event and called it fire over england 
the spanish armadas 125 ships carried 19000 soldiers 8000 
sailors 2000 galley slaves and 180 monks and friars sent by 
philip ii the roman catholic king of spain to overthrow englands 
protestant queen elizabeth i 
legend has it that elizabeths favorite captain sir francis 
drake was involved in a lawnbowling game in plymouth as the great 
fleet approached and was so unflustered that he insisted on 
finishing the game before going to his ship 
queen elizabeth ii is to visit plymouth on thursday to join 
armada festivities in the city from which drake sailed into action 
everyone seemed to be in on the fun even the post office 
which issued 40 million stamps depicting galleons and cannon smoke 
a breakfast cereal company offered armada treasure replica 
coins the replicas are copied from coins found in armada ships 
wrecked by gales as the great fleet struggled home after failing to 
link up with a spanish invasion army waiting in the netherlands 
historians have argued long over whether the english or the 
gales defeated the armada 
the weather did help but the defeat was a great victory for 
england because it raised the hearts of men in dark hours said 
james mildren a historian specializing in armada lore 
tamsin thomas responsible for 10 of cornwalls 20 fires said 
the villagers in lizard had been celebrating all day as they have 
done every anniversary for four centuries 
she said the kynance beacon mounted on a 30foot oak pole had 
a trial firing tuesday morning and burned for an hour with a bright 
orange flame 
we are also having 2000 pounds 3360 dollars worth of 
fireworks and i was astonished to find when we opened the boxes 
that they were made in spain mrs thomas said 
frank kitchen a schoolmaster who has studied the matter said 
the earlywarning system of beacons and fires was unique to england 
and could muster up to 30000 men within two hours 
he said the procedure lasted to the 19th century when there was 
a threat of invasion by napoleons armies and there is a record of 
one sentinel setting his beacon alight and frying sausages 
in setting up the new beacons we worked from secret 
elizabethan diagrams which showed pitch at the center covered by 
anything dry and combustible topped by a thatch to keep out rain 
and the whole thing covered with brushwood said warren davis of 
the national trust which looks after historic sites and buildings 
the trick was to build a fire that would quickly produce a 
flame at night and a lot of smoke in the daytime

the defense rested in the wedtech corruption 
trial of rep mario biaggi and six others ending 19 weeks of 
testimony 
prosecutors who did not call any rebuttal witnesses were 
slated to begin their closing statement to the jury wednesday 
morning at federal court in manhattan 
biaggi 70 a 10term bronx democrat former bronx borough 
president stanley simon and five others including biaggis eldest 
son are charged with turning the wedtech corp into a racketeering 
enterprise that paid out millions of dollars in bribes to obtain 
nobid defense contracts 
a nowbankrupt bronx defense contractor wedtech grew from a 
small machine shop into a 100 million concern through a small 
business administration program that awarded government contracts 
to minorityowned businesses without competitive bidding 
prosecutors claimed biaggi and other defendants extracted cash 
or stock from wedtech in return for political assistance 
but the defense maintained that four corrupt wedtech executives 
who testified for the government in exchange for leniency had 
links to reagan white house insiders like attorney general edwin 
meese iii and did not need help from biaggi and simon both 
democrats 
us district judge constance baker motley denied a defense 
request however to call meese as a witness saying his actions 
had nothing to do with the guilt or innocence of those on trial 
meese has not been charged with any wrongdoing 
after the defense called its last witness prosecutors decided 
against putting on a rebuttal case after motley ruled against them 
on their request to present evidence to the jury about biaggis 
conviction for obstructing justice in an unrelated case last fall 
in brooklyn 
the trial which began march 11 with opening arguments to the 
jury generated more than 18000 pages of transcript from the 
testimony of more than 130 witnesses 
biaggi his son richard and bernard ehrlich the congressmans 
former law partner did not take the witness stand in their own 
defense but the other defendants did 
biaggi had intended to take the stand himself until motley gave 
prosecutors wide latitude to crossexamine the congressman about 
his past including the brooklyn case which is under appeal

dr martin luther king lies only a few miles from us 
tonight he must feel good as he looks down upon us we sit here 
together a rainbow the sons and daughters of slavemasters and 
the sons and daughters of slaves sitting together around a common 
table to decide the direction of our party and our country his 
heart would be full tonight 
as a testament to the struggles of those who have gone before 
as a legacy for those who will come after as a tribute to the 
endurance the patience the courage of our forefathers and 
mothers as an assurance that their prayers are being answered 
their work was not in vein and hope is eternal tomorrow night my 
name will go into nomination for the presidency of the united 
states 
we meet tonight at a crossroads a point of decision 
shall we expand be inclusive find unity and power or suffer 
division and impotence 
we come to atlanta the cradle of the old south the crucible of 
the new 
tonight there is a sense of celebration because we have moved 
fundamentally from racial battlegrounds by law to economic common 
ground with the challenge to move to moral higher ground 
common ground 
think of jerusalem the intersection where many trails met a 
small village that became the birthplace for three great religions 
judaism christianity and islam 
why was this village so blessed because it provided a 
crossroads where different people different cultures and 
different civilizations could meet and find common ground 
when people come together flowers always flourish and the air 
is rich with the aroma of a new spring 
take new york the dynamic metropolis what makes new york so 
special 
it is the invitation of the statue of liberty give me your 
tired your poor your huddled masses yearning to breathe free 
not restricted by english only 
many people many cultures many languages with one thing in 
common the yearn to breathe free 
common ground 
and tonight in atlanta for the first time in this century we 
convene in the south 
a state where governors once stood in school house doors where 
julian bond was denied his seat in the state legislature because of 
his conscientious objection to the vietnam war 
a city that through its five black universities has graduated 
more black students than any city in the world 
atlanta now a modern intersection of the new south 
common ground 
that is the challenge to our party tonight 
left wing right wing progress will come not through boundless 
liberalism nor static conservatism but at the critical mass of 
mutual survival it takes two wings to fly 
the bible teaches that when lions and the lambs can lie down 
together and none will be afraid there will be peace in the 
valley

even before michael dukakis officially claims the 
democratic presidential nomination george bushs backers were 
circulating a harshly critical video charging that dukakis seems 
to challenge american patriotism itself 
the 20minute video being distributed in the democratic national 
convention complex hits dukakis on issues ranging from the death 
penalty to tax increases to saying the pledge of allegiance in 
school 
it goes to great lengths to link dukakis with former president 
jimmy carter and contains some of the most strident assaults 
launched to date between bush and dukakis 
but its not just military muscle that dukakis opposes a 
narrator says he seems to challenge american patriotism itself 
in a statement distributed by a group called americans for bush 
described as an independent project of the national security 
pac the bush backers said it was targeted at conservative 
democrats who have backed president reagan in the past two 
elections 
the theme of the video is experience vs experiments and 
takes dukakis to task for a prison furlough program that released 
criminals for the weekend and attacked him for vetoing a bill 
dealing with the pledge of allegiance in schools 
in his home state of massachusetts birthplace of the american 
revolution dukakis vetoed a bill requiring schoolchildren to 
pledge allegiance to our flag the narrator said 
in one segment the camera pans over the field of democratic 
presidential candidates scanning all of the group but freezing on 
dukakis and jesse jackson most polls taken when the vice 
presidential nomination was still an open question showed jackson 
badly damaging democratic hopes of winning the election 
organizers of the effort said they had scheduled a preview of 
the video at the georgia world congress center adjacent to the 
convention hall and home base for media organizations covering the 
convention 
floyd brown who described himself as a consultant to the group 
said democratic national committee officials halted the preview 
dnc spokesman mike mccurry did not immediately return two phone 
calls seeking comment

former california gov jerry brown said tuesday 
he still hopes to make a political comeback when theres an 
opportunity and if its appropriate 
the 50yearold former governor made a brief appearance before 
the california delegation to the democratic national convention to 
help launch the 1990 campaign for state treasurer of his sister 
kathleen 
but brown said he would probably make few if any other public 
appearances this year because he is concentrating on completing a 
book on his political experiences and his views of future political 
directions of the nation he has spent much of the last few years 
traveling abroad 
his brief and lowkey appearance contrasted sharply with 1976 
when the then38yearold governor was the final presidential 
contender to withdraw from the race and endorse jimmy carters 
successful candidacy 
brown who gave up the governors office in 1982 after two terms 
for an unsuccessful campaign for the us senate said its 
possible he might run for the us senate in 1992 if democrat 
alan cranston retires 
asked whether he might run for governor again he replied you 
shouldnt unexpect it but said that shouldnt be construed as a 
trial balloon or announcement 
its kind of hard to be in it public office 12 or 13 years 
and be known by 95 percent of the people and know all the players 
and be used to that kind of life and not do it you actually have 
to work at it brown said

sen lloyd bentsen showing success in selling 
himself to jesse jackson and other black leaders switched hats 
tuesday and worked to sell texans on michael dukakis 
here we have running on the ticket a man from new england a 
governor from new england bentsen told texas delegates he hosted 
for brunch 
but you know he talks the same language we talk in texas 
because he talks the language of jobs and growth and housing and 
health care and education for all of the people he said 
economic growth is a campaign theme of one of vice president 
george bushs possible running mates rep jack kemp of new york 
but bentsen said tuesday night hed rather run against kemp than 
the other lawmaker frequently mentioned for bushs ticket 
bentsens senate colleague and friend bob dole rkan 
kemp a longtime supporter of supplyside economics was 
extremely vulnerable to criticism bentsen said in an interview 
on cnn tuesday night 
bentsen used the theme of economic growth at length before his 
homestate gathering texas is considered a major campaign 
battleground this year and was a big reason bentsen was chosen for 
the ticket was to win that state 
bentsen said texas has taken a hit economically during the 
reagan administration and he said dukakis was a man who can help 
create jobs and who believed that government can be of help in 
restoring the economy 
the room was filled with people wearing bentsen buttons 
including many who had supported jackson rep mickey leland 
jacksons state chairman in texas was on the dais with bentsen and 
helped lead the applause 
but some jackson delegates were still disappointed that dukakis 
had not chosen their candidate instead of bentsen state rep al 
edwards of houston invited to sit at the head table did not 
attend 
i have no problem with senator bentsen but right now im 
campaigning for jackson edwards said im sure before its 
over well sit at a lot of head tables together 
bentsen was not confronted tuesday by the jackson placards which 
greeted him monday when he began his series of meetings with state 
delegations and he received his strongest endorsement yet from 
jackson 
jackson dukakis and bentsen appeared at a civil rights 
breakfast together and afterward jackson told the associated 
press that bentsen had demonstrated to him a sensitivity for 
minorities jackson had not previously spoken much about bentsen 
since dukakis selected his running mate last week 
when jackson and dukakis made a campaign unity pact monday 
bentsen was called in and then joined the others at a news 
conference 
what was significant was his perception his understanding of 
what had to be done to broaden the base for inclusion jackson 
said 
coming out of texas where you have to reach out to become a 
us senator you necessarily have to deal with the blacks browns 
the farmers and ranchers the workers jackson said your 
orientation becomes inclusive and expansive because it is the only 
way to win and the way he relates is indicative of his 
experience 
bentsen praised jackson as someone who has acted more on his 
own for the cause of freedom and justice more than the reagan 
administration has been able to achieve in the last eight years 
the texan also received a warm welcome tuesday at a noontime 
rally with dukakis and coretta scott king widow of slain civil 
rights leader martin luther king jr at the martin luther king 
center 
dukakis highlighted bentsens long civil rights record he was 
one of two southern congressmen who voted against the poll tax in 
1949 he said 
much of bentsens day was spent in private meetings preparing 
for his acceptance speech thursday night and organizing a campaign 
staff for the months ahead 
dukakis and bentsen planned to leave atlanta together friday for 
houston as the first stop in a threeday crosscountry swing to 
launch their campaign 
from texas the candidates will travel to california then to 
north dakota and missouri on saturday theyll visit missouri and 
pennsylvania on sunday before dukakis returns to boston on sunday 
evening it was still being decided whether bentsen would go to 
boston with dukakis or return to washington

crews used natural barriers to keep a 14000acre wildfire in 
wyomings teton wilderness from reaching summer homes tuesday 
while officials in alaska left fires that have charred more than a 
halfmillion acres to die on their own 
firefighters in northwestern colorado got a little break in the 
weather which helped contain all but two of 15 fires that consumed 
more than 20000 acres of range and pinon juniper fires also 
burned tuesday in california utah and oregon but none threatened 
populated areas and most were small 
a blaze swept over a firefighting crew near jackson calif 
about 45 miles southeast of sacramento but the workers surivived 
by taking refuge in portable fireproof shelters said karen 
terrill a spokeswoman for the california department of forestry 
the northern edge of the lightningsparked fire in wyoming was 
closing in on yellowstone national park but was allowed to burn 
since its on us forest service land and not a threat however 
550 firefighters used natural firebreaks like streams and rock 
formations to keep the southern border of the fire from reaching a 
small colony of summer homes in buffalo valley 12 miles away 
officials said unless heavy rains fall soon its likely the 
fire will burn until snow puts it out no later than september 
in alaska five major fires accounted for almost 450000 acres 
of the total nearly a third went up in a blaze near livengood 
about 60 miles northwest of fairbanks said us bureau of land 
management spokeswoman sue mitchell 
rugged territory in the wyoming fire at an elevation of about 
8500 feet and in prime grizzly bear habitat has complicated 
firefighting 
were not only shuttling crews by helicopter to the 
fireline but during the day were moving the crews around fire 
information officer doug huntington said tuesday normally they 
would be able to walk from point to point but because of the 
rugged terrain and downed timber were moving the crews around 
if we dont do that theyre worn out by the time they arrive on 
the spot where theyre supposed to be fighting the fire 
the crews have little more than picks shovels and the water 
tanks they carry on their backs to fight the flames 
in yellowstone to the north of the teton wilderness officials 
monitored several fires covering 11000 acres 
while all yellowstones roads and frontcountry campsites were 
open campfire restrictions were imposed throughout the parks 
backcountry where fire danger forced the closing of some 
campsites 
alaska officials generally let the fires burn unless they 
threaten lives or property critical wildlife habitat or commercial 
timber said tom frey fire coordinator for the alaska fire service 
the fires open up dense stands of unproductive black spruce 
said frey natural revegetation of burned areas with willow grass 
and berries provides food for many of alaskas big game species 
animals usually move away from the flames well before they are 
endangered and few die in the fires 
yellowstone officials also tend to let fires burn themselves out 
weve had several questions on that and the majority are 
probably coming from some local guides and outfitters said 
yellowstone fire information officer doug huntington theyre for 
a good reason concerned that this fire would destroy some prime 
habitat where they take hunters in for big game hunts and packers 
in for some hikes 
the forest service held a public meeting in jackson to let the 
outfitters and guides discuss their concerns and so the agency can 
explain its fire management decisions huntington said 
the low humidity and dry brush fueled the colorado fires which 
caused no structural damage despite threatening the town of 
dinosaur and the headquarters of dinosaur national monument on 
sunday 
only one injury was reported on tuesday when a firefighter at 
the flatiron fire near rifle got cinders in his eyes fire 
information officer larry dove said the man was treated at a local 
hospital and released 
the colorado fires were being fueled by dry brush high 
temperatures and low humidity officials said 
in northern california fires that apparently had been set were 
contained monday and early tuesday but not before destroying a 
home and two other buildings in jackson 
and in southern california an allout air and ground assault by 
1000 firefighters went a long way toward extinguishing a 
3500acre wildfire in los padres national forest 
five waterdropping helicopters and three air tankers bombarding 
flames with fire retardant chemicals helped ground crews in their 
extensive effort to halt the threeday blaze said david schreiner 
of the us forest service 
the utah fires were reported in rich county and on the 
uintahouray indian reservation and crews were mopping up an 
88acre fire on diamond mountain in eastern utah 
oregon firefighters stopped a 27acre fire on tuesday but a new 
fire broke out about 20 miles northeast of prineville and whipped 
by strong afternoon winds spread across at least 25 acres of pine 
forest said state forestry department spokesman doug decker

jesse jacksons presidential candidacy has 
demonstrated that clergymen can seek public office and take strong 
moral stands without mingling religion with politics evangelist 
billy graham said tuesday 
jackson has the most charisma of anybody in politics today in 
my judgment graham said 
the baptist preacher delivered the invocation at tuesdays 
session of the democratic national convention and said he had been 
asked to do likewise at the republican gathering next month in new 
orleans 
while clergymen and other christian politicians should not 
exploit their positions by depicting themselves as gods 
candidates neither should they downplay their religious ties 
graham said 
if pat robertson made a major mistake it was when he 
renounced his ordination graham said i think even the people 
who followed him or people who didnt follow him would have a 
hard time understanding how a man could be called of god ordained 
of god and youre ordained for life and to renounce it 
graham who has been close to several presidents including 
lyndon johnson and richard nixon but says he never took sides in a 
presidential election said he would stick to that policy this year 
he said he hoped both parties conventions would serve as 
catalysts of a genuine spiritual revival in america that would 
spread around the world including the soviet bloc 
we are a very pluralistic society he said we shouldnt 
have a jewish platform or a muslim platform or a christian 
platform but we should have principles based upon our religious 
faith and of course the dominant religion in america is 
christianity

the veterans peace convoy of 31 american 
activists taking humanitarian aid to nicaragua was helped by the 
us governments attempt to keep it from crossing the border 
members said tuesday 
the publicity helped us greatly and poor people came to us 
throughout our trip to mexico city pushing coins into our hands 
and saying this is the least we can do said convoy 
coordinator raul valdez 40 of austin texas 
the support of mexicans has been great 
the caravan crossed the mexican border at nuevo laredo on july 
14 it now has 20 trucks with 20 tons of supplies 
the activists who oppose us policy aimed at overthrowing 
nicaraguas leftist sandinista government spoke with reporters 
after rain washed out a planned demonstration in front of the us 
embassy 
they originally planned to reach nicaragua in june to donate 
food medicine and other supplies but were delayed by us 
treasury department refusal to let them cross the border at laredo 
texas 
the us government said that leaving the trucks in nicaragua 
as they plan to do would violate a 3yearold trade embargo 
now the schedule calls for arriving in nicaragua on july 27 
after traveling through guatemala and honduras 
members of the group praised the hospitality they received in 
mexico 
its been fantastic said scott breindel of new york we 
stopped to ask this guy for directions to a hotel in mexico city 
and he just offered this compound where we could park our trucks 
and a place to stay for the night 
the american visitors noted that the foreign ministry and 
interior department arranged an official escort for their stay in 
mexico 
if they return to the united states without the trucks the 
activists face up to a 50000 fine and 10 years in jail each the 
us government said the vehicles could be used by nicaraguas 
sandinista government for military purposes and thus were subject 
to the trade embargo 
before the group entered mexico us customs agents asked us 
to sign a form that said we would promise to bring the trucks 
back said david silk 60 a world war ii merchant marine veteran 
from stonington conn 
it was another attempt to make it impossible for us to 
continue our journey said silk adding that no one signed the 
document 
silks truck is carrying more than 1000 pounds of paper donated 
by a local methodist church organization to print a bible in the 
language of nicaraguas sumo indians other activists are bringing 
food medicines and medical equipment 
the convoy also has sent 300000 tons of goods by ship to 
nicaragua whose government celebrated the ninth anniversary 
tuesday of its revolutionary victory over the rightist somoza 
dynasty that ruled nicaragua for four decades 
convoy leaders said they hope to obtain a ruling in federal 
court exempting their trucks from the nicaraguan embargo but they 
said that even if its not forthcoming they wont change their 
plans 
were going to donate this assistance to humanitarian 
organizations for the relief of human suffering said valdez a 
veteran of the vietnam war for that well risk any charges

iran condemned tuesdays iraqi raids 
against iranian targets accused the baghdad government of 
sabotaging peace efforts and said the un chief could declare the 
start of a truce at this very moment 
but senior iraqi sources at the united nations speaking on 
condition of anonymity said they doubted that secretarygeneral 
javier perez de cuellar would succeed in his aim of achieving a 
ceasefire in a week to 10 days 
iraqs foreign minister said in baghdad on tuesday that until 
iran takes concrete action toward achieving peace iraq must keep 
on with the war 
on monday iran declared after a years delay that it 
unconditionally accepts security council resolution 598 which 
demands an immediate truce and troop withdrawal and sets out a 
peace plan to end the 8yearold iraniraq war 
irans un ambassador mohammad jaafar mahallati spelled out 
irans views after meeting perez de cuellar and after lodging a 
formal protest with the security council over iraqs air raids on a 
nuclear facility and other targets 
iraq said the air strikes were prompted by iranian attacks 
mahallati said he told the un chief that in the view of the 
authorities of iran the secretarygeneral has a totally free 
hand to declare dday at this very moment which means starting 
implementation of resolution 598 
dday is the day on which a ceasefire would begin it would be 
set by the secretarygeneral after consultations with both sides 
mahallati called the air strikes a deliberate attempt to 
sabotage the work of the secretarygeneral and the security council 
to put an immediate end to this aggressive war initiated by 
iraq 
perez de cuellar held urgent consultations with mahallati and 
later with iraqi ambassador ismat t kittani to discuss putting the 
resolution into effect and the latest iraqi attacks 
the security council held closeddoor consultations on 
resolution 598 and on irans demand to condemn the us destruction 
of an iranian airliner july 3 
the consultations ended tuesday night without any decision or 
statement and are scheduled to resume wednesday 
the secretarygenerals spokesman francois giuliani told 
reporters the un chief believes the continuation of hostilities 
is a clear sign that the ceasefire must come into place as soon as 
possible 
mahallati urged the council in a letter to condemn the iraqi 
attack which he said so defiantly mocks all efforts for 
attainment of a peaceful end to the conflict 
some diplomats said procedural matters including translating 
mahallatis letter into other official un languages would have 
to precede council discussion of this latest complaint the 
diplomats spoke on condition of anonymity 
the protest was lodged hours before the council was to discuss 
the shooting down of an iranian airliner by the us missile 
cruiser vincennes which mistook it for an attacking warplane all 
290 people on board were killed 
iran has not obtained council condemnation of the us action 
and negotiations were under way to reach a compromise statement 
which would be acceptable to all parties 
foreign minister aziz said in baghdad that iraq was on guard 
against iranian intentions and believed its decision to accept the 
ceasefire plan known as resolution 598 might be a tactical 
decision aimed at winning time or decoying with the aim of 
surprising us by initiating hostilities or preparing for more 
aggression 
aziz said that until iran takes tangible steps toward peace and 
demonstrates its sincerity it is logical to act as if the war is 
still going on 
on tuesday iraq hit iranian targets and iranian warplanes 
retaliated by raiding a dam in iraq 
iraq said a year ago that it accepts the resolution to end the 
war that began in september 1980 if iran does tehran at the time 
withheld endorsement saying iraq had to be branded the aggressor 
before there could be peace 
among other provisions resolution 598 calls for a prisoner 
exchange an impartial body to determine which side was the 
aggressor and massive international reconstruction aid

it sounds impossible lions eat lambs lambs sensibly flee from 
lions yet even lions and lambs can find common ground 
why neither lions nor lambs want the forest to catch fire 
neither lions nor lambs want acid rain to fall neither lions nor 
lambs can survive nuclear war if lions and lambs can find common 
ground surely we can 
the only time we win is when we come together in 1960 kennedy 
beat nixon by only 112000 votes he brought us together and 
reached out 
he had the courage to defy his advisors and inquire about dr 
kings jailing in albany ga we won by the margin of our hope 
inspired by courageous leadership 
in 1964 lyndon johnson brought us together and we won 
in 1976 jimmy carter unified us again and we won 
and when we do not come together we never win 
in 1968 division and despair in july led to our defeat in 
november 
in 1980 rancor in the spring and summer led to defeat in the 
fall 
when we divide we cannot win so our challenge here is to find 
common ground 
tonight i salute gov michael dukakis he has run a wellmanaged 
and a dignified campaign 
no matter how tired or how tried he always resisted the 
temptation to stoop to demagoguery i have watched a good mind fast 
at work with steel nerves guiding his campaign out of the crowded 
field without appeal to the worst in us 
i have watched his respective grow as his environment has 
expanded ive seen his toughness and tenacity close up and know 
his commitment to public service 
mike dukakis parents were a doctor and a teacher my parents 
were a maid and a janitor 
there is a great gap between brookline mass and haney street 
in greenville sc 
he studied law i studied theology 
there are differences of religion region and race differences 
in experiences and perspectives but the genius of america is that 
out of the many we become one providence has enabled our paths to 
intersect 
his foreparents came to america on immigrant ships my 
foreparents came to america on slave ships 
but whatever the original ships we are both in the same boat 
now our ships could pass in the night if we had a false sense of 
independence or they could collide and crash and we would lose 
our passengers 
but we can seek a higher reality and a greater good 
apart we can drift on the broken pieces of reaganomics satisfy 
our baser instincts and exploit the fears of our people 
at our highest we can call upon our noble instincts and 
navigate this vessel to safety 
the greater good is the common good as jesus said not my will 
but thine be done it was a way of saying there is a higher good 
beyond personal comfort or position the good of our nation is at 
stake its commitment to working men and women to the poor and the 
vulnerable to the many in the world

with so many guided missiles and so much misguided leadership 
the stakes are very high 
our choice full participation in a democratic government or 
more abandonment and neglect so this night we choose not a false 
sense of independence not our capacity to survive and endure 
tonight we choose interdependency and our capacity to act to 
unite for the greater good 
common ground 
governor dukakis and i share a common commitment to new 
priorities to expansion and to inclusion a commitment to 
expanding participation in the democratic party at every level 
a commitment to new priorities that insure that hope will be 
kept alive 
common ground is a commitment to a legislative agenda for 
empowerment to the conyers bill for universal sameday voter 
registration to dc statehood to enforcement of economic 
setasides enacted under the leadership of rep parren mitchell and 
gus savage to the dellums bill for comprehensive sanctions against 
south africa commitment to a new direction 
common ground is found in commitment to new priorities to 
expansion and inclusion a commitment to expanding participation in 
the democratic party at every level 
a commitment to a shared national campaign strategy and 
involvement at every level 
a commitment to new priorities that insure that hope will be 
kept alive 
common ground where do we find common ground at the point of 
challenge this campaign has shown that politics need not be the 
marketing of politicians packaged by pollsters and pundits 
politics can be a moral arena where people come together to find 
common ground 
we find common ground at the plant gate that closes on workers 
without notice common ground at the farm auction where a good 
farmer loses his land to bad loans or diminishing markets common 
ground at the school yard where teachers cannot get adequate pay 
students cant find a scholarship cant make a loan common ground 
at the hospital admitting room where the sick lie dying unable to 
go up to a bed thats empty waiting for the insured to get sick

amnesty international called on egypt wednesday to 
protect political detainees who claim they were beaten with cables 
and whips given electric shocks and burned with cigarettes while 
in detention 
the international human rights organization said evidence it 
compiled since 1981 indicated a continuing pattern of torture by 
security and other officials working in egyptian prisons and 
detention centers 
in june 44 security prison and police officials accused of 
torturing political prisoners from 198183 were acquitted after a 
trial in cairo former detainees identified some of them as their 
torturers amnesty international said in a statement 
the group said in a 50page report that its evidence of the 
beatings shocks and burns comes from interviews with victims and 
from medical reports by the egyptian justice ministrys forensic 
medicine department doctors examining detainees who said they were 
tortured found in many cases physical scarring consistent with the 
complaints 
many reports of torture followed the arrest of thousands of 
political suspects after the attempted assassinations in may and 
august last year of two former interior ministers maj gen hassan 
abu basha and maj gen nabawi ismail and magazine editor makram 
muhammed ahmed the group said 
most of those arrested were supporters of islamic groups and 
said they were blindfolded and could not identify their torturers 
it said 
an amnesty official attended part of the 18monthlong cairo 
trial 
the organization said it is still assessing the trial outcome 
but that it did not want the acquittals to signify an end to 
efforts by egypt to end torture of political prisoners 
the report was written after two missions to egypt and extensive 
talks with government officials there the group said 
the report recommended structural reforms within the country 
noting that egypts state of emergency has facilitated prolonged 
detention 
the state of emergency began after the 1981 assassination of 
president anwar sadat by islamic fundamentalists 
egypt was among the first six countries to become party to a 
united nations convention against torture

democrats closed ranks tuesday night and adopted 
a unity platform after soundly defeating jesse jacksons calls for 
higher taxes on the wealthy and a pledge to reject the first use of 
nuclear weapons 
by clamorous voice vote the delegates bellowed their approval 
after rep robert matsui dcalif said this platform is for 
our children this is a document for the future of america 
in the entire arena only a scattered few voices were heard when 
house speaker jim wright asked if there were any nays 
after rebuffing the jackson campaign on taxes and nuclear 
strategy delegates to the democratic national convention embraced 
a raft of compromise amendments on other jackson positions before 
shouting their final approval of the entire platform 
the platform debate followed a script agreed to by michael 
dukakis the partys presidential nomineetobe and jackson 
that script included a heated debate on a minority plank calling 
for selfdetermination for the palestinians the jackson side 
withdrew the matter without putting it to a vote 
michigan gov james j blanchard chairman of the platform 
committee said the platform will surprise skeptics who said it 
couldnt be done they said neither party could say no to the 
special interests the lobbyists the money brokers 
the socalled jackson fair tax plank was defeated 2499 to 
10915 there were 90 abstentions 
the minority plank on no first use of nuclear weapons went down 
24741 to 12206 with 67 abstentions 
as promised the palestinian platform never came to a vote 
the deadly silence that submerged the issue of palestinian 
rights has been shattered said james zogby executive director 
of the arabamerican institute and a jackson adviser as he spoke 
a huge banner was carried across the crowded convention floor 
reading selfdetermination and statehood for the palestinian 
people 
but sen daniel inouye of hawaii called the jackson middle east 
plank a vicious kick in the teeth of americas interests in that 
part of the world 
jacksons tax plank called for higher taxes for businesses and 
the very wealthy 
but denver mayor frederico pena said lets not tie 
dukakis hands with a tax increase 
i dont like throwing softballs to an opponent to knock out of 
the park and a tax hike pitch is a grand slam for george bush 
said pena 
the dukakis and jackson campaigns had settled most of their 
differences beforehand 
as part of the agreement between the two campaigns the jackson 
forces said they would not press their demand for a fiveyear 
freeze on pentagon spending 
the dukakis campaign made concessions on nine other disputed 
platform issues from spending on education and head start to a 
call for a mutual moratorium on missile flight testing 
the dukakis campaign also accepted intact a jackson budget plank 
that states investing in america and reducing the deficit 
requires that the wealthy and corporations pay their fair share and 
that we restrain pentagon spending 
the platform was barely 4500 words before amendments 
titled the restoration of competence and the revival of 
hope it makes no mention of either ronald reagan or george bush 
but promises to reverse voodoo economics help the homeless and 
needy improve education and maintain more stable defense 
budgets 
jackon has had a greater impact on this platform than any 
candidate other than a nominee in memory eleanor holmes norton 
jacksons chief platform negotiator boasted 
michael barnes dukakis negotiator said we dont have 
anything in the document that runs counter to governor dukakis 
positions he denied a jackson campaign claim that the compromise 
language on head start prenatal care and nutrition programs for 
pregnant women and babies amounted to a commitment of roughly 9 
billion 
we dont have anything in the platform that could be described 
as a specific budget item that would in any way commit the next 
congress or commit the next president even theoretically said 
barnes 
on the middle east zogby said we wanted a debate but we 
didnt want a bloodletting 
hyman bookbinder a dukakis adviser who was formerly the 
american jewish committees washington representative said the 
proisrael community is very pleased with the way its coming out 
and that the majority plank is not antipalestinian 
the platform calls for new leadership to deliver the promise 
of peace and security through negotiations that has been held out 
to israel and its neighbors by the camp david accords it makes 
no specific mention of the palestinians 
jackson lost a 1984 platform dispute in san francisco over the 
nofirstuse of nuclear weapons issue 
current us and nato policy would allow first use in the event 
of a soviet invasion of europe 
sen sam nunn of georgia chairman of the senate armed services 
committee told a forum at the carter center on tuesday that 
jacksons plank if passed would shake the nato alliance to 
its core 
what that says to the europeans is that as long as the soviets 
can contain it to a tank war even chemical weapons they can come 
in and take western europe said nunn 
the platform negotiators resumed talks monday after a sixday 
hiatus caused by tension between jackson and dukakis norton said 
the middle east plank was the last on the table 
this shaped up as the tersest democratic platform since franklin 
d roosevelt ran on platforms of only a few thousand words in 1932 
and 1936 the democrats 1984 blueprint was eight times longer

use of firearms and to provide the number of cases in which a 
serious and thorough investigation was opened into the killing of a 
palestinian 
the group also asked israel to explain how it reached its

common ground what is leadership if not to present help in a 
time of crisis 
so i have met you at the point of challenge 
in jay maine where paperworkers were striking for fair wages 
in greenfield iowa where family farmers struggle for a fair 
price in cleveland ohio where working women seek comparable 
worth in mcfarland calif where the children of hispanic 
farmworkers may be dying from a poisoned land dying in clusters 
with cancer in the aids hospice in houston texas where the sick 
support one another too often rejected even by their loved ones 
common ground america is not a blanket woven from one thread 
one color one cloth when i was a child in south carolina and 
momma couldnt afford a blanket she didnt complain and we didnt 
freeze instead she took pieces of old cloth patches wool 
silk gaberdeen crockersack only patches barely good enough to 
shine your shoes with but they didnt stay that way long with 
sturdy hands and strong cord she sewed them together into a quilt 
a thing of power beauty and culture now we must build a quilt 
together 
farmers when you seek fair prices you are right but your 
patch isnt big enough workers when you seek fair wages you are 
right but your patch isnt big enough women when you seek 
comparable worth and pay equity you are right but your patch 
isnt big enough mothers when you seek head start prenatal care 
and day care you are right but your patch isnt big enough 
students when you seek scholarships your are right but your 
patch isnt big enough 
blacks and hispanics when we fight for civil rights we are 
right but our patch isnt big enough gays and lesbians when you 
fight against discrimination and for a cure for aids you are right 
but your patch isnt big enough conservatives and progressives 
when you fight for what you believe you are right but your patch 
isnt big enough 
but dont despair when we bring the patches together make a 
quilt and turn to each other and not on each other we the people 
always win george bush will be off to private life leave 
washington on a oneway ticket a super saver 
we stand at the end of a long dark night of reaction we stand 
tonight united in the commitment to a new direction for almost 
eight years we have been led by those who view social good coming 
from private interest who viewed public life as a means to 
increase private wealth they have been prepared to sacrifice the 
common good of the many to satisfy the private interests of a few 
we believe in a government that is the tool of democracy in 
service to the public health education affordable housing not an 
instrument of aristocracy in search of private wealth we believe 
in government by of and for the people we must now emerge into a 
new day and a new direction

humidity steamed through the south on tuesday forcing power 
companies to plead for customers to conserve while residents of 
the midwest and northeast got some relief from changing weather 
patterns and a banks fan giveaway 
this miserable hot weather has got air conditioners running 
full blast said joseph maher a duke power co spokesman in 
north carolina 
a cold front moving slowly east from the great lakes region and 
widespread rain from the plains to the gulf coast moderated 
temperatures for much of the nation the national weather service 
said but a strong upperlevel high pressure system anchored over 
northern california drove inland temperatures well above 100 
degrees 
detroit officials blamed the weekend deaths of two men on the 
heat bringing the national toll of heatrelated deaths to at least 
43 since june 1 
officials in st louis county called off a heat warning after 
rain fell and temperatures moderated tuesday but not before an 
elderly woman and a 63yearold man were found dead in sweltering 
homes 
overcast skies and scattered showers brought cooler temperatures 
to the boston area ending three days of intense heat and stifling 
humidity the high temperature at logan airport tuesday was 77 
compared with low 90s over the weekend 
temperatures in the 90s for the past week across much of north 
carolina prompted duke power co and carolina power and light co 
to implement conservation programs 
duke asked customers to turn up thermostats 4 to 5 degrees stop 
running appliances and otherwise curtail power use until 8 pm 
tuesday because the demand for electricity was expected to exceed 
the supply 
the company is also reducing voltage throughout its 
20000squaremile service area today said power supply manager 
walter campbell in a statement adding that the voltage reduction 
could result in dimming of television sets and slower operation of 
appliances 
the two utilities had cut off service to some industrial 
customers for an hour to an hour and a half on monday amid record 
power demand 
power demands also reached an alltime high in californias 
central valley and pacific gas amp electric co officials asked 
customers to stop running major appliances from noon to 6 pm the 
temperature in redding calif reached 116 breaking a 42yearold 
record by 3 degrees and in red bluff calif it was 115 beating 
the 1931 record by 1 degree 
in eureka on the cool northern california coast the 71degree 
reading was enough to beat the 5yearold record by 3 degrees 
in washington seattle had a record high for the date of 95 
degrees and quillayute on the olympic peninsula hit 97 a record 
for the month of july 
it reached 109 degrees in medford ore 2 degrees hotter than 
the record for the date set in 1946 other oregon records included 
astoria 93 4 degrees hotter than the 1956 record and eugene 
102 1 degree hotter than the 1946 record 
the suffering produced by hot weather was brought home to st 
paul minn bank executive mark sheffert when his air conditioner 
broke now first bank system is handing out and delivering if 
necessary 10000 fans to the elderly and disabled and people with 
young children 
i just kept thinking about the people who had no relief from 
the heat said sheffert first bank systems executive vice 
president i figured there must be something we can do 
he said the bank bought the fans for about 200000 from sears 
roebuck and co and had them shipped from pennsylvania on eight 
trucks 
i think this is a wonderful gesture on the part of the bank 
said sarah lemire 81 who got a fan for her eighthfloor 
apartment weve had some awfully hot days 
since june 1 deaths blamed on the heat numbered at least 5 in 
kentucky 4 in kansas 2 in michigan 24 in missouri 3 in illinois 
and 5 in georgia

reaganomics reaganomics was based on the belief that the rich 
had too much money and the poor had too little so reverse robin 
hood take from the poor and give to the rich 
today seven years later the richest 1 percent of our society 
pay 20 percent less in taxes the poorest 10 percent pay 20 percent 
more reaganomics 
reagan gave the rich and the powerful a multibilliondollar 
party now when the partys over he expects the people to pay for 
the damage 
but we say let us not raise taxes on poor and middleclass 
people the rich and the corporations must pay their fair share of 
taxes let those who had the party pay for the party reaganomics 
we are spending over 150 billion a year defending europe and 
japan 43 years after the war is over we have more troops today in 
europe than we had seven years ago yet the threat of war is ever 
more remote 
germany and japan are now creditor nations we are a debtor 
nation let them share more of the burden of their own defense we 
can use some of the money to invest in prenatal care head start 
and day care to invest in education to invest in our children 
that they might grow and strengthen this country from the inside 
out 
we must reverse reaganomics for that we need bold leadership 
sound ideas and a new direction authentic leaders do not follow 
public opinion polls they mold opinion they set a moral tone 
define priorities and forge a mandate for change 
leaders address the moral challenge of their day the moral 
challenge of our day is economic violence plants that close on 
workers without notice economic violence consumers gouged by 
corporate greed economic violence a minimum wage that keeps 
workers in poverty economic violence 
we must make sense the no 1 threat to our national security 
tonight is drugs we must stop the flow of drugs into this country 
drugs are killing our children threatening our neighborhoods 
undermining our society educate the children yes but do not stop 
there 
we are spending 150 billion a year on drugs children are not 
buying 150 billion worth of drugs athletes are not laundering 
that money bankers are 
lets get serious about a war on drugs bust the bankers who 
launder and the gun dealers who exploit this partys platform 
commits us to a serious war on drugs convene the nations where 
drugs are grown offer them economic assistance for alternative 
crops strengthen our coast guard and border patrol to stop the 
drugs coming this way education and rehabilitation for those who 
are sick 
if the democratic party is in the white house we will 
significantly reduce the flow of drugs but you must cut the demand 
for the drugs it must be a partnership a bond between the 
government and the people

attorney general edwin meese iii says he acted 
legally ethically and properly despite an independent 
counsels conclusions that he probably broke two tax laws and twice 
violated a conflictofinterest law 
meese mounted a strong counterattack to the report by 
independent counsel james mckay who said monday that the 
toughest calls we made were not to proceed with criminal charges 
against the attorney general 
it was not a close call to find that there were probable 
violations mckay said on the macneillehrer newshour 
television program 
mckay said meese and his wife ursula probably violated two 
sections of the internal revenue code by failing to report and 
promptly pay tax on a net capital gain of 20706 on the sale of 
54581 in securities in 1985 
mckay noted that meese filed an amended return on feb 6 of this 
year shortly after the scheduling of the grand jury appearances 
for the meeses accountants in connection with mckays criminal 
investigation of the matter

world wildlife fund advertisements around the world has helped 
raise thousands of dollars to save the fewer than 1000 pandas left 
in chinese forests 
but there are no international fundraising efforts to save the 
200 to 300 squintyeyed batnosed river dolphins they are dying 
out as their only native home chinas yangtze river becomes 
increasingly congested and polluted

week its instructive to consider how the governor is spending his 
time here his schedule reveals a sharp departure from the strategy 
of nominees past 
the dukakis campaign has junked the nominees ritual

the product to put it delicately is a filter to keep from

has two initials that could stand for beneath sanity but they 
dont 
butler could be found on day two of the convention hawking his 
product in a blocklong parking lot near the convention hall set 
aside for speechmaking a sort of atlanta hyde park 
his filter wasnt needed right at that moment the speaker at

vice president george bushs campaign manager lee atwater said 
tuesday that dukakis should be the beneficiary of a normal boost in 
popularity that comes from convention exposure gop consultant 
roger stone agreed saying he expected dukakis to get an 
artificial boost maybe as much as 7 to 10 points 
both predicted a long tight race atwater said i think its

despite dry weather housing construction only 
partially rebounded in june from the sharp slump in may and 
economists say rising mortgage rates likely will curtail home 
building for the rest of the year 
the commerce department said tuesday that builders started 
construction of new houses and apartments at a seasonally adjusted 
annual rate of 145 million units in june up 51 percent from the 
previous month 
but the improvement only partly offset a precipitous 126 
percent decline in may 
the hot dry weather of june bad for farming but ideal for home 
building also contributed to the uptick 
and mortgage interest rates which had climbed by 
threequarters of a percentage point from poststock crash lows in 
early march eased slightly in june falling by nearly a quarter of 
a percentage point

flamboyant rock singer morris days idea of 
acting is to raise his eyebrows and purse his lips 
that makes him just perfect to play flamboyant record producer 
curtis rousseau in the nbc sitcom pilot heart and soul nbc is 
airing the show thursday in place of a different world 
rousseaus foil is richard bradley the reasonable 
rightthinking half of the partnership he is played by clark 
johnson and lifts the sitcom above insulting stereotype level 
richard wants to quit the business to teach high school music 
curtis is appalled weve been together since michael jackson 
had cartilage and thinks a new girl singer he has discovered 
will change richards mind but her rather large conservative 
father played by james avery thinks record producers are a sleazy 
lot and prefers that his daughter go to medical school 
to convince the father otherwise curtis makes a stab at 
respectability by donning a threepiece suit checking himself in 
the mirror he notes if there was a charity for people who had 
to dress like this every day my check would be in the mail 
day doesnt deliver lines very convincingly but his personal 
style is often delightful as when he pirouettes to pick up the 
phone or whoops his pleasure at the outrageous compliments dished 
by his mailroom sycophant barry sobel they said elvis was de 
king he not de king you de king 
but the second half of the comedy turns to leaden melodrama when 
the aspiring singer tisha campbell tries to persuade richard to 
manage her career when she finally sings she has a great voice 
but the scene is embarrassingly maudlin 
one of the executive producers of heart and soul is quincy 
jones michael jacksons producer with some insidethebusiness 
insights and a few more laughs this show might have given jones a 
different kind of hit

why is this man here john candy seems pleased but vaguely 
perplexed about why he was chosen to be host of hbos live special 
from the just for laughs international comedy festival in montreal 
on saturday 
the festival features mostly standup comics candy a former 
cast member of sctv is a comic actor but hes never done 
standup 
they had called way out of left field he said im not 
really associated with standups at all so i dont understand but 
i was flattered i do have a great respect for these people 
the festival began six years ago as a frenchspeaking event but 
has expanded into a 10day multilingual festival this years 
headliners include richard belzer steven wright and graham chapman 
candy is canadian but he hadnt been to the festival before 
and is therefore a somewhat diffident salesman for the event even 
though hbo arranged an interview to promote the special 
theyre spending a lot of time money and effort there 
candy said searching for something promotional to say they seem 
very organized theres a lot of great acts judging by what im 
seeing its very impressive and its got a big guest list there 
candy was a little more forthcoming about the movie he was 
shooting in toronto he described it as a detective comedy a la 
peter sellers inspector clouseau 
except for splash candys movies havent been roaring 
successes with the critics hes currently starring in the great 
outdoors with dan aykroyd 
he insists though that hes very happy with the script for the 
new movie which is being directed by paul flaherty brother of 
candys sctv colleague joe flaherty 
i rarely talk about movies im in but i feel very good about 
this one said candy who is its executive producer its got a 
nice feel to it very reminiscent of some of our work on sctv 
you know creative periods where you can just feel it sense it 
good work 
candy said hes tired of dealing with movie people who know 
nothing about comedy and just try to get the movie out as quickly 
as possible 
im tired of it and my associations in the future will be 
with people i feel i can depend on and trust he said im 
looking at my pictures a little more carefully now if the odd 
cameo comes up youve got to look out for money we all have to 
make a living but the ones im involved with if you know what i 
mean i want to make sure theyre done right

because either theyre more appealing or more 
keenly needed christian books these days are commanding a swelling 
audience thats looking for help in living 
thats the assessment of william r anderson president of the 
christian booksellers association whose international convention 
in dallas this week staged one of the nations biggest trade shows 
it involves a 2 billion annually retail industry doubled since 
1980 
the volume is growing steadily anderson said in a telephone 
interview the market has expanded beyond the pew partly because 
the product appeal is broader and also because of sociological 
trends 
theres a renewed interest in religion in general an acute 
awareness of the spiritual side of life a return to 
judeochristian values 
about 11000 people were registered for the trade show buyers 
from about 5200 christian bookstores across the nation placing 
orders with about 350 exhibitors spread over 275000 square feet of 
the dallas convention center 
as part of it about 20 educational workshops were offered on 
such things as finance marketing and management 
in size the affair is in the top 1 percent of the 8000 trade 
shows that take place annually in this country as rated by the 
trade show bureau 
statistical extrapolations indicate the christian bookstores 
sell about 80 million volumes annually with best sellers often 
selling two or three times more than books on secular bestseller 
lists 
anderson said readers especially want selfhelp kind of 
books on difficult issues of life and understanding of them on 
a spiritual plane both for themselves and their children 
publishers are dealing with hard issues that were skirted a 
decade ago books on aids child abuse putting a broken marriage 
together death and dying liferelated issues that everybody faces 
were selling information about life how to change how to 
determine values what the scriptures have to say about it 
he said there also is big demand for books for young parents 
wanting quality products focused on nurturing children in 
values of honesty integrity respect for parents and other 
authorities 
theres more recognition of the role of parents and a 
conservative value swing in terms of judeocbhristian values 
anderson 40 whose organization is based in colorado springs 
colo and whose glossy trade monthly bookstore journal has 8000 
subscribers said books make up about 45 percent of christian 
bookstore sales 
an increasing proportion now about l8 percent is music tapes 
with christian singers such as amy grant sandy patti and others 
gaining popularity and producing hits that cross over into the 
secular field 
christian music is one of the fasting growing areas of our 
stores anderson said he noted that the stores also handle a 
variety of other merchandise gifts greeting cards video and 
church supplies 
theyve really become department stores of christian 
products he said thats part of the story of whats 
happening the variety of products allows selection according to 
the media people want to use 
it also provides a variety in levels of complexity from kids 
to adults according to education and theological depth from 
simple to the more educated and knowledgeable 
studies by john dessauer director of the center for book 
research at the university of scranton in pennsylvania project 
christian book sales will reach 36 billion annually by 1990 
anderson said store managers have become more professionalized 
and sophisticated in their approach and also younger their 
average age dropping from 54 to 37 in the last 20 years 
its viewed more as a viable career from the front end rather 
than as a postretirement kind of career he said 
he said the present demand for selfhelp books reflects the 
pragmatic american streak to find a quick fix in a society 
more success oriented 
but much of life does not have a quick fix he said were 
complex beings mentally spiritually and emotionally one of the 
deceptions of modern day thought is that things can be easily fixed 
by an instant dance in front of the microwave 
but honest books point out that most things dont have quick 
fixes that they require changed habits values new ways of life 
patterns and norms things that come only with difficulty and 
time 
some books offer the superficial howto formulas he said and 
consumers need to be aware of it not many times can you just add 
water and stir to get the job done we need to take a hard look at 
that

since 1980 the pretax median income of the 
twoearner family has leaped to 46848 from 29627 a sizable 
increase until you try to spend it 
dont try a lot of people who attempt doing so end up in 
bankruptcy court 
while the figures cited are real as mathematics can make them 
they are for the practical purposes of every day life as reliable 
as a swindlers spiel there is a wide gap between perception and 
reality 
in a sense much income today is prespent on taxes at all 
levels and on social security levies moreover what remains is 
reduced sharply by inflation which erodes spending power as 
relentlessly as termites turn wood to dust 
in real terms after subtracting for inflation and higher 
direct federal taxes including social security the median income 
for a twoearner household with two children has risen a bit more 
than 3700 so far in the 1980s 
that figure from the tax foundation a nonprofit organization 
that claims to have no ax to grind except that which is used to 
hack away at inefficiency is but a fraction of the 14000ayear 
increase depicted by the raw figure 
the disparity between appearance and reality might help explain 
the tendency toward low savings and extensive use of credit that 
has identified the 1980s as distinct from other recent decades 
in explanation it might be argued that a lot of folks tend to 
think of themselves as financially better off than they are and 
then attempt to live up to that image if it takes credit to do so 
then so be it 
some in fact may have justification for living beyond their 
job incomes having made wise investments in securities or real 
estate that provide them with dividends borrowing power or 
saleable assets 
but based strictly on income earned from jobs the financial 
story of american families is not as pretty as it might at first 
seem 
the tax foundation study says that in 1980 the median twoearner 
family with two children and filing a joint return paid 4050 in 
federal income taxes and 1816 in social security taxes for a 
total bite of 5866 
in 1988 the estimate for the 46848 median income is 5623 
for federal income taxes and 3518 for social security taxes the 
total of 9141 supposedly will leave 37707 to be used by the 
family 
the results however are illusory since they are stated in 
current dollars 
that is the 1980 figures were in 1980 dollars and the 1988 
numbers were measured by the 1988 dollar the calibrations on the 
measuring stick were different like saying a foot was 12 inches 
one time and six inches another 
what changes the calibrations on the measuring stick of course 
is inflation and while inflation during the 1980s has not been 
nearly as bad as in the doubledigit 1970s it does add up and it 
compounds too 
the only way to make a sensible comparison is to use the same 
measuring stick and the tax foundation chose the 1988 dollar by 
that measurement the 1988 aftertax income remains 37707 but 
the 1980 income becomes 33393 
it could be stated differently the value of the dollar in any 
year could have been used to make the comparisons the important 
thing is that the same measuring device the same dollar be used 
for both periods 
even then the figures obtained might not reflect reality the 
foundation study for example included only direct federal taxes 
it omitted state and local income taxes to say nothing of real 
estate and sales taxes

music videos have become one of the sharpest 
promotional tools for records since radio play but their 
usefulness may be waning 
not all artists need or want their mtv and record company 
executives concede that after years of trying they simply cannot 
make money selling video clips to consumers 
while costs have increased outlets for showing music videos 
have diminished from several syndicated shows to just two 
continuous programming cable channels and six major cable shows 
lasting from 14 hours a day to one hour a week 
still such stars as tiffany terence trent darby and george 
michael owe their success to the image they present through slick 
video productions that cost anywhere from 10000 to 225000 to 
produce 
when videos first started it was an emotional point for 
everyone to ask for one and it made sense said jeff gold vice 
president of creative services for aampm records i can remember 
five years ago that 100000 was an unthinkable amount and now 
100000 is a regular cost for a major production 
three years ago i said there was no market for music videos 
in retail stores that holds true today we dont even stock it 
it just isnt worth it to us said allan caplan of omahabased 
applause video with 85 retail outlets 
caplan said only socalled longform videos usually concert 
documentaries or rock music movies such as pink floyds the 
wall do reasonably well but those arent really classified as 
videos 
record companies who finance artists video production tend to 
view music videos as strictly a promotional vehicle according to 
jack rovner a marketing vice president for cbs records the 
companies usually make the initial outlay for the production then 
seek repayment tied to the success of the record the video is 
promoting 
but 85 percent of our records fail to break even and in that 
case we shoulder the entire cost gold said 
there is some recovery for record companies through fees charged 
for exclusive use of videos on broadcast outlets but that hardly 
dents the production cost 
what has changed in the past five years is the amount of 
scrutiny about why we are doing a video what is it going to yield 
for the artist can we get a placement air time for the video 
and will we realize our goals and the artists goals rovner said 
a new standard practice for newly signed artists at cbs and 
other major labels is a screen test an artists first step to 
getting a video may be his or her last 
but even visually exciting acts have decided a video may not be 
the way to the top of the charts 
its always been our feeling that you should come see the band 
live because theres no way to translate the energy and the 
excitement of what goes on stage and try to put it inside a box the 
size of a tv set said alex van halen drummer of the rock group 
van halen 
for its 5150 album van halen released no promotional 
videos but later made a concertlength film from which video 
programs edited some clips similarly the band has decided to 
promote its ou812 album with a concert both albums reached the 
top of the charts without a video 
sometimes we will kick back and spend the promotional money 
putting a band on the road said aampms gold you can put a band 
out on the road for a long time for what it costs to do a video 
and in some cases the money is better spent 
music videos rose to prominence in the early 1980s but short 
promotional clips and segments from filmed concerts or shows have 
been popular since the 50s 
no one denies that videos played in heavy rotation on music 
television mtv video hits one vh1 or black entertainment 
television bet can mean big sales and instant recognition 
music video is as powerful if not more so than it has ever 
been mtv senior vice president lee masters said 
he noted for example that in the week of june 27 mtv had 
broken 10 acts of the top 40 listings 
in spite of the fact that mtv will be adding more nonmusic 
programming we have never had this many acts represented in the 
top 40 he said 
like other music video outlets mtv has matured in its seven 
years with 17 out of 168 weekly hours now devoted to nonvideo 
programs the video rotation has dropped from 120 to 80 clips and 
audience analysis has begun to determine what videos are presented 
and when 
one such change was the scheduling of club mtv a mix of new 
music videos and dance videos appreciated by younger teenagers 
for 330 pm when school generally lets out 
outlets have refused to show some videos whose content they 
consider controversial such as drug use explicit sexuality or 
nudity record companies also have to take into account that videos 
are presented in european markets on regular television sometimes 
on childrens shows 
you cant have anyone smoking nothing risque theres a 
whole list of things said aampms gold

commercial airliners are filling 
the skies in ever increasing numbers causing backups and delays 
that worry industry officials and leave passengers grumbling in 
airport waiting lounges 
industry officials in europe predict one of the gloomiest 
summers ever for flight delays as air traffic controllers struggle 
to allocate slots to a record number of flights in already crowded 
skies 
one of the reasons is the makeup of europe itself unlike the 
united states where airspace is controlled by a single aviation 
authority european airspace is divided into 34 different parcels 
each under different jurisdiction 
at the same time the air traffic industry is booming beyond 
anyones previous predictions said klausulrich moeller a 
spokesman for west germanys lufthansa international airline 
the number of flights is also growing in the far east but 
officials in japan and hong kong two of the orients major 
commercial air hubs say the competiton for airspace has not yet 
reached european proportions 
during the peak season booking a seat will be very difficult 
and planes will be very very full said geoffrey tudor a 
spokesman for japan airlines in tokyo 
but he added that conditions in the far east were not comparable 
to the traffic jam in western europes skies 
at terminals throughout europe tourists are fuming business 
travelers are grumbling and air traffic controllers are protesting 
at englands manchester international airport recently several 
hundred british tourists recently waited up to 20 hours to get off 
the ground 
airport officials rushed 700 extra seats into the airports 
waiting lounges and provided clowns and jugglers to keep passengers 
entertained 
in west germany tourists staged a sitin aboard a jetliner 
after they were told that their flight which had arrived three 
hours late from majorca in the mediterranean could not continue on 
to hamburg because the airport there had closed for the night 
airport authorities called in police to remove the passengers 
lufthansa officials say some of the airlines ground employees 
have been threatened by angry passengers frustrated passengers 
broke into tears after 23 flights were cancelled in one day at 
munichs airport officials said 
lufthansa spokesman moeller said the costs of such delays can be 
staggering for airlines 
he added that lufthansa jets alone have spent 4000 hours in 
holding patterns so far this year over west german airports and 
estimated that the delays will cost more than 55 million in fuel 
wages and maintenance 
civil aviation authorities in europe were not prepared for 
the new surge in traffic said a spokesman for the international 
civil aviation organization in paris they had not made 
investments in new equipment nor hired or trained personnel 
many air traffic controllers agreed 
it is not humanly possible to handle 700 flights within 10 
hours as we are asked to do regularly during the busy summer 
tourist season said a senior air traffic controller at el prat 
airport in barcelona spain 
a delay in england france or west germany can cause a ripple 
effect on runways throughout the continent controllers say 
the 170airline international air transport association iata 
says the gap between the demand for air travel and capacity will 
continue in europe unless governments take coordinated action 
we have airports and airspace capacity which can barely cope 
with todays demand let alone tomorrows said gunter eser 
iatas director general 
according to the genevabased associations statistics 
international air traffic increased by 13 percent last year and is 
continuing at that rate this year 
european air traffic also reached 13 percent in 1987 and is 
expected to increase by at least 7 percent this year 
transatlantic flights some airline officials say could jump by 
as much as 10 percent this year 
industry officials in japan say a record number of japanese are 
traveling overseas to take advantage of the increased value of the 
yen 
according to figures compiled by japans narita aviation 
authority the number of flights to the united states from japan 
increased 172 percent in 1987 over the previous year 
flights to australia and new zealand increased by more that 31 
percent according to the authority 
air traffic to south korea jumped by 128 percent and flights to 
china increased by almost 10 percent the authority said 
taipei a major transit point for many transpacific flights 
logged a record 11244 flights from hong kong a 204 percent 
increase over last year officials in hong kong said 
aviation officials in europe admit they were caught behind in 
technology and in contoltower manpower but they add that european 
airspace suffers from unique limitations 
two thirds of our airspace is reserved for the military 
lufthansas moeller said 
calls are growing for greater access to restricted military 
airspace especially in west germany where the air forces of nato 
nations fly regular training maneuvers 
west germany is planning to pump millions into upgrading its air 
traffic control technology over the next fews years and has 
approved pay raises for controllers 
measures also are being taken to extend night operations at many 
european airports 
to cope with the summer vacation rush transport ministers of 
the european economic community recently agreed to set up a red 
alert telephone link among western europes five busiest 
airports london frankfurt paris rome and madrid 
a crisis center also was set up to coordinate air traffic during 
the busiest summer weekends 
but aviation experts say no longterm solution can be found 
until a paneuropean data processing and central control system is 
set up 
air traffic control computers in western europes 34 different 
jurisdictions cannot communicate directly with each other now 
flights often go over small countries in just five or six 
minutes and that countrys air controllers must hand over the 
flight to the next country said joachim lischka chairman of the 
west german civil aviation authority 
what we really need is a central european authority to create 
more efficient less fragmented work 
but lischka said it may take years to put a unified system into 
operation 
in the meantime he added passengers can take some consolation 
in the fact that most delays occur in the cause of safety 
they just dont take off until we can handle them he said

fear of more killing here in troubled 
punjab has brought on an acute farmlabor shortage just as the 
season begins for transplanting rice 
agriculture officials are concerned the shortage will not only 
affect the economy of punjab the nations breadbasket but the 
national economy as well because the country depends on this 
northern states surplus to supply less developed regions 
an estimated onethird of the 700000 migrants who normally work 
in punjab fled in may after a spate of attacks by sikh militants 
left more than 70 poor hindu migrants dead large but still 
undetermined numbers are staying away now officials and farmers 
say 
earlier these laborers used to beg for jobs said pritam 
singh a farmer in horshiarpur district now the farmers have to 
beg before these workers times have changed 
the 58yearold singh is among the hardest hit because he leases 
his 100acre farm from a landlord and must come up with rent no 
matter what he had 14 migrant laborers working the land but only 
four are on the job 
most of the migrants come from the poorer states of bihar and 
uttar pradesh to the southeast they usually work through the 
various seasons for wheat corn sugarcane and rice going home in 
between 
sikh militants fighting for a separate nation in punjab have 
attacked both hindus and moderate sikhs since 1982 nearly 1500 
deaths this year have been blamed on the radicals from the minority 
faith 
but the sikh rebels did not particularly target migrant workers 
until may when 31 migrants were killed in an attack on a canal 
project the militants oppose because it would carry water to the 
hindumajority states of haryana and rajasthan 
a series of other attacks ensued killing 40 other workers and 
the exodus of migrants began 
punjab agricultural officials say few workers are coming back 
despite programs to ensure the workers safety 
they also note that some farmers are switching to planting 
sunflowers for their seeds because they take less labor than rice 
punjab has greatly increased rice production in recent years

a broad crosssection of american leaders says a 
distinctive hallmark of the nation free nonestablished religion 
is threatened by modern battling over it 
theyve sought to stake out some common ground to protect that 
principle of religious liberty 
in the conflicts the pendulum was described as having swung in 
american history from one pole to another from religious to 
secular semiestablishments 
but the standard is set by constitutions first amendment 
congress shall make no law regarding an establishment of 
religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereoff 
in the shifting applications of these doublededged clauses 
controversy lately has ballooned and confusion multiplied about 
relationships of church and state faith and politics 
the issue has frayed political campaigns and engulfed the 
courts more lawsuits about it have landed in the us supreme 
court in the last 25 years than in all the nations previous 
history 
the controversies over religion in public life pose both a 
danger and an opportunity says an unusual new document the 
williamsburg charter backed by a wide spectrum of religious 
academic business and political leaders 
citing dangers either of forcing religion out of public affairs 
or in reaction politicizing faith for laws to establish a 
christian america the charter calls for a renewed national 
compact about it 
social scientist os guinness of washington dc head of the 
project says any sense of shared agreement about the place of 
religion and politics has broken down 
he says recurring conflicts and the flood of cases about 
textbooks prayer abortion and an infinite number of things 
will intensify unless there is a process for restored consensus 
its important not just to religion but to democracy he 
said in an interview without it theres danger down the line 
he described the new charter already endorsed by about 150 
national leaders in various fields and expected to be signed by 
many others in state meetings this fall as like the queensbury 
rules that restrained boxing from sheer destructiveness 
it sets forth the place of religion in public life thats 
the heart of it and also guiding principles by which people of 
different religions or none can debate and contend robustly but 
with civility he said 
the 6000word charter says the constitutions religious 
liberty provisions hold the key to american distinctiveness and 
american destiny 
the guaranteed rights depend on recognition that they are 
neither given by the state nor can they be taken away by the 
state but are inherent in belief in the inviolability of the 
human person the charter says 
it says the meaning of those provisions is ignored whenever 
the logic of arguments favors either an unwarranted intrusion of 
religion into public life or an unwarranted exclusion of religion 
from it 
until well into the 20th century the charter says that there 
was a de facto semiestablishment of a generalized 
protestantism especially in the public schools 
but now the tendency was seen as swinging the other way 
toward the de facto semiestablishment of a wholly secular 
understanding of humanity and public institutions 
the charter aims at mapping a middle course between the secular 
left which has worked to push religion out of public life and the 
religious right which wants religious premises to predominate 
the document drawn up by the williamsburg charter foundation a 
private publicpolicy organization funded by individuals and 
corporations has gained an impressive array of backers 
they include present and former chief justices the chairmen of 
the republican and democratic national committees congress 
members corporate executives educators and various faith leaders 
evangelical and mainline 
however it so far hasnt gained support of some aggressive 
antagonists such as the american civil liberties union which 
opposes religion in the public sphere and moral majority which 
wants them prevailing there 
the charter says religion too often is dimissed as a purely 
private matter but this ignores the fact that the american 
system depends on ultimate beliefs for otherwise we have no 
right to the rights it upholds 
the first amendment guarantee of no interference with religion 
puts religious expression on an equal footing with all other 
forms of expressing in genuinely public forums the charter says 
it says that some in recent disputes have insisted that any 
evidence of religious influence on public policy represents an 
establishment of religion and is therefore precluded 
such exclusion of religion from public life is historically 
unwarranted philosophically inconsistent and profoundly 
undemocraticmany of the most dynamic social movements in 
american history including that of civil rights were legitimately 
inspired and shaped by religious motivation 
however the document criticizes religionists who bring to 
politics a misplaced absoluteness that idolizes politics 
satanizes their enemies and politicizes their own faith 
in the conflict participants often have been acrimonious and 
unfair the charter says urging greater balance mutual respect 
and civility

when hordes of panicky investors dumped stocks 
last oct 19 stan weinstein basked in the wisdom of a personal 
adage you make your own luck he had warned his newsletter 
readers a month earlier to cash out 
i sounded like a real party pooper recalled the market 
strategist and publisher of the professional tape reader which 
proclaimed an alert in midaugust to switch from stocks into other 
investments 
as it turned out he was one of the few professional tipsters 
who predicted wall streets dazzling rally was about to collapse 
since then weinstein said he has received hundreds of letters 
from grateful subscribers who told him you saved my life 
his prescient warning earned him the title of timer of the 
year bestowed by the market publication timer digest it 
also landed him guest spots on such television shows as 
moneyline and wall street week and inspired sales of his 
recent book about investing secrets for profiting in bull and 
bear markets 
the fame and publicity are mixed blessings to weinstein a 
transplanted new yorker who works out of his hollywood fla house 
and does most of his analysis with a pencil and paper 
his newsletter business is booming at a time when many 
competitors are suffering a decline in subscriptions a direct 
result of the october crash 
on the other hand weinstein said he now spends extended 
periods on the lecture circuit away from his home wife and three 
daughters gets hoarse talking about his strategies misses 
swatting a tennis ball and sometimes just wants to vegetate in his 
backyard pool 
i dont want to be a guru weinstein said during an 
interview in new york i dont want the idiot investor whos 
looking for the perfect stock strategist the stock market is sort 
of like gambling its another form of probability playing im a 
real good probability player 
as for luck the 46yearold weinstein said i dont go for 
that i think you make your own luck 
weinstein wouldnt disclose his worth or income from the 
newsletter business but dropped a few hints through the jewelry 
on his fingers and a big gold watch on his right wrist 
its very very lucrative he said the newsletter costs 
275 a year and ive got 12000 subscribers you figure it out 
weinsteins professional and personal lives are so intertwined 
that wife rita is his business manager overseeing an eightmember 
staff that works in an office addition to their house 
he said he typically works a 15hour day often late at night 
on the twicemonthly newsletter he exercises by jogging on a 
treadmill machine while watching the financial news network on 
cable tv 
thats not to imply he thinks business headlines are useful 
however as a technical analyst weinstein dismisses interestrate 
forecasts government economic reports corporate earnings and 
dividends as yesterdays news 
rather his approach is based on a stocks charted behavior over 
time which reflects what weinstein calls its differing stages of 
supply and demand learning how to interpret those stages correctly 
is the key to success in the stock market he said 
the broader market barometers such as the dow jones industrial 
average and the standard amp poors 500stock index react in much 
the same way as individual stocks do and can flash significant 
signals about future opportunity or risk 
even when he vacations with his family the newsletter must go 
on weinstein said hes dictated copy via telephone from holiday 
spots ranging from israel to hong kong he nearly had a disaster 
though when he went to the south pacific island borabora on a 
deadline day 
i found out after i arrived there was no phone he said i 
spent half a day making arrangements for a mobile telephone hookup 
well thats the price ive gotta pay im not going to lie its 
always with me 
weinsteins approach isnt infallible he readily admits he can 
be wrong but he claims his percentage of error is often less than 
others in the same business 
many of weinsteins contemporaries agree veteran strategist 
yale hirsch publisher of the stock traders almanac named 
weinsteins secrets of profiting in bull and bear markets as 
book of the year 
its very comprehensive hirsch said for the average 
investor who doesnt know too much you dont need any computers 
its a nice discipline 
robert nurock publisher of the widely read astute investor 
newsletter said weinstein gives a very strong case for technical 
analysis his book is an excellent guide 
weinstein said hes is flattered by the praise and hopes the 
book will continue to sell but what if everyone started using 
weinsteins methods and no longer sought his advice 
its not going to happen he said most people dont trust 
technicians they say we just use squiggles and wiggles im 
looking for the sophisticated investors 
weinstein said hes been playing the market for more than 30 
years he started by using his barmitzvah money to buy a handful of 
what he thought were highquality stocks thats when he learned 
the hard way about the risks of ignorant investing within a 
couple of years i blew the whole thing 
he developed his strategies for the best time to buy and sell 
based largely on an early career as a stockbroker and his own 
common sense not from his ba in economics from hofstra university 
on long island 
i had to learn to put my degree on the side he said the 
economics of today is the bull for tomorrow 
weinstein quit working for someone else in 1970 and went into 
newsletter writing slowly developing a base of subscribers he 
abandoned brokering he said because i was upset with the bosss 
churnem and burnem philosophy 
although he gets hundreds of complimentary letters weinstein 
said occasionally hell receive a nasty note from a disgruntled 
subscriber which he keeps in a separate file 
i once got one that said mr weinstein my barber knows more 
about stocks than you do he recalled it was a guy who had 
subscribed for two weeks i wrote him back and said i didnt think 
we were the right newsletter for him i returned his money

editors note the 100000 american missionaries in foreign 
lands are becoming more vulnerable as security tightens around more 
conventional targets of terrorists but an unusual organization is 
teaching hundreds of them how to reduce the danger short of hiring 
armed guards and driving armorplated cars 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
taking some cues from the bible itself a 
group of christian law enforcement specialists and other volunteers 
is teaching american missionaries abroad how to protect themselves 
from terrorists 
as security tightens around the traditional political and 
economic targets terrorists are striking at the more vulnerable 
religious community overseas according to chester l quarles of 
oxford one of the founders of the unusual organization 
quarles the director of the university of mississippis law 
enforcement program helped form contingency preparation 
consultants a private nonprofit group based in ventura calif 
that has provided antiterrorism training for more than 500 
missionaries from 18 denominations 
we believe god is in control but we believe as in ephesians 
61018 that we should put on the whole armor of god and use all of 
the knowledge skill and ability we have to survive as soulwinning 
evangelical christians quarles tells people attending his 
workshops 
a missionary cannot afford an armorplated mercedesbenz and 
would not want an armed guard quarles says but missionaries can 
be taught ways to avoid becoming victims of terrorism and increase 
their chances of not being harmed if kidnapped or involved in a 
plane hijacking 
we see this as a ministry says quarles the son of the late 
chester l quarles sr who served for years as executive secretary 
and treasurer of the southern baptist convention board each of 
us had a deep desire to put our specialized knowledge skills and 
expertise to work in the service of the lord we come from 
different denominational backgrounds but share the bond of christs 
love 
others helping in the training of missionaries are ted childress 
of knoxville tenn a retired fbi agent who is now director of 
training for a major defense contractor richard farley of la 
jolla calif a clinical psychologist and bob klamser of ventura 
calif a police lieutenant who commands his departments hostage 
negotiation team 
quarles says that in the past two years hes traveled to nine 
countries to conduct his antiterrorism workshops which last 2 
days quarles has had several articles published in the 
nondenominational evangelical missions quarterly and hes 
writing a book on missionaries and terrorism 
almost 50 american missionaries have suffered violent deaths 
around the world in the past 20 years including two from the 
kansas city pentecostal fellowship who were among 10 people hacked 
to death by terrorists last november in zimbabwe 
klamser the president of contingency preparation consultants 
says he personally knows of eight american missionaries who have 
suffered violent deaths abroad in the past five years 
four missionaries are currently being held hostage 
while most of the missionaries have been released unharmed 
quarles expects things to get worse before they get better 
americas 100000 missionaries abroad are being singled out 
more by terrorists he says but theyre not being focused upon 
because they are christians theyre being focused upon because 
theyre americans and theyre westerners 
the us government and private corporations have spent millions 
of dollars beefing up security at offices overseas and there about 
30 private organizations worldwide specializing in antiterrorist 
training 
but quarles says missionary groups cant afford to bring in 
private help 
contingency asks for reimbursement for outofpocket expenses 
such as travel the workshop speakers donate their time 
the missionaries also turn to contingency preparation 
consultants because the group provides instructors with a christian 
background 
often the zeal of the missionaries makes them unduly confident 
in troubled lands putting themselves as well as others in danger 
quarles says for example it took a lot of talking to persuade one 
protestant missionary in honduras to leave the village where he was 
serving even though intelligence sources had indicated he was 
targeted by a terrorist group he eventually left for the sake of 
the village 
each antiterrorism workshop begins with several scriptural 
references illustrating the concepts to be taught for example 
paul and silas fled enemies in thessalonica even though local 
church members had asked them to stay 
david archibald is among those who have attended quarles 
workshop he moved in june from waxhaw nc to peru on 
administrative assignment for jungle aviation and radio service 
the technical support arm of wycliffe bible translators of dallas 
wycliffe has hundreds of people in 48 countries and wanted its 
staff to be more aware of security archibald says he had traveled 
in foreign countries while working for private industry but had 
never heard many of the safety tips provided by quarles 
the typical thing was to have a business card on your 
briefcase archibald says quarles cautioned that that was an 
invitation to a terrorist looking for someone with an 
administrative or ecclesiastical position 
if you are traveling in an area where airline hijackings 
occur quarles said to stay away from doors dont sit next to the 
aisle where terrorists can more easily reach you things like that 
i hadnt thought of he said 
mission aviation fellowship of redlands calif began using 
quarles workshops following the abduction of 33yearold pilot dan 
rogers in surinam rogers was kidnapped by the group jungle 
commandos last oct 30 and released unharmed on nov 7 
in our opinion theyre one of the best says marianne 
pielin executive assistant to the president of mission aviation

dana delany insists that china beach the 
new series about the vietnam war is based on real life 
delany stars as nurse colleen mcmurphy who is assigned to a 
medical evacuation center located at china beach near da nang in 
vietnam its also the site of a recreation facility for american 
troops 
the series which made its bow on abc in april was created by 
writerproducer john sacret young and william broyles jr a marine 
officer in vietnam and a former newsweek editor 
some people who were in vietnam either in the service or as 
news correspondents have criticized the show saying they never 
saw anything like china beach 
delany disagrees 
broyles was in vietnam and our stories are all based on things 
that happened she says one of our writers was a radio 
operator there 
delany says shes done some research on her own about vietnam 
and hopes to go there this christmas an uncle kevin delany was 
the head of abc news in vietnam and was evacuated on one of the 
last helicopters out of saigon before the fall of the city 
china beach focuses on the women in vietnam chloe webb who 
will not be back next season as a regular portrays uso singer 
laurette barber and nan woods is red cross worker cherry white 
one of the criticisms has been directed against the red cross 
girl that the men in the show put her on a pedestal delany 
says in drama you need archetypes cherry white was the 
innocent although by the sixth show she was no longer innocent 
and the men were very protective 
as for her own character delany says colleen in the twohour 
movie pilot was much different from colleen in the episodes shes 
changed so much shes guarded emotionally because of all the pain 
and death she sees on a daily basis 
although only the twohour pilot and six episodes were made of 
china beach it has become one of the most popular shows on abc 
and one of the most critically acclaimed 
delany is just back from a visit to italy where her sister is 
living temporarily she also went to the cannes film festival for 
the showing of patty a new film about the kidnapping of 
patricia hearst on feb 4 1974 by the symbionese liberation army

watts shootout

kidnapped she says a friend of mine at andover had known 
patty i saved a time magazine story about her patty and her 
husband came to cannes for the screening the movie due out in

delany worked on patty at the same time as the china 
beach pilot she also will be seen soon in moon over parador 
a comedy made in brazil which stars richard dreyfuss and raul 
julia dreyfuss plays an american actor forced to assume the role 
of a latin american dictator who has died suddenly julia is the 
power behind the scenes delany plays an actress in the movie 
dreyfuss was working on 
the movie we were supposedly filming is like miami vice 
she says richard has a don johnson look with the hair and the 
white suit 
moon over parador was her second movie in brazil she also 
did when the river runs black with charles durning 
delany grew up in new york city and attended wesleyan 
university after college she worked in new york for seven years 
appearing in the soap operas love of life and as the world 
turns and the offbroadway production of bloodmoon she moved 
to the west with the play and caught the eye of produceractor

down his proposal of marriage and bruce willis girlfriend in 
moonlighting she was also peter hortons girlfriend in abcs 
thirtysomething

people recognize the melodies if not the man 
behind the music 
i can dream cant i ill be seeing you dear hearts 
and gentle people let a smile be your umbrella that old 
feeling by a waterfall when i take my sugar to tea 
wedding bells are breaking up that old gang of mine 
these and scores of other songs are the lifes work of sammy 
fain 
at 86 fain is one of the last of a breed of songwriters who 
wrote their way from tin pan alley to broadway to hollywood during 
the golden days between the two world wars give them a job and 
theyd write a song fast 
you know youd get an assignment on monday fain says 
matteroffactly and theyd be rehearsing the orchestra by 
thursday its one of those things 
if his name isnt as wellknown as a rodgers gershwin porter 
or berlin it may be because he never had a big broadway musical 
although fain did write the music for hellzapoppin the 
longrunning vaudeville escapade remembered more for the antics of 
comics ole olson and chic johnson than its songs 
the success that eluded fain on broadway was found in hollywood 
dozens of film assignments 10 academy award nominations and two 
bestsong oscars for secret love and love is a many 
splendored thing 
now theatergoers have a chance to sample a fain rarity ankles 
aweigh a 1955 broadway musical that had nothing more on its mind 
than gags girls and a good time 
the show is on view at the goodspeed opera house that 
gingerbox musical museum in east haddam conn best known as the 
birthplace of annie and for its sterling revivals of vintage 
musicals from the 1920s and 30s it will run through sept 30 
a new book has been written for the musical by charles busch 
author and star of the longrunning offbroadway hit vampire 
lesbians of sodom buschs revamped plot still set in the 1950s 
had something to do with hollywood starlets the us navy italy 
and a secret code coveted by the russians 
ankles aweigh is an oldfashioned show fain said the 
other day during a visit to the headquarters of the american 
society of composers authors and publishers its got a lot of 
good rhythmic tunes and ballads which i like to do 
fain whose family lived in new york was born into music his 
father was a cantor his older brother played violin in broadway 
pit orchestras his cousin was willie howard the great sadfaced 
comedian 
every winter i would get pneumonia fain recalls so the 
family eventually moved from the city to the catskills 
living up in the country all i had was the piano says 
fain who taught himself to play and to write his own music i 
had a rather interesting little alto voice id just get up and 
sing my own material 
after high school singing brought him back to new york and a 
job as a staff pianist with jack mills who ran a music publishing 
company 
they hired me to demonstrate and teach their songs to all the 
performing artists fain says i would sell the songs to big 
performers it helped me learn to play in every key 
he also performed in vaudeville and on radio as part of an act 
called dunn and fain but he never stopping writing his first hit 
song with lyrics by al dubin was published in 1925 its title 
was nobody knows what a redhead mama can do and fain was on 
his way 
two years later he teamed up with irving kahal a young 
vaudeville performer and writer their partnership took them to 
hollywood and back again to broadway and lasted until kahal died in 
1942 
in california fain and kahal contributed songs to such movie 
musical classics as footlight parade and dames the songs 
they wrote during those days were sweet and saucy with titles like 
two little flies on a lump of sugar and when you were a smile 
on your mothers lips and a twinkle in your daddys eye 
a good title is an incentive to me fain says ill change 
my melody if i hear a good line im not stubborn about it thats 
collaboration 
and fain has worked with some of the best word men in the 
business besides kahal his lyricists have included al dubin jack 
yellen ey harburg mitchell parish joe young lew brown ralph 
freed and paul francis webster 
when i play a good tune for a lyricist it gives him some 
construction fain says music can lead you to a different 
construction and sometimes a good lyricist likes that it gives 
them a chance to dig for a different kind of rhyme 
ankles aweigh which has lyrics by dan shapiro originally 
ran in new york for six months besides hellzapoppin and its 
sequel sons o fun it was one of fains longer running 
broadway shows 
many of his other musicals such as christine something 
more and toplitsky of notre dame disappeared quickly 
flahooley a 1951 fain musical that starred yma sumac barbara 
cook and bil bairds marionettes has developed an almost legendary 
reputation 
the score one of fains best graced a witty and satirical book 
by ey harburg that told the story of a laughing doll and its 
effect on the big business of toymaking 
that show was the talk of philadelphia said fain recalling 
flahooleys triumphant outoftown opening only new york 
seemed unimpressed and the musical died after only 40 performances 
it was a very unusual show fain sats someday somebody 
will revive flahooley and it will be a hit 
if the shows werent successful much of the music was consider 
two of fains biggest hit songs i can dream cant i and 
ill be seeing you they somehow survived a 1938 flop called 
right this way that lasted two weeks on broadway 
fain keeps writing today turning out new songs at his home in 
beverly hills calif 
i like to read the script fain says that gives me an 
idea for a melody many times i play a certain little progression 
and the lyricist will say thats great if he doesnt like it 
ill switch it around to fit a line we help each other thats the 
way to work

doctors and nurses in scrub suits the colors 
of sherbet wheeled another patient into the operating room for a 
brief procedure placing fertilized eggs in her womb 
everyone involved hoped they would cling there and grow into a 
pregnancy but everyone knew they probably would not 
the scene played out on a video monitor over the heads of 
georgeanna and howard jones whose in vitro fertilization clinic 
gets credit for about 400 testtube babies including the first 
in this country 
in a month the woman on the screen would receive a phone call 
telling her whether or not she was pregnant roughly three times in 
four even at the best centers like the jones institute for 
reproductive medicine at eastern virginia medical school the 
answer is no 
its always hard said the 77yearold dr howard as 
colleagues call him 
but said dr georgeanna whos 76 it more than 
compensates when you call to say yes 
on monday it will be 10 years since in vitro technology was 
proven with the birth of louise joy brown in britain the first of 
an estimated 10000 such infants born to infertile couples around 
the world 
in vitro fertilization has become routine medicine a 
multimilliondollar business and a catalyst of new ethical debate 
with each research advance 
at least 169 in vitro centers operate in 41 states in this 
country alone and with the proliferation have come questions that 
practitioners and policymakers are now being pressed to answer 
why isnt success more common 
are in vitro clinics and their practices adequately regulated 
why does in vitro cost so much 4000 to 6000 on average 
per attempt and should insurance companies or taxpayers help pay 
the bill 
why has the federal government maintained a de facto 
moratorium on financing research 
have some clinics taken advantage of a vulnerable patient 
population to make a profit 
some clinics are selling false hope asserted gary ellis 
director of a justcompleted study of infertility for the 
congressional office of technology assessment 
a clinic knows if it has had any babies born a clinic that 
keeps admitting people in the front door and does not have any 
births i ask you what are they selling theyre selling false 
hope 
he and others stressed that only a minority of clinics fell into 
that category but the vast market for infertility services 2 
million to 3 million american couples unable to have babies 
enhances the danger of charlatanry and fraud 
you can charge these people more because theyre more 
desperate said gina de miranda who founded a consumer 
protection group in texas for infertile people after her own years 
of frustration and sadness 
what youve had is a whole lot of clinics opening all over the 
united states with varying rates of success and in order to break 
even theyve got to get more patients in and charge them as much as 
they can she said 
infertility treatments cost americans 1 billion last year 66 
million of that for what has become the treatment of last resort 
in vitro fertilization according to the ota study 
mrs de miranda whose lobbying made texas one of the five 
states along with maryland massachusetts hawaii and arkansas to 
require insurance companies to offer coverage of in vitro advises 
anyone thinking of the procedure to ask questions 
patients need to know more than the basics of in vitro the 
hormonal stimulation of the woman to produce more than one egg in a 
month the retrieval by doctors of as many eggs as possible the 
mixing of those eggs with the husbands sperm in a petri dish and 
the implanting of fertilized eggs or embryos in the uterus 
patients should ask among other questions suggested by mrs de 
mirandas group how long a program has been in operation its rate 
of live births how many retrieval procedures recover a mature egg 
and how often the procedure is canceled before the embryo implant 
stage 
success rates should be spelled out she and others said 
stressing the need for clear definitions for example a 
pregnancy defined early in chemical terms may never produce a 
baby and hard numbers 
a recent report by 41 us in vitro centers claimed a combined 
rate of clinical pregnancy determined by detectable fetal 
heartbeat of 17 percent per embryo transfer calculating 
miscarriages and other loss the chance of having a baby after one 
embryo transfer was 11 percent 
the centers surveyed were among the nations most successful 
scores of others still have recorded no births 
the jones institute reported that 500 patients underwent 736 
stimulation cycles last year in 537 cases embryos were 
transferred of those 169 clinical pregnancies occurred or 23 
percent per attempted stimulation 295 percent per embryo 
transfer the miscarriage rate was 24 percent 
noting that even fertile couples have only a 25 percent chance 
of achieving a pregnancy in any one month of trying howard jones 
said hes pleased with his centers total of about 400 babies to 
date 
it sounds so easy to do you get an egg and get some sperm 
you put em together and you transfer them nothin to it he 
said smiling in fact its not easy its a very demanding and 
exacting science and art to interpret sometimes contradictory 
signals to harvest eggs at just the right moment of maturation 
it just doesnt seem to be a technique thats easily taught 
and transferable 
even so 41 states have at least one ivf center california has 
22 texas 14 and new york 11 according to the ota report the nine 
states without centers are alaska arkansas idaho maine montana 
new hampshire north dakota south dakota and wyoming 
waiting lists for the established centers can be as long as two 
years but the report also noted nearly half of all centers 
have yet to achieve a live birth 
most centers are notforprofit though some are forprofit 
adjuncts of research hospitals and still others operate strictly as 
profitmaking concerns 
who monitors the quality of care at these clinics asked 
rep ron wyden dore chairing a congressional committee hearing 
last month on the proliferation of in vitro centers 
noting that guidelines set by a professional group the american 
fertility society are voluntary he answered his own question 
there are no federal or state requirements for accreditation or 
reporting there is in fact no public accountability at all

in a step toward consumer protection he promised the federal 
government would survey success rates of all us in vitro clinics 
and make the results public 
dr richard marrs director of the in vitro center at los 
angeles hospital of the good samaritan testified that even though 
regulation of reproductive medicine is a sensitive issue the 
procedures performed are potentially dangerous without standard 
licensing of the facilities and personnel 
government involvement is not something that medicine normally 
seeks but howard jones too chastised washington for staying away 
from infertility research 
the national institutes of health have never provided any 
funds for in vitro fertilization or its offshoots such as transfer 
of egg and sperm directly to the fallopian tubes and embryo 
freezing for later implant because of pressures which the 
politicians are not willing to buck he said 
federal regulations require that a special ethics advisory board 
approve governmentfunded in vitro research but since 1980 no 
secretary of health and human services has appointed the board 
a de facto moratorium has resulted and mrs de miranda who 
says federal funding would ensure bettercontrolled research 
blames it on righttolifers within and without the government 
for some ethical difficulties arise as soon as embryos are 
created the central part of the in vitro process and of research 
to improve the technique 
i think its just a straightout fear of touching upon the 
whole issue of abortion asserted arthur l caplan director of 
the university of minnesotas center for biomedical ethics 
the vatican in its 1987 instruction on respect for human 
life recognized no moral distinction between embryos at the 
moment of conception and fetuses and fully developed humans they 
must be protected equally yet many physicians and ethicists do 
make distinctions and consider medical research using embryos to be 
justifiable 
regardless of the controversy caplan argues the government has 
an obligation not to evade an issue that affects so many americans 
it just shows a culpable lack of leadership 
at a congressional hearing earlier this month rep ted weiss 
dny sought to find out why the health and human services 
department has declined to appoint the required ethics board 
for years the agency fended off the question 
a 1986 memo by an hhs staff member to dr robert windom 
assistant secretary for health suggested windom could reply to the 
american association for the advancement of sciences call for an 
ethics board by sending a letter that was warm but 
noncommittal the memo said the national institutes of health saw 
advantages in proceeding as we have avoiding cost and 
controversy associated with a permanent board 
finally facing the weiss panel this july 14 the department was 
ready to respond more fully just two days earlier windom 
testified hhs secretary otis bowen had agreed to reestablish the 
board first however the boards charter must be redefined 
and the new scope and purpose published in the federal register 
followed by a 60day public comment period the reagan 
administration could be out of office by then 
theyve timed it obviously so they can be free of 
controversy weiss said in a telephone interview 
nor are the issues of right and wrong simple in this uncharted 
realm 
in the jones institutes labs among others researchers are 
trying to find a way to help in those cases in which a husband does 
not produce the millions of sperm needed for natural fertilization 
with microinjection directly into the egg only one sperm would 
be needed 
a purely humanitarian avenue of research to which no one could 
object 
ethicists wonder 
which one sperm will it produce a boy or a girl who chooses 
whos responsible if the baby is abnormal 
for another question the response is clearer why have couples 
continued to pursue in vitro for a decade despite its 
uncertainties 
the answer is in a portrait on the wall in howard jones office 
showing twinklyeyed twin girls wholl be 3 next month heather and 
ashley smith 
the day the jones institute opened sarah smith was at the door 
the first to sign up for in vitro id had several operations to 
correct problems she explained you just have a drive to have 
a child 
seven failures later however shed given up she and her 
husband robert had been saving every penny for years for the 
procedures she was 38 and emotionally spent 
when it didnt work she said it was just like a death 
had occurred 
still robert asked her to make one last try 
a month after the implant the phone call from the clinic 
finally came it was christmastime and mrs smiths present was 
two tiny heartbeats 
she caught her breath then shouted then wept at last it was 
time for the announcement shed ached to make 
i asked my mother do you still believe in miracles she 
just looked at me mrs smith recalled 
i said im going to have a baby

i must have done something wrong to deserve this 
that diary entry from an infertility patient reported by a 
washington dc psychologist hints at the fragile state of mind 
of many unable to reproduce but doctors say there are 
welldocumented physical reasons for the condition 
infertility is defined as the inability of a couple to conceive 
after 12 months of trying without contraception 
among women the cause may be a hormonal disturbance impairing 
ovulation or endometriosis a disease in which cells of the 
uterine lining grow outside the uterus and disrupt the reproductive 
cycle or it may be scarred or blocked fallopian tubes the normal 
site of fertilization 
tubes are most often damaged by pelvic inflammatory disease 
studies have shown intrauterine devices can increase this risk in 
women fertility decreases markedly after age 35 
male infertility usually results from abnormal or insufficient 
numbers of sperm researchers cite such factors as environmental 
hazards drug abuse cancer and testicular blood vessel problems 
in 20 percent of cases of infertility sexually transmitted 
diseases often treatable are blamed 
in up to 20 percent more no clinically demonstrable cause is 
ever found

with shoulderlength blonde hair blue 
eyes and chubby cheeks the worlds first testtube baby is 
growing up in her own words just like all the girls at school 
louise joy brown approaches her 10th birthday with a knack for 
writing stories and poems and getting into trouble for playing 
outdoors too late 
louises birth in oldham england on july 25 1978 was hailed 
as a medical breakthrough on the order of the first heart 
transplant as the first human conceived outside the womb she gave 
hope to millions of childless couples 
now louise has a sister 6yearold natalie also conceived 
through in vitro fertilization and sees nothing special about 
testtube babies 
the sisters and their parents truck driver john brown 47 and 
his wife lesley 40 live in a modest twostory house in 
whitchurch a suburb of this bustling western england seaport 
louise attends a neighborhood school wansdyke primary and 
belongs to the local brownie troop 
i just like to play and i like doing english she said 
proudly displaying stories and poems she had written 
she is a very bright child and if she can just learn to 
concentrate and work a bit harder then she can do very well for 
herself her father said 
shes a monkey mrs brown said but even so she could be 
really talented at whatever she does 
a doting father brown says he gets annoyed when louise fails to 
return home on time from playing outdoors 
i told her that if she was late again she would have to write 
out 500 times i must not be late he said but she is so full 
of life and so friendly that it doesnt make any difference 
i was worried that she might grow up a spoilt brat he added 
the browns volunteered for the thenpioneering in vitro 
treatment after failing to produce children in nine years of 
marriage 
mrs browns infertility resulted from a fallopian tube 
blockage her husband has another daughter sharon 27 by a 
previous marriage 
gynecologist patrick steptoe and physiologist robert edwards 
spent a decade developing the procedure that made louises life 
possible 
brown said it was sad that steptoe who died in march couldnt 
share in louises 10th birthday celebrations 
but louise is a sort of tribute to him he said

since the worlds first testtube baby was 
born in england 10 years ago the medical technique that made her 
life possible has spread around the world and spawned an array of 
treatments to help childless couples 
its been astonishing the ideas are coming from 
everywhere said physiologist robert edwards who with the late 
gynecologist patrick steptoe pioneered the technique known as in 
vitro fertilization 
there have been some amazing advances especially in 
unlocking some of the mysteries of early human growth and 
hereditary diseases edwards said 
originally developed as a treatment for women with blocked 
fallopian tubes in vitro fertilization has produced a range of 
techniques such as embryo freezing wombleasing and egg donation 
to treat infertility in both men and women 
virtually every industrialized country has an established in 
vitro program and many developing countries such as china india 
and egypt have entered the field 
because few countries keep records of in vitro births no 
precise estimate exists of their number worldwide 
however a survey by ap bureaus indicated at least 10000 
testtube babies have been born since the first louise joy brown 
on july 25 1978 
britain australia france the united states west germany 
belgium and austria account for the majority of testtube babies 
worldwide 
but fledgling programs also have been set up in asia the middle 
east and latin america often in defiance of religious and economic 
objections 
in the conservative islamic nations of the middle east for 
example theologians initially balked at in vitro because of the 
korans teaching against westernstyle adoption procedures and 
birth outside marriage but clinics have sprung up in saudi arabia 
and egypt mainly catering to the wealthy and two clinics are 
expected to open soon in bahrain 
italy meanwhile has established a flourishing testtube baby 
program despite the roman catholic churchs objections to 
artificial reproduction 
china while imposing a strict onechildperfamily regime to 
control its population of more than 1 billion announced the birth 
of its first testtube baby this year indias first testtube baby 
was born two years ago 
in vitro researchers say assisted conceptions produce a 
statistically negligible addition to the population and edwards 
says those who criticize populous countries for promoting new 
childbirth methods should reanalyze their own view of life 
a chinese woman has the same urge to have children as a 
british woman he said you cant just set aside a group of 
patients and leave them to suffer in silence 
despite the proliferation of clinics the steptoeedwards 
technique remains a costly hitandmiss proposition available to 
only about 5 percent of childless couples 
nearly 10 years after the first baby was born as a result of 
in vitro fertilization this treatment is still largely 
unsuccessful said a report in the june 25 issue of the british 
medical journal 
it said the latest figures show that in britain only 11 percent 
of women got pregnant and 9 percent had a live baby after a single 
cycle of treatment and other countries with advanced programs had 
similar success rates 
the treatment has brought an awful lot of joy and happiness 
for a lot of people but also a lot of disappointment said dr 
peter brinsden deputy director of the fertility and in vitro 
fertilization unit at londons humana hospital wellington 
eventually he expects the success rate to creep up to 20 to 
30 percent but noted its a long way down the road 
brinsden and his colleagues are among world leaders in the 
latest in vitro spinoff known as gamete intrafallopian transfer or 
gift in which doctors transfer egg and sperm directly into the 
fallopian tube for fertilization in the womb 
the humana unit has reported a 312 percent success rate with 
gift but it has the drawback of being available only to women with 
at least one unblocked fallopian tube the normal site of 
conception 
although edwards said his clinic at bourn hall near cambridge 
has a much higher pregnancy rate than average he acknowledged that 
the biggest in vitro advances have been in research into hereditary 
diseases rather than improving the techniques success rate 
under the steptoeedwards technique ova are removed from the 
mother mixed with the prospective fathers sperm in a laboratory 
dish and reimplanted in the mothers uterus 
to increase the chances of pregnancy doctors now routinely use 
drugs to stimulate ovulation and fertilize and implant three or 
four embryos at a time resulting in a high incidence of multiple 
births 
australia which began in vitro research as far back as 1971 and 
has produced an estimated 2000 babies has pioneered the storing 
of frozen embryos in liquid nitrogen 
the procedure which saves embryos for later use if the first 
attempt at pregnancy fails has proved highly controversial 
in 1983 a quandary developed over what came to be known as the 
worlds first testtube orphans embryos left in australian 
cold storage after their american parents died in a plane crash 
the embryos were offered to a childless couple last december but 
it is not known whether they were ever used 
an estimated 10000 frozen embryos are now stockpiled around the 
world 3000 in france 1000 in britain and most of the others in 
australia raising concerns over their fate should their parents 
die or decide not to claim them 
australia france west germany sweden italy and spain have 
all taken steps to regulate in vitro but the most comprehensive 
nationwide controls are expected to emerge in britain where the 
government has proposed legislation covering the entire field of 
fertility treatment and embryo research

from ernest thayers famous poem casey at the 
bat to james thurbers short story you could look it up 
baseball has been literatures favorite sport 
that tradition continues with roger angells season ticket 
houghton mifflin co 1895 the fourth book the fiction editor 
at the new yorker magazine has written about the summer game 
although he writes about drugs and strikes temperamental owners 
and milliondollar salaries angell believes the real story is 
still on the playing field and he approvingly cites the saying of 
the late chicago white sox owner bill veeck that baseball is a game 
to savor 
this insatiable thirst by the fans for what someone is really 
like is ok angell said but i think they sort of miss the 
point for why theyre there in the first place 
angell has been writing about baseball since 1962 each year he 
visits the spring training camps in florida and arizona travels to 
ballparks around the country during the regular season and attends 
as many postseason games as possible he is not just interested in 
the games themselves but how they are played 
the past few years ive been asking how they catch how they 
pitch he said in an interview the players once they know 
youre interested in what theyre doing you cant shut them up 
season ticket compiles articles starting with the 1983 
season through the summer of 1987 when angell describes a visit to 
baseballs hall of fame in cooperstown ny whether writing about 
the 1986 world series or discussing the intricacies of how catchers 
field their position angell is continually surprised at how much 
there is to learn about baseball 
im just beginning to understand we all go through this its 
very easy for fans to think that they know the game he said 
listen to new york mets announcer tim mccarver this is a guy 
whos been playing the game all his life and everytime i listen i 
learn something new 
in the preface of season ticket angell writes that baseball 
is a game that can never be fully understood 
i will always be an amateur of baseball but i no longer feel 
like an outsider none of the old pros i talked to gave me the 
impression that he had subdued the game either we are baffled but 
still learning and we keep coming back for more 
angell was born in 1920 his mother katherine was an editor at 
the new yorker for many years his stepfather was eb white 
he white suffered writing but made it look easy angell 
said he taught me how difficult it is to write 
although he admires the spare clean prose that was whites 
trademark angell changes his style when writing about baseball 
i think that ive developed a habit of rather long sentences 
with parentheses which i dont use in other writing he said 
you use runon sentences like the flavor of the runon feeling in 
the ballgame 
angell believes the pace of a baseball game makes it easier to 
write about baseball is linear one thing happens then 
something else happens he said you can take notes you can go 
back and recreate a game and you can almost always explain why 
something happened 
you cant do that with basketball or hockey they move too 
fast 
as someone who became a fan when babe ruth was in his prime 
angell has seen many changes night games artificial turf the 
designated hitter he has lost none of his enthusiasm 
the game itself has hardly changed at all in our lifetime the 
leagues are bigger the players are better paid but it has the same 
feel its a real part of summer 
like many fans angell has imagined himself playing in the major 
leagues he was a pitcher in high school and use to dream about 
striking out the side he remembers when his fantasy stopped 
at some point in my upper 30s or early 40s i was seeing a 
psychiatrist and i came in with a dream angell recalled i 
dreamed that there were some bushes and shrubbery and there was a 
gravestone with my name and my birthday on it and the year i was in 
i took this dream to my shrink with some trepidation and he 
asked how i felt and i said i felt sort of sad he asked me what 
the gravestone reminded me of and i said it reminds of those stones 
out in center field in yankee stadium 
then i realized it meant the end of my baseball dreams 
in a chapter discussing the drug problems that have tarnished 
baseballs image in recent years angell warns against expecting 
too much of the players 
i think a great many of us have begun to see how deeply we 
want baseball players and other athletes to be better than we are 
we may wish this now more than ever before because other heroes 
in politics in our daily lives seem to be in short supply 
angell never worries about expecting too much from the game 
itself 
the enthusiasm i have for baseball is real he said my 
appreciation has increased with the knowledge ive noticed a lot 
of players feel this way too

in a summer that delivered an army of dwarfs and an extremely 
charming rabbit to movie theaters one might wonder whether a 
talking robot is a little much 
no way short circuit 2 a sequel to the original of a few 
seasons back is a sweet surprise package that will charm your 
socks off 
its star is unquestionably a robot but never has a hunk of 
metal been quite so adorable 
if you remember the first short circuit the creature 
dubbed number five was invented as a tool of war but the robot 
was struck by lightning reprogrammed itself and escaped from the 
military 
number five is alive said promos for the first movie 
now two years later the robot has taken a human name johnny 
five and his adventurous spirit craves input information on 
the world around him 
meanwhile his inventor ben jahrvi an indian who speaks 
malaprop has fallen on hard times fired from the military the 
inventor played by fisher stevens has taken to selling miniature 
johnny fives on streetcorners a department store buyer falls in 
love with the toys orders 1000 of them and the plot is off and 
running 
when johnny five is shipped to the big city to help with toy 
production the countrybred robots circuits get overloaded with 
input adventures abound johnny five gets involved with street 
hoodlums and bank robbers and becomes the intermediary in a love 
affair he gets mugged hugged and spray painted with graffiti and 
he tries on an array of colorful outfits seeking his own fashion 
image 
when hes pushed out the window of a 34story skyscraper johnny 
five has a magical way out after all this is a fairy tale the 
gleaming backdrop by the way is toronto 
in various action scenes johny five flies swings from a crane 
and dizzily spins two villains who intrude upon the toy factory 
johnny five is supported by some able human actors in addition 
to stevens as the addled jahrvi theres michael mckean as a 
smalltime hustler whose baser instincts are reformed by johnny 
fives friendship the always amusing jack weston is a sneaky 
villain named oscar 
kenneth johnsons direction of the script by ss wilson and

a summer story is a sad beautiful romance of human choices 
and regrets and of how love sometimes fails to overcome 
differences between people 
set in the gorgeous devon countryside just after the turn of the 
century the film focuses on upperclass londoner frank ashton 
james wilby who is spending a holiday trekking through the moors 
when he twists his ankle 
while recovering he rents a room in a farmhouse where he soon 
falls in love with the incredibly pretty megan a farm girl 
portrayed by film newcomer imogen stubbs of the royal shakespeare 
company 
ashtons presence is resented by farm owner mrs narracombe 
susannah york and by her son joe jerome flynn who long has 
hoped to marry megan 
after a few idyllic and clandestine midnight meetings the young 
lovers must part although ashton promises to return to fetch megan 
the outcome of this romance is influenced by the social class 
boundaries so rigid in england before world war i but the choices 
ashton faces also deal with timeless issues of commitment 
responsibility and free will 
directed by piers haggard a summer story is being shown in 
theaters only in los angeles new york and perhaps up to 50 other 
big cities it is a quiet film unlikely to attract the mass 
audience drawn by blockbusters and adventure movies 
but it belongs to a too often overlooked class of films that 
deal with real people and genuine human emotions films that touch 
the heart and the brain rather than blast the eardrums 
penelope mortimers screenplay is based on the apple tree a 
classic romance story written in 1916 by john galsworthy the 
british author best known for his forsyte saga trilogy 
a summer story released by atlantic entertainment group 
was produced by danton rissner it is rated pg13 with adult 
themes and some sex and nudity running time 95 minutes

stanley kubrick was at a disadvantage when full metal jacket 
hit the nations movie screens last summer oliver stones 
platoon had already nabbed academy awards including best 
picture and helped galvanize a nation around the haunting 
reminders of a terrifying time 
other vietnam war movies also had floated by francis coppolas 
gardens of stone lionel chetwynds the hanoi hilton and 
john irvins hamburger hill 
still kubricks electrifying excursion into military mania 
managed to snare its share of the moviegoing audience in fact 
film buffs had long awaited kubricks next work seven years after 
the shining and were curious to see how he would treat the 
madness of vietnam after depicting modern insanities in paths of 
glory 2001 a space odyssey and dr strangelove or how i 
learned to stop worrying and love the bomb 
based on gustav hasfords gripping novel the short timers 
kubricks work actually is two movies with the same characters the 
first part and by far the best takes place at parris island 
sc where recruits are stripped of their humanity to become 
killing machines the second part shifts to vietnam where the 
marines fight the tet offensive 
we see the best of kubricks talents in full metal jacket 
the title refers to the casings on the bullets in the slick 
editing and direction of gunnery sgt hartman working the last 
nerves of his boys you will be ready to eat your own guts and 
ask for seconds he tells them 
lee ermey a former marine drill instructor himself is 
outstanding as hartman and vincent donofrio as his major victim 
dubbed pvt gomer pyle by the sergeant also puts in an excellent 
performance 
kubrick seals each training scene with a tension that zooms us 
to the next 
but when the action shifts to vietnam all that tension is lost 
and one of the worst battles of the war becomes a whimper part of 
the problem is that the movie was shot in england rather than 
southeast asia which would have lent a muchneeded authenticity 
still kubricks effort is worthy of home viewing

range 
 
while scenes from the southside isnt the first music to 
evoke the atmosphere of appalachia it may be the first to do it 
with a piano rather than a mandolin banjo or fiddle but few 
records have a stronger sense of a region than the second album 
from bruce hornsby and the range 
hornsby pleads for preservation of the environment on look out 
any window sings about a smalltown scandal on the valley 
road and jabs fundamentalist preachers common to the region on 
jacobs ladder and defenders of the flag hornsby and his 
brother and writing partner john hornsby show a novelists eye 
for detail in describing the area where they were raised 
hornsbys piano is more dominant than on the bands first album 
the hit the way it is hornsby who gives himself plenty of 
time for solos on the 48minute record has a jazzy sense of 
phrasing that recalls keith jarrett but he plays with a jerry lee 
lewislike velocity its a unique blend and one to be embraced by 
listeners weary of synthesizers 
the record could use more diversity in tempo and 
instrumentation for example hornsby makes little use of his skill 
on the accordian such quibbles aside scenes from the 
southside is an album delivered with considerable honesty and 
heart

if mike dukakis would adopt dream world from midnight oils 
new album as his campaign theme hed beat the republicans in a 
landslide the song is a sure votegetter that sounds celebratory 
for democrats ominous for the gop 
your dream world is just about to end midnight oil lead 
singer peter garrett snarls above chiming guitars that provide the 
wakeup call the song written with the reagan revolution in mind 
is killer rock n roll hookfilled danceinducing and 
thoughtprovoking all at once 
happily the rest of diesel and dust is of the same caliber 
as dream world and the album could allow midnight oil a break 
into the american market until now the veteran australian 
quintets socially conscious music hasnt found much of an audience 
in the united states 
but midnight oil deserves to be heard its sound reflects 
fivestar bands from other eras including the clash and the byrds 
while garrett sounds like a worldweary joe strummer bassist peter 
gifford and guitarists jim moginie and martin rotsey play with both 
finesse and fire to help create music that is catchy and yet 
thundering the band must be great live 
and its message is strong besides the call to activism on 
dream world garrett sings about the arms race on put down 
that weapon and addresses land rights on beds are burning 
social concerns have become a more prominent part of pop music 
in recent years so there should be room on the charts for midnight

already a film legend as princess leia in the 
star wars epics carrie fisher amazed the literary world last 
year by producing a book that not only won critical praise but 
placement on bestseller lists 
postcards from the edge now released in paperback is a 
novel about a film actress suzanne vale who enters a 
rehabilitation clinic to break her addiction to drugs and alcohol 
since carrie fisher is a film actress who almost overdosed in 1985 
and underwent 30 days of treatment at a century city detoxification 
center interviewers ask whether the book is based on her life 
a lot of books are partly autobiographical in nature she 
replies if you dont write from what you know then youre 
writing science fiction which maybe ill try but then theyll say 
im writing about star wars 
the book is partly autobiographical i did draw from certain 
situations in my life but the book isnt autobiographical 
i think it makes people more comfortable to think that it all 
happened that i kept copious notes ive certainly done enough 
movies so theres my movie sequence i was in a clinic but i 
couldnt have kept notes in that situation it was too traumatic to 
keep notes youre barely there anyway most of the other 
characters are really fiction its probably half and half 
her next book 
its going to be about a girl who is interviewed about a book 
that everybody says is autobiographical just kidding as is her 
custom 
the new book is tentatively called surrender the pink 
she says the new book is totally fiction and concerns 
obsessive relationships or weird love she must deliver it 
next march 
with her newfound discipline fisher is likely to make the 
deadline she is now working in the burbs with tom hanks and 
bruce dern and she takes her word processor to work with her she 
is also scheduled to adapt postcards from the edge for a film 
by mike nichols but the project has been shelved by the writers 
strike 
the 31yearold fisher wisecracked her way through an interview 
at the hilltop home paid for with her star wars earnings 
she remarked that she came from a long line of short people 
who are survivors 
her parents are debbie reynolds and eddie fisher stars of a 
major scandal of the 1950s carrie was too young to remember the 
headlined events when fisher abandoned reynolds for the love of 
elizabeth taylor who ultimately left him for richard burton 
at 17 carrie fisher made her film debut in shampoo 
graphically propositioning warren beatty she dropped out of high 
school to appear in her mothers nightclub act at 19 george lucas 
chose her to play princess leia in star wars how did she land 
the role 
i always like to say that i was in schwabs drugstore wearing 
that hairstyle when lucas walked in and said what other jerk 
would look appropriate in space 
i just tested for it she said i read well with harrison 
ford the dialogue was bizarre but i have a weird pacman way of 
talking that kind of charged through it they were either going to 
go for pretty or whatever it is that i have which is sort of 
gritty 
star wars proved to be the biggest moneymaker up to its time 
1977 and fisher appeared in the two sequels what did the films 
do for her 
well they made me financially ok until i got business 
managers they made me a household word like ajax only i wasnt a 
household word princess leia was famous and i was sort of adjunct 
to her its an associated fame sort of once again 
fisher grew up famous because of her parents but she found 
nothing unusual about her upbringing nor does she think it 
contributed to her drug problem 
what happens in hollywood is that you dont see your parents 
as much but its the same as having working parents she 
observed so i had working parents and there were divorces but 
that happens everywhere 
drug problems can happen anywhere too my brother todd 
had a similar background to me and he was never a drinker or a 
drugger it gets a lot of publicity in hollywood and maybe it is 
more part of this environment but its everywhere though mostly 
in cities who wants to take cocaine and sit around and watch the 
crops fail

in april 1958 a quiet young texan brought 
classical music to the heart of america and captivated a nation by 
winning the tchaikovsky competition in moscow 
van cliburn was the first american ever to win the coveted 
prize and he won by playing the explosive and romantic piano 
concerto 
he stopped performing a decade ago to take an intermission 
from his hectic concert and recording schedule and is now 
returning to the concert stage 
i love music passionately the pianist said it is my 
life but i think of the time necessary to make something ready for 
the concert stage its a lonely procedure and a solitary life 
a friend said i certainly move at a snails pace he said 
with a laugh i dont want to rush this thing i do love my 
audiences through the years it has been so heartwarming to hear 
from people who remembered hearing me and want to hear me again 
cliburns first performance since oct 1 1978 was last dec 8 
at a white house dinner for soviet leader mikhail gorbachev before 
he left the white house he promised conductors mstislav 
rostropovich and zubin mehta that he would appear with the national 
symphony and the new york philhamonic 
he also received an award but did not play at a carnegie hall 
concert in june which unveiled the 500000th piano built in america 
by steinway 
in september he will play at the inauguration of the dallas 
symphonys new hall and he has been talking to rca records which 
is releasing his old records as compact discs about recording 
again 
cliburn stopped accepted future dates in 1977 intending to give 
himself about a years sabbatical 
when i was young i told some little friends i feel i will 
work very hard in the first part of my life he said i want to 
have an intermission i want to take the intermission while im 
young enough to enjoy it and get something out of it i feel i will 
work very hard the last part of my life 
he began playing piano when he was 3 and made his orchestral 
debut with the houston symphony when he was 12 the next year he 
performed at carnegie hall made his new york philharmonic debut at 
19 and went to the soviet union at 23 
it has been playing playing playing he said 
cliburn took his intermission when he did because both his 
father and his manager sol hurok died in 1974 
i didnt get to spend too much time with my father some 
managers rearranged certain dates so i had a little more time with 
him at the end i wouldnt exchange that for anything there are 
certain things in life you never get back he said 
cliburn received invitations to play but was enjoying his social 
life too much so he extended his holiday then the white house 
called on nov 17 requesting that cliburn play at the gobachev 
dinner 
i was very flattered by the invitation then i thought what an 
interesting and lovely experience it would be he said i had 
been practicing i was enjoying my work 
cliburn had given up his longtime apartment across the street 
from carnegie hall and bought a house in fort worth texas moving 
in with his mother rildia bee cliburn she was his only piano 
teacher until he went to the juilliard school at 17 
my mother is my chief critic he said after the white 
house phone call came i asked her do you think i can do it she 
said well i dont know let me hear you play a program tonight 
she listened she said i want to hear this again tomorrow night 
i was practicing feverishly the next night i played my little 
program for her she said i think you can go ahead and call and 
accept she is critical she makes little suggestions she has a 
great sense of style and drama 
she thinks ive had a long enough intermission and ive got to 
get back to the second half of my life vladimir horowitz 
recommended the same thing 
in 1983 cliburn went to a small party for emil gilels the last 
time gilels played in new york i thought possibly he would give 
me a lecture instead he said im so proud of you for having the 
strength to take time off and smell the flowers he said youll 
know when to start playing again never think about time 
when i was a child my mother never wanted me to think about 
how long i was going to practice she said if you do youre not 
concentrating on what youre doing when you go to the piano only 
think of accomplishing something if you can do something in a 
short amount of time fine practice until it is what you want 
it was terribly providential for me having my teacher in the 
house ready to correct mistakes immediately he said children 
of parents who arent trained go to a lesson and it takes another 
lesson just to correct things in my case it was already corrected 
and i was on to other things 
cliburn would like to perform in the soviet union next season 
gorbachev had asked when hed be visiting 
i can not believe it has been 30 years since i was in 
moscow he said i feel younger today than i did then i feel 
so good

rick james the selfprofessed king of 
punkfunk rock calls his latest album wonderful with good 
reason 
thats the way i feel since ive been off motown said 
james referring to the legendary recording label which released 
the string of singles you and i super freak i 
coldblooded that catapulted james to superstardom during the 
past 10 years 
the release of wonderful last month on warner bros records 
marks a new phase in his career he said his fans will hear a joy 
in it that i havent had for years 
its just a very happy album said james who is known for 
his risque lyrics throbbing dance rhythms and long curly hair 
with so many years of unhappiness with motown so many of my 
albums after street songs which was my biggest album were kind 
of downhill as far as the ambiance and the joy because i really 
wasnt feeling a lot he said on this album i kind of got it 
all back 
james has severed his 10year relationship with motown they 
just didnt allow me to have the freedom that i needed to really 
make the kind of records and do the kinds of things in the industry 
that i wanted to do 
working at motown which produced such stars as the jacksons 
the supremes stevie wonder smoky robinson and the miracles the 
temptations and the four tops was initially invigorating for james 
then the tension between the sexually graphic themes coursing 
through much of his work and motowns traditionally conservative 
approach to pop music began getting to him 
they never totally understood what i was trying to do where i 
was trying to come from with my music he said for the whole 
10 years it was a constant battle in me trying to acquaint them 
with what i wanted to say and how i wanted to say it 
the parting was not amicable motown is suing james for not 
fulfilling his contracts with them and james is suing motown 
claiming the company owes him money and never gave a proper 
accounting of his royalties 
motown denies all of that 1000 percent said company 
attorney mark gottridge james denies the charges motown has made 
against him 
theyre trying to say im in violation of a contract which 
im not said james adding that he had finished and delivered 
both his own final lp for motown and a third lp by the group he 
produces the mary jane girls 
during the past three years james has spent much of his time 
producing both the artists in his stable the mary jane girls val 
young and process and the doorags and others including comedian 
eddie murphy and his successful single party all the time 
he also says that during that time hes been free of a cocaine 
addiction that he feels was a serious threat to his life 
there was a bad period in my life some years ago when i got 
into a serious cocaine habit 10000 to 15000 a week said 
james i didnt really see it my lawyers and my accountants and 
friends really saw it before i did they saw that my usage of coke 
was getting to be a milliondollarayear habit i didnt see it 
until i went into rehab and i didnt understand it until i got 
out 
james said he got caught up in living the bad boy persona he 
had cultivated 
there was a time where i was just trying to live the image 
wholeheartedly i wasnt thinking about the person james 
johnson he said i mean rick james was just a manmade image 
the image i created just trying to live rick james almost killed 
me he was born james a johnson jr on buffalos rough east 
side 39 years ago 
james who retains the youthful swagger of his earlier years 
says his drug rehabilitation made him more patient and less angry 
i was like the angry young man years ago he said it 
wasnt anything specific i was angry at the politics of the 
country i was angry about the poor people in ethiopia i was angry 
at bigots and racism i was angry that the buffalo bills were 
losing you name it and id be angry about it 
the buffalo area remains home for james who lived for several 
years in los angeles 
the west coast is crazy too crazy for me he said i live 
here because my roots are here its very important for me to 
maintain a strong relationship with my mother and my family and i 
cant do that long distance it gives me an anchor 
his house appears to be a modest white ranch from the outside 
with only the extra large parking lot and guard booth at the 
driveway seeming out of character with the aurora neighborhood an 
affluent suburb south of buffalo 
inside he has all the luxuries of a star indoor swimming pool 
basement recording studio and a solarium filled with handcarved 
redwood furniture 
with his impending reemergence on the music scene james is not 
worried that people wont remember him because of his absence from 
the charts wonderful is his first lp in almost two years 
ive sold close to 30 million albums he said its not 
like 30 million people that bought your music are going to forget 
about you ive never really had worries about being forgotten 
ive had worries about losing myself in the interim 
however with plans for a world tour during the last half of the 
year james said he is scared about his return to the limelight 
im horrified he said its a question of fear of the 
unknown of not knowing what the reception will be

the sanders have swapped rowdy alaskan 
bars for more gentle settings to sing their songs of love 
after fighting off grizzly bears and gold thieves in the land of 
the midnight sun the brothersister duo came to nashville with 
their closeknit vocals and launched a country music recording 
career 
vicki sanders 31 and dale 33 spent the past 10 years singing 
in alaska at night and often mining for gold by day with their 
father a retired geology teacher 
it was very rewarding dale sanders said it was nice 
being able to make people smile all the time 
vicki sanders gave a sample of their experiences 
we played in barrow in the far northern part we were hired 
with 13 colombians who never went to sleep they partied nonstop 
there were two buckets for the bathroom and a shower stall that 
said girls mondaywednesdayfriday and boys tuesdaythursday 
in seward a girl was beating a guy up she picked up a 
chair and threw it at him he ran into the bathroom and hid he 
stepped out and she sucker punched him 
a guy threatened to tie his wife to a tree so she shot him 
nine times with a 22 at their cabin she got on a snow machine and 
went for help 
the darkness and remoteness of alaska seemed to affect the 
residents the sanders said 
in all those remote places where its dark people have a 
tendency to get wild and kick up their heels vicki said it 
gets depressing 
you get a different breed of people said dale those who 
dont like society go to those type places its kind of the end of 
the road 
the two also had to contend with bears while mining along the 
alaskacanada border 
we were pretty heavily armed at the mine because they would 
surprise you or you would surprise them dale said in an 
interview youd be in a bind without a weapon they destroyed 
our camp a couple of times one time they walked through a 
campertrailer by going in one end and tearing out the whole wall 
and destroying the inside they pushed a refrigerator through the 
wall and made another hole to go out 
they mined from 1973 until the mid1980s always on the lookout 
for thieves 
one guy took a chain saw and stole the floor out of a cabin 
dale said 
the two both born and raised in alaska compared the mining 
business to the entertainment field 
some years were good and some were not very good at all 
vicki said i wouldnt recommend it for someone who needs 
security its like the music industry you cant count on 
anything you work your hardest and hope it works out at the end 
they recently signed a recording contract with airborne records 
a new independent label in nashville steve roberts an airborne 
vice president had heard them sing several years ago while he was 
a concert promoter in anchorage 
one listen and i was sold on their music roberts recalled 
about his first exposure to them i decided then that if i ever 
had a label they would be on it 
their first single record is you fit right into my heart 
their sound is sure to draw comparisons to the carpenters a 
brothersister duo who had hits 15 years ago with for all we 
know superstar and rainy days amp mondays 
we listen to them vicki said but our style of harmony 
doesnt resemble theirs in any way only that we are brother and 
sister we do have kind of a folk influence which they did also 
our music is kind of on the sweet side but ours is not as 
sweet as theirs ours is more country dale said weve got a 
new sound with a different approach we dont sound like anyone 
else our music is easy to listen to positive straight ahead 
the sanders are the latest in a variety of family acts in 
country music joining larry gatlin and the gatlin brothers the 
judds mother and daughter the forester sisters the whites 
father and daughters and others 
the blend you get when you put family together is going to be 
closer than if you are not related said vicki who has two other 
brothers 
and you make more concessions when working with family on the 
road you have disagreements but you forgive your brother or 
sister its harder to forgive someone not related 
said dale a lot of families grow up singing and just fall 
into it

makers of domestic luxury sedans already plagued 
by a dwindling aging buyer base and a dull product image likely 
will lose market share in the next five years to foreign luxury 
marques slated to enter the domestic market according to industry 
consultant jd power 
in an interview monday power described a december survey of 
2100 luxurycar owners designed to identify the image of 22 luxury 
marques including four not yet sold in this country 
image itself is a vague concept of the general perception of a 
car including its advertising styling handling and performance 
and intangibles such as elegance 
power said the survey revealed a surprising lack of distinctive 
image among many luxury names those surveyed recognized only an 
average of 27 marques including the one they purchased within the 
18 to 24 months before the survey was taken 
some luxury cars do have a clear image mercedesbenz and jaguar 
particularly are considered elegant prestigious enjoyable to 
drive wellengineered contemporary but classically styled and 
distinctive power said 
but domestic makes overall are seen as conservative comfortable 
and unexciting he said that is despite individual successes such 
as ford motor cos lincoln division which has attracted more 
younger importoriented buyers while general motors corps 
cadillac buick and oldsmobile have not 
power said imagebuilding is a lengthy and costly process and 
may lag behind a marques actual sales as with lincoln 
but he said all domestic makers of luxury sedans likely will 
lose market share in the next five years to new entries such as 
nissans infiniti and toyotas lexus line both from japan and 
possibly to citroen and opel from europe 
the luxury car market in the united states peaked in 1986 with 
sales of 1176 million power predicted a downturn to 1 million in 
sales this year followed by a drop to 969000 in 1989 and a 
recovery to 1186 million sales by 1993 
the luxury markets recovery will be fueled partly by the entry 
of the new marques he said 
infiniti and lexus plan to offer six and eightcylinder engine 
coupes and sedans and hondas acura luxury line plans a sedan with 
an eightcylinder engine moving steadily in the arena dominated by 
the big three power said 
the new entries will find it easier to create solid distinctive 
images for their products because of their specialization and a 
lack of the poorquality and lookalike problems that marred 
domestic nameplates such as buick and oldsmobile power said 
also while 56 percent of luxury owners age 65 or older said 
they shop only for domestic models only 6 percent of buyers 
younger than 35 said they would not consider imports and 43 
percent of those younger buyers said they did not consider domestic 
cars at all 
as the younger buyers age and move further into the luxury car 
market the big three will be forced to design with them in mind 
and move their luxurymarque images in their direction if they hope 
to lure them away from japanese and european dealers power said 
in addition to lincolns success big three makers have begun 
improving and modernizing their images by offering sportier 
twoseat models such as the cadillac allante buick reatta and the 
muchdelayed chrysler turbo coupe by maserati 
european makers will not be similarly threatened as long as they 
continue moving their cars upward in price and exclusivity thus 
protecting their images he said

takeover strategist carl icahn says he still has 
a myriad of options to pursue despite his defeat in a june proxy 
fight attempt to win a block of seats on texaco incs board of 
directors 
texaco management on monday confirmed earlier estimates that 
shareholders rejected icahns attempt to place himself and four 
associates on the board texaco said icahns dissident slate was 
voted down by 586 percent to 416 percent a much bigger margin 
than earlier thought 
icahn who owns a 148 percent chunk of texaco stock had 
conceded defeat after the oil giants annual shareholder meeting 
but had contended the vote was close 
there had been speculation icahn was awaiting the exact results 
to determine how close he came to winning before deciding what to 
do with his texaco investment 
some texacowatchers speculated that a narrow vote might prompt 
icahn to challenge the outcome or make another attempt to get on 
the texaco board as part of a broader campaign to acquire the 
company or force a restructuring that would raise the value of his 
shares 
we obviously regret that we lost but hope that management 
will do as they said and work to enhance stockholder value icahn 
said in a statement issued by df king amp co the firm that 
handled his proxy campaign 
to answer the many queries concerning our position there are 
a myriad of options open to us at this time he said we have 
not yet determined which one we will follow 
texaco stock rose 37 cents a share to 4575 in new york stock 
exchange trading 
texacos management stated that corporation trust co which 
tabulated the shareholder votes reported 85 percent of the 
companys 2429 million shares outstanding were represented in 
person or by proxy at the june 17 annual meeting in tulsa okla 
excluding icahns stake all texaconominated directors received 
714 percent of the shares voted while directors nominated by the 
icahn group received 286 percent texaco said that gave 
management an overall victory margin of 586 percent to icahns 
414 percent 
there had been speculation that the fatal blow against icahns 
effort was the vote for management by the investment firm of 
kohlberg kravis roberts amp co which had a 49 percent stake but 
the results announced monday showed management would have won 
regardless of how kohlberg kravis had voted 
this substantial victory margin is the result of widespread 
support among all texaco stockholders james w kinnear 
president and chief executive officer said in the companys 
statement on the results 
icahn sought board membership as part of an effort to force 
texaco management to consider his 60ashare cash buyout offer 
which valued the company at 146 billion kinnear called the offer 
insincere 
icahn who has chased several big companies over the past few 
years and acquired trans world airlines began building a stake in 
texaco last year while the company was mired in bankruptcy court a 
result of its protracted multibilliondollar legal battle with 
pennzoil co 
icahns motive of a possible takeover became clearer after 
texaco emerged from bankruptcy court a few months ago he denounced 
managements handling of the pennzoil matter and claimed texacos 
postbankruptcy reorganization plan would not maximize shareholder 
values

gte corp is selling most of its stake in the 
unprofitable us sprint communications co to its business partner 
for 600 million and may eventually withdraw totally from ownership 
of the nations thirdbiggest longdistance telephone company 
the tentative deal announced monday carries high risks as well 
as potential gains for united telecommunications inc the phone 
company that is raising its stake in us sprint to 801 percent from 
50 percent 
gtes share will fall to 199 percent at the beginning of 1989 
assuming completion of the deal 
in a related announcement robert h snedaker us sprints 
62yearold president said he would take early retirement 
effective aug 15 
standard amp poors corp which rates the security of company 
debt announced late monday it was considering a downgrade of 
united telecommunications debt and an upgrade of gtes debt 
united telecommunications based in kansas city is onefifth 
the size of stamford connbased gte and is losing money because 
of the red ink at us sprint 
us sprint lost 138 million in the first quarter of 1988 after 
racking up losses of 800 million last year the two parents have 
shared those losses equally 
in addition to the huge costs of building a nationwide fiber 
optic network us sprint has a history of billing problems that 
have cut into revenue it says the billing problems are largely 
behind it 
financial analysts say united telecommunications management has 
staked the future of the company on the success of us sprint which 
is third in the longdistance market behind american telephone amp 
telegraph co and mci communications corp 
atampt leads with about 72 to 73 percent of the longdistance 
market mci is second with about 10 percent and us sprint ranks 
third with about 7 percent according to jack grubman an analyst 
for painewebber inc 
charles schelke an analyst at smith barney harris upham amp co 
said he believes us sprint has turned a corner toward 
profitability so united telecommunications increased ownership is 
a pretty good deal 
but he said it depends on your view of us sprints future 
obviously we believe that the opportunities far exceed the 
risk united telecommunications spokesman don forsythe said 
united telecommunications stock closed unchanged at 3362 a 
share while gtes fell 37 cents a share to 40 in consolidated 
new york stock exchange trading monday 
in a joint statement gte and united telecommunications said 
both partners came to the conclusion that the 5050 management 
arrangement inherent in the present partnership agreement although 
important initially in launching us sprint successfully has become 
an unnecessary burden given the dynamics of us sprints fast growth 
and the rapidly changing environment of the longdistance 
industry 
gte and united telecommunications formed us sprint in july 1986 
as a joint venture consisting of gtes sprint united 
telecommunications own us telecom and some smaller operations 
their projections of profitability for the company proved 
premature last summer charles skibo resigned as president as the 
company announced a 350 million pretax charge against 
secondquarter earnings 
snedaker who was named to succeed him had been vice president 
and chief operating officer of united telecommunications 
william t esrey the president and chief executive of united 
telecommunications will fill snedakers job on an interim basis 
before the end of the year united telecommunication will take over 
daytoday management of us sprint 
esrey issued a statement praising snedaker that said we owe 
him a great debt of gratitude for putting us sprints operations 
back on track 
even before its latest move united telecommunications had gone 
to great lengths to support us sprint in may it announced it was 
selling its cellular phone operations to centel corp for 772 
million partly to raise cash for us sprint 
the estimated 600 million purchase price for the 301 percent 
stake in us sprint is based on estimates of the book value of the 
partnership interest at the end of 1988 
under the deal united telecommunications would have the option 
until dec 31 1995 to buy gtes remaining 199 percent interest 
in us sprint at book value of dec 31 1988 or at book value at 
the time of the transaction whichever is higher 
otherwise gte would have the option of requiring united 
telecommunications to buy its remaining interest at any time 
between dec 31 1991 and dec 31 1995 at the book value 
prevailing at the time of the transaction 
united telecommunications provides local phone service mainly 
in the southeast and midwest it lost 515 million on revenue of 
298 billion in 1987 
gte also gets most of its revenue from local phone service 
although it also has data communications sylvania light bulbs 
specialty manufacturing and consumer communications products it 
earned 112 billion on revenue of 154 billion last year

share prices took the largest drop of the year 
today on the tokyo stock exchange and the dollar fell sharply 
against the japanese yen 
the nikkei stock average of 225 selected issues a 25167point 
loser the day before plunged 51309 points or 189 percent 
closing at 2714903 points 
it was the largest oneday decline of the key index since 
december 26 1987 when the nikkei fell 58750 points 
stock brokers attributed the decline purely to the internal 
reasons they said steel and shipbuilding shares which had 
supported the market over the past few weeks finally gave way and 
led to a decline across the board 
nippon steel one of the largest shares on the exchange had 
risen from the 400s to 750 yen in less than two months but lost 
54 points today 
i cant see any outstanding reason why shares especially 
steel shares fell this much today said ichitaro watanabe a 
broker at nikko securities co the market seems to have entered a 
transitional stage the 500point drop is a result of an adjustment 
made for the transition 
another stock broker said the plunge without apparent reason 
indicated steel and ship building shares can no longer sustain the 
market 
the market as a whole was not in a good mood in the last two 
weeks except for steel and shipbuilding shares said keiichi 
nishida of kidder peabody todays plunge indicates the end of 
the steelled market investors have to find other shares they can 
count on 
in the foreign exchange market the dollar which gained 175 
yen monday closed at 13385 yen down 130 yen from mondays 
close after opening at 13430 yen it traded in a range of 
1337013438 yen 
currency dealers said early morning speculation on whether the 
bank of japan would intervene in the market and sell dollars was 
the major cause of the currencys decline 
the speculation led to a onesided selling of the dollar

however the pound was able to recover some lost ground which 
diffused the immediate need for interest rate hikes dealers said 
reported heavy central bank intervention to cap the dollars 
rise combined with the effects of mondays sixth rise in interest

pacific bell breaking from tradition has 
made a surprise proposal to give up its monopoly on local toll 
calls in exchange for reduced state regulation 
the giant local phone company called its proposal the most 
significant change since the breakup of the bell system in 1984 
under the offer the company would also expand the local 
tollfree zone and offer pushbutton phones without extra charge in 
exchange for the decreased regulation if approved by the public 
utilities commission the plan would give customers access to 
hightechnology lowcost services 
consumer representatives greeted the proposal with trepidation 
my biggest fear is that we will have the pretense of 
competition but not the safeguards of competition said robert 
gnaizda a lawyer who represents six minority and lowincome groups 
in the pacific bell rate case before the public utilities 
commission 
others would compete in handling local toll calls but there 
wont be any real competition and the company will escape 
effective public and puc scrutiny gnaizda said pacific bells 
profit will exceed 1 billion this year more than twice its 
highest level before deregulation he said 
the public utilities commission which has suggested increasing 
phone company flexibility in the new market created by the 
dismemberment of the bell system will consider all the proposals 
during the next year 
according to pacific bell the new proposal is more generous 
than a plan the company presented in january in an attempt to 
loosen state regulation 
the public utilities commission would continue to approve 
residential rates after 1992 but without the exhaustive 
threeyear inquiry of pacific bells financial structure under the 
plan regulatory controls would also be loosened to allow new 
services to be introduced more quickly 
monthly business rates would be allowed to rise gradually to 
approach the cost of service however rates on premium residential 
services such as callforwarding callwaiting and speeddialing 
would be cut 
pacific bell said it also would expect reduced local toll rates 
because of competition

billionaire h ross perot is waging a bidding war 
for a lucrative medicaid contract taking on electronic data 
systems the company he founded and steered to a huge share of the 
automated health services market 
eds a general motors corp subsidiary since 1984 won the texas 
medicaid contract in 1976 
j livingston kosberg chairman of the board of the texas human 
services department said the department had not expected another 
qualified bidder and had begun negotiating with eds on the 
financial terms of the pact until perot systems corp entered the 
picture 
we certainly will be there and will bid eds spokesman roger 
still said we look at this as a competitor and will treat them 
as a competitor 
under the pact eds assumes dataprocessing and administrative 
responsibility for more than 800 million in the states medicaid 
program eds could net close to 7 million depending in part on 
performance 
perot founded eds in 1962 and sold the firm to gm in 1984 in 
december 1986 after highlypublicized conflict between perot and 
gm perot and three other top eds executives left the computer 
services company when gm agreed to pay them 850 million 
under terms of the gm buyout agreement perot is barred from 
operating a forprofit firm until after december 1989 
perot built national respect for eds through health care 
contracts 
wall street analysts said perots extensive knowledge of eds 
complemented by the two dozen former eds employees on his staff 
give his firm some competitive strengths 
ross and his people ought to know exactly contract by 
contract what eds has said stephen mcclellan a technology 
analyst with merrill lynch amp co in new york theyll know what 
deals are expiring what their profit margins are and what itll 
take to beat them on a bid

ah robins cos plan to emerge from 
nearly three years of bankruptcy protection has won the approval of 
creditors stockholders and dalkon shield claimants but one hurdle 
remains 
at a hearing monday us district judge robert r merhige said 
he and us bankruptcy judge blackwell n shelley who are 
overseeing the case cannot approve the plan unless it contains a 
provision giving them authority to oversee a trust for dalkon 
shield claimants 
the plan would establish a trust of nearly 25 billion to 
satisfy claims by women who allege they were injured by using the 
dalkon shield intrauterine birth control device marketed by robins 
in the early 1970s the plan also would provide for a 32 billion 
buyout of the 122yearold richmondbased company by the american 
home products corp 
merhige gave attorneys a week to submit briefs on the proposed 
revision 
robins attorney dennis drebsky told the judges the plan was 
supported by about 95 percent of the 141094 dalkon shield 
claimants who sent in ballots and by more than 99 percent of the 
19 million stockholders who voted 
the four banks owed a total of 156 million by robins 
unanimously backed the plan under which the new yorkbased 
american home would pay robins creditors in full 
attorney murray drabkin of the dalkon shield claimants committee 
said the plan which needed the approval of twothirds of each 
class of voters provides a just and fair resolution of the 
case 
however attorney ralph pittle who represents several hundred 
dalkon shield claimants said the trust fund was inadequate and 
that more claimants would have voted against the plan if they had 
been better informed 
the plan was difficult for claimants to understand especially 
since many of them do not have lawyers pittle said 
if the judges approve the plan there will be a 30day period 
before a confirmation order is issued even if appeals are filed 
payments to claimants would begin 30 days after court approval 
using a 100 million fund set up by robins 
robins filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in august 1985 
in the face of mounting claims and settlement payments associated 
with the dalkon shield

oil prices retreated today after a big jump in 
the previous session that was fueled by speculation that peace 
could break out in the persian gulf 
the august contract for west texas intermediate the benchmark 
us crude fell 30 cents a barrel to 1540 a barrel in the 
opening minutes of trading on the new york mercantile exchange 
that contract had jumped 84 cents a barrel on monday the 
biggest daily rise since april after iran said it would accept a 
united nations resolution calling for an immediate ceasefire in 
its nearly 8yearold war with iraq 
analysts said an end to the iraniraq war might make it easier 
for the organization of petroleum exporting countries to reach 
agreement on limiting production in order to boost prices 
but analysts also expressed skepticism about the ability of opec 
nations and nonopec members to end their chronic infighting and 
overproduction even if the persian gulf war halts 
this is a very very hypesensitive market said madison 
galbraith senior energy specialist for merrill lynch energy 
futures 
very little has changed here aside from the psychology said 
peter beutel assistant director of the energy group at elders 
futures inc 
mondays jump in the august contract was the biggest rise since 
west texas intermediate soared 101 a barrel on april 11 
the price jump was even bigger for the september contract which 
rose 92 cents to 1589 a barrel 
mondays jump brought prices back to their levels of earlier 
this month before a steep skid in prices took hold because of 
concerns about a worldwide oversupply of oil oil still remains 
more than 1 a barrel below its level of midjune 
among refined products traded on the new york mercantile 
exchange august no2 heating oil jumped 215 cents a gallon to 
4327 cents a gallon the august contract for unleaded gasoline 
rose 138 cents a gallon to 5111 cents a gallon 
the rebound in west texas intermediate brought it back from its 
recent low of 1444 a barrel last wednesday and nearly back to its 
level of 1583 a barrel on july 7 
analysts said crude futures were boosted by traders who had been 
betting on further declines in prices and rushed to cover their 
positions by buying contracts 
aiding the rebound in prices was a report that opecs price 
monitoring committee would meet within the next 30 days 
part of opecs overproduction has been war relief production 
by saudi arabia kuwait and the united arab emirates which have 
given the proceeds to iraq to help in the battle with iran said 
frank p knuettel an analyst for prudentialbache securities inc 
a ceasefire could eliminate that source of production he said 
in addition saudi arabia might be more willing to support 
prices instead of punishing iran by allowing prices to fall said 
rosario ilacqua an analyst for nikko securities international co 
inc 
but analysts remained uncertain about the outlook for harmony in 
the fractious cartel furthermore there was skepticism over the 
possibility that any ceasefire would last 
as part of its announcement iran said it would not withdraw its

housing construction partially recovered in june rising 51 
percent after plummeting 126 percent in may the government said 
today 
the commerce department said the increase in housing starts was 
the steepest in four months mortgage rates eased in june 
contributing to the revival 
on monday reports of a possible ceasefire in the iraniraq war 
sent oil prices soaring while grain and soybean futures plunged 
following heavy weekend rains in the droughtstricken midwest 
on the new york mercantile exchange the august contract for 
west texas intermediate the benchmark us crude oil shot up 84 
cents a barrel monday to settle at 1570 a barrel it was the 
biggest rise since a jump of 101 a barrel on april 11 
but prices retreated in early trading today the august contract 
for wti fell 30 cents to 1540 a barrel 
soybeans for july delivery skidded more than 109 a bushel one 
of the steepest oneday soybean price declines in the history of 
the chicago board of trade july corn plunged 30 cents a bushel 
the spike in oil prices reignited inflation worries on wall 
street and in the credit markets 
the concerns were heightened by a federal reserve board report 
that us industry in june operated at 831 percent of capacity 
its highest point in eight years and edging closer to a level that 
economists believe signals a pickup in inflation 
the nervousness about inflation weakened stock prices the dow 
jones average of 30 industrials up 2330 points last week dropped 
1156 to 211789 
bond prices also fell forcing interest rates higher the yield 
on the treasurys closely watched 30year bond jumped to 923 
percent from 914 percent late friday 
the possibility of a breakthrough in the 8yearold iraniraq 
conflict along with aggressive dollar sales by central banks 
pushed the us currency to a weaker finish against most key 
foreign currencies the dollar historically is regarded as a 
safehaven currency during times of unrest and the prospect of 
peace between the two middle eastern enemies spurred investors to 
sell dollars 
the news of a possible ceasefire between iran and iraq alao 
raised prospects that the organization of petroleum exporting 
countries would be able to calm its chronic infighting which has 
led to overproduction of oil and lower prices 
the ensuing price jump in the futures market brought oil back to 
its levels of earlier this month before a steep skid in prices 
sparked by concerns about a worldwide oversupply of oil 
analysts said prices were driven up by traders who had been 
betting on further declines in prices and rushed to cover their 
positions by buying contracts 
iran said monday it would accept a united nations resolution 
calling for an immediate ceasefire in its war with iraq however 
iran also said it will not withdraw its troops from its borders and 
called on iranians to prepare to thwart further iraqi attacks 
supporting the price rebound was a report that opecs pricing 
committee would meet within the next 30 days

grain and soybean futures opened sharply lower 
today on the chicago board of trade as forecasts for more rain in 
the droughtstricken midwest provoked intense selling pressure for 
the second straight day 
prices on most contracts for future delivery of corn oats and 
soybeans plunged their permissible limits at the opening bell 
halting trading in all but the limitless july contracts which 
expire at noon thursday 
the limitdown opening caused sell orders to pile up some 40 
million bushels of soybeans and about 50 million bushels of corn 
were awaiting buyers about 15 minutes after the opening 
weekend showers soaked farm fields in much of the northern corn 
belt and substantial rains were forecast for the regions southern 
portion today through wednesday said victor lespinasse a trader 
with dean witter reynolds inc 
despite irreversible drought damage to much of the us corn 
crop some of it will benefit and the soybeans definitely will 
benefit from all this recent rain lespinasse said 
the national weather services latest 6to10day forecast 
calling for abovenormal temperatures and mostly normal rainfall in 
the corn belt during the early part of next week was another 
bearish factor lespinasse said

contract for delivery in july at 367 a bushel corn was 3 cents 
to the limit 15 cents lower with july at 3 a bushel oats were the

the swiss army knife is one of those 
products that keeps finding a new market from gis in the foxhole 
to yuppie campers on a weekend in the wild 
and thats good news for a small connecticut company that had 
the good sense to promote the handy pocket tool from forgotten 
sideline to bestseller 
the story of how the forschner group inc of shelton came to be 
the exclusive us marketer of swiss army knives is a classic tale 
of serendipity the companys founders picked up the knife in a 
search for good european cutlery for butchers years later new 
owners would move the little redhandled knives to the top of the 
line 
forschner sold more than 4 million of the knives in 1987 alone 
accounting for more than half the companys sales 
its a good business said james w kennedy forschners 
37yearold president and chief executive officer 
the knives manufactured by the victorinox cutlery co in 
switzerland are readily identified by their color and many 
gadgets the most popular model with about 500000 units sold in 
1987 is the classic a key chain model that has in addition to a 
knife blade a nail file scissors tweezers and a toothpick 
the latest addition to the more than 60 different models is the 
swisschamp which was introduced this year it has 29 features 
including a ballpoint pen pliers wood saw fish scaler corkscrew 
and magnifying glass 
the typical customer is a man between the ages of 21 to 35 
living in the northeast or northwest kennedy said the weakest 
sales for the knives are in the southeast 
the company whose stock is publicly traded had record sales of 
more than 364 million in 1987 up 24 percent from 1986 after 
expenses the company earned about 18 million the previous 
record was set in 1986 when forschner rang up 273 million in 
sales 
the swiss army knives which range in price from 8 to 18 for 
the classic to 90 for the swisschamp accounted for roughly 20 
million of last years sales 
the united states snapped up about 35 percent of victorinoxs 
output of swiss army knives in 1987 the sales have continued 
upward despite a more than doubling of the effective price of the 
knives in the past two years due to the declining value of the 
dollar kennedy said 
americans got their first exposure to the knives following world 
war ii when gis were stationed in europe kennedy said gis gave 
the name swiss army knife to the product because everyone in 
the swiss army carried it 
the rh forschner co started in 1855 as a manufacturer of 
butcher scales in new britain conn sometime during the 1880s it 
moved to new york city where it remained until relocating to 
shelton in 1976 it currently employs 80 people at its headquarters 
and a shelton warehouse where it does some assembly and repairs 
kennedy who started with the company in sales in 1975 was 
named president and chief operating officer in june 1987 he 
assumed the new title of chief executive officer this march 
the company after world war i started importing knives from 
germany because they were selling scales to the meatpacking 
industry so therefore they could assume the same people would 
buy knives kennedy said 
world war ii came along and their german source was naturally 
unavailable when the war ended the grandson of the founder 
went over to switzerland because germany was devastated and found 
this little company called victorinox that made very good butcher 
knives and he started importing them he continued 
the swiss army knife also made at the swiss factory was tossed 
in for good measure 
in 1957 the founding family sold rh forschner to a 
businessman who expanded the butcher knife segment and phased out 
the scale business in 1974 the business was sold again this time 
to marline resources co inc of new york city marline took the 
company public in 1983 
the business was purchased for the butcher knife business and 
lo and behold sitting there in the corner was the litte swiss army 
knife kennedy said 
we did a market research study of the whole company and the 
market research study indicated that we had a great opportunity 
with the swiss army knife 
the company turned up its marketing program for the knives in 
1976 when it introduced sealed display cases which are now used by 
10000 retailers to show off 10 to 20 knives 
it was a very successful program kennedy said it made it 
a silent salesman its always there in the store and frankly 
you dont get up in the morning and say im going to go out and 
buy a swiss army knife its something you know about and if you 
see it in a store it reminds you hey i will want one of those

after months of leaks rumors and innuendo about 
impending mass indictments the ivan boesky securities fraud 
scandal has yet to result in a triumphant prosecution raising 
questions about the true strength of the governments case against 
suspected wall street felons 
the apparent weakness stems from the sources of evidence 
largely supplied by boesky or a few accomplices who have negotiated 
agreements for leniency in exchange for information about other 
alleged lawbreakers 
that suggests investigators are facing acute problems getting 
corroboration from more credible witnesses and making sense out of 
the enormous amounts of material subpoenaed in the probe 
the biggest target the investment firm drexel burnham lambert 
inc has yet to be formally accused of anything although it has 
been the subject of numerous press leaks the securities and 
exchange commission has recommended civil charges of securitieslaw 
violations against the firm and some key employees 
drexel has taken an increasingly combative approach toward the 
crackdown drexel sources speaking privately have acknowledged 
that the firms senior management is preparing for a legal brawl 
with the sec and has briefed lowerlevel staff on what to possibly 
expect in the weeks and months ahead 
sec officials have declined to comment on any aspect of the 
drexel matter but people familiar with its investigation speaking 
on condition of anonymity have suggested the agency is delaying 
civil charges because of an incomplete criminal probe of drexel by 
the us attorneys office 
if the sec filed civil charges first drexel would gain 
wideranging access to the governments evidence and witnesses 
under the federal rules of pretrial evidence gathering but drexel 
would be denied that opportunity if indicted first because 
criminal pretrial rules are much stricter 
drexel is not the only bottleneck in the governments 
investigation prosecutors also have failed to bring new charges 
against three wall street professionals arrested with great 
publicity in february 1987 after they were implicated by a 
confessed boesky accomplice merger specialist martin a siegel 
the original charges were dropped in may 1987 because the 
government said it needed more time to prepare the case against 
robert m freeman timothy l tabor and richard b wigton trading 
professionals who were accused of profiting in the stock market on 
inside information supplied by siegel 
manhattan us attorney rudolf giulianis office promised at the 
time to obtain broader indictments against the trio in 
recordbreaking time 
fourteen months later officials in the us attorneys office 
decline to comment on why new charges have not been filed but the 
delay suggests that prosecutors already embarassed once are 
reluctant to pursue a case without evidence that is more 
substantial than siegels testimony 
lawyers for the three men express resentment over the 
governments handling of their clients who remain under a cloud of 
suspicion without formal charges the lawyers have indicated they 
will immediately move to dismiss any new charges on grounds they 
violate the constitutional right to a speedy trial 
one indication that the government has progressed in its 
boeskyrelated investigation came earlier this month when a grand 
jury indicted gaf corp and a vice chairman for alleged stock 
manipulation based on evidence supplied by another boesky 
associate and admitted felon boyd l jefferies 
but securities lawyers have said the prosecutors could face an 
embarassing defeat without evidence that corroborates jefferies 
testimony they say manipulation is one of the most difficult 
crimes to prove regardless of evidence 
even if the government triumphs in the gaf case the results of 
the wall street corruption crackdown have been much milder than 
first predicted when boesky one of the biggest stock speculators 
was arrested in november 1986 
he paid the sec a record 100 million to settle insidertrading 
charges and was sentenced last december to three years imprisonment 
on a single felony count of conspiring to lie to the sec but 
boesky has yet to testify in any proceeding against others he has 
implicated 
boeskys lawyers contend his cooperation has exceeded original 
estimates resulting in a dozen criminal charges four guilty pleas 
and nine sec administrative actions 
in arguing for a reduced sentence a few months ago the lawyers 
claimed more indictments would emerge soon showing the 
extraordinary extent and value of mr boeskys cooperation

is it a sign of great weakness that the united 
states owed 368 billion to foreign creditors at the end of 1987 
more than was owed by any other nation or is it a sign of strength 
the popular position is that the debt is further evidence of 
a decline of the us economy the united states it is said is 
the worlds largest debtor nation the insinuation being that debt 
is bad 
in this instance however the debt referred to can also be 
viewed as strength there is even a school of thought that declines 
to call it debt pointing out instead that much of the money is 
invested 
they ask you to consider this simple equivalent 
when you put 20000 into a 100000 house for your family do 
you explain to your friends that you have just gone deeply into 
debt or do you tell them youve just made the best investment of 
your life 
most people would say the 20000 was invested and so would any 
foreigner who put money into us stocks bonds and real estate 
such folks invest for a good return they dont see themselves as 
lenders they really arent 
the popular view of the united states being the largest debtor 
nation comes from a comparison of us investments abroad vs 
foreign investments in the united states it is true foreigners 
invest more here than we do there 
do they do so because they lack faith or because of the 
attractiveness of american investments does it indicate an uncle 
sam with his hand out or foreigners eager to get in on good 
investments 
in short is it debt or is it investment is it weakness or 
strength 
while those who call it debt are entitled to do so others point 
out that if foreigners buy stock in a company put money in an 
american bank buy us government securities or purchase a 
production plant they are investing 
it makes sense the us market is the worlds biggest by far 
the country is also the most politically stable a factor that has 
dictated investments as far back as international trade itself and 
us investments are inexpensive 
it is the latter factor a direct result of the decline of the 
us dollar that has been the latest spur to foreign investments 
in the united states 
sanford simon a new yorkbased broker who has arranged at least 
70 us investments for british companies offers some succinct 
reasons for the phenomenon 
despite belonging to the european economic community he says 
the british have an island economy it is a mature economy in which 
successful companies long ago carved out their niches the result 
they butt heads in a small market 
they look for ways to expand especially if they have good cash 
flow and they see the biggest market of all in the united states 
growing evolving changing and to boot englishspeaking 
english laws discourage dividend distributions a situation that 
produces problems for good companies they must expand and what 
better place to do so than in america where because of the 
devalued dollar businesses are available at a discount 
there is another side of the coin if the united states economy 
is so attractive to foreigners why shouldnt it be equally so to 
americans that is why should they have to send their money abroad

japans mazda motor corp is talking with ford 
motor co about selling ford trucks through us mazda dealers in a 
reversal of mazdas traditional relationship with ford mazdas 
president said tuesday 
norimasa furuta also said mazda plans to introduce a sporty 
japanesebuilt minivan this fall and will decide by the end of the 
year whether to build an engine plant at flat rock where its 
assembly plant opened in september 
ford owns 25 percent of mazda and receives more than half of the 
cars produced at flat rock which was built on the site of a 
closed ford metal casting plant the engine plant would be part of 
an effort to increase the us content of cars made at flat rock to 
75 percent by 1991 furuta told the automotive news world congress 
mazda expects to sell 270000 imported and domestic cars and 
100000 trucks in the united states during 1988 and eventually 
wants to sell 500000 vehicles a year here 
ironically ford sold mazda compact pickups before ford 
developed its own small trucks earlier this decade mazda also 
supplied ford first with small cars and then began sharing 
development with ford as with the new probe designed by ford 
engineered by mazda built by mazda at flat rock and sold by ford 
dealers a second version of the car the mazda mx6 is sold by 
mazda dealers 
now our relationship has reached the stage where there may be 
the opportunity in some future programs for the historical roles to 
be reversed furuta said ford could supply mazda with 
components and could build vehicles for mazda to sell entering 
a new age of true reciprocity 
furuta said mazda is talking with ford on a wide variety of 
subjects including the possibility of selling ford compact pickups 
through us mazda dealers because of the strength of the japanese 
yen and the 25 percent us duty on japanese pickups 
other small pickup alternatives could include assembling the 
pickups in japan from usmade parts which would not be subject 
to the duty when the trucks were shipped to the united states he 
said 
ford spokesman ken brown confirmed the discussions on sale of 
ford trucks through us mazda dealers but said he was unfamiliar 
with the possibility of selling mazda components for assembly in 
japan 
the ford probe is selling so fast that ford is requesting that 
we reach full capacity at flat rock as soon as possible furuta 
said production at the plant is being accelerated slowly to keep 
quality under tight control 
at full capacity the plant can make 240000 cars a year but 
furuta said it could build 300000 cars a year without additional 
investment and will do so if demand remains strong 
more than 60 percent of the cars built at flat rock are probes 
the plants production was sold out through the end of the year 
shortly after largescale production began 
brown said both mazda and ford would like to see more cars 
coming out of flat rock but neither would be willing to compromise 
the quality of vehicles built there

operations and is 49 percent owned by cocacola co 
cocacola enterprises said its volume in cases rose about 22 
percent in the second quarter and 19 percent in the first half

stock prices held at sharply lower levels today 
as a weakened technology sector and overall investor nervousness 
took their toll on equities 
the dow jones average of 30 industrials was off 2472 points at 
209317 an hour before the closing bell 
declining issues outnumbered advances by more than 11 to 5 in 
nationwide trading of new york stock exchangelisted stocks with 
446 up 1004 down and 468 unchanged 
volume on the big board came to 12331 million shares as of 3 
pm on wall street 
the dow average moved up about 2 points in the first half hour 
of trading but sank below the psychologically important 2100 level 
at midday and then continued to fall despite continued reports of 
higher corporate earnings for the second quarter 
hildegarde zagorski a second vice president at prudentialbache 
securities inc noted that the decline began in the technology 
sector where several stocks tumbled that started the ball 
rolling and then computertriggered sell programs kicked in she 
said 
other analysts remarked on a sense of apathy among investors 
the primary problem is the mood of the market said alfred 
goldman a vice president at ag edwards amp sons inc in st louis 
im very disappointed with todays action theres a worldwide 
malaise about owning equities 
goldman noted that despite relatively favorable fundamentals 
such as lower interest rates and higher corporate earnings the 
vast majority of investors are in a very apathetic mood theyre 
not coming to the equities trough 
earlier in tokyo the key nikkei 225share index plummeted more 
than 500 points to its lowest level this year which contributed to 
investor nervousness when trading shifted to new york 
zagorski attributed the decline in japan to inflation fears 
sparked by higher oil prices which rose on monday following 
reports that iran had acceded to a united nations resolution 
calling for a ceasefire in its war against iraq 
but reports that iran downed three iraqi jets today cast a veil 
of confusion over prospects for a ceasefire 
among technology issues seagate technology plunged 5 to 12 in 
overthecounter trading one trader said that helped trigger 
further declines in the industry because seagate provides parts to 
other computer makers 
elsewhere in the technology sector ibm fell 1 at 123 the

prices for some corn and soybean futures 
contracts closed down their permissible limits tuesday on the 
chicago board of trade amid forecasts for more rain in the 
droughtstricken midwest 
but analysts said that after two consecutive days of limit 
losses the markets appeared to have discounted all the rain that 
the corn belt is likely to receive this week 
i think well have a twosided trade tomorrow said victor 
lespinasse a trader with dean witter reynolds inc in chicago 
well probably open lower but not necessarily 
oat futures also closed lower but wheat futures advanced on 
expectations of new export business analysts said 
the wetweather pattern that drenched parts of the upper midwest 
over the weekend continued on tuesday bringing rain to the 
regions parched southern and western portions more rain was 
expected in the northern corn belt on wednesday 
the rain halted further deterioration of the badly damaged corn 
crop and greatly improved the prospects for good soybean yields 
analysts said 
at the close wheat was 4 cents to 8 cents higher with the 
contract for delivery in july at 375 a bushel corn was the 
limit 15 cents lower to 4 cents higher with july at 308 a bushel 
oats were 13 cents lower to 3 cents higher with july at 290 a 
bushel soybeans were 6 cents to the limit 45 cents lower with

divergent secondquarter results tuesday as ameritech announced a 
27 percent profit gain while southwestern bell corp said its 
earnings fell 14 percent 
ameritech based in chicago and parent of five bell phone 
companies in the midwest said the sale of its canadian cellular 
telephone holdings and strong growth in its us mobile phone 
business helped boost its results 
ameritech reported net income of 3515 million or 258 per 
share for the three months ending june 30 compared with 2758 
million or 196 per share for the same period a year ago 
revenue for the quarter increased 46 percent to 248 billion 
from 237 billion ameritech said in a statement 
net income for the first six months of 1988 totaled 6466 
million or 473 per share compared with 5648 million or 399 
per share for the same period a year ago 
firsthalf revenues totaled 489 billion compared with 467 
billion 
ameritech is the holding company for bell companies serving 
illinois indiana michigan ohio and wisconsin

bell telephone co and some smaller subsidiaries said it earned 
2129 million or 71 cents a share down from 2488 million or 
83 cents a share a year earlier revenue rose 78 percent to 203 
billion from 189 billion

4865 million or 162 per share a year earlier revenue rose to 
403 billion from 376 billion

related to the expense of shutting down silver pages operations 
the cost of acquiring new cellular and paging properties and 
increases in telephone company expenses the company said 
we remain confident of our ability to produce earnings growth 
for the year zack barnes the chairman and chief executive said

northrop corp posted a profit tuesday of 
219 million in the second quarter compared to a 154 million 
loss a year earlier when the company took a large writeoff on a 
secret project believed to be the stealth bomber 
the aerospace company reported that its sales for the quarter 
fell 52 percent to 135 billion from 142 billion in the second 
quarter of 1987 
in the first six months of the year northrops profit climbed 
to 1615 million or 344 a share compared with 252 million 
or 54 cents a share a year earlier sixmonth revenue fell 4 
percent to 271 billion from 283 billion a year earlier 
the company attributed the improved secondquarter results to 
absence of a 1243 million writeoff it took in the second quarter 
of 1987 on a project it hasnt officially identified but which is 
widely believed to be the b2 or stealth bomber earlier this 
year northrop and the air force acknowledged for the first time 
the company is developing the bomber which is designed to be 
difficult to detect on enemy radar 
secondquarter operating profit was cut by lower revenues on the 
unnamed classified program as well as by reduced sales and lower 
profit margins on guidance units for the air forces mx missile and 
other military projects revenue also was reduced because of a 
pentagon policy that requires contractors to pay a larger share of 
research and development costs that they previously did the 
company said 
production of inertial measurement units for the mx has lagged 
behind schedule but the company says it now is producing the units 
on a schedule acceptable to the air force the government is 
withholding less than 50 million in progress payments on the mx 
systems down from a high of 145 million in december 1987 
northrop said 
northrop is one of three southern california aerospace companies 
whose offices were searched last month in the nationwide 
investigation of allegations that defense industry consultants 
bribed pentagon officials for information to help win contracts 
the company has said it is cooperating in the probe which so far 
has centered on independent industry consultants and former defense 
department officials

stock prices sank today amid computerdriven 
sell programs and investor nervousness following a sharply lower 
markets overseas 
analysts said the markets momentum continues to abate and a 
500plus point plunge in tokyos key nikkei 225share index only 
served to heighten investor uneasiness as the session began 
some investors are hesitant to hold on amid even the slightest 
weakness rather than ride out the correction noted eugene 
peroni a technical analyst at janney montgomery scott in 
philadelphia 
slightly higher bond prices and positive corporate earnings for 
the second quarter provided only minimal support for equities 
traders pointed to the technology sector as being particularly 
weak the fact that we had very vague leadership was partly a 
cause for the markets poor behavior peroni said

reported profits in the second quarter in contrast with steep 
losses a year earlier 
citicorp wells fargo amp co mellon bank corp and irving bank 
corp noted that the secondquarter losses in 1987 stemmed from 
additions to loan reserves for potentially uncollectible loans to 
developing countries 
great western financial corp one of the biggest us thrifts 
said its secondquarter earnings jumped 22 percent to 647 
million or 50 cents a share from 53 million or 40 cents a

company said it earned 359 million or 103 a share compared 
with a loss of 26 billion in the second quarter of last year 
if the loanloss provisions hadnt been made citicorp said it 
would have earned 285 million or 93 cents a share in the second 
quarter of 1987 
citicorp attributed the improvement in the latest quarter to 
continued strength in its core banking businesses in the united 
states and abroad much of the momentum in banking came from 
citicorps credit card business the company said 
the banking giant also credited positive results from securities 
and currency trading during the quarter as well as gains from 
venture capital loans 
in the first half of the year citicorp posted net profit of 
717 million or 204 a share compared with a net loss of 23 
billion in the first six months of 1987 
san franciscobased wells fargo the 11thlargest us bank 
company reported secondquarter earnings of 1244 million or 
224 a share compared with a net loss of 2937 million a year 
earlier 
excluding the provision for risky loans wells fargo would have 
earned 836 million or 145 a share in the second quarter of 
last year 
the company said an increase in net interest income resulting 
from favorable market conditions in california was a major factor 
in the secondquarter improvement wells fargo which acquired 
barclays bank of california in may is the thirdlargest banking 
company in the state 
in the first half of the year the bank posted net profit of 
2448 million or 439 a share compared with a net loss of

1156 a share compared with a net loss of 1134 million a year

121 million or 95 cents a share from 142 million or 111 a

significant because the central banks seemed to be trying to push

dollars surge over the last eight weeks mccarthy said

the stock market skidded lower tuesday as 
investor nervousness over the direction of interest rates overrode 
a flurry of favorable corporate earnings reports 
the dow jones average of 30 industrials which fell more than 11 
points on monday dropped another 2063 to close at 209726 
declining issues outnumbered advances by about 9 to 5 in 
nationwide trading of new york stock exchangelisted stocks with 
517 issues up 918 down and 492 unchanged 
volume on the floor of the nyse was 14411 million shares down 
from 15621 million in mondays session nationwide consolidated 
volume in nyselisted issues including trading at regional 
exchanges and in the overthecounter market totaled 16811 
million shares 
stock prices were mixed at the opening of trading but soon 
headed lower by midday the dow sank below the psychologically 
important 2100 mark and continued to hold at depressed levels 
despite repeated reports of higher corporate earnings for the 
second quarter 
hugh johnson a senior vice president at first albany corp 
noted that higher interest rates overseas coupled with fear that 
the federal reserve may also hike rates in this country is the 
principal reason making the market nervous 
he said the market largely discounted repeated doubledigit 
corporate earnings increases for fear they will be neutralized by 
higher interest rates down the road 
the technology sector which typically has been a leader in 
propelling the market to higher levels was particularly weak it 
can be a little depressing elsewhere in the market when you see 
that group give ground johnson said 
with the technology sector down computerdriven sell programs 
kicked in and further depressed stock prices 
noting that the market is continuing to lose momentum some 
analysts remarked on a sense of apathy among investors and a mood 
that is negative toward equities 
eugene peroni a technical analyst at janney montgomery scott in 
philadelphia said investors are hesitant to hold on amid even 
the slightest weakness rather than ride a correction through he 
attributed the nearsighted behavior to residual trauma from 
last octobers stock crash 
earlier in tokyo the key nikkei 225share index plummeted more 
than 500 points to its lowest level this year but because the drop 
largely was a reaction to mondays sharply higher oil prices 
traders said it did not take a toll on domestic trading 
among technology issues seagate technology plunged 5 to 13 
following a sharply lower earnings report it was the most active 
issue in overthecounter trading and one trader said seagates 
decline affected other companies in the industry because it 
provides parts to other computer makers 
elsewhere in the technology sector ibm which introduced new 
computers and personal software tuesday fell 1 at 124 ncr fell 
3 to 58 prime computer was off at 15 and national 
semiconductor was off at 11 
among other actively traded big board issues union carbide was

rainy weather brought another sharp drop in corn and soybean 
futures prices tuesday on the chicago board of trade and some 
analysts wondered if the midwestern drought had finally been 
quenched 
on other markets silver futures soared to a 10month high 
energy futures fell livestock and meat were mostly lower and 
stockindex futures retreated 
the wetweather pattern that drenched parts of the upper midwest 
over the weekend brought rain on tuesday to the regions parched 
southern and western portions more rain was expected in the 
northern corn belt on wednesday 
analysts said the rain halted further deterioration of the badly 
damaged corn crop and greatly improved the yield prospects for 
soybeans which are just entering the critical podforming stage 
some corn and soybean contracts plummeted their permissible 
limits in reaction to the rain and analysts said that after two 
consecutive days of limit losses the markets appeared to have 
discounted all the rain in sight for the corn belt 
i think well have a twosided trade tomorrow said victor 
lespinasse a trader with dean witter reynolds inc in chicago 
well probably open lower but not necessarily 
lespinasse said the weather would continue set the markets 
course and cathy leow an assistant vice president with thomson 
mckinnon securities inc in new york agreed 
last week a lot of people bought soybeans at 9 thinking they 
were going to go to 13 she said now theyre thinking my 
god what if we continue to get rain 
it could be that the droughts broken ms leow said 
sure we need 10 to 15 inches of rain in most areas to bring the 
soil moisture back to normal but at least were not seeing 
further deterioration in the crops 
although it was uncertain how much rain the western corn belt 
would receive overnight ms leow said the price drop of the last 
two days probably had taken a substantial rainfall into account 
oat futures also finished lower but wheat futures advanced on 
expectations of new export business analysts said 
wheat settled 6 cents to 8 cents higher with the contract for 
delivery in july at 376 a bushel corn was the limit 15 cents 
lower to 5 cents higher with july at 308 a bushel oats were 14 
cents lower to 3 cents higher with july at 290 a bushel soybeans 
were 6 cents to the limit 45 cents lower with july at 874 a 
bushel 
the price for july delivery of silver soared more than 57 cents 
on new yorks commodity exchange to 7727 the highest price for 
nearmonth delivery since sept 10 when the september contract

analysts cited a number of factors for the rise including the 
twoday old peruvian silver miners strike and growing investment 
demand for silver as a hedge against inflation 
world supplies of silver are plentiful and the strike in peru 
which accounts for about 20 percent of world production normally 
would have little longterm effect on prices said fred demler 
metals analyst with drexel burnham lambert inc in new york 
if investment demand were not picking up the fact that the 
supply is being disrupted from peru would not have a large impact 
on the supplydemand scenario he said 
a bullish technical picture also spurred buying of silver which 
helped boost prices of other precious metals other analysts said 
gold settled 870 to 980 higher with august at 44750 a troy 
ounce silver was 577 cents to 625 cents higher with july at

first republicbank corp undergoing a 
federallyassisted bailout reported tuesday that it lost 758 
million in the second quarter citing deteriorating values on real 
estate assets and foreclosed properties 
as forecast at the annual meeting of shareholders last month 
the secondquarter losses were substantial said albert v casey 
chairman and chief executive officer 
the company had lost 3132 million in the second quarter a year 
ago 
during the first quarter of 1988 first republicbank recorded a 
15 billion loss and its loss for the six months ending june 30 
was 226 billion 
first republicbanks first quarter loss the largest ever for a 
us bank after citcorps 25 billion loss in 1987 forced the 
company to launch an emergency federal recapitalization plan 
the federal deposit insurance corp in may infused 1 billion 
into the holding company formed through the merger of interfirst 
corp and republicbank corp in may 1987 
for purposes of comparison the company said it had a loss of 
3028 million for the first six months of 1987 
lost the holding company attributes its latest loss to 
deteriorating values on real estate held as loan collateral and 
repossessed properties which it is unable to resell 
the market is very very soft said joe bowles first 
republicbank spokesman 
it said its nonperforming assets totaled 5135 billion up 671 
million from the quarter ending march 31 
casey said in a statement that declining values of its real 
estate slowed slightly in the second quarter i clearly cannot 
report however that we have reached bottom at this point he 
said 
the companys recapitalization plan is under examination by the 
fdic and bowles said the second quarter earnings report would not 
affect the agencys acceptance of it weve kept the fdic and 
other regulatory parties fully apprised bowles said 
the plan was submitted last month with several other proposals 
and the fdic was expected to choose a plan for the company this 
month 
we had hoped for a favorable decision on our plan by now but 
the fdic has required additional time to study all available 
options said casey we remain confident that the first 
republic plan is the most viable of those options and will 
ultimately be accepted company officials now expect a plan to be 
chosen within a weeks

beretta the italian arms manufacturer sued 
general motors corp for 250 million tuesday claiming its 
centuriesold reputation for fine workmanship will be ruined if the 
carmaker continues producing a fourwheeled beretta 
fabrica darmi p beretta spa maker of firearms since the late 
15th century charged gm with trademark infringement and unfair 
competition in a federal lawsuit 
beretta which calls itself the oldest manufacturer of arms in 
the world said its lawyers warned gm about using the beretta 
name a year before the automaker unveiled the chevrolet model in 
1987 
the arms maker based in the italian province of brescia said 
the company had registered trademarks in this country for the 
beretta name as far back as 1954 
in detroit general motors issued a statement that said no 
basis for the suit exists because there is no likelihood for 
confusion as to the source of those vehicles between gm and the 
beretta gun company 
the gm employee who selected the beretta name was unaware of 
the existence of the beretta gun company moreover in the united 
states it is not uncommon that vehicle models and firearms have the 
same names such as colt and marlin gm is not aware of any 
customer confusion concerning the beretta name the statement 
from gm said 
the italian concern which makes luggage clothing cutlery and 
optical equipment as well as target hunting and military guns 
claimed that for the past four centuries its products have become 
synonymous with refined workmanship and the very highest quality 
the lawsuit contends beretta pistols are the standard military 
sidearm in several countries the us army signed an 80 million 
contract for 315000 beretta pistols in 1985 but has been forced 
by congress to hold a new competition among pistol companies for 
its next order 
other examples of the gunmakers reputation can be found in 
literature where the italianmade pistols are the weapons of 
choice for numerous fictional spies and detectives including ian 
flemings agent 007 james bond
