three intellectuals who have been the governments 
only vocal critics since the student movement for democracy was 
suppressed last year disappeared on thursday and their planned news 
conference was canceled 
it was not clear if the three former hunger strikers were 
voluntarily maintaining a low profile or if they were taken into 
custody 
sunday is the anniversary of last years army attack on 
prodemocracy protesters in beijing that left hundreds dead and the 
government has been tightening security measures in anticipation of 
possible disturbances 
also on thursday chinese newspapers reported 20 people were 
executed for crimes including a man convicted of destroying an air 
force jeep during last junes uprising 
the three intellectuals had planned to issue an open letter to 
chinese leaders calling for the release of political prisoners 
friends said two of the three who drafted the letter folk singer 
hou dejian and the former editor of a university newspaper gao xin 
had not been seen since they left hous home early thursday 
several hours later hou telephoned to say he was well but would 
not be coming back for an unspecified time gao 34 telephoned 
later with a similar message 
hou 34 also phoned two foreign journalists and said because 
i personally have things to do im not ready to hold a news 
conference he refused to elaborate 
the third intellectual zhou duo 43 also dropped out of sight 
on thursday 
foreign ministry spokeswoman li jinhua said at the ministrys 
weekly briefing later thursday that chinese were free to talk to 
foreign journalists but a certain kind of formalities should be 
observed for interviews she did not comment directly on the case 
authorities may have been willing to tolerate their criticism 
because it would have only reached a foreign audience and the three 
were so open that they clearly were not involved in any underground 
plotting 
holding a major news conference just days before the anniversary 
may however been too great a provocation most of the foreign 
journalists in beijing were expected to cram hous tiny apartment 
for the meeting 
sundays edition of the official sichuan daily seen in beijing 
on thursday said courts in the capital of sichuan province last 
week sentenced convicted arsonist yu yongchuan to death he was 
immediately executed 
the newspaper said yu led others in overturning a jeep and 
setting it on fire during rioting that broke out in the capital 
chengdu on june 5 the day after the prodemocracy movement was 
crushed 
the other executed people were convicted of a variety of crimes

solidarity leaders who worked together for 
a decade to rid poland of communism now find their unity rent by 
differences over the pace and nature of change 
the spectacle of this war at the top to use lech walesas 
phrase has dismayed activists some are choosing sides and others 
hope to make peace between the factions 
walesa who led the 1980 strike in which solidarity was born 
brought the longrumored tensions into the open in april 
his method was public criticism aimed at the government of prime 
minister tadeusz mazowiecki and the parliamentary caucus led by 
bronislaw geremek both are intellectuals and solidarity advisers 
who owe their positions to the shipyard electrician from gdansk 
walesa said he had been silent too long he accused the 
government of advocating a steered democracy one that limits 
dissent because it thinks it has all the answers he said the 
communist system was being dismantled too slowly and people were 
dissatisfied 
walesa feels the mood of the people very well and the people 
are getting impatient especially for political changes said 
zdzislaw najder whom walesa has named chairman of solidaritys 
national citizens committee 
mazowieckis defenders say walesa is motivated by personal 
restlessness and an ambition to be president they say his criticism 
threatens to stir unrest when the government needs calm to obtain 
western investment and accomplish difficult economic reforms 
no reasonable person can see any monopolization of power 
aleksander malachowski a solidarity member of parliament said in 
an interview but added that some demagogues sought excuses to 
attack the government 
very often in walesas statements you can see reflections of 
this demagoguery malachowski said he probably does not realize 
it 
the dispute seems to signal a turning away from the 1989 round 
table accord in which solidarity agreed to a transitional stage of 
coexistence with the communists who still held most of the power 
with the collapse of communist control throughout eastern europe 
poland has become a rarity where former party leaders retain titular 
positions of power including the presidency and high posts in the 
military police and parliament 
they have kept their places largely by not disturbing the 
decisions of mazowiecki and the solidarity parliamentary caucus 
walesa speaks for those who want to end the artificial 
arrangement as quickly as possible mazowieckis allies worry about 
upsetting a balance that has worked so well 
while walesa says the intellectuals misled him some of them 
hint he is losing his renowned political instincts 
you are making mistakes in many areas foreign affairs 
specialist kazimierz wojcicki lectured the solidarity chairman may 
13 in a stormy session of the citizens committee 
you use terminology that confuses us he said you start a 
presidential campaign and then retract it you make us all 
nervous at a moment when our economic reforms are entering a key 
stage 
there also has been sniping between the daily gazeta wyborcza and 
weekly tygodnik solidarnosc two newspapers founded by solidarity 
they are edited respectively by adam michnik an intellectual 
perhaps best known for his letters from prison and jaroslaw 
kaczynski a walesa loyalist 
who will succeed president wojciech jaruzelski has become the 
subject of sometimes acrimonious debate it is assumed the former 
communist party chief will have to step down before the formal end 
of his term in 1995 
walesa clearly wants the job and kaczynski has organized a 
political group called the center alliance to support the candidacy 
from the other side suggestions are being circulated sometimes 
even printed that walesa is too impulsive and does not have the 
learning or manners the presidency requires 
malachowski and some others in parliament and the government say 
mazowiecki who was little known until walesa made him prime 
minister in august is a better presidential candidate 
how could people who fought and suffered so long together with 
the notion of solidarity as their highest value fall out so 
soon after their hour of triumph 
in part the dissolution of their common foe the communist 
party has released various conflicts within solidarity leftright 
workerintellectual warsawprovinces 
now the most difficult moment has come because we dont have 
anyone to fight against actress maja komorowska said at the may 
13 meeting 
we are all victims of 45 years of communist rule and of the 
lack of democracy said najder who recently returned from exile 
we know how to fight our enemies but we dont know how to coexist 
as allies 
he also said in an interview he felt the differences between 
walesa and mazowiecki were blown out of proportion 
we have democracy but when there are differences of opinion 
people are aghast he said if somebody criticizes the 
government they think he or she wants to bring down the government 
its absurd 
at the same citizens committee meeting where he spoke of the 
war at the top walesa praised the government and the solidarity 
leadership in parliament najder said 
walesa said his criticism was meant to help the government by 
providing a safety vent for growing public frustration 
according to najder the dispute developed because walesa is in 
close touch with public feelings and wants to create a more open 
political game by opposing monopolistic tendencies in 
parliament 
he said government leniency about pensions for former officials 
and its mild attitude on recovering property taken by the communist 
party were incomprehensible to some solidarity supporters 
the government also may be guilty of excessive sensitivity 
najder said the returned exile a former director of radio free 
europes polish section was sentenced to death in absentia by the 
communist regime 
malachowski who wants walesa to continue as solidarity chairman 
instead of becoming polands president said years of joint struggle 
had forged links among solidarity activists that occasional 
arguments could not break 
mrs komorowska the actress said the relationsship between 
walesa and the intellectuals should be like a marriage and observed 
it is a bad marriage where the couple does not sit down at the 
table in the evening and say to each other what is painful

he once was the man of the hour the 
latest strongman installed by the army to lead guatemala out of 
corruption insurrection and bloodshed 
gen efrain rios montt a bornagain christian with a 
charismatic style presided over times of masked tribunals and 
firing squads of army massacres that shocked the world 
when a coup deposed him in 1983 after 16 months as president 
rios montt seemed consigned to political obscurity 
his ambition like his faith has been resurrected and he is 
running for president as a civilian rios montt is a serious 
contender scoring high in the polls a candidate of crisis 
five years of democracy have not brought clean effective 
government or ended violence and human rights abuses street crime 
is rampant drug trafficking on the rise the economy unraveling 
it is a moral crisis an ethical crisis a failure of hope 
said juan luis bosch a leading businessman people put their 
hope in a democratic government but hope has become 
disillusionment 
things seem to be spinning out of control and rios montt offers 
to put them right he is a lawandorder candidate with an old 
testament style stern and paternal 
guatemala needs a man of character a man who knows and 
enforces the law the 63yearold retired brigadier general said 
in an interview not a dictator a man of law 
rios montts law was harsh 
he imposed a state of siege and created special tribunals where 
masked judges tried hundreds of people for crimes including 
sabotage possession of explosives and the sale of weapons to 
people deemed subversive 
only 15 people were ultimately sentenced to death but it was 
a great scandal because we shot five when the pope was here rios 
montt said 
pope john paul ii made a personal plea for clemency during his 
1983 central america tour 
it would have been easier to shoot them and just dump them in 
the trash but that wouldnt have been justice rios montt said 
curtly closing the subject 
during his presidency the army continued a vicious 
counterinsurgency campaign to destroy any potential base of support 
for leftist guerrillas among the peasants 
it led to the gravest violations of human rights including 
the destruction and sacking of entire villages and massacres of the 
inhabitants the human rights commission of the organization of 
american states said in 1983 
now an almost nostalgic glow seems to bathe rios montts reign 
the worldwide condemnation of human rights abuses seems forgotten 
you talk to the average person here about human rights and it 
means getting on a bus and not being robbed a western diplomat 
said that is what makes rios montts message so powerful 
people speak of how his stern measures seemed to work how the 
armys scorchedearth campaign in the countryside dimmed the 
leftist insurgency how city streets were safe and official 
corruption waned 
he is seen as an upright man a person of principles and 
order someone who will end the violence and corruption said 
fernando hurtado deputy attorney general for human rights he is 
someone who in a time of crisis stresses values 
central americas most populous nation seems caught in a time 
warp turn on television and there is rios montt again talking 
about law and order the family and clean government just as he 
did in evangelistic sunday homilies as president 
more than half a dozen candidates are seeking the presidency 
encouraged by the vulnerability of the incumbent christian 
democrats who are widely seen as corrupt and inept 
rios montt is running as an independent political observers say 
they detect little solid support for him in the two most powerful 
segments of guatemalan society the army and business 
i have the support of the people he said in the interview 
that is what matters 
the most serious obstacle to his candidacy is a constitution 
that appears to bar former dictators heads of de facto 
governments from becoming president 
rios montt says the 1985 constitution is not retroactive and he 
will run despite an adverse advisory opinion from the 
constitutional court the opinion was requested by the legislature 
and is not binding 
the former general predicted his followers will start a civil 
uprising if election authorities refuse to let him register when 
they meet in june to set an election date and register candidates 
it will be the people not the army he said an army 
uprising doesnt interest me coups dont interest me 
he grabbed a wellthumbed copy of the constitution with key 
passages highlighted in yellow ink or underlined in red and 
thumped a clause he says makes such an uprising legal 
it says here that people have the right to defend their 
rights and they have a right to vote for me he said 
his interest in constitutional law is relatively new one of his 
first acts after a march 1982 coup put him in power was to revoke 
the 1965 constitution suspend political activity and cancel 
election laws 
rios montt a member of the church of the word based in 
california says he does not intend to revive the special tribunals 
or military rule instead he proposes an extensive system of 
locally elected judges 
no more tanks no more planes no more soldiers he said 
more justice 
his human rights record could make him unacceptable to many 
other governments if he becomes president 
publicly the united states is neutral privately us 
officials say aid might be cut if rios montt wins 
rios montt said his election could provoke a us invasion or 
assassination attempt 
do something like panama shoot me end everything he said 
spitting out the words 
rios montts administration was the last but one in a 30year 
line of military or militarydominated governments that began with 
a ussponsored coup in 1954 
he dismisses criticism of his armys counterinsurgency campaign 
echoing former president reagans comment in 1982 that the general 
got a bum rap 
they blamed me for what lucas did but they knew i had an 
honest government he said referring to his predecessor gen 
fernando romeo lucas

if mikhail gorbachev fails to bring home a 
signed trade agreement from his summit meeting with president bush 
it will be another blow to a soviet economy that is already 
reeling analysts say 
both gorbachev and president bush have put major emphasis on a 
new trade agreement as the primary way the united states can 
provide economic support for gorbachevs reform program 
it is a very important trophy for gorbachev it wont solve 
all of his economic problems but not getting a deal will hurt 
said marshall goldman a soviet expert at harvard university 
the pact would normalize trade relations between the two 
superpowers for the first time in nearly a half century and clear 
the way for significantly lower tariffs on soviet products it 
would also expand business opportunites for american companies in 
the soviet union 
donald bowles an economics professor at american university 
said that given the food shortages and other problems besetting the 
soviet economy the boost from a trade agreement should not be 
underestimated 
the more quickly that we can normalize relationships the 
better we can make things for the soviet people generally he 
said that is in our longterm interests 
us and soviet negotiators reached basic agreement on the trade 
pact on april 25 with administration officials expressing optimism 
a month ago that a few minor loose ends could be resolved in time 
for bush and gorbachev to sign the document during this weeks 
summit 
although the administration has not ruled out a signing cremony 
during the fourday summit the outlook has grown considerably less 
certain 
at first the administration said it would not sign a trade 
agreement until the soviet parliament put into law liberalized 
emigration policies for soviet jews and other dissidents 
but now the administration seeking to influence gorbachevs 
handling of the lithuanian independence movement has linked a 
trade agreement with the lifting of moscows economic blockade on 
the breakaway republic 
while bush is being pressured by many members of congress to 
hold firm to this position some us business groups were lobbying 
the administration to go ahead and sign a trade deal 
the national association of manufacturers sent bush a letter 
wednesday saying that the first role of us trade policy was to 
advance americas competitive standing in the world not to serve 
as a poor foreign policy messenger 
without some clear indication that the pending ussoviet 
trade agreement will be implemented american business proposals 
will get short shrift in the soviet union compared with those from 
europe and japan wrote nam president jerry jasinowski 
the trade agreement is needed to grant the soviet union most 
favored nation status qualifying it for the lowest tariffs 
granted to any other country currently soviet products sold in 
the united states bear duties as much as 10 times higher than 
imports from other countries by one estimate the price of soviet 
vodka could drop by 125 per bottle 
us officials have estimated that the 5 billion in annual 
trade between the soviet union and the united states could double 
or even triple over the next three years with a new trade agreement 
in addition to the lower tariffs the agreement includes a 
number of provisions aimed at expanding foreign business 
opportunities the agreement would provide better copyright 
protection for american companies and cut down on the time us 
companies have to wait for approval for commercial operations in 
the soviet union 
the agreement would also clear the way for american companies 
doing business with the soviets to be eligible for 
governmentsubsidized loans from the exportimport bank and the 
overseas private investment corp 
analysts said this provision was significant because it would 
expand the number of us companies interested in setting up joint 
ventures in the soviet union a key goal of gorbachevs economic 
reforms 
the dire economic situation in the soviet union was emphasized 
during a presummit press conference wednesday conducted by a group 
of soviet economists who discussed with unusual candor the slumping 
soviet economy which has been beset by food shortages labor 
strikes and high inflation 
everything we have done so far were half measures one step 
forward and two steps backwards said vladlen martynov director 
of the soviet institute of world economics and international 
relations

ally sheedy robert blake and polly draper 
turned out for gubernatorial candidate dianne feinstein jack 
lemmon and james garner made tv commercials against a pair of 
republicanbacked redistricting measures 
but for the most part hollywoods big names are sitting out the 
june 5 primary saving their star power for the general election 
especially for the big green environmental initiative celebrity 
drive headed by jane fonda 
primaries are too divisive explained shana weiss of the 
hollywood womens political committee unless there is a 
compelling principled reason to endorse someone the celebrities 
are going to wait 
feinstein is battling state attorney general john van de kamp 
for the democratic nomination for governor us sen pete wilson 
is the favorite to win the gop nomination 
a feinstein fundraiser drew some stars and a gop fundraiser 
that indirectly helped wilson attracted charlton heston bob hope 
and chuck norris van de kamp appears to have garnered no strong 
celebrity support no celebrities have been seen at his 
fundraisers and his campaign could not provide the name of a 
single bigname backer 
oddly it wasnt the usually hollywoodhip issues of abortion or 
the environment that got lemmon and garner involved 
they gave their support to opponents of propositions 118 and 
119 initiatives that would dramatically change the way the state 
draws legislative and congressional boundaries based on the latest 
census figures 
one measure would require a twothirds vote of the legislature 
to approve reapportionment plans rather than the current simple 
majority the other would take redistricting power away from the 
legislature and give it to an independent commission both have 
heavy republican backing 
the commercials touched such a nerve among many republicans that 
gop gov george deukmejian who backs the measures assailed the 
celebrity support and noted that in 1984 a similar ad campaign 
helped defeat a redistricting effort 
the opponents are again using a hollywood star with a message 
of misrepresentation deukmejian said 
the other initiatives however have lacked star appeal the 
celebrities didnt offer and the campaigns didnt call 
were just not trying to sell it that way said bob schmidt 
with the gas tax initiative proposition 111 and a companion 
measure proposition 108 frankly in any of the strategy 
conferences weve never even discussed getting any celebrity 
types 
feinstein the former san francisco mayor in a close race with 
van de kamp got a good celebrity showing at a may 5 fundraiser at 
the home of feminist lawyer gloria allred 
as an almost lifelong republican i am no longer deluded and 
im delighted to support dianne said richard paul star of the 
carter country television series 
but feinsteins star support is lowprofile at best none of the 
celebrities has been seen stumping for her and many of the stars at 
the fundraiser declined to comment on their political leanings 
among them was dana delaney of televisions china beach 
dana just didnt think it was something she wanted to talk 
about said her publicist heidi schaeffer 
wilson also has lukewarm support from hollywood the february 
event that drew hope heston and norris was technically for the 
state republican party not wilsons campaign and an appearance by 
president bush was the draw 
although van de kamp has not stirred up hollywood interest the 
big green measure he cosponsors with assemblyman tom hayden 
dsanta monica has the entertainment world buzzing 
the sweeping environmental initiative has lined up the support 
of miss fonda meryl streep robin williams ted danson candice 
bergen billy crystal martin short chevy chase barbra streisand 
ed begley jr and donna mills

barbara bush is laying out the china though 
not the dishes that got nancy reagan in trouble for a spectacular 
evening of socializing and opera at tonights dinner for president 
mikhail s gorbachev and his wife raisa 
lastminute details including finishing touches on the menu 
were being completed in secrecy today as white house social 
officials prepared for the hottest social event of the year 
first lady barbara bushs office which oversees planning for 
state dinners released minimal information in advance saying the 
details could not be divulged until all was absolutely ready 
but a few glimpses of the evenings promise penetrated the 
secrecy shield 
the feature entertainment will be american opera singer 
frederica von stade considered one of the worlds foremost 
mezzosopranos 
the new jerseyborn von stade has sung with most of the nations 
major opera companies including the washington opera and has 
performed all over the world she is particularly renowned for her 
french repertoire especially the role of cinderella in the opera 
cendrillon by jules massenet 
the white house planned to set out dishes bought during 
president lyndon b johnsons administration which nancy reagan 
once described as just not elegant enough for a state dinner 
mrs reagan ordered new china she later wrote in her 
autobiography my turn that the purchase became a symbol of 
my supposed extravagance even though the bill was picked up by 
the knapp foundation not the taxpayers 
the set left behind by the johnsons mrs reagan wrote did 
not include serving platters finger bowls dessert bowls and 
bouillon cups and while the johnson china was lovely with the 
various state flowers around the edge it was more suitable for a 
luncheon than a formal state dinner 
maybe so but mrs bush chose to use that dishware rather than 
nancy reagans for reasons left unsaid if not obvious simply 
put mrs reagan and mrs gorbachev never hit it off as the former 
first lady acknowledged in her book the relationship she said 
obviously had been difficult for both of us 
the administrations chief of protocol ambassador joseph v 
reed confirmed the bushes themselves took a strong hand in 
planning the dinner as he put it it has their personal stamp of 
american elegance on it 
the menu features classic continental cuisine said mrs 
bushs press secretary anna perez she provided no specifics as is 
customary domestic wine will be served 
during dessert the air force strolling strings orchestra will 
perform for the dinner guests 
before and after dinner the marine orchestra will play in the 
white house grand entrance hall where dancing is the custom after 
guests sit for the entertainment in the east room 
the dinner also affords an opportunity for the two presidents to 
exchange pleasantries in formal toasts which are often political 
in nature 
the tightlyheld guest list included such american luminaries as 
academyaward winning actor jessica tandy tandys husband hume 
cronyn actor morgan freeman and nbc news anchor tom brokaw 
sources said tandy and freeman starred together in last years 
academy award best picture driving miss daisy 
the gorbachevs also will have a chance to mingle with the 
democratic and republican congressional leaders also among the 
invitees 
the 130person guest list was rounded out by assorted political 
social athletic and entertainment world figures 
some questions remained open 
would the gorbachevs take a whirl around the dance floor the 
bushes always dance a number or two but whether their more 
reserved soviet guests would follow suit was not known 
would bush and gorbachev call each other by first names in the 
formal toasts bush frequently addresses his foreign guests by 
first name but it remained unclear whether gorbachev would accept 
that level of intimacy with the american president 
so far in their public comments bush and gorbachev have 
addressed one another formally as mr president 
the gorbachevs will reciprocate as hosts on friday night when 
they hold a dinner for the bushes at the soviet embassy in 
washington

if no superpower trade agreement is 
signed during the washington summit the plight of yuri semenenko 
may be one small reason why 
semenenko holds a us passport by virtue of his birth in 
portland oregon 45 years ago but he still is unable to leave the 
soviet union 
the catch he also holds a soviet passport and visa officials 
say he cannot leave until he gives it up and only they can decide 
if and when he can do that 
semenenko served five years in prison camps on what he said were 
trumpedup criminal charges connected to his effort to obtain a 
us passport in the early 1980s 
for him the political and economic reforms for which the world 
has praised president mikhail s gorbachev are changes in words 
only 
in deeds nothing has changed said semenenko a trim tennis 
fanatic and former motocross racer 
even though he knows portland only through old photographs he 
would like to take his wife yelena a ballet dancer and newborn 
daughter to the city to live 
i have some kind of feeling that the city is my home some 
kind of ties there he said 
travel and emigration from the soviet union have reached record 
levels under gorbachev an israeli immigration agency reported in 
january that 71509 jews left the soviet union in 1989 the highest 
total in about two decades 
but many say gorbachevs reforms have been limited soviet jews 
plan to demonstrate in moscow during the superpower summit to make 
their point 
soviet officials long have promised a new emigration law to 
remove obstacles and president bush has set that as a criterion 
for easing trade restrictions against the soviet union 
under a 1974 us law the soviet union has been denied the 
benefits of most favored nation trading status because of its 
repressive policies toward the emigration of soviet jews and other 
minorities 
bush administration officials have worked on the final wording 
of a trade agreement but it was unclear whether it would be put on 
the table during the summit without a new soviet emigration law 
gorbachevs economic crackdown on lithuania was also hindering an 
accord officials said 
in november the supreme soviet legislature gave preliminary 
approval to a bill that would allow emigration for virtually anyone 
who has entry permission from another country and no outstanding 
alimony obligations criminal charges or recent knowledge of state 
secrets 
it sets a limit of five years on the period a citizen can be 
kept from emigrating because of access to secrets nevertheless 
jewish activists claim the bill is vaguely worded and might still 
be used to restrict emigration 
there are indications the bill might come up for debate soon 
but it has proved little comfort to semenenko and others caught in 
the slow grind of soviet bureaucracy 
semenenko is the son of a soviet military officer assigned to 
oversee lendlease shipments in world war ii and is american by 
virtue of his birth in portlands wilcox memorial hospital on feb 
10 1945 
his family left the united states several months after 
semenenkos birth and he has lived since then in the soviet union 
ten years ago he learned he was eligible for us citizenship 
and in march 1989 obtained a us passport after being released 
from prison camp where he served time on charges of bribery and 
hooliganism 
he began seeking permission from the soviet union to leave but 
was told only the soviet government could decide whether and when 
he can give up his soviet citizenship 
the bureaucracys gears moved another notch in february 
leningrad visa officials invited him to fill out an application to 
give up citizenship and pay a fee of 500 rubles about twice the 
monthly wage for an average factory worker 
but nothing has happened since he paid the fee and filled out 
the form semenenko said calls to the local visa office indicated 
the documents still have not been transmitted to moscow for 
approval 
to semenenko that means my documents are with the kgb and the 
visa office cant do anything about it there is no way to guess 
if the secret police will sign off on his departure he said 
as the soviet union struggles through economic failure ethnic 
tension and political upheaval semenenko said it does not matter 
what kind of life he finds in the united states 
sitting here its impossible to construct any kind of 
possibilities for the future he said im ready for any kind 
of work

it has come to this with the russian currency 
so great is its trouble so low its value that an essay contest 
was held on ways to rescue the ruble six hundred ideas came from 
23 countries 
frank furth a wealthy californian who put up 42000 in prize 
money said the idea came to him when a soviet guest visiting his 
ranch asked if he had any suggestions on how to make the ruble 
convertible worth something outside of the ussr 
his suggestion was to have the contest 
if the ruble isnt convertible no one wants it it cant be 
cashed in for other currencies when pepsicola set up shop in the 
soviet union it worked out a deal to sell pepsi for rubles buy 
vodka with the rubles export the vodka then sell the vodka and 
make its profit that way 
it works but its clumsy economists talk about liquidity but 
thats not what they have in mind 
the judges three american academics three russian experts 
went over the finalists and awarded 10000 prizes wednesday to two 
russians giuzel anulova and k panov and an economics professor 
from tufts university franklyn holzman 
they gave 4000 prizes to the runnersup a russian a west 
german and a hungarian 
the top winners called one way or another for creation of a 
market economy in the soviet union as the only effective path to 
ruble respectability the others called one way or another for a 
dual economy which might or might not lead to a convertible 
ruble the judges said 
the judges issued a statement after two days of intense 
discussion the jury came away impressed with the difficulties 
involved in devising a workable strategy for achieving a

abc fibbed when it said laura palmers murder 
would be solved in the season finale of twin peaks executive 
producer mark frost says but withholding the whodunit seems to 
have gotten the series renewed 
we had no guarantee that abc would ever renew us he said 
tuesday in a telephone interview from hawaii i intentionally 
structured that last hour so that if abc was really curious about 
who killed laura theyd have to pick up the show 
our sole strategy was survival by withholding the identity of 
the killer we thought we were down to our last coin 
an abc spokesman said early this month that the mystery would be 
solved in the last episode which was last week on wednesday 
spokesman bob wright changed his tune 
i was always under the assumption that the central part of the 
story pertaining to the murder would be resolved he said i 
was wrong from now on i will not make any promises about twin 
peaks 
twin peaks will be back in the fall along with frost 
hopes disappointed viewers who charted every dizzying turn of the 
shows nine hours trying to figure out who murdered the sleepy 
northwest lumber towns homecoming queen 
on april 8 television was introduced to a world out of kilter 
confected by frost and film director david lynch who made blue 
velvet 
the ratings were only mediocre but fans threw twin peaks 
parties and more was written about the program than any other in 
recent memory

mikhail s gorbachevs first full day of 
summitry mixes weighty sessions at the white house and private time 
during which he will play luncheon host to a group of 
yettobeidentified american intellectuals 
gorbachev accompanied by his stylish wife raisa arrived from 
ottawa canada for the fourday ussoviet summit late wednesday 
he looked slightly weary as he stepped off his jet but said he 
was keen to see bush 
this is the first time that the president and i will have 
enough time to reflect on and discuss not only in a formal 
setting but also in a more informal surrounding oneonone all 
the questions either of us might have that fall within our 
responsibility gorbachev said in brief remarks at a redcarpet 
welcoming ceremony at nearby andrews air force base 
gorbachev will meet twice with bush at the white house today and 
attend a state dinner in the evening after more sessions friday 
the pair will relax at camp david md the presidential retreat in 
maryland on saturday 
also on todays agenda is the luncheon for american thinkers 
that will be at the soviet embassy where gorbachev is staying 
about six blocks from the white house the soviets have kept the 
guest list closely held 
when gorbachev arrived at the embassy he was greeted by gawkers 
and protesters one small group of people chanted stop killing 
armenians and another carried signs reading no tanks in 
lithuania 
gorbachevs car was in a motorcade of more than 50 vehicles 
earlier as his zil limousine drove down connecticut avenue 
gorbachevs window was open gorbachev waved and smiled at people 
along the sidewalk who applauded 
the promise of an agreement reducing strategic nuclear arms was 
high on his wish list gorbachev said he and bush were sure to get 
down to that topic at their first meeting this morning 
other issues likely to be addressed included a chemical weapons 
ban the role of conventional forces in europe the unification of 
germany the future of the baltic republics and according to bush 
aides gorbachevs domestic problems 
those may have taken a turn for the worse wednesday with an 
announcement by boris yeltsin the newly elected russian president 
that hell seek sovereignty for the largest soviet republic within 
his first 100 days in office 
yeltin a political threat to gorbachev from the left said he 
would try to mend fences with gorbachev but outlined a program of 
economic and social reform must broader than gorbachevs 
already the economic reforms initiated by gorbachev have caused 
increases in food prices 
the sad shape of the soviet economy and gorbachevs desire to 
improve ties with capitalist countries must have been a factor in 
the soviet leaders decision to meet with south koreas president 
next week in san francisco us officials said wednesday 
moscow and seoul have no formal diplomatic relations and 
gorbachevs decision to hold the meeting represents the strongest 
soviet gesture yet toward south korea 
gorbachev is scheduled to meet with south korean president roh 
taewoo on monday in san francisco where he also will see ronald 
reagan and former secretary of state george shultz

vincent the chin gigante is no dapper don 
he prefers a bathrobe and pajamas to a silk shirt and designer 
suits and wears slippers instead of guccis as he rambles through 
the streets of greenwich village 
but authorities say that gigantes befuddled ways are a dodge 
and that the reputed boss of the genovese crime family is every bit 
as ruthless as the betterknown betterdressed john gotti gigante 
even put a contract out on gotti in 1987 authorities in new jersey 
allege 
gigante who until now had been untouched by a government 
crackdown on the mafia was among 15 people from four mob families 
charged wednesday with monopolizing the installation of windows in 
the citys housing projects since 1978 
the business brought mob companies more than 191 million 
attorney general dick thornburgh said 
andrew maloney us attorney in brooklyn said the cooperative 
effort by the four rival families was an unusual arrangement 
prompted by the profits available gigante mediated disputes 
between the crime families maloney said 
gigantes brother and other family members says hes no don 
hes deranged they maintain gigante is mentally and physically 
unfit to care for himself 
law enforcement officials reject the claim as bogus 
hes crazy like a fox fbi organized crime and narcotics 
chief jules j bonavolonta said last year 
gigante 62 was in his robe and striped sleepwear when he was 
arrested early wednesday and charged with racketeering 
the fbi says the genovese family with 250 members is second 
only to gottis gambino crew in power and influence the family 
maintains a lock on waterfronts and unions in new york and new 
jersey officials say 
gigantes alleged ascent to the top spot followed the 1986 
racketeering conviction of his predecessor anthony fat tony 
salerno his organized crime career began more than three decades 
earlier as a mob hit man the fbi said investigators said his most 
famous job was one he bungled a 1957 hit on mob boss frank 
costello 
this is for you frank gigante allegedly announced before 
firing a shot at costellos head costello was only grazed he 
refused to identify his assailant 
gigante was acquitted costello retired and vito genovese 
assumed control of the family that now carries his name 
investigators say gigante whose nickname apparently came from 
an early boxing career moved up through the ranks of the family 
his climb interrupted by a jail term from 1959 to 1964 on a heroin 
charge 
but since beating a 1970 bribery rap by pleading mental 
incompetence he has avoided prosecution 
authorities attribute gigantes elusiveness to his bizarre 
lifestyle they say most of his conversations with mob colleagues 
are conducted on long walks through greenwich village far from the 
wiretaps that brought down other crime bosses 
gigante is a familiar shuffling presence on the streets of the 
village clad in a robe and mumbling incoherently he strolls from 
his headquarters the triangle social club to a store across the 
street he sits and plays cards 
fbi agents serving gigante with a subpoena several years ago 
found him standing naked in a shower holding an open umbrella 
gigantes brother the rev louis gigante a roman catholic 
priest tried unsuccessfully for years to have his brother declared 
incompetent he claims his brothers frequent visits to a 
sanitarium are evidence of his mental anguish and notes a 
psychiatric report detailing vincents schizophrenia and 
hallucinations 
his mental state is such that he couldnt be the boss of a 
candy store gigante attorney barry slotnick argued earlier this 
year 
federal prosecutors unswayed by such arguments had targeted 
gigante as their no 2 priority behind the thriceacquitted gotti

karlmarxstadt east germany ap karl marx looks awfully 
angry as he stares at a city that no longer practices his 
principles and no longer wants his name 
the imposing twostory bust of socialisms intellectual 
architect rests on a massive block of granite in front of city 
hall staring sternfaced across a main avenue that also sports his 
name 
the area around it is empty of people but nearby streets are 
crawling with commerce hundreds of booths stands and trucks 
loaded with western merchandise fill plazas and malls the 
frontline forces of capitalisms advancing army 
like virtually every other major population center in east 
germany karl marx the city has become karl marx the market one 
of the places to be if you have something to sell 
you can do a lot of business here it is incredible said 
jochen siebke head of marketing for the west german branch of 
citroen the french automaker 
this 825yearold city was known as chemnitz until 1953 when 
the former communist government changed the name in an april 
referendum 76 percent of those voting said the city of 308000 
should be changed back to chemnitz 
the city council has not yet formalized the change however and 
the drab industrial town is known alternately by both names 
highway signs switch back and forth and the government news 
agency adn uses a karlmarxstadtchemnitz dateline on 
stories from the city 
if the city is still somewhat schizophrenic about its name 
there is little doubt about which ideology is prevailing 
furniture is peddled from the backs of trucks and a seemingly 
endless string of booths sell everything from barbie dolls to black 
amp decker tools 
in a plaza models cavort to a michael jackson song and tout a 
line of surf wear the show takes place under a banner that says 
test the west west is a brand of cigarette 
citroen recently parked a dozen of its shiny cars on a dusty 
parking lot in town set up tables under redandwhite parasols and 
blared music and commercials touting its sleek sets of wheels 
the automaker wasnt necessarily looking to sell cars today 
siebke said but after july 2 when the german states merge their 
economies and east germans can convert their money to coveted west 
german marks 
you have to get out here get youre name known siebke 
said its in preparation for the whole economic union 
the cheapest car sells for about 9000 about 1800 more than 
the average east germans annual salary 
about half of the people who come by cannot pay and many work 
in outmoded industries that are likely to face high unemployment 
siebke says 
we dont press people to buy he said 
but he added that many people have large savings accounts 
people have been saving for 20 years but they have had 
nothing to buy he said one man came here and he had a savings 
account book with 500000 east marks in it 
under the conversion system that will be worth about 252000 
west german marks or 152000 after july 2 
prime minister lothar de maiziere has urged east germans to 
refrain from spending their new currency so they will not erode its 
value and cause inflation in both germanys 
but wolfgang hufenbecher director of the west german 
commerzbank and the head of its new east german operation said the 
influx of western products may be too tempting 
you can see that already he said speaking in east berlin 
recently lots of west german companies put out various goods at 
rather high prices but people still buy it there is a lot of 
money around 
he said average east german savings accounts range from the 
equivalents of 3010 to 6020 
last week trabant workers staged a brief strike in the nearby 
city of zwickau to demand protection from the unemployment expected 
as outmoded enterprises try to compete with their inferior products 
it is ironic of course siebke said east germans will 
accelerate the decline of their own industries by buying western 
products

senators padded their incomes by 27 million 
last year by speaking to specialinterest groups but the practice 
seems to be losing some of its appeal 
the total honoraria income for senators in 1989 reported 
wednesday in annual financial disclosures was slightly below the 
levels for the two previous years and the lobbying group common 
cause said that for this year more than onethird of the senate 
34 members up from 19 in 1988 have sworn off keeping speaking 
fees for their personal use 
one member on the common cause list sen rudy boschwitz has 
relapsed after declining in the past to keep honoraria he 
retained 11284 last year saying he was strapped for funds 
because of the cost of maintaining three houses boschwitz 
president of a lumber company has holdings that could be worth 
more than 34 million common cause said he has promised to resume 
his old policy this year 
as usual the top talker was senate minority leader bob dole 
rkan who raked in 108900 senators are not allowed to keep 
more than 40 percent of their salaries in honoraria so dole gave 
all but 35750 to charity 
also big on the speaking circuit were sens alan simpson 
rwyo who collected 90600 orrin hatch rutah with 92499 
and ernest hollings dsc with 73450 majority leader george 
mitchell dmaine took in 50000 
the house which disclosed its finances on tuesday has moved to 
eliminate the practice of accepting honoraria after this year 
common cause president fred wertheimer said the senate should 
follow suit 
it is ludicrous for the senate to have lower ethical standards 
than the house the executive branch and the judiciary he said 
in a statement calling the practice a totally discredited 
system 
otherwise the voluminous disclosure forms highlighted how 
little many senators rely on their taxpayerpaid salaries 
reflected the popularity of travel financed by special interests 
and listed the quirky gifts senators receive from various groups 
sen phil gramm rtexas was given a dog named gus and a pair 
of long underwear dole got 14 neckties among other items and 
sen lloyd bentsen dtexas chairman of the senates taxwriting 
committee accepted a 940 steuben glass bowl from the 
washingtonbased tax foundation 
sen alan dixon dill received eight trips paid for by 
interest groups including four to west palm beach fla near 
where he owns a vacation condominium 
another frequent flier was sen robert kasten rwis who took 
nine trips on the specialinterest tab the forays included moscow 
israel west palm beach and indianapolis on the weekend of the 
indianapolis 500 auto race 
as the disclosures illustrate the senate remains largely a rich 
mens club 
wisconsin freshman democrat herbert kohl owner of the milwaukee 
bucks pro basketball team said he grossed more than 15 million 
from that source alone pushing his 1989 income to 20 million or 
more sen john heinz rpa reported assets that could exceed 17 
million from the family food empire 
sen john danforth rmo whose family founded ralston purina 
disclosed holdings that could be in the 15 million range and the 
assets of sen claiborne pell dri appeared to be worth upwards 
of 8 million 
the disclosure forms require only that assets and income be 
reported in broad ranges so it is impossible to determine net 
worth with any specificity some senators with extensive holdings 
in blind trusts such as hollings and sens edward kennedy 
dmass and john d rockefeller iv dwva are required to 
report only the income they receive from the trusts 
the forms can cause problems sen dave durenberger dminn 
who already is the subject of a senate ethics investigation said 
wednesday he had failed to report a shortterm 484000 loan to buy 
a house and a friends gift of lodging in previous years he filed 
amended disclosures for five years 
his office said the 35 days of lodging had been left out by

listen is one of the suggestions kenneth 
a shaw president of the university of wisconsin system offers to 
fellow college administrators trying to deal with campus racism 
shaws comment is included in a new book on dealing with a 
problem that many contend is becoming more visible at us colleges 
and universities the book the lurking evil racial and ethnic 
conflict on the college campus was unveiled by the american 
association of state colleges and universities during a news 
conference wednesday 
it is clear that this is an issue that is rearing its ugly 
head in a lot of segments of society said anthony f ceddia 
president of shippensburg university in pennsylvania and a 
contributor to the book 
the publication contains 16 articles most of them written by 
college administrators that describe problems with campus racism 
and offer suggestions for dealing with them 
listen listening gives us information about what is important 
to other parties it allows adversaries to relax and focus on 
solutions shaw wrote in the book 
another writer washington lawyer david s tatel suggests that 
administrators use the means most available to them to fight racial 
intolerance on their campuses 
universities should respond by doing wht they do best namely 
education he said 
the schools should avoid implementing written policies that 
punish students for racial slurs and other verbal acts tatel said 
because they could wind up in court defending the rules 
lower federal court rulings he said have said even racial 
slurs are protected speech the supreme court has yet to rule on 
the issue 
schools that believe policies are absolutely necessary should 
draft them as narrowly and as clearly as possible tatel said 
in addition he said universities ought not to write these 
policies from the administration building he said students 
faculty and community representatives should be involved to 
minimize the chances of a court challenge and to demonstrate to 
the courts a deliberate and careful response of the entire 
community 
one way to change student attitudes is by making sure that all 
groups are represented among the faculty and administration said 
ceddia he added however that he would be very cautious about 
using words like portions or quotas or goals 
ceddia said schools can do many things to help students learn to 
deal with those of other races but he warned you cant just 
accomplish reteaching in a two or threeday or weeklong program 
programs need to be ongoing throughout the year

the long and apparently fruitless 
haggling to bring oaklands beloved raiders home from los angeles 
may cost mayor lionel wilson his bid for a fourth term 
the city of about 350000 people has some of the highest crime 
and unemployment rates in the state a deeply troubled school 
system widespread drug abuse budget problems and earthquake 
damage 
but those woes have been overshadowed in the campaign leading to 
tuesdays mayoral election by questions about wilsons handling of 
the raiders deal 
the 75yearold wilson mayor since 1977 had only 18 percent of 
the vote in a may 22 poll in the tribune of oakland leading was 
state assemblyman elihu harris with 32 percent followed by city 
councilman wilson riles jr with 22 percent 
if none of the eight candidates wins more than 50 percent in the 
nonpartisan election the two top votegetters will face off in 
november 
the deal had seemed like a political bonanza when wilson 
announced in march he was bringing back the nfl team that left in 
1982 the city offered raiders owner al davis a 602 million 
package including guaranteed ticket income and upfront payments 
but wilson and the city council had to quash the deal after 
critics charged that the city already strapped with huge expenses 
and with debts from the earthquake would end up paying millions if 
raider games didnt sell out 
city officials have returned to the bargaining table but their 
offer has dwindled to 475 million and it appears unlikely to be 
accepted 
wilsons critics say his handling of the deal shows he has lost 
his common touch 
it exemplified peoples feeling that they are not in control 
of their government said harris who was endorsed wednesday by 
the tribune the city is not accountable to the community 
people are concerned about the kind of time and energy and 
resources that our elected officials have spent trying to 
consummate this deal when we have such other problems said dezie 
woodsjones a candidate who trails far behind the leaders 
wilson did not return repeated phone calls but aide erica 
huggins said the raiders are not a priority in his campaign 
riles an 11year city councilman who finished second in the 
1985 mayoral race and has been one of wilsons staunchest opponents 
on the raiders deal said wilsons handling of the raiders was an 
example of his bumbling handsoff method of administration 
the mayors inattention is at the root of the blight in many of 
oaklands neighborhoods riles charged 
don perata president of the alameda county board of supervisors 
and chief architect of the raiders proposal said the raiders deal 
had given riles an issue to move out on 
take the raiders issue out there wouldnt be a clear issue in 
the campaign itself he said 
the other candidates are leo bazile jr a lawyer and sevenyear 
city councilman hector reyna who runs a recycling business 
philip haymon a teacher and computer programmer and michael 
kinane owner of a trading and consulting firm

the navy has grounded its fleet of twinrotor 
h46 sea knight transport helicopters for the second time this 
month 
the 340 helicopters were ordered not to fly after routine 
maintenance found fractures in the rotorhub connecting links that 
hold the rotor blades to their hub said a pentagon statement 
released wednesday 
there are 259 helicopters in the fleet assigned to the marine 
corps and 81 to the navy 
aircraft will be returned to flight status following 
electronic inspections of the connecting links the statement 
said periodic followup inspections will be implemented to 
identify and remove from service any links which show evidence of 
developing cracks 
the problem with the links is not related to trouble in the 
copters aft transmission that led to a may 13 grounding order the 
statement said 
that transmission problem was discovered after an investigation 
of an h46 accident earlier this month 
seventeen marines were injured at the marine airground training 
center at twentynine palms calif when their helicopter made a 
rough landing during an airassault exercise 
the transmission problem meant that the aircrafts rear rotor 
system could lose its drive power 
the helicopters were to be returned to service after the may 13 
grounding and repair

the federal election commission has accepted a 
2500 fine to settle a complaint charging the 1984 reaganbush 
campaign with violating campaign finance laws according to 
documents 
the campaign agreed to pay the fine as part of a conciliation 
agreement that quells fec allegations that the campaign failed to 
keep records to justify voterregistration and recruitment efforts 
paid for in part with public money 
the fec raised questions about the expenditures during its 
routine audit of the campaign and asked for records detailing the 
voter identification and mobilization efforts 
the campaign committee balked at the request saying many of the 
documents requested by the commission didnt exist in march 1987 
the commission referred the audit to its legal staff for further 
action 
the overall result of the committees failure to produce these 
documents has been that no final audit determination could be made 
regarding the appropriateness of the spending the fecs general 
counsel said in a memo included in the documents made public 
wednesday 
the reaganbush campaign signed the conciliation agreement last 
month the fec released the records wednesday in keeping with its 
practice of making previously confidential investigations public 
within 30 days after the case is closed

the postal service says doonesbury stamps 
protesting the upcoming postage stamp price increase are starting 
to appear in the mail 
cartoonist garry trudeau included a sheet of mock stamps 
featuring zonker harris of the doonesbury comic strip in sunday 
papers may 20 
the stamps carry the legend mad as heck and ticked off 
and show a value of minus5 which the comic strip indicates is 
minus5 cents the stamps were intended to protest the coming 
increase in postal rates from 25 cents to 30 cents 
postal service spokesman lou eberhardt said an empty envelope 
from california bearing two of the stamps arrived at postmaster 
anthony franks office and that a few others have also been 
delivered 
but eberhardt said he did not know how many of the stamps were 
used 
he said many envelopes with the stamps may have ended up in dead 
letter offices although some may have gotten through because of 
the large volume of mail 
eberhardt said frank finds trudeaus work funny and takes the 
stamps in the manner in which they were intended as a protest 
eberhardt said letterwriters should have no problem if they put 
the cartoon stamps in addition to valid 25cent stamps on their 
mail but doonesbury stamps alone are not legal postage

candidate new york republicans nominated pierre rinfret a 
political unknown with deep pockets to challenge gov mario cuomo

at the state gop convention wednesday that hes no sacrificial lamb 
i think were going to take this guy rinfret told the 
convention 
cuomo is expected to announce a bid for for a third fouryear 
term within days considered a potential 1992 democratic 
presidential contender he is generally viewed as a big favorite 
for reelection even by republicans 
in trying to find a candidate to challenge him the state gop 
had been turned down by one bigname republican after another 
including us sen alfonse damato it was only last week that 
party leaders settled on rinfret 
rinfret who has never run for public office admitted he 
doesnt know much about such major issues as closing the shoreham 
nuclear plant on long island and development in the 6 millionacre 
publicprivate adirondack park 
but he promised i will know more than mario cuomo come 
election day 
born in montreal and raised in new york city rinfret heads an 
international economic financial and political intelligence and 
trading firm 
he put his net worth at about 14 million but wouldnt say how 
much of that he was willing to spend to try to unseat cuomo the 
democrat has more than 7 million in his warchest 
rinfret was an unpaid economic counsel to presidents kennedy 
johnson and nixon and chief economic spokesman for nixons 1972 
presidential campaign 
his unorthodox economic policies included calls for tax cuts 
during the nixon years and a ban on credit cards to bring order to 
the economy 
in his acceptance speech to the convention he had delegates 
cheering as he advocated executing drug dealers to get the vermin 
off the streets cuomo has vetoed the death penalty ever year 
since he became governor in 1983 
but rinfret took the same position as cuomo on abortion im 
prochoice period he said a few delegates jeered 
the convention opened tuesday with the adoption of an 
abortionrights platform plank putting the new york gop at odds 
with the national party and president bush 
the states conservative party which usually agrees on a 
candidate with the gop split with the republicans over abortion 
this weekend the conservatives plan to nominate 51yearold new 
york university professor herbert london 
the split is expected to divide the anticuomo vote and make the 
governors reelection even more likely 
cuomo has presided over two consecutive years of 1 billionplus 
tax increases made necessary by budget deficits and economic 
problems in new york

in october 1957 a beeping sphere streaked across 
the sky striking terror in the hearts of unsuspecting americans 
sputnik i the first artificial satellite had been launched by the 
russians 
for the next decade american schoolchildren were inundated with 
lessons on the space program all intimating that if the united 
states lost the space race and the soviets landed first on the 
moon the free world was doomed 
today those children can bring their children to see and touch 
the technology that once seemed so terrifying a fullsize replica 
of sputnik hangs in an exhibit opening friday at bostons museum of 
science 
soviet space is the first major us exhibit of soviet space 
technology it tears down yet another wall between east and west 
the exhibit represents a new age in space said dana wilson 
the museum official who helped organize the show the new space 
age is cooperative 
visitors through sept 23 can see working models of probes sent 
to mars and venus a soyuz space capsule soviet spacesuits a 
returned moon probe even soviet space food theres a fetching 
portrait of laika the first dog in space 
cosmonauts valentin lebedev and aleksei leonov the first man to 
walk in space will visit during the opening week and artifacts 
and history once shrouded in secrecy will be available for 
comparison to the us program 
the exhibit brings to light soviet failures along with 
successes included is a fullsize model of the phobos probe to 
mars an incorrect radio command caused phobos i to lose contact 
with earth in 1988 about six weeks after launch phobos 2 orbited 
mars in 1989 gathering data for two months until it too was lost 
to create the exhibit wilson and j kelly beatty who covers 
the soviet space program for the magazine sky and telescope made 
two trips to the soviet union all doors were opened to them 
wilson said including those of a rocket factory 
the feeling now is cooperation wilson said no one 
country can afford to have its own space program space belongs to 
all of us you hear that over and over 
despite the alarm caused by sputnik and by cosmonaut yuri 
gagarins becoming the first human in space in 1961 the 
superpowers have long collaborated on space including the 
soyuzapollo mission of 1975 
today soviet and american scientists are cooperating on 
unmanned travel to mars and hope some day to send a manned mission 
to the planet 
although americans won the race to the moon the soviets 
have racked up a long list of firsts including the first human in 
space the first spacewalk and the first woman in space valentina 
vladinirovna 1963 beatty noted 
most impressive is their work in conditioning cosmonauts to long 
space stints something necessary for flights to mars or other 
planets beatty said 
on dec 21 1988 vladimir titov and musa manarov returned to 
earth exactly one year after they were launched into space the 
mission provided scientists with extensive data on the effects of 
prolonged weightlessness

leaders of minor parties say theyre 
satisfied with their isolated victories in local elections even 
though unofficial results showed overwhelming support for 
solidarity nationwide 
candidates from solidaritybacked citizens committees had a 
commanding lead in sundays elections for local councils partial 
returns showed 
solidarity made an especially strong showing in large cities 
where the citizens committees are better organized than in the 
countryside 
it won 59 of 60 seats in the baltic port of gdansk where the 
union was founded a decade ago 72 of 75 seats in the city of 
krakow and 301 of 345 in warsaw according to unofficial returns 
published wednesday in the gazeta wyborcza daily 
official results for the 52000 individual races in more than 
2000 councils were delayed because of slow reporting from some 
outlying areas 
among the 80 other parties and groups that fielded candidates 
were the social democrats the party formed in january as main 
successor to the nowdissolved communist party various peasants 
parties and the anticommunist confederation for an independent 
poland 
the social democrats appeared to have scored only marginal 
success the party won two seats in the cities of kielce and 
czestochowa six in lodz and 15 in warsaw 
the small confederation for an independent poland a staunch 
anticommunist group that has been politically active for a decade 
won six seats in the city of lublin one in katowice and three in 
krakow but leszek moczulski the leader of the group lost his 
race in warsaw 
solidaritys landslide victory last june in races for all but 
one of the parliamentary seats it was allowed to contest broke the 
communist partys monopoly on power and led to the formation of the 
first noncommunist government in the east bloc three months later 
the aim of the latest elections was to establish independent 
local councils during four decades of communist rule the local 
councils were dependent financially and politically on central 
authorities 
turnout in what amounted to the countrys first fully free 
elections since world war ii was only 42 percent with a large 
number of parties as well as splits in solidarity cited as reasons 
for ignoring the polls

the newyork historical society hopes to unravel 
a centuriesold art enigma who was that guy in the blue dress 
since 1952 the society has proudly displayed a portrait said to 
be of viscount cornbury royal governor of the colonies of new york 
and new jersey from 1702 to 1708 
reflecting lord cornburys reputed preference for womens 
clothing the subject of the portrait is decked out in a 
jeweladorned dress and a lace head covering 
patricia u bonomi new york university history professor used 
to accept historical depictions of lord cornbury as a crossdresser 
but recently while writing cornburys biography she concluded 
that the anonymous undated portrait is not of him she also 
believes his political opponents launched a 200yearold legend by 
lying about his alleged proclivities 
philip davenporthines a fellow of the royal historical society 
in england pronounced bonomis findings inconclusive he said he 
still thinks the portrait accurately depicts cornbury 
this summer a graduate student from columbia university will 
research the painting for the newyork historical society said 
annette blaugrund senior curator the society also hopes to 
consult bonomi 
i think there were questions all the way down the line about 
the history of the painting said blaugrund 
the historical society bought it from a british family named 
pakington which kept the work on its estate 
its not clear when it was painted but bonomi determined the 
work was first alleged in 1796 to depict lord cornbury who died in 
1723 after inheriting the higher title of earl of clarendon 
i believe it was done as a serious portrait it was not meant 
to be kinky said blaugrund when you look at it theres 
nothing very sexy about this picture 
a label that was on the frame when it arrived at the societys 
museum identifies the subject as lord cornbury halfwitted son 
of henry lord of clarendon 
the viscount was said to receive colonists dressed up in 
complete female court costume because truly he represented the 
person of a female sovereign his cousin german queen anne 
according to the label 
the portrait and label remain prominently displayed in the 
museum in new york city 
how do visitors react some of them stop and giggle a lot of 
them just pass it by as being one of our large group of colonial 
paintings said blaugrund 
after all a lot of these paintings have both women and men 
seemingly with 5 oclock shadows thats a matter of painting 
technique the undercoats coming through what time does to a 
certain painting she said and there were some pretty hefty 
women in their day 
blaugrund said that in the case of this painting its pretty 
clearly a man he has a mans facial features a bigger nose 
more jowly

china has detonated a nuclear device 
with at least twice the destructive force of the bomb dropped on 
hiroshima its first nuclear weapons test in nearly two years 
swedish monitors reported 
seismic signals indicated the explosion occurred at the lop nor 
test site in the far western province of xinjiang nilsolov 
bergqvist of the swedish defense research establishment at the 
hagfors observatory said wednesday 
the last chinese test was sept 29 1988 when beijing tested a 
low magnitude bomb of less than 10 kilotons bergqvist said by 
telephone 
the seismic indicators detected saturday registered 58 on the 
richter scale and indicated a bomb with a yield of 40 to 50 
kilotons according to the governmentrun observatory 
one kiloton has the explosive force of 1000 tons of tnt the 
bomb dropped on hiroshima japan during world war ii had an 
explosive force of 20 kilotons 
the chinese have conducted only four tests since 1984 
apparently restrained by the high cost of building and exploding a 
nuclear bomb 
china which set off its first atmospheric explosion in 1964 is 
the only nuclear nation that makes no announcements about its 
tests little is known about its nuclear capabilities 
it was only the second test this year of a nuclear weapon 
following an explosion at the us test site in nevada on march 10 
last year 27 tests were carried out around the world including 11 
by the united states and seven by the soviet union 
china insists that its nuclear weapons are solely for 
selfdefense and will never be used to strike first its nuclear 
arsenal is believed to include a halfdozen intercontinental 
ballistic missiles and more than 100 mediumrange ballistic 
missiles

boris n yeltsin newly elected president of the 
russian republic earned his reputation as a radical reformer by 
criticizing the slow pace of reform under mikhail s gorbachev 
following are some of the points on which they differ 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
gorbachev believes the soviet union was right to choose the 
socialist road 72 years ago and that perestroika should merely 
breathe new life into socialism 
yeltsin backed private ownership in his campaign speech and 
never mentioned socialism prompting gorbachev to brand him 
antisocialist 
 
gorbachev refuses to redraw any of the soviet unions internal 
boundaries for fear of unleashing chaos 
yeltsin urges a commission to examine the internal boundaries 
of the russian federation which contains some two dozen autonomous 
regions with an eye to reexamining the boundaries and creating 
new regions 
 
gorbachev has ruled out whittling the soviet army down to a 
small professional corps 
yeltsin says the army must go professional 
 
gorbachev has overseen some reform in the kgb 
yeltsin urges the kgb be merged with the interior ministry in 
one investigative body 
 
gorbachev has been reluctant to take out major foreign loans to 
try to cure the economy 
yeltsin proposes taking out foreign loans and pulling in a 
percent of the governments foreign currency income to gather 20 
billion rubles and direct them mainly toward buying scarce consumer 
products 
 
gorbachev backs government plan to raise prices and introduce a 
fiveyear plan to shift to a partial market economy 
yeltsin says government plan is based on lowering the 
alreadylow soviet standard of living and the shift to a market 
economy can be faster and less painful by changing property laws 
freeing enterprises and taking out foreign loans 
 
gorbachev imposed a partial economic blockade on lithuania 
yeltsin says russia should strike deals with lithuania and 
other regions that want to sign direct contracts with lithuania 
without going through moscow 
 
gorbachev backs the government plan of a maximum tax of 55 
percent on profits 
yeltsin says the maximum should be 35 percent

abul abbas who claimed responsibility 
for the latest palestinian guerrilla attack on the israeli 
coastline also masterminded the 1985 hijacking of the achille 
lauro italian cruise liner 
the stocky abul abbas heads a faction called the palestine 
liberation front that has launched guerrilla attacks for 14 years 
his group is loyal to palestine liberation organization leader 
yasser arafat 
abbas is a longtime supporter of the armed struggle to establish 
a palestinian state his faction is said to number no more than a 
few hundred 
abbas guerrillas shot to death wheelchairbound american leon 
klinghoffer 69 during the 52hour achille lauro hijack that began 
oct 7 1985 they tossed his body overboard 
abul abbas the nom de guerre of mohammed abbas said the 
guerrillas had intended to travel to israel aboard the liner and 
launch terrorist attacks there but the plan was scrapped when 
their weapons were discovered 
after the passengers were released the us justice department 
issued an arrest warrant for abbas charging him with piracy 
hostagetaking and conspiracy to commit both crimes 
us warplanes diverted an egyptian plane carrying abbas to 
sicily but italian authorities allowed abbas to leave for 
yugoslavia before the warrant could be served 
abbas now 42 was one of three palestinians tried in absentia 
in genoa in 1986 for the achille lauro crime he was convicted and 
sentenced to life in prison while the others received lesser 
prison terms 
after he was convicted the united states withdrew its arrest 
warrant saying that since abbas had been tried in an italian 
court a us conviction was not important 
in 1981 his group launched the first air infiltration attempts 
from south lebanon into israel a front guerrilla flew a motorized 
hang glider into northern israel in a failed attempt to bomb an oil 
refinery 
later that year another front squad flew a hotair balloon into 
israel but israelis said troops spotted the aircraft and shot it 
down 
since then there have been recurrent clashes between the 
groups fighters and israeli troops both inside israels socalled 
security zone in south lebanon and northern israel

frightened residents of this jungle town 
spent their second night in the streets after earthquakeprone 
perus deadliest temblor in two decades killed at least 115 people 
and injured hundreds more 
hundreds of people crowded into riojas central plaza afraid to 
enter their damaged homes many lay inside tents or beneath 
umbrellas while others crowded around smoky cooking fires in the 
jungle twilight 
more than 800 people were injured and at least 40 missing after 
the earthquake which registered 62 on the richter scale rocked 
northern peru late tuesday night civil defense authorities said 
the damage was centered around moyobamba a farming center of 
50000 and the capital of san martin department 400 miles north of 
lima officials said rioja is 15 miles west of moyobamba 
most of the confirmed deaths occurred in soritor a small town 
six miles south of moyobamba that was nearly flattened by the quake 
at least 23 people were killed in the town including a family 
of 15 living in a twostory house that collapsed the other dead 
were from nearby villages such as rioja a colonial town where 
eight people were killed 
it was very ugly said flor de maria masaboya of rioja 
holding her yearold son in her arms we were almost knocked off 
our feet by the shaking 
all of us slept in the streets but we were afraid to take out 
our beds because we might be trapped by another tremor said 
masaboya pointing to a threeinchwide crack in her adobewalled 
home 
another resident of rioja juan soplin ruiz said all the 
homes are cracked and everyone fears the walls may collapse 
soplin said the town has received no emergency aid from the 
government some residents were going hungry rather than enter 
their damaged homes he said 
many people had begun to return to their redtileroofed houses 
wednesday morning soplin said a strong aftershock at midday 
however sent them fleeing back into the streets he said 
according to the peruvian geophysical institute the aftershock 
one of 45 during the day registered 55 on the richter scale 
the main quake occurred at 933 pm tuesday and lasted 45 
seconds it was centered in the jungle 75 miles northeast of 
moyobamba the geophysical institute said 
authorities declared a state of emergency in battered san martin 
province which had almost no communications with the rest of peru 
the area also had no water or electricity 
local police reports reaching lima by radio wednesday said 
several villages around moyobamba were 60 to 80 percent destroyed 
gen jorge ferreyro perus civil defense chief said the area 
had few doctors and authorities there were asking the government to 
send doctors medicines and generators 
health minister paul caro gamarra said an air force plane left 
for moyobamba wednesday afternoon carrying a team of 10 doctors and 
emergency supplies two more planes filled with rescue supplies 
were to leave today 
health department workers have been on a nationwide strike for 
two months but a union official in lima said wednesday that 
workers were helping with emergency plans 
patricia vargas llosa the wife of presidential candidate mario 
vargas llosa visited the area on wednesday accompanied by former 
president fernando belaunde terry 
the people there are terrorized because the ground is still 
shaking said mrs vargas llosa on her return to lima she said 
many people were being treated in tent hospitals for fractures and 
other injuries 
belaunde terry said the worst damage appeared to be in soritor 
and the nearby town of porvenir 
the temblor came two days before the 20th anniversary of a 
devastating earthquake that killed 70000 people in the northern 
andes mountains 
that quake the most deadly natural disaster ever recorded in 
the western hemisphere registered 77 on the richter scale an 
estimated 20000 people in the city of yungay were killed that day 
buried in mud and ice that came crashing down from a nearby 
mountain 
the richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an 
earthquake as measured by the ground motion recorded on a 
seismograph a quake of a magnitude of 5 can cause considerable 
damage

scientists said today they have made a 
breakthrough that will let them accurately estimate the ages of 
fossils up to 30000 years old compared with the old limit of 
about 9000 years 
the gain in the technique known as radiocarbon dating has 
already paid off by corroborating a theory on how variations in 
earths orbit affected ancient glaciers and it could help research 
into climate and other topics scientists said 
the new work can correct the techniques tendency to 
underestimate ages by up to 3500 years researchers from columbia 
universitys lamontdoherty geological observatory in palisades 
ny wrote in the british journal nature 
scientists have long sought ways to make radiocarbon dating 
accurate for older objects and the new work seems to have 
succeeded said harry gove of the university of rochester 
coinventor of one radiocarbon dating technique 
another expert paul damon of the university of arizona said 
my guess is it will have a significant effect on the estimated 
timing of past events in such areas as longterm variations in 
climate 
but eric delson an anthropology professor at lehman college of 
the city university of new york said he doubted the development 
would make much difference in studies of human history it would 
simply adjust dates of many events in the same direction without 
affecting the more important issue of the order in which they 
occurred he said 
the 30000year time period covered by the study included the 
spread of humans to the new world and cave painting in europe he 
said 
radiocarbon dating is based on the fact that all living things 
absorb a type of carbon called carbon14 at death the absorption 
stops and the amount trapped within the living thing begins to 
decay at a constant rate 
scientists can date an object by comparing the amount of 
carbon14 in it today to the amount it had presumably absorbed from 
the atmosphere while it was alive 
the problem is that concentrations of carbon14 in the 
atmosphere vary unpredictably over time 
scientists have solved the problem for objects younger than 
about 9000 years using calculations based on ancient tree rings 
of known ages but no reliable tree ring data is available for 
objects older than that 
in the new work the researchers dated coral samples with both 
carbon14 dating and a second method which depends on the constant 
radioactive transformation of uranium234 into thorium230 the 
second method like the tree rings provided an independent measure 
for calibrating the carbon14 data 
the work was done by researchers edouard bard bruno hamelin 
richard fairbanks and alan zindler 
in a telephone interview zindler said the newfound accuracy 
cleared up an inconsistency in a climate theory 
scientists had theorized that subtle changes in earths orbit 
affected growth and melting of glaciers by changing the amount of 
solar energy reaching the surface he said but previous carbon14 
dating of ancient coral clashed with that theory by suggesting the 
last peak of glaciation was about 18000 years ago he said 
the corrected date from the new study was 21500 years ago 
which fits with that theory very well zindler said

four of new yorks mafia families used their 
combined muscle to assume neartotal control over installation of 
windows in city housing projects prosecutors alleged in announcing 
the indictment of 15 people 
among those charged were the reputed bosses of the genovese and 
lucchese crime families 
todays indictment closes the cash window on this lucrative 
enterprise us attorney general dick thornburgh said at a news 
conference wednesday 
since 1978 more than 75 percent of the window contracts awarded 
by the citys housing authority totaling more than 191 million 
went to companies controlled by the criminal enterprise thornburgh 
said 
payments of up to 2 per window for about 1 million windows were 
funneled to the lucchese family prosecutors said 
the scheme made even higher profits by illegally using nonunion 
labor and by employing intimidation and threats of labor unrest to 
keep legitimate contractors from making lower bids on the window 
contracts prosecutors said 
the scam cost taxpayers tens of millions of dollars said 
assistant us attorney gregory oconnell 
andrew maloney the us attorney in brooklyn said the four 
normally rival crime families cooperated because of the profits to 
be made 
most if not all of the companies bidding on new york city 
housing contracts were mobowned or mobcontrolled maloney said 
the indictment charges the defendants with labor racketeering 
labor payoffs extortion mail fraud and conspiracy 
if convicted the defendants could spend the rest of their lives 
in jail 
vincent the chin gigante the 62yearold alleged boss of 
the genovese family and vittorio amuso reputed head of the 
lucchese family were among those indicted gigante was said have 
mediated disputes among the families 
gigante who often walks the streets in his pajamas and mumbles 
to himself denies he is a mobster and claims to be mentally ill 
on wednesday he refused to get dressed when agents arrested him 
he appeared in court in a hooded bathrobe 
also named were benedetto aloi an alleged underboss in the 
colombo crime family and peter gotti brother of reputed gambino 
boss john gotti john gotti who was acquitted the last three times 
he was tried was not named 
gigantes lawyer barry slotnick entered an innocent plea for 
him and said he was mentally incompetent and has severe heart 
problems any stress could cause sudden death slotnick said 
assistant us attorney charles e rose said prosecutors 
believed gigantes behavior is an act 
us magistrate john l caden ordered gigante held in a 
psychiatric ward pending a hearing four other defendants were 
ordered held without bail gotti and five others were free on 1 
million bail three others were being sought

the contra rebels have agreed to 
disarm by june 10 after reaching accords with the government that 
give them zones for settlement their own police force and a voice 
in government 
according to the agreement signed wednesday some contra 
commanders could be sent to nicaraguan embassies abroad for their 
safety a government source said 
top contra leader israel galeano said he was taking 
responsibility to complete the disarmament of his 13000member 
force by june 10 a deadline set in an earlier accord signed may 4 
with the government of president violeta barrios de chamorro 
mrs chamorro announcing the accord said what we want as 
nicaraguans is peace and reconciliation 
the president who defeated the longruling leftist sandinistas 
in elections feb 25 and took office two months later said she was 
satisfied that the misunderstandings that led the usbacked 
contras to suspend disarmament for a time had been overcome 
the latest accord which spells out the aid to be given 
demobilized rebels says former combatants will form a police force 
to ensure public order within regional development centers where 
they may settle 
the government will ask the united nations to expand the mandate 
of its peacekeeping forces to include instructing the contras in 
the creation of a professional police force which will be under 
the interior ministry 
its like the formation of a state within a state and its 
very dangerous because nicaragua could become another lebanon 
said reynaldo antonio tefel a sandinista deputy in the national 
assembly 
it would be forming another army disguised as a police in 
this manner instead of distancing ourselves from war wed be 
getting closer to it tefel added 
galeano who goes by commander franklin sent a commission to 
managua last week to talk about resuming the demobilization that 
began may 8 
the commission last friday accused the army under sandinista 
control of slaughtering 14 demobilized fighters and 100 civilians 
they halted the disarmament saying they had no security 
investigators including representatives of the contras 
government and international organizations found no evidence of 
the killings 
galeano said there would be no more suspensions of the 
dismantling process we are assuming the responsibility he 
said 
a top government source speaking on condition of anonymity 
told the associated press the government offered top contra 
commanders diplomatic posts abroad for their own security 
those who dont feel safe here can go to one of our missions 
and stay away for a year or so and come back when they feel 
safe the source said 
the source said the posts offered would be as lowlevel 
diplomats he said the only purpose would be to afford contra 
commanders some protection and keep them out of nicaragua 
the contras agreed to demobilize at least 100 rebels daily in 
each of the five security zones where the guerrillas are massed 
but if the deadline is to be met the number of rebels disarming 
would have to be at least 200 per day in each zone 
so far fewer than 2000 rebels have turned in their weapons to 
united nations and organization of american states peace missions 
supervising the demobilization process 
galeano said the establishment of regional development centers 
where demobilized combatants can settle was important in resuming 
the disbanding 
both sides announced tuesday an agreement establishing more than 
20 regional development centers in rural areas 
under the accord demobilized rebels who are largely peasants 
would be given priority in recovering their farmland confiscated by 
the sandinistas 
they also will be guaranteed representation in municipal 
governments of towns within the development centers as well as in 
government ministries that will have to deal with helping them 
rejoin civilian life

airfields 
in a unanimous vote the 15member city council on wednesday 
ordered an ordinance drafted barring the helicopters from los 
angeles airports choppers in past months have been spraying 
malathion to kill the cropdevouring medfly 
the ordinance should be ready by tuesday said greg nelson 
spokesman for councilman joel wachs 
courts thus far have rejected lawsuits from southern california 
municipalities trying to block the stateordered spraying 
opponents contend not enough is known about malathions 
longterm health effects state officials say the pesticide is safe 
officials sprayed garden grove on wednesday but it was to be 
the last city sprayed unless new flies are found officials are 
trying to supplant the spraying with the use of sterile flies 
which disrupt the medfly breeding cycle 
meanwhile us agriculture department officials in washington 
on wednesday declined a request from florida officials to 
quarantine all california produce more than 1300 square miles in 
california already are quarantined 
a total quarantine would have been disastrous for californias

mikhail gorbachevs meeting with south 
koreas president in san francisco next week could eventually lead 
to diplomatic relations between the two nations and unification of 
korea a scholar says 
i dont expect any particularly shattering development right 
away but its a first step of great symbolic importance 
lawrence lau stanford university professor in asian economics 
said wednesday 
i wouldnt be surprised if diplomatic relations are 
established out of this 
the soviet leader who begins four days of talks today with 
president bush will meet with south korean president roh taewoo 
on monday during gorbachevs 21hour stay here said us officials 
speaking on condition of anonymity 
better relations between moscow and seoul for more than 40 
years a prous foe of sovietbacked north korea would help the 
soviets by giving them a cheap close source of consumer goods and 
a market for natural resources lau said 
from the soviet point of view south korea also is in a 
position to help north korea lau said unification is pretty 
far up the road but the north koreans need help and their 
principal supporter the soviet union is no longer in a position 
to support them 
youn ja shinchey a leader of the korean center in san 
francisco and a russian scholar said the 100000strong korean 
community in the bay area was surprised and thrilled by the meeting 
there are maybe 60 million koreans all over the world and if 
you asked any korean what is your one wish the answer would be 
the unification of north and south youn said 
korea was divided at the 38th parallel into soviet and us 
zones of occupation after world war ii north korean forces invaded 
south korea prompting the korean war from 1950 to 1953 the 
peninsula since has remained two independent nations 
the nations have no formal diplomatic relations and the soviets 
maintain strong ties with north korea 
in december the soviet union and south korea opened consular 
departments in their trade offices in each others capitals but 
officials working there do not have normal diplomatic privileges

the chinese government has executed 20 people 
including a man convicted of destroying an air force jeep during 
last junes prodemocracy uprising chinese newspapers reported 
sundays edition of the official sichuan daily seen in beijing 
today said courts in the capital of sichuan province last week 
sentenced nine people to die including convicted arsonist yu 
yongchuan all were immediately executed 
the newspaper said yu led others in overturning a jeep and 
setting it on fire during rioting that broke out in the capital 
chengdu on june 5 the day after the bloody military suppression 
of the prodemocracy movement in beijing 
the official press has reported the executions of at least 20 
participants in antigovernment disturbances last june although 
the number of actual executions is believed to be substantially 
higher 
yu is the first reported case since a beijing court last 
december sentenced two men to die for killing a policeman on june 4 
the official beijing daily also reported today that a local 
court ordered the execution of 11 criminals the day before the 
court cited the need to ensure social stability for the asian games 
to be staged in beijing in september 
the condemned convicted of murder robbery rape and 
hooliganism were immediately taken to an execution grounds and 
shot to death the daily said 
beijing municipal intermediate peoples court chief ji shuhan 
in handing down the verdict said the city must severely attack 
criminal elements to ensure the security of the asian games and 
october 1 national day the beijing daily said 
the sichuan and beijing trials followed another mass execution 
in zhengzhou central china on saturday when 11 train robbers 
were put to death 
china does not release capital punishment figures and many 
executions go unreported in the official press 
however recently the press has carried numerous reports of 
death sentences and condemned men have been paraded before mass 
rallies to emphasize the governments tough stance toward crime

turned hostile when vietnam invaded cambodia in late 1978 and drove 
the chinesebacked khmer rouge from power

to punish hanoi since then china has been the main military 
supporter of the khmer rouge and other resistance forces battling

surgeons today said they have found a way to 
forestall a usually fatal birth defect by opening up the mother 
operating on the fetus and putting it back in the womb to develop 
normally 
experts say the operation which involves rearranging the 
fetuss organs is the most extensive fetal operation ever 
successfully performed however it is also controversial because 
of the risks to both the mother and fetus 
the first successful operation was performed on blake schultz 
now 9 months old the son of elizabeth and richard schultz of 
waterloo mich im just glad hes healthy and hopefully it will 
help other people too ms schultz said 
the surgery was pioneered at the university of california san 
francisco to correct fetal diaphragmatic hernia a defect that 
occurs in about one of every 2000 babies about threequarters of 
all babies with the defect die 
during development a hole in the fetuss diaphragm fails to 
grow shut and the stomach intestines and other organs squeeze 
into the chest cavity as a result the lungs fail to develop and 
the baby is born unable to breath 
this problem is immensely frustrating for pediatric surgeons 
because the babies are otherwise perfectly nice but they die 
said dr michael r harrison who developed the surgery it 
seemed as though this was one of those situations in medicine where 
fixing it earlier would be the only way to have an impact 
harrison has performed the highly experimental surgery eight 
times the first six fetuses died but the last two went on to 
become healthy children blake schultz and a girl a report on the 
first success was published in todays new england journal of 
medicine 
during the surgery doctors cut into ms schultzs uterus and 
pulled the fetuss arm through the hole 
then they put the misplaced stomach intestines and other organs 
back where they belonged and covered the hole in the diaphragm with 
a goretex patch finally they tucked the fetuss arm back into the 
womb and closed up the incision 
ms schultz carried the fetus for seven more weeks before giving 
birth the baby was premature and had to spend a month on a 
respirator but is now healthy 
the second successful operation was performed march 3 on devona 
anderson of tacoma wash now 6 weeks old she did better and was 
able to breathe on her own on her second day of life 
her father stephen anderson said he and his wife lora were 
devastated when they learned the fetus had only a 25 percent chance 
of survival if born with the defect the more we thought the 
more we thought lets do it he said 
the operation takes just under an hour and costs about 16000 
at the university of manitoba dr frank manning said a major 
difficulty is separating those fetuses that will survive without 
surgery from those that are doomed since the operation itself is 
highly dangerous to the fetus 
he also noted that women who undergo the surgery risk a ruptured 
uterus if they get pregnant again 
i dont want to pour on cold water because this is an 
innovative thing he has done said manning but i cant give 
you unbridled enthusiasm and tell you this will be the panacea for 
diaphragmatic hernia 
the disease he is attacking is a very big problem in 
pediatrics said dr joseph p vacanti of childrens hospital in 
boston it is an important approach that ought to continue to be 
investigated 
doctors have experimented for the past decade with treating and 
repairing defective fetuses before birth most such operations have 
been relatively minor however among the most common is opening up 
urinary blockages 
harrison said he worked on the latest procedure for about 12 
years his team tested it on 1000 fetal lambs and 200 fetal 
monkeys and reviewed 200 fetuses in which the disorder was not 
treated before birth

president bush is welcoming mikhail s 
gorbachev to the white house today for summit talks marked by hopes 
for a strategic arms control agreement but sharp differences over 
the shape of a united germany in the postcold war era 
as soviet and american flags waved sidebyside along 
pennsylvania avenue bush and the soviet president headed for their 
first negotiating session in four days of summitry at the white 
house and camp david md 
a few hours before ritual welcoming ceremonies on the white 
house south lawn secretary of state james a baker iii held out 
the prospect of significant and concrete progress on arms 
control at the summit the first since bush and gorbachev met six 
months ago at malta 
baker interviewed on abcs good morning america saw 
encouraging signs of a dialogue on lithuanian independence an 
issue that has left plans for a sovietamerican trade agreement in 
limbo 
but baker cautioned that neither lithuania nor the german issue 
is likely to be resolved at the summit 
on his arrival from canada late wednesday gorbachev declared 
that the summit stands out in its importance first of all for 
the promise it holds as the first major step to reduce strategic 
nuclear arms 
white house chief of staff john sununu like baker sought to 
discourage speculation of major breakthroughs at the summit 
i dont think it ought to be measured in terms of what gets 
signed and what doesnt get signed but how it develops the 
relationship sununu said on nbcs today show 
treaties and lesser agreements covering arms control chemical 
weapons air travel and other subjects were in various stages of 
readiness but the list of differences ran to conventional weapons 
cutbacks trade human rights gorbachevs handling of the 
secessionist republic of lithuania and germany 
whatever the diplomatic prospects washington was eagerly 
awaiting its springtime summit 
oversized american and soviet flags hung side by side over the 
entrance to the federal office building next door to the white 
house old glory on the left and the hammer and sickle on the 
right 
in the elegance of the white house waiters were setting out the 
china for the state dinner on the first evenings schedule across 
the street at lafayette square authorities doled out space to 
competing protest groups and assigned undercover officers to keep 
an eye on things 
for his part gorbachev moved about town in a motorcade that 
stretched for more than 50 vehicles 
even as gorbachev arrived came a fresh reminder of his 
difficulty at home newly elected russian president boris n 
yeltsin said he would press for swift sovereignty for his republic 
the largest and most influential one in the soviet union

the soviet leader made no mention of germany when he arrived at 
andrews air force base although he said earlier in the day in 
canada the united states and its allies were trying to dictate 
the terms of the merger between east germany and west germany 
this will not suit us he said 
baker referred to germany when he welcomed the soviet leader to 
america 
the challenge of the summit he said was to leave behind not 
only the cold war but also the conflicts that preceded it to do 
that we must see a germany unified and europe reconciled 
soviet commentator georgi arbatov also interviewed on nbctv 
said today that nato represents an antisoviet military bloc 
that cannot last europe needs a totally new organization he 
said you cannot bring cold war structures into a postcold war 
world 
soviet foreign ministry adviser vitaly churkin said on abctv 
that were flexible on the german issue and that us officials 
were showing signs of creative movement 
the two leaders are expected to sign a declaration of basic 
agreements on cuts in long range nuclear weapons with a 
longsought treaty hopefully to follow by the end of the year the 
goal is to reduce arsenals of nuclear missiles bombers and 
submarines by 30 to 35 percent 
a formal signing ceremony was scheduled for friday agreements 
ranging from chemical weapons to air travel were ready for 
signatures as well 
talks on proposed cuts in troops and conventional weapons were 
on the agenda as well but progress there seemed to hinge on the 
outcome of what shaped up as the thorniest issue of the summit 
the white house said bush was sympathetic to soviet concerns 
about the military might of a reunified germany and added it would 
pursue an answer that was politically acceptable and reasonable 
privately us officials said bush would cut no deal at the 
summit to limit german troops but he is prepared to discuss a 
formula that might eventually scale down those forces along with 
the red army 
bush has insisted that a unified germany remain within the nato 
alliance gorbachev has proposed that it be a member of both nato 
and the warsaw pact or that both military alliances be disbanded 
west germany has been in nato east germany has long been in the 
sovietsponsored warsaw pact but its alignment is uncertain 
following the fall of the communist government there last year 
before leaving canada for washington gorbachev challenged bush 
to offer another solution to the german question 
it seems that it is just like an old record that seems to be 
playing the same note again and again i would like us to find 
a new melody the soviet leader said

welcome visitor from the land of glasnost to 
the land of huckster behold mikhail sergeyevich gorbachev free 
enterprise at work 
while the news pages of the nations newspapers are filled with 
accounts of your visit it is on the advertising pages where 
brotherly feelings hold sway 
who can resist the message of warmth and good fellowship in the 
fullpage advertisement dominated by a steaming cup of coffee and 
this message across the top we hope this is the only thing that 
comes between mikhail gorbachev and george bush this week 
if you are wise in the ways of advertising mikhail sergeyevich 
you will search for the hook there it is at the bottom 
discreetly chock full onuts corporation it says the firm 
mr president makes coffee 
we turn the pages to see two drink glasses each half full with 
the american stars and stripes and the soviet hammer and sickle 
decorating the stirrers 
sometimes the best relationships start on the rocks is the 
message and below in smaller print it continues tomorrow the 
superpowers begin yet another historic summit stolichnaya the 
import that broke the ice in 1972 hopes their discussions go as 
smoothly as their toasts 
there are two metaphors at play here and you have to know the 
idiom to get the point on the rocks is a mariners term for 
running his ship aground in this case it refers to past 
ussoviet difficulties 
on the rocks has a second connotation it refers to straight 
booze over ice the advertisement placed by stolichnaya the 
russian vodka combines the two ideas 
thats not all thats combined stolichnaya is exported to this 
country by pepsico which is allowed in turn to sell pepsi cola in 
the soviet union 
let us move on to a less subtle advertising presentation also a 
full page 
in three rows of three each it shows battleships helicopters 
tanks fighter planes submarines missiles trucks with missiles 
and soldiers with guns at the ready each set of the figures is 
covered with a big red x as if to indicate the summit had done 
away with their threats 
the ninth panel is left unscathed as if it were all that 
remains after the tools of war had been done away with it shows 
nine bottles of smirnoff vodka and this legend across the bottom 
now thats what we call a successful summit in smaller 
type the ad mentions that first the russians welcomed smirnoff 
back in the ussr after 73 years next who knows with a start like 
that anything is possible 
in case the news media missed their ad stolichnaya followed 
with a personally delivered statement to say that five cases of 
their premium product were delivered to the white house for 
fridays state dinner there was also something about a drink 
called the glasnost mary being served using guesswhose vodka 
just because these samplings are about beverages mr president 
doesnt mean that their makers are the only ones to do shall we 
say business as usual at this propitious time 
the smith corona corporation maker of office machines boasts 
that your delegation mr president will use smith coronas 
personal word processor and electronic portable typewriter products 
this summit week with cyrillic alphabet yet 
the firm pointed out that it is selling its products through 
vneshtorgizdat in case you want to get one at home

attorneys for a condemned murderer 
argue in an appeal that the last man florida sent to the electric 
chair was tortured in a botched execution that the state is not 
investigating properly 
an inmate about to be executed in florida will likely be 
burned and tortured during that execution will be conscious during 
the event and will suffer pain says the appeal 
color photographs of the bodies of 10 executed men accompanied 
the motion filed wednesday by statepaid attorneys for a prisoner 
condemned to die july 10 
fire smoke and sparks flew from the head of the last man 
executed in florida on may 4 
jessie joseph tafero was burned alive in floridas electric 
chair the appeal said there is no assurance that william 
michael squires will also not be burned alive 
taferos execution for the fatal shootings of two law 
enforcement officers 14 years earlier shows that executing squires 
would be a violation of the constitutional guarantee against cruel 
and unusual punishment the motion argues 
squires 48 is condemned for the september 1980 fatal shooting 
of service station attendant jesse albritton in hillsborough 
county he is under his first warrant and no death row inmate has 
been executed on a first warrant since since the state reinstituted 
capital punishment in 1979 
reporters and prison officials who witnessed taferos execution 
said he appeared to breathe and move after the first and second 
jolts gov bob martinez ordered an investigation four days later 
the state department of corrections concluded taferos death was 
instant but that the mistaken replacement of a natural sponge with 
a synthetic sponge had caused the burns on his head 
squires attorneys blasted the corrections department for 
testing the flammability of the sponge used in taferos execution 
by using a household toaster scientific testing is not done with 
a toaster the attorneys wrote 
the attorneys from the state agency that represents poor death 
row inmates said corrections officials are not competent to carry 
out executions without unneccessary pain 
spokesmen for martinez and corrections secretary richard dugger 
said wednesday that the state stood by its investigation in a 
statement dugger called the allegations absurd frivolous and 
designed to distort eighth amendment issues with a smokescreen of 
technical and procedural faultfinding

russian president boris n yeltsin said today he 
expected to meet soviet president mikhail s gorbachev soon and 
assured concerned lawmakers that the two political rivals would 
resolve most issues between them 
yeltsin who was elected tuesday to the powerful post despite 
the opposition of gorbachev said he would try to mend fences with 
gorbachev but outlined a far more radical program than that of the 
soviet president 
as president of russia the largest and most powerful of the 
soviet unions 15 republics yeltsin could pose a major challenge 
to gorbachev and his economic reforms 
yeltsin promised to seek a businesslike relationship with 
gorbachev despite their personal differences 
true we have our differences he said i renounce all 
these personal aspects fully and completely i leave that behind 
deputies speaking today at the russian congress expressed 
concern over the exchange of statements about each other by 
yeltsin and gorbachev the official soviet news agency tass 
reported 
yeltsin answered that after gorbachev returns june 4 from the 
summit with president bush in washington i think well have an 
appropriate conversation and well resolve most issues without 
damaging the sovereignty and aims of russia tass said 
gorbachev told reporters in ottawa on tuesday he was somewhat 
concerned about yeltsins victory and feared that if yeltsin is 
playing a political game then we may be in for a difficult time 
there have been no reports that he sent congratulations to yeltsin 
on his election 
yeltsins election as russian president capped a remarkable 
political comeback gorbachev brought him to moscow to head the 
citys communist party but sacked him in 1987 for criticizing the 
slow pace of reform 
he returned to power through a popular election to the russian 
congress and survived perhaps even benefited from a lastminute 
attack by gorbachev who accused him of working toward the 
dissolution of the soviet union 
despite his conciliatory statements yeltsin at times seemed to 
be baiting gorbachev asked by reporters whether he thought leaders 
should hold top posts in both the communist party and government 
yeltsin said 
i am against combining any post in one person and i am 
talking not just about the chairmanship of the party at the russian 
level at the regional level or at the local level 
it was an oblique call for gorbachev soviet president and 
soviet communist party general secretary to give up one post 
yeltsin on wednesday urged making the soviet union a federation 
of strong states that can overrule gorbachevs central government 
on most matters 
outlining his plans at a news conference in the grand kremlin 
palace the radical populist reformer said he would seek 
sovereignty for russia within his first 100 days in office 
he also demanded that soviet premier nikolai i ryzhkov resign 
for what he called a failure to deal decisively with the countrys 
economic turmoil and said he would open treaty talks immediately 
with the secessionist baltic republics 
we must turn this pyramid on its head yeltsin said 
yeltsin attacked the reform program that ryzhkov presented one 
week ago touching off panic buying by outlining plans to double 
food prices jan 1 and triple the price of bread on july 1 the run 
on provisions prompted moscow officials to bar nonresidents from 
stores in the capital 
regrettably the national leadership and government at 
this point is losing the trust of the nation he said i do 
think we should demand its resignation 
yeltsin outlined a far more radical program than that of 
gorbachev the price increases ryzhkov seeks would be part of a 
transition to a partial market economy in the next five years 
yeltsin wants faster steps toward a market economy but opposes 
sharp price increases an apparent contradiction 
in addition under yeltsins plan russia and the other 14 
soviet republics would remain within a reconstituted soviet union 
but have far more power than the central government in most 
matters excluding defense and national security 
we must withstand the diktat of the center yeltsin said 
if we withstand 100 days if we are not pulled down russia 
will be independent in every respect it will make its own 
decisions russian laws must take priority over the union 
national laws 
the russian constitution must precede the union constitution 
any declaration of russian sovereignty must be approved by the 
russian congress of which yeltsin is chairman or president 
the russian congress is a newly created body that is the highest 
authority in the russian republic as its leader yeltsin will play 
a major role in shaping his own powers and duties

moslem militants today fired automatic 
weapons in the air and swore to die for an independent kashmir as 
300000 mourners paid tribute to kashmirs top islamic leader 
assassinated last week 
the conservative hindu newspaper said elements of three 
divisions have been transferred from indias east to the troubled 
states of punjab and jammukashmir the report quoting senior 
officials was the first mention in the indian press of a believed 
troop buildup on indias border with pakistan 
the associated press earlier reported that three divisions 
amounting to 30000 men were moved into the region from indias 
northeastern border areas 
the newspaper report said officials declined to specify how many 
troops have been moved into jammukashmir the site of a bloody 
campaign for independence from mostly hindu india or punjab where 
sikh militants have also been battling for a separate homeland 
india blames pakistan for the troubles especially in kashmir 
where it accuses pakistan of training and arming moslem militants 
pakistan denies the claim and says india is brutally crushing a 
movement for selfdetermination relations between the two 
countries have sunk to their lowest point in years 
since independence from british rule india and pakistan have 
fought three wars two over kashmir in 1948 and 1965 
the hindu said the purpose of the troop transfer was to further 
seal indias borders with pakistan to prevent reported 
infiltrations of pakistanitrained or armed militants it said 
indias director general of military operations had informed the 
pakistan army of the buildup 
in kashmir hundreds of thousands of mourners of the slain 
clergyman maulvi mohammad farooq filled the roads and dirt paths 
to a prayer ground 13 miles from srinagar 
farooq was killed may 21 by three unidentified gunmen a few 
hours later security forces fired on crowds carrying his body 
killing at least 58 people it was one of the worst days of 
violence since jan 20 when india launched a crackdown on the 
separatist movement in kashmir valley so far at least 480 people 
have been killed 
at the prayer ground ceremony kashmiri militants stood on a 
stage and fired their guns in the air 
a young man saying he represented a coalition of about a dozen 
militant groups spoke to the crowd blaming farooqs death on 
security forces and accusing the government of trying to split the 
movement by killing the clergyman the government has denied the 
charge 
we are united and will fight for the cause of freedom he 
said we will talk with our guns 
he urged kashmirs people to burn every indian product they 
owned beginning friday 
the moslem insurgency in kashmir stems from the regions 
division along a stilldisputed frontier between predominantly 
hindu india and moslem pakistan after the two countries were 
partitioned along religious lines in 1947 kashmir was mainly 
moslem but its hindu maharajah or king opted to join india 
instead of pakistan 
today the indiangoverned part of kashmir is incorporated into 
the state of jammukashmir the only one in india with a moslem 
majority sixtyfour percent of jammukashmirs 6 million people 
are moslems but nationwide moslems acount for only 12 percent of 
indias 880 million people

why is montreals flag flying over boston city 
hall today 
because montrealers walloped bostonians when it came to 
exercising for 15 minutes wednesday thats why 
a total of 328258 people from the boston area called into the 
local ymca wednesday saying they had exercised for a quarterhour 
compared with 425787 residents of montreal said gerdy weiss a 
spokeswoman for the ymca 
the whole thing ran on the honor system callers didnt even 
have to huff and puff as proof 
any activity that raised the heartbeat for 15 minutes counted 
for points in the second annual boston vs montreal challenge the 
brainchild of a montrealbased fitness organization called 
participaction 
for its punishment bostonians this morning got to see 
montreals flag flying over city hall 
two inches of rain and 25 mph wind kept 67yearold ellie marino 
indoors so she just paced up and down three flights of stairs in 
her charlestown home 
i had a stroke two years ago so im doing great mrs marino 
said after calling the challenge hotline to register her 
quarterhour of civic exertion people got to keep going thats 
the thing 
jane flynn a 32yearold housewife in marshfield jogged a 
little did jumping jacks and then switched on her calisthenics 
tape before she called the hotline 
im not really that great about exercising every day so this 
is a little inspiring to get me going she said 
organizers planned to use a plaza outside city hall for daylong 
athletic activities from basketball to hula hooping and hopscotch 
but until the rain stopped around midday the only people around 
were dressed up as giant bags of popcorn giving away samples 
mayor raymond flynn a regular entrant in the boston marathon 
postponed his run around the city to the afternoon 
exercising brain and muscle power about 400 boston 
schoolchildren went for an urban hike along the boston womens 
heritage trail 
in montreal the temperature was about the same in the high 
50s but winds were a milder 10 mph and the sun was out 
montreal is much like boston in size and ambiance last year 
boston lost to montreal 420868 to 248328 
montreal mayor jean dore got things moving in the morning 
riding behind a chauffeur on a tandem bicycle and then joined in a 
large public aerobics class corporations marshaled their employees 
for 15minute walks and montrealers could catch games of volleyball 
or concentrate in a spell of tai chi

illegal aliens who live in california are not 
eligible for the instate tuition discount at california 
universities and must pay the amount charged outofstate 
residents a judge ruled 
superior court judge david p yaffe issued a 10day stay of his 
ruling wednesday to allow attorneys for the university of 
california board of regents to appeal 
charles pereyrasuarez attorney for the regents said he would 
discuss an appeal with the regents 
yaffe ruled on a lawsuit by david p bradford 35 who claimed 
he was forced to resign from his job at the university of 
california los angeles in 1985 after he refused to enroll 
undocumented students 
bradford who processed student applications for residency 
status contended the state has spent up to 13 million over the 
past five years to subsidize illegal aliens who pay instate 
tuition 
yaffe cited a 1984 opinion by state attorney general john van de 
kamp finding that under the california education code undocumented 
aliens were not legal residents for tuition purposes 
ucla attorney david birnbaum said the universitys tuition 
policy conformed to a 1985 alameda county superior court order 
requiring campus registrars to treat aliens residency applications 
the same way they would for us citizens 
under the order california students who were in the united 
states illegally were eligible for state financial aid as well as 
instate tuition rates 
california residents pay an average 1633 per year in tuition 
at state universities compared with an average 7432 per year 
paid by outofstate residents according to a regents spokesman 
peter schey director of the center for human rights and 
constitutional law said wednesdays ruling would be unenforceable 
the university is not in a position to become the second line 
of defense to the border patrol he said schey successfully 
argued a 1982 case that allowed children of undocumented workers to 
attend public schools in texas 
state universities schey added have neither personnel nor 
expertise to evaluate the immigration status of every student or 
potential student it would take an army of immigration agents to 
figure that out 
bradfords lawsuit contesting his firing has yet to go to trial

the peaceful revolution that swept away communist 
rule in czechoslovakia six months ago was engineered jointly by 
leaders of the secret police in moscow and prague the british 
broadcasting corp reported 
in prague today police chief major pavel hoffman said secret 
police headquarters have been put under special protection after a 
heated debate of seveal dismissed agents ended up in personal 
threats 
a bbc television documentary contends that secret police leaders 
in both the soviet union and czechoslovakia conspired to bring down 
the hardline communist leadership in prague because it rejected 
mikhail s gorbachevs reforms in the soviet union 
the plotters planned for more reformminded communists to 
replace the hardliners but miscalculated the depth of public 
desire for change said john simpson the bbc foreign affairs 
editor 
milan hulik an investigator for the czechoslovak parliamentary 
commission probing the plot told the bbc it was not yet known if 
the revolution was instigated by the czechoslovak secret police or 
the soviet kgb 
but all the facts point to kgb connivance he said we 
cannot reach any conclusion other than that the whole affair had 
been given the blessing of the soviet political leadership 
the plotters on the czechoslovak side are now under 
investigation and some are in prison charged with misusing their 
positions as public officials while a parliamentary inquiry into 
the plot continues simpson said 
the 50minute news program czechmate inside the 
revolution was broadcast on bbctv late wednesday 
the gorbachev administration has also been reported to have had 
a hand in the nearly concurrent fall of erich honecker the former 
east german communist leader who had resisted implimenting 
sovietstyle reforms 
simpson said the spark that ignited the czechoslovak plot was 
the erroneous report of a death of a youthful demonstrator during 
an officially sanctioned march in prague on nov 17 the 
demonstration marked the 50th anniversary of the murder of a prague 
student by nazi troops in 1939 
the plotters believed a death during the november commemoration 
would provoke a hostile reaction simpson said 
according to the bbc report several thousand young 
demonstrators were lured into a narrow street leading to wenceslas 
square by lt ludek zivcak a secret policeman who had infiltrated 
the student movement 
the documentary showed a photograph of zivcak apparently urging 
the marchers to take the narrow street which had not been part of 
the original route of the demonstration 
once in the street marchers were hemmed in by police and 
brutally beaten about 560 people were injured 
zivcak fell to the ground his body was covered with a blanket 
and an unmarked ambulance took the body away the event sparked 
rumors that riot police had beaten to death a student named martin 
smid 
in the days that followed people poured into wenceslas square 
in the heart of the capital to mourn the death and the protests 
grew 
demonstrations continued even after the only two students named 
martin smid at prague university were shown to be alive 
the mass protests finally brought about the downfall of 
hardline president gustav husaks government the creation of 
czechoslovakias first noncommunist government in four decades and 
the election to the presidency of playwright vaclav havel the 
countrys bestknown opposition figure 
simpson said the chief plotters were the cezchoslovak secret 
police chief general alois lorenc the kgb head in prague general 
teslenko first name unavailable and kgb deputy chairman general 
viktor grushko 
he said they monitored the nov 17 demonstration together in 
prague and grushko returned to moscow the next day 
the plotters candidate to replace communist party chief milos 
jakes was zdenek mlynar who had been a leading figure in alexander 
dubceks doomed reform government in 1968 
mlynar a friend of gorbachev when they were law school students 
together in moscow had been purged by his own communist leaders in 
1969 
but mlynar did not want the job when it was proposed to him and 
havel and his noncommunist civic forum were ushered into power by 
popular acclaim

a halfdozen accordions stand on lawrence 
shine moutons kitchen table the result of hundreds of hours 
of work and decades of experience 
my daddy was a musician amadia breaux he composed jolie 
blonde i tried to learn to play but didnt learn to play as 
well as he did said mouton 63 i said if i couldnt play id 
learn to make em 
moutons name is now as well known among cajun musicians as his 
stepfathers his accordions are played by such performers as the 
popular zydecajun musician wayne toups and jimmy basile of 
cajun tradition the mamou group nominated for a grammy award this 
year 
as cajun music and its spinoffs have become more popular so has 
moutons craft about 45 people now make the little germanstyle 
squeeze boxes most of them in little backyard sheds 
i figured i wasnt any dumber than the next fellow i figured 
if he could make it i could make it too said john elton doucet 
whose workshop is in his grocery store the first one wasnt too 
too good but then the second one was good 
doucet makes six to 10 accordions a year its painstaking work 
the flat metal reeds and the bellows are imported from italy but 
everything else is made by hand 
or at least adapted for instance many people make the big 
silver buttons on the left end of the accordion from chromeplated 
chair glides they snip off the little prongs solder a wood screw 
onto the back and fill in the curve with lead 
you drill a hole and its all threaded and ready to go 
said larry miller who makes accordions only for his family but 
makes and sells cajun triangles spoons set in wooden blocks so 
theyre easy to use as a rhythm instrument and the 
overtheshoulder style metal washboards used by zydeco bands 
the four wooden stops used to close off the four sets of 
accordion reeds are made from cabinetwork spindles and tiny coiled 
screws inside the accordion were made to put tension on stereo 
tuning knobs 
some people paint their accordions others varnish them to show 
off finegrained woods the long curved halfdowels which open or 
close the reeds often are covered with gold mylar tape which gives 
even more glitter than the once traditional gold paint and is a lot 
easier to apply 
miller said he began learning to play the accordion because of a 
lecture from cajun music great dewey balfa after an assembly at 
the school where miller was principal miller told balfa that his 
father had made triangles and played accordion but none of his 
brothers or he had kept it up 
he said if youre concerned about it dying in your family 
itll probably be your fault you were the one that broke the 
chain recounted miller it hit me like a ton of bricks three 
days later i went and bought an accordion and commenced to 
learning 
about seven years later he started thinking about making the 
instruments he was influenced by stories he had heard about mouton 
and a few other men who had loved the instrument so much that 
after repairing and rerepairing german instruments made before 
world war ii they started making their own 
strictly speaking the cajun accordion is a melodeon or diatonic 
accordion a very different instrument from the big piano 
accordion popular shortly after the turn of the century 
for one thing the cajun accordion is much smaller its about 
11 inches high and six inches deep and will squeeze down to 14 
inches across it weighs about eight pounds less than a third the 
weight of its big cousin 
its held on with a strap around the back of the left hand and a 
smaller strap for the righthand thumb and played like a 
handdriven harmonica each of the 10 righthand buttons gives two 
notes one when the accordion is squeezed the other when its 
pulled out 
the 28pound piano accordion cant be held up without heavy 
padded shoulder straps its twooctave keyboard is twice as long as 
the cajun accordions little row of buttons each key always plays 
the same note 
since it does have all 12 notes of the chromatic scale it can 
play in any key while the cajun accordion is limited to four if a 
player is particularly adept and plays every note of the scale 
only in one 
however cajun accordion makers say that their instrument can 
overpower the bigger one because it has four sets of melody reeds 
german accordions began showing up in cajun country around the 
1890s and quickly upstaged the quieter fiddle as lead instrument 
world war ii stopped imports and the factories were destroyed or 
converted to other uses 
factories resumed making accordions later but the style popular 
in louisiana four sets of reeds controlled by one set of buttons 
wasnt used much elsehwere 
mouton charlie ortego and sidney brown and marc savoy are 
generally considered the pioneers of modernday accordion building 
mouton began making accordions in 1961 opening up his fathers 
old germanmade sterling accordion and using it as a reference 
in 1970 heart trouble forced him to choose between a transfer 
and retirement from work as a civil engineer for conoco his hobby 
became his fulltime job 
not to say a living i dont make that much money making 
accordions because the cost of reeds and bellows is so high he 
said 
those two parts are ordered from italy and cost hundreds of 
dollars reed makers dont give any discounts miller said but he 
and about 25 other accordion makers recently began ordering bellows 
together 
i remember when you could buy reeds for 5 a set said 
mouton now the cheapest reeds are 90 and bellows start at 150 
and those are for a brand scorned as vastly inferior to those 
made in italy 
importing presents other problems i ordered some reeds oct 
19 1989 they have my money i still dont have the reeds said 
mouton 
mouton still works in a little backyard shed though his heart 
problems have cut back to six or seven hours a day and about 20 
accordions a year a friend has begun cutting out the wooden parts 
for him to put together 
photographs of his father and his wife betty stand on a shelf 
over his workbench on the walls are a plaque naming breaux to the 
cajun musicians hall of fame in 1984 musicians signed promotion 
photographs and several wayne toups posters one of them 
inscribed to mr shine thanks for being a special friend 
mouton opens a corner cabinet 
this is my daddys old accordion he bought it in 1918 for 
750 i dont know what it would cost today but i turned down 
2500 for it

a court today charged a highranking reserve 
officer and a company he heads with illegally providing military 
expertise and equipment to a group of civilians in colombia 
the defendant lt col yair klein is also wanted in that south 
american country for allegedly helping to train fighters for 
cocaine cartels 
the case involving klein and his hod hahanit or spearhead 
company has prompted wide debate in israel over the practice of 
retired military officers working as mercenaries overseas 
kleins company is defined in the charges as an organization 
that trains and builds counterterrorist fighting squads 
the fourpage charge sheet makes no mention of the colombian 
charges that klein was involved in training assassination teams for 
the medellin drug cartel klein has vigorously denied such 
allegations 
a copy of the charge sheet provided to the associated press 
charges klein with making an illegal deal with a group known as the 
farmers organization in colombia around april 1988 
the illegalexport charges by the jerusalem magistrates court do 
not give details on the farmers group klein maintained earlier 
that he had legally provided training to a group of colombian 
cattlemen 
klein who was involved in secret counterterrorist operations 
with the israeli army came under investigation in august 
at the time colombia sought him in connection with a spate of 
drugrelated shootings klein is still wanted in colombia for 
allegedly organizing training and equipping paramilitary groups 
for drug traffickers he has been declared a fugitive from justice 
and may be tried in absentia 
he was also questioned by israeli police last month for an 
alleged role in the illegal diversion of weapons destined for 
antigua to the medellin cartel he has denied any such involvement 
an antiguan commission of inquiry opens hearings on the case 
friday 
the israeli court has charged klein with three counts 
negotiating to sell military expertise without a license the 
actual sale of expertise and the unlawful sale of equipment such 
as weapons belts and night gunscopes 
such actions violate a 1986 law on the export of israeli goods 
and services and a 1956 law on the activities of reservists the 
charge sheet says 
the charges carry a maximum threeyear sentence army radio 
reported no trial date has been set 
the maariv newspaper said state prosecutor uzi hasson plans to 
call a number of defense ministry officials to the stand 
also named in the charge sheet is a man identified as yitzhak 
ben shimon shoshani he is charged with mediating kleins 
negotiations for the illegal deals and direct involvement in the 
illegal export of military equipment

the president of the university of south 
carolina has resigned after weeks of criticism about lavish 
spending on fundraising trips and hiring of celebrities as 
visiting teachers 
james b holderman 54 who has headed the 40000student state 
university since 1977 will step down on july 1 
holderman made no reference to the controversy when he announced 
his resignation wednesday and declined to answer reporters 
questions he read from a statement in front of his home on the 
campus in downtown columbia 
for my whole family this has been more than a job it has 
been a total commitment he said in our collective judgment 
we have determined that it is time to pursue new personal and 
professional challenges 
holderman regularly used luxury hotels while on fundraising 
trips hired 35anhour chauffeured limousine services in 
washington and frequently chartered jets or flew first class 
according to records from the university and private foundations 
affiliated with the school 
holderman argued that expensive hotel rooms were necessary to 
woo wealthy donors and said his critics overlooked the fact that 
he has helped raise 225 million in the past year 
much of the money spent came from the presidents discretionary 
account which is funded not from tax revenue but from such things 
as profits from campus vending machine sales 
as a result of the controversy the board of trustees last week 
implemented guidelines aimed at limiting his expenses forcing him 
to obtain prior approval for exceptional spending and making him 
more accountable for funds spent 
critics said holdermans spending was excessive since during the 
same period he told lawmakers courses were being canceled for lack 
of state funds 
holderman first came under criticism in 1986 for lavish spending 
on his travels for giving expensive gifts to donors and students 
and for paying top dollar to lure celebrity lecturers and speakers 
to the school 
jihan sadat widow of egyptian president anwar sadat was paid 
200000 to teach a course in egyptian culture for three semesters 
in 1985 and 1986 
more recently the school has drawn criticism for paying 
actordirector robby benson 158367 to teach filmmaking and 
15600 for rent with holderman kicking in 10000 from his 
discretionary fund for travel and moving expenses 
board of trustees chairman michael mungo said the board did not 
pressure holderman to resign though he acknowledged that criticism 
of the university because of the spending should end with 
holdermans departure

the dow jones industrial average is cruising 
toward the onceunimaginable 3000 mark in what analysts call a 
signal that the bull market of the 1980s has shrugged off both 
scandal and the crash of 1987 
in less than five weeks from april 27 through wednesday the 
oldest and best known measure of trends in stock prices surged 
23351 or 88 percent to an alltime high of 287856 it needed 
only a 42 percent advance to reach 3000 
in todays early trading the dow edged even higher rising 498 
to 288354 by 11 am 
many traders and money managers minimized the significance of 
the milestone the average of 30 blue chip stocks does not 
necessarily mirror what is happening to the hundreds of other 
substantial companies 
still i think it is a big psychological target said robert 
stovall president of stovalltwentyfirst advisers inc 
a move to 3000 in the dow any time soon would come less than 3 
years after the average first broke 2000 in january 1987 that 
kind of pace has few parallels in the history of the centuryold 
average 
it first touched 1000 in 1966 faltered badly in the bear 
markets of 196970 and 197374 and did not break 1000 decisively 
until early 1983 
analysts are skeptical about the significance of a 3000 dow for 
the economy as a whole during much of the 1980s and again more 
recently the market has staged its strongest advances during 
periods of sluggish economic growth

here is the text of the arrival ceremony at 
the white house for soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
president bush friends and distinguished guests welcome to all 
of you especially our guest from the soviet union it is my great 
honor to welcome to the white house the president of the soviet 
union mikhail gorbachev mr president just applause 
mr president just over a year ago i said that the united 
states wanted to move beyond containment in its relations with the 
soviet union toward a new era an era of enduring cooperation 
when we last met in malta we agreed to accelerate our efforts on 
a full range of issues today differences remain of course but in 
the short six months since the malta summit we have made 
encouraging progress and i want this summit to take us further 
still and i know that that is your view as well mr president 
we have seen a world of change this past year and now on the 
horizon we see what just one short year ago seemed a distant dream 
a continent truly divided east and west has begun to heal with the 
dawn of selfdetermination and democracy 
in germany where the wall once stood a nation moves toward 
unity and peace and freedom and in the other nations of the most 
heavily militarized continent on earth at last we see the long era 
of confrontation giving way to the prospect of enduring cooperation 
in a europe whole and free 
mr president you deserve great credit for your part in these 
transforming events i salute you as well for the process of 
change youve brought to your own country 
as we begin this summit let me stress that i believe we can 
work together at this historic momewnt to further the process of 
building a new europe one in which every nations security is 
strengthened and no nation is threatened 
around the world we need to strengthen our cooperation in 
solving regional conflicts and building peace and stability in 
nicaragua for example weve shown that we can work together to 
promote peaceful change 
in angola our support for an early resolution of that countrys 
tragic conflict is a resolution acceptable to the angolan people 
is now paying off 
so let us expand this new spirit of cooperation not merely to 
resolve disputes between us but to build a solid foundation for 
peace prosperity and stability around the world 
in that same spirit mr president let me quote the words of 
one of your nations great minds one of the worlds great men in 
this or any age andrei sakharov 
fourteen years ago he wrote i am convinced that guaranteed 
political and civil rights for people the world over are also 
guarantees of international security economic and social 
progress 
sakharov knew that lasting peace and progress are inseparable 
from freedom that nations will only be fully safe when all people 
are fully free 
and we in the us applaud the new course the soviet union has 
chosen we see the spirited debate in the congress of peoples 
deputies in the soviet press among the soviet people 
we know about the difficult economic reforms that are necessary 
to breathe new vigor into the soviet economy and as ive said many 
times before we want to see perestroika succeed applause 
mr president i firmly believe as you have said that there is 
no turning back from the path you have chosen since our meeting in 
malta we have reached agreements in important areas each one 
proof that when mutual respect prevails progress is possible 
but the agreements weve reached cannot cause us to lose sight 
of some of the differences that remain lithuania is one such issue 
we believe that good faith dialogue between the soviet leaders 
and representatives of the baltic peoples is the proper approach 
and we hope to see that process go forward 
over the next four days were not going to solve all of the 
worlds problems we wont resolve all of the outstanding issues 
that divide us but we can and will take significant steps toward a 
new relationship 
this summit will be a working summit in the strictest sense of 
the term one where we mark the real progress weve made by signing 
new agreements and where we address the differences that divide us 
in a spirit of candor in an open and honest search for common 
ground 
in a larger sense though the success of this summit depends 
not on the agreements we will sign but on our efforts to lay the 
groundwork for overcoming decades of division and discord to build 
a world of peace in freedom 
mr president together your great country and ours bear an 
enormous and unique responsibility for world peace and regional 
stability

reached their first agreement even before their summit talks began 
today they decided not to answer reporters questions in the oval 
office 
the switch from the policy observed by president reagan who 
allowed questions during summit photo sessions in his office was 
engineered by bush as he posed with the soviet leader for cameramen 
and photographers moments before their first round of talks 
i do not take questions during photo opportunities in the oval 
office bush explained as the reporters crowded into the room 
if they yell questions at you which theyre unlikely to do 
but if they did you should feel free to answer if you want bush 
told his guest 
a reporter immediately asked gorbachev about his differences 
with bush on the issue of a united germany 
ive been told by the president that the current policy is 
that there are no questions during the photo opportunity 
gorbachev said he promised they would report later to the press on 
their talks

president gorbachev 
mr president mrs bush ladies and gentlemen comrades thank 
you for this welcome may i also greet all americans on behalf of 
the peoples of the soviet union 
my present visit to the united states is a confirmation that 
sovietus relations are acquiring greater stability clarity and 
predictability i am convinced that both the soviet people and the 
americans approve such changes i think that they are also properly 
appreciated throughout the world 
therefore it is the great responsibility of the president and 
myself to make sure that the capital of trust and cooperation 
accumulated in recent years is protected and constantly increased 
i remember well my first visit to the united states and not 
only because i saw america for the first time then during those 
days in december 1987 president reagan and i signed the treaty on 
the elimination of inf missiles 
that was truly a watershed not only in our relations but in 
the history of modern times it was the first step taken together 
by two powerful countries on the road leading to a safe and 
sensible world 
since then our two great nations have traveled a long way 
toward each other thousands of american and soviet citizens 
dozens of agencies private companies and public organizations are 
involved in political and business contacts humanitarian 
exchanges scientific and technological cooperation 
in the same years the world around us has also changed beyond 
recognition 
mr president this generation of people on earth may witness 
the advent of an irreversible period of peace in the history of 
civilization the walls which for years separated the peoples are 
collapsing the trenches of the cold war are disappearing the fog 
of prejudice mistrust and animosity is vanishing applause 
i have come to the united states with the impressions still 
fresh in my mind of how our people celebrated the 45th anniversary 
of the victory over nazism and of my meetings with war veterans 
i have recently had many meetings with my countrymen they all 
understand the importance of sovietus relations 
they look upon their improvement with hope that the tragedies of 
the 20th century those horrible wars will forever remain a thing 
of the past i think that this is what the americans want too 
applause 
mr president living up to these hopes of our two nations is 
your mission and mine this meeting is part of it 
my colleagues and i have come to do serious work in order to 
make a decisive step toward an agreement reducing the most 
dangerous arms which are increasingly losing their political 
significance and to provide further impetus to interaction between 
our two countries interaction and of course cooperation in solving 
international problems in trade scientific technological and 
humanitarian fields and cultural exchanges in expanding 
information about each other and in people to people contact 
we want progress in relations between the soviet union and the 
united states of america 
i am looking forward to meeting with the americans and to the 
extent possible getting to know better your unique and great 
country 
on behalf of mrs gorbachev and myself and of all those who have 
come with me to your nations capital i thank once again president 
george bush and all those present here for this warm welcome

prime minister benazir bhutto today 
postponed visits to four moslem nations because of ethnic unrest 
that has killed at least 306 people in her home province and 
threatened her power base 
sporadic gunfire rang through karachi pakistans largest city 
for the fifth straight day today officials said at least seven 
more people were killed in the violence that broke out may 15 
raising the overall death toll to 126 
ms bhutto has rejected demands to dismiss the government of 
sindh province headed by her pakistan peoples party and bring it 
under control of the federal government in islamabad 
instead she has called out the army to help restore law and 
order 
soldiers and local security troops were patrolling the largely 
deserted streets of karachi the capital of sindh and the countrys 
financial and industrial hub 
most shops and businesses including the karachi stock exchange 
have been closed this week because of aroundtheclock curfews that 
have brought life in this city of 8 million people to a standstill 
the army also was patrolling hyderabad a city of 3 million 
people 150 miles to the north after clashes there killed at least 
180 people 
the trouble is rooted in deep hatred between native sindhis and 
the mohajirs descendants of moslem indians who immigrated to 
pakistan during the 1947 partition of the subcontinent sindhis 
accuse the bettereducated mohajirs of taking the best jobs and 
most valuable land 
police blame the latest violence on a militant faction of the 
mohajir qami movement a small political party representing the 
moslem indian immigrants the party is demanding recognition as 
pakistans fifth nationality along with the pathans punjabis 
baluch and sindhis 
the prime minister had planned to leave june 3 on a fourday 
trip to qatar iraq kuwait and bahrain to drum up support for 
pakistan in its dispute with india over the kashmir region moslem 
secessionists there are trying to break away from hindudominated 
india india blames pakisan a moslem country for fomenting that 
unrest but pakistan denies the charge 
ms bhuttos aides said today the two weeks of random shootings 
and clashes between rival ethnic groups and security forces in 
pakistan had forced her to delay her trip aides said 
the prime minister has decided to delay her trip until some 
normalcy returns said one aide speaking on condition of

the transit authority has instituted a new 
policy following court battles over begging in the subways all 
panhandlers will be ejected 
the chief of the ta police william j bratton instituted the 
new rule wednesday and explained it to officers in a videotape 
bratton said that under the new stringent guidelines all 
panhandlers even those silently holding out a cup would be kicked 
out of the subway system 
earlier this month a federal appeals court threw out a lower 
courts ruling that had held that begging was a constitutionally 
protected form of speech the new rules are the first attempt since 
the ruling to instruct officers in how to handle beggars 
some forms of soliciting will still be allowed in the system 
although not on trains they include musical performances and 
requests for money for legitimate registered charities or 
religious or political groups 
in the videotaped message bratton said the guidelines were 
needed to clear up any misunderstanding and confusion among 
officers and to restore order to a system that the public 
believes is out of control the times said 
bratton asked officers to use their skill and experience in 
ejecting beggars 
the new york subway system transports roughly 35 million 
passengers a day

it was a great day for flying my wife 
my 5yearold son and young daughter watched from the runway as we 
took off 
ive always been scared to fly but the plane takeoff was so 
smooth i was feeling very comfortable and was talking to duncan 
much of the way 
we flew in formation to the tanker and practiced fueling in air 
everything was going so smoothly 
i handled the plane for a couple of minutes then duncan took 
control for good we took it for a roll we went up and did some 
gforce testing to see how i would react 
then he brought the squadron back together and began setting up 
for combat exercises 
we did the first exercise it was pure top gun we were 
moving so fast i saw duncans head swinging around looking at the 
other planes it was very aggressive 
we were engaged in a dogfight with another plane and we were the 
aggressor suddenly it got turned around and another pilot was the 
aggressor duncan told me on his radio now were on defense 
we began going around with greg gore the other pilot in pursuit 
of us 
i noticed way down to the left of what i could see that gores 
plane was coming up in an arch towards us duncan suddenly pointed 
the nose higher and seemed to be backing off the fight that is 
when i fixed on gore coming at us the pilots later said they were 
trying to exercise a scissor maneuver 
those planes go so fast a mere second makes such a difference 
i said to myself there isnt any danger these guys are too good 
of pilots we wont collide then it became obvious he was going 
to hit us 
i saw the whites of the other pilots eyes 
we went up but i think we took the hit low he hit us from 
underneath towards the tail section 
gore said later he thought he was going to take it right in his 
canopy and he would have died instantly 
duncan hit the ejector button as soon as we hit sending me 
exploding through the canopy and him following a second later then 
everything came apart it was just a ball of flame duncan later 
told me that if he had waited a couple of seconds longer to eject 
we would have been crispy critters 
it was just a surreal scene i was floating up in the air and my 
flight suit was burning like a torch my first thought was ill 
never see my wife and kids again this is it 
pieces of the plane were going by flames were all over me i 
couldnt remember where the cord was to open the parachute but it 
went open automatically 
it was like one of those movies the plane and debris were 
spiraling down below me in flames it was completely silent up 
there 
the parachute was swinging me around i thought oh my god 
im alive 
then i noticed blood was dripping from my head the only thing i 
could think was i wonder if im really seriously hurt i 
didnt know if half my head was blown off i looked down at my feet 
and saw my shoes were completely singed but they were both there 
i saw the other guys were alive duncan gave me the thumbs up i 
gave him the thumbs up it was very peaceful floating down but i 
kept smelling this smell and finally figured out it was my own skin 
that had burned 
i was trying to remember everything they told me about landing 
how to avoid trees power lines it seemed like five minutes to get 
down it was very very slow the whole world was sitting out there 
i saw people gathering in cars below us there were a lot of 
farmers there with the wreckage off in the distance 
i just sort of floated down and hit kind of awkwardly i thought 
id broken my leg i couldnt get out of the chute right away and 
it was blowing me across the field a farmer came out and grabbed 
the chute and helped me 
duncan came along and asked me if i was all right he said he 
was sorry it had to happen

a chinese couple who fled their homeland 
because of chinas harsh family planning laws have been granted 
political asylum in the united states their lawyer said today 
li jin mu and wang sai zhen are the first known refugees to be 
granted asylum under an order president bush issued last november 
that established fear of forced abortion as grounds for asylum 
at the time they fled china last year ms wang was pregnant 
with the couples second child only one was allowed she had 
undergone several previous abortions and her doctor had warned her 
another could damage her health 
the us immigration and naturalization service notified the 
couple that they had been granted asylum late wednesday said the 
lawyer kathleen rimar she said the letter did not specifically 
mention the abortion issue 
its a form letter rimar said it basically just says 
that they have demonstrated a wellfounded fear of persecution 
ealier this month the state department had recommended that 
asylum be granted 
li 37 and ms wang whose age has not been disclosed now live 
in new york city they must undergo a followup interview with the 
ins within a year to confirm their asylum status rimar said 
after the asylum is confirmed the couple would qualify for 
permanent resident status although it could be a few years before 
they win it because of a backlog of applications rimar said five 
years after becoming permanent residents they could qualify for 
citizenship 
the couple fled their hometown of fuzhou early last year along 
with a nephew chun kong cheung 19 and made their way to canada 
there they paid smugglers about 1500 apiece to get them into the 
united states 
the ins caught them in albany and sent li and chun back to 
canada ms wang was allowed to stay because of her advanced 
pregnancy and gave birth to a daughter in new york li and chun 
tried again to get into the united states last october but 
government agents found them in the back of a truck at a border 
crossing near buffalo 
the three applied for asylum after bush issued his nov 30 
order which was part of a directive allowing chinese students to 
stay in the united states after the tiananmen square massacre of 
prodemocracy demonstrators in beijing 
the couple left their first child a 10yearold daughter 
behind with relatives in china they have said they would like to 
go back someday and get her 
the state department has rejected the nephews application for 
asylum but rimar said she has asked it to reconsider he is still 
in the united states but the ins is trying to have him sent back 
to canada

a man charged with manslaughter in his 2yearold 
sons death testified that the ill boy appeared to be improving the 
day he died 
david twitchell and his wife ginger both christian 
scientists were charged with manslaughter because they did not 
seek medical help for their son who died of a bowel obstruction 
that could have been corrected by surgery 
the couple says they rely on spiritual healing to cure physical 
ailments according to christian science principles 
twitchell took the stand wednesday describing the days and 
hours before their son robyn died in 1986 twitchells testimony 
continued today 
defense attorneys have sought to show that robyns symptoms 
resembled the flu and that he died suddenly while cradled in his 
fathers arms an autopsy showed the boy had a birth defect that 
caused the obstruction 
officials from the christian science church which is based in 
boston contends the state of massachusetts has put the religion 
itself on trial 
prosecutors maintain medical attention would have saved the 
boys life and deny that they are prosecuting the couples 
religious beliefs 
twitchell broke down a few times during almost three hours of 
questioning by his attorney rikki klieman he became emotional 
when describing the hours leading up to his sons death when the 
twitchells believed he was getting well 
i remember holding him and him being quiet in my arms and then 
quietly shaking said twitchell it wasnt violent shaking and 
it didnt last very long after the shaking i noticed he half 
closed his eyes 
twitchell then began to cry quietly and suffolk county superior 
court judge sandra hamlin called a brief recess 
twitchell said he and his wife were never far from robyns side 
during his last days after calling in a christian science 
practitioner two days before robyns death twitchell said he and 
his wife began spoonfeeding robyn every 30 minutes in an effort to 
get him to eat 
the day the boy died he appeared much better twitchell 
testified 
it was like a sunny day after a hazy day he said we were 
pleased and happy it had turned out that way things had appeared 
to turn out so wonderfully 
twitchell said he believed the boy was recovering when he 
followed his father and older brother into the kitchen tuesday 
night for dinner but after drinking some liquid robyn vomited 
twitchell said 
later that night the boy died in his arms twitchell testified 
twitchell called a funeral home director who told him to call 
911 operators coached him in cardiopulmonary resuscitation over 
the phone until paramedics arrived to take the child to the 
hospital

at least five toxic chemicals from the 
rocky mountain arsenal including a nerve gas byproduct and two 
banned pesticides have migrated underground four miles to the 
south platte river officials said 
environmental protection agency officials said wednesday that 
they did not believe there was any public health threat from the 
wastes dumped by the army and shell oil co 
when it reaches the south platte its very diluted said 
connally mears who directs an epasupervised cleanup at the 
arsenal north of stapleton international airport 
the epa had not previously disclosed that pollution from the 
arsenal was affecting the south platte which supplies water for 
drinking and irrigation to thousands of rural northeastern colorado 
residents 
the pollution apparently is seeping around the edges of 
underground barrier systems the army and shell built along the 
arsenals northern and northwestern borders to cleanse groundwater 
the 27squaremile arsenals contamination of groundwater dates 
to the early 1950s shell oil co manufactured pesticides at the 
arsenal for 30 years beginning in 1952 before that the army 
manufactured and stored chemical warfare weapons there 
epa officials said a plume consisting of many pollutants reached 
the river but they are chiefly concerned about five an army nerve 
gas byproduct called dimp pce an industrial solvent chloroform 
dieldrin a shell pesticide banned for most uses in 1974 because of 
links to cancer and dbcp a shell pesticide banned for most uses 
in 1979 because it can cause sterility in workers 
the key uncertainty is over the longterm health effects of 
dimp mears said 
last month the epa and the colorado department of health 
announced plans to test wells used by 150 homes north and northwest 
of the arsenal for dimp results are expected this summer

change mikhail s gorbachev sparked in the soviet union but 
wasted no time in laying out us displeasure over the soviet 
presidents policy in lithuania 
in an official greeting on the white house south lawn bush 
noted the encouraging progress made by the two countries since 
he and gorbachev held their first summit meeting in malta last 
december 
however he said the agreements weve reached should not 
cause us to lose sight of some of the differences that remain 
lithuania is one such issue

applause rippled across the audience of several hundred dignitaries 
and guests 
bush greeted gorbachev with a warm handshake and the two smiled 
frequently during the ceremonial part of the official greeting at 
the start of their second summit 
mr president you deserve great credit for your part in these 
transforming events that have brought dramatic reform to eastern 
europe bush said 
i salute you as well for the process of change youve brought 
to your country

we are not going to solve all of the worlds problems we will 
not resolve all of the outstanding differences that divide us but 
we can and will take significant steps toward a new relationship

soviet concerns on the subject 
we want to hear their concerns and their interests said

control negotiations once a treaty to reduce troops and tanks 
throughout europe is reached

that could have the western allies limit the size of the german 
army in exchange for proportional cuts in the size of the red army 
within the soviet union

advisers as gorbachev wrapped up a 29hour stopover in canada 
before flying to washington

columbias astronomy mission is on 
hold for at least another week and possibly longer as nasa tries 
to track down a small leak in a shuttle fuel line that caused the 
launch to be scrubbed 
workers entered the engine compartment early today to search for 
the leak after the shuttles external fuel tank was purged of 
combustible hydrogen 
a tiny leak was found in a socalled flex line connector in 
the extensive plumbing in the suspected area but it was believed 
to be too small to have leaked so much hydrogen tuesday said nasa 
spokesman bruce buckingham 
the feeling is at this point thats probably not what theyre 
looking for buckingham said 
if workers cant find the main leak the shuttle would have to 
be rolled back into its hangar nasa officials said that would 
mean about a onemonth delay 
columbias launch which had been set for 1238 am wednesday 
was scrubbed six hours before liftoff because of leaking hydrogen 
during fueling of the shuttle with more than a halfmillion gallons 
of supercold liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen 
it was the first time a shuttle launch had been scrubbed during 
fueling the mission already had been delayed two weeks because of 
repairs to the cooling system 
columbia will carry into orbit seven astronauts and a 150 
million observatory called astro the astronauts returned to 
johnson space center in houston to practice liftoffs and landings 
in a shuttle simulator 
the earliest another launch could be attempted is the middle of 
next week said bob sieck launch director for the national 
aeronautics and space administration 
if the problem is something obvious that we can repair on the 
pad then well do that and fly said bascom murrah a nasa 
official in charge of prelaunch operations for columbia 
the odds of that happening are 5050 nasa officials said 
engineers believe the leak is in a 17inch valve in a pipe that 
carries fuel from the external tank to the main engine 
the effect of the delay on the shuttles astronomy mission was 
not clear but the postponement is likely to affect what can be 
seen of comet austin which was discovered last year and is 
receding rapidly from the solar system 
nasa plans to open columbias payload bay friday to replenish 
the argon used to keep astros xray telescope cold astros three 
other telescopes which track ultraviolet radiation have no 
special needs 
the space agency said it would proceed as planned with fridays 
launch of a german xray observatory known as rosat it will be 
boosted into orbit by an unmanned delta rocket 
sieck would not say what impact columbias delay will have on 
this years flight schedule nasa does not want anything to 
threaten an october mission to deploy the ulysses satellite which 
will explore the suns poles

the government moved thursday to 
reduce the violence shown on television particularly in news 
programs 
transport and communcations minister kim beazley said he 
supported the recommendations in the australian broadcasting 
tribunals report on television violence which was brought up for 
discussion in parliament 
the key recommendation is that the television industry draw up a 
uniform code on how to treat violence 
although the emphasis is on supervised selfregulation 
tribunal chairman deirdre oconnor said in a separate statement 
that if the code could not satisfy meet public concerns the 
tribunal would be driven to consider a range of options which could 
include imposing program standards and license conditions 
the report said there was widespread worry about the repetition 
of violent images closeups of blood and intrusion on grieving 
people 
the overriding concern was the effect of violence on children 
the report said it was clear that news had assumed an 
overwhelming importance in the competition for evening ratings 
the depiction of violence in sport was also criticized 
particularly slowmotion replays of brawls and the use of fighting 
in promotions

east german lawmakers voted today to create a 
commission that will investigate and perhaps seize the vast 
property held by the former communist party 
the coalition government of prime minister lothar de maiziere 
asked parliament to form a commission that would have broad powers 
to seize evidence search houses and interrogate witnesses 
when it is created in the next few days all property owned by 
political parties and other organizations under the former regime 
would be put in trust while the government decides how to dispose 
of it 
the law was passed as the young democratic government grapples 
with how to convert stateowned property to private ownership a 
prerequisite to unification with west germany 
the two german states are to merge their economies and social 
institutions on july 2 when west german currency will become the 
currency of east germany 
the property commission is to report its findings to parliament 
by june 30 
the commission is part of the monumental process of dismantling 
the nations vast system of state ownership 
the proposal calls for the property of all political parties 
unions and other organizations to be investigated but it is 
clearly aimed at the former communist regime 
lawmaker gregor gysi leader of the reconstituted communist 
party that now supports a form of democratic socialism said the 
government proposal was aimed at eliminating his partys role as an 
opposition faction 
they want all opposition eliminated said gysi whose party 
is now called the party of democratic socialism that is the goal 
and nothing else he said his party already has given up a large 
part of its property 
richard schroeder leader of the social democratic lawmakers in 
parliament said the proposal is aimed at merely shedding light on 
who owns what in the country 
we should bring clarity and light to the property 
proportion he said we have the impression that the history of 
the former communist party property is still being written 
the leftleaning social democrats are part of conservative de 
maizieres coalition 
under the governments proposal the property commission would 
report back to the parliament by june 30 
the issue of distributing east german property has generated 
much argument in both germanys 
hans klein spokesman for west german chancellor helmut kohl 
said on wednesday that property seized when the communists assumed 
control of east germany 40 years ago should be given back to the 
original owners 
more than 1 million west germans are expected to lay claim to 
property they or their ancestors left behind when fleeing after 
world war ii or during the communist regime 
east germany wants instead to pay compensation to former owners 
and let east germans have the initial opportunity to buy the 
property 
some west germans already have written letters to tenants of 
east german apartments warning them that they will seek to claim 
the land on which the buildings stand 
east germans also fear high unemployment and rising prices when 
the two nations merge their economies 
east germans have been lining up at grocery stores to stock up 
on food and other household goods creating huge shortages of meat 
milk and other basic necessities officials said 
lawmaker vera wollenberger said meat was selling out in stores 
within one hour of opening in the cities of east berlin and halle 
commerce minister sybille reider said consumer demand has 
increased 300 percent to 400 percent in recent days soap bread 
and other goods are selling out she said

president roh taewoo said thursday 
his talks next week with mikhail s gorbachev will be aimed at 
helping to end hostility on the divided korean peninsula 
roh is scheduled to meet with the soviet president in san 
francisco on monday after gorbachev ends summit talks with 
president bush afterward roh is to meet bush in washington 
the rohgorbachev meeting will be the first between leaders of 
the two nations which have no diplomatic relations 
the talks come at a time when economic ties between seoul and 
moscow are rapidly increasing their twoway trade doubled to 600 
million last year and is expected to surpass 1 billion in 1990 
the meeting also represents the culmination of south koreas 
northern policy which is aimed at fostering ties with 
communist nations able to influence communist north korea since 
that policy went into effect in july 1988 south korea has 
established formal diplomatic relations with every nation in 
eastern europe except albania and east germany 
roh said thursday he will try to use the san francisco talks not 
only to improve ties with the soviet union but also to force open 
north koreas closed society 
the president said he would be trying to make overtures through 
gorbachev to officials in the north korean capital of pyongyang 
since there is no way opened for me to go to pyongyang i have 
to go there by way of moscow aides quoting roh as saying 
chief presidential spokesman lee soojung said roh and gorbachev 
will discuss normalizing relations between seoul and moscow trade 
between the two nations and peace on the korean peninsula 
they will also discuss world affairs with emphasis on the 
situation in northeast asia and discuss ways to help ease tension 
and promote peace on the divided peninsula lee said 
south korea and north korea have been archenemies since the 
division of the peninsula in 1945 the soviet union is a close ally 
and arms provider of north korea 
south and north korea have held sporadic talks on easing 
tensions but little progress has been made

a commercial rocket sustained minor 
damage during a test possibly delaying its june launch with a 
satellite that will study space radiation nasa said thursday 
the unmanned atlascentaur rocket had been scheduled to lift off 
june 23 from cape canaveral air force station with the combined 
release and radiation effects satellite the satellite was not 
inside the rocket at the launch pad when the damage occurred 
a preliminary investigation showed that a highpressure helium 
line failed wednesday as the system was being pressurized said jim 
cast spokesman for the national aeronautics and space 
administration the line failure apparently caused two small holes 
in the rockets interstage adapter 
the launch will be the first of a commercial atlas built by 
general dynamics corp 
general dynamics said it is forming an investigation team to 
determine the cause of the damage and to assess the launch date 
nasa and the air force will participate in the investigation

a courtappointed trustee overseeing the 
sale of jim bakkers bankrupt empire today asked a judge to approve 
a 7 million bid by a california minister for the ptl television 
network 
morris cerullo head of worldwide evangelism inc of san diego 
agreed to purchase ptls remaining assets if he could be guaranteed 
the cable network trustee dennis shedd told us bankruptcy court 
judge thurmond bishop 
cerullo 58 an assemblies of god pastor has an organization 
with branches in great britain canada israel and zimbabwe in 
1978 he unveiled plans for a 100 million world outreach 
center in san diego but unlike bakkers heritage usa complex 10 
miles south of charlotte nc it never materialized 
earlier this month evangelist oral roberts signed a 645 
million contract that gave him the right to buy the cable network 
unless someone else bid more or agreed to buy all of ptls assets 
as a package deal 
in urging bishop to approve the sale of the network to cerullo 
shedd did not mention whether cerullo had signed a contract for 
other ptl assets 
the charlotte nc observer reported today that cerullo signed 
a 52 million contract wednesday that included heritage usa ptls 
former religious theme park and retreat in fort mill 
also wednesday cerullo deposited 7 million in an escrow 
account for the network said brad leggett an attorney 
representing shedd 
shedd has said that any offer he accepts must be paid in full at 
the time of the sale not paid over time 
it was not clear whether the reported 52 million price included 
the 7 million for the television network shedd would not answer 
questions during a recess called so he could confer with attorneys 
cable televisions home box office had asked the bankruptcy 
court to block shedds deal with roberts because it doubted 
roberts could make the 242000 monthly payments for the use of a 
satellite hbo provides for ptl 
ptl has been in bankruptcy proceedings since june 1987 three 
months after bakker resigned in the sexandmoney scandal that led 
up to his 45year federal prison term for fraud and conspiracy 
although the ptl network still carries other evangelists taped 
programs heritage usa where bakker had his studios and church 
has been closed since september the 500acre retreat near fort 
mill also has five restaurants a 10 million water park and two 
500room hotels one of them unfinished it includes about 1700 
undeveloped acres 
last year toronto businessman stephen mernick failed to close 
on a 65 million deal to buy ptl with bank financing the lenders 
wanted title insurance for heritage usa and mernick could not 
obtain it because of a catawba indian lawsuit claiming 144000 
acres of land including the heritage usa site was illegally sold 
to the state in 1840

in a public relations effort gone awry a 
newspaperman who had criticized national guard flyovers as 
dangerous was invited along on a flight exercise and nearly was 
killed in a crash that destroyed two jets 
the two a7 fighter jets of the south dakota air national guard 
collided over northwestern iowa on wednesday raining debris on a 
soybean field 
both pilots and ward bushee executive editor of the sioux falls 
sd argus leader ejected the pilots were uninjured but bushee 
was taken by ambulance 70 miles to a sioux falls hospital where he 
was in fair condition 
bushee said that just before the planes collided i saw the 
whites of the other pilots eyes 
after the pilot of his plane hit the ejection release 
everything came apart it was just a ball of flame bushee said 
in an account published in his newspaper 
it was just a surreal scene i was floating up in the air and 
covered with fire my first thought was ill never see my wife 
and kids again this is it 
pieces of the plane were going by flames were all over me i 
couldnt remember where the pull was to open the parachute but it 
went open automatically it was like one of those movies the plane 
was spiraling down below me in flames it was completely silent 
bushee 41 had written an editorial in august criticizing 
ceremonial flyovers as noisy and dangerous 
flyovers pose a risk for neighborhoods he wrote what if 
the jet crashed 
the piece apparently led to an invitation to an orientation 
flight which the air guard offers to show civic leaders and 
community personnel what our mission is and why there is an air 
guard said lt ruth christopherson 
weve had no problems until this she said 
bushee 41 suffered a broken vertebra in his neck cuts and 
burns but said he felt lucky to be alive 
ive always been kind of scared of flying i dont like to fly 
that much i think i will fly commercial but i dont think ill 
fly in an a7 soon bushee said its incredible we survived 
it 
the pilots maj gregory gore of collierville tenn and maj 
duncan keirnes of sioux falls were treated at a hospital in 
spencer and released christopherson said 
bushee said it was a clear calm day and the planes were taking 
part in exercises with two other a7s 
we were doing dogfights bushee said one of the planes 
started coming at us and it just seemed like we couldnt get out 
of the way we seemed to be dodging into each other the next 
thing i knew i was ejected out into the air and parachuting down 
the guard was not releasing the names of the two pilots involved 
in the crash the cause of the accident is under investigation

youve seen dick tracy the hype now 
its time for dick tracy the movie 
the disney co screened the warren beattymadonna film for 
reviewers wednesday climaxing months of buildup aimed at 
acquainting potential patrons with the halfforgotten comic strip 
and beattys efforts to convert it into a megahit 
scheduled for wide release on june 15 dick tracy bears 
disneys hopes for another smash like who framed roger rabbit 
the production cost was high estimates range from 23 million to 
30 million for a film with little apparent builtin appeal for 
the younger crowd that is the backbone of todays film audience 
the competition for summer tickets is fierce total recall 
days of thunder and rehashes of die hard robocop 48 
hrs and back to the future against such predictable fare 
dick tracy is distinguished by its originality 
the plot is basic comic strip good cop vs the bad guys chief 
bad guy big boy caprice schemes to rule the metropolis with his 
band of grotesques ranging from flattop to pruneface big boy mows 
down his opposition but his efforts to destroy dick tracy 
repeatedly fail even his luscious moll breathless mahoney cant 
seduce the dedicated cop 
forget the plot the essence of dick tracy lies in 
characters and style and there it exceeds last summers clunky 
overproduced batman 
the characters are outrageous and for the most part 
entertaining dustin hoffman does a delightful bit as the 
unintelligible mumbles al pacino in the best coverup since albert 
finneys hercule poirot in murder on the orient express is 
properly obnoxious as big boy caprice james caan is wasted as the 
gangster spaldoni 
beatty plays tracy straight and true blue theres no wit to the 
character and little sagacity on a scale of 1 to 10 with sherlock 
holmes ranked 10 tracy ranks 3 among fictional detectives but 
tracys very straightness provides a solid core for the film 
after a couple of flops madonna finally registers on the screen 
as the oversexed breathless shes busty and brash with the kind of 
lines what im looking for is a driver preferably one with some 
mileage that lauren bacall used to murmur to humphrey bogart 
as the orphaned kid the only sympathetic character charlie 
korso almost steals the film glenne headly registers nicely in the 
thankless role of tracys patient girlfriend tess trueheart also 
notable mandy patinkin as 88 keys paul sorvino as lips manlis 
charles durning as chief brandon and dick van dyke also 
unrecognizable as district attorney 
richard sylberts design for dick tracy is selfconscious 
but eyefilling the same reds greens blues etc are everywhere 
as in the sunday comics 
director beatty maintains a staccato pace punctuated by danny 
elfmans overpowering score in keeping with the 1930s atmosphere 
beatty uses three extended montages to advance the plot the few 
quiet moments with tess and kid are welcome relief 
disneys touchtone pictures is releasing the film originally 
designed for the walt disney pictures banner the switch seems 
logical since the pgrated film contains madonnas sexual innuendo 
and much gunfire although no blood 
beatty also produced dick tracy the writing passed through 
several hands but the credit goes to jim cash and jack epps jr 
running time 100 minutes

the field of youngsters competing in the 63rd 
annual national spelling bee narrowed today to 65 superspellers as 
the competition became more intense and the words became harder in 
the closing rounds 
after completion of the fourth round almost twothirds of the 
226 young spellers who had made it to the national event had been 
eliminated ninety youths 10 to 14 years in age fell by the 
wayside in the fourth round alone 
they were victims of such words as cerebriform 
cambistry and consanguinity 
take a deep breath one of the judges suggested to william 
aston 13 an eighthgrader from jackson tenn as the youngster 
struggled with the word hamartia 
he did and spelled it correctly to advance to the next round 
heather ambrose 12 of front royal va was not as lucky she 
left the competition after failing to spell sayonara japanese 
for goodbye 
about twothirds of the 226 young spellers who entered the 
national finals survived the opening rounds wednesday and moved on 
to todays competition 
the field was expected to narrow rapidly in early rounds 
wednesday the spellers were given words that had been included in a 
study list of more than 2000 words 
in later rounds today however the words were not in the study 
list 
in wednesdays competition 71 of the 226 competitors fell out 
of the competition after failing to spell such words as 
upeygan ipsedixitism quercitron and other words 
equally challenging 
last year spellers went through 903 words before scott isaacs 
14 of englewood colo won 
the 127 girls and 99 boys who entered this years spelling bee 
competed against nearly 9 million other students at the local level 
to advance to the national contest 
the competition which began in 1925 is sponsored by scripps 
howard newspapers and 208 other daily weekly and sunday newspapers 
in 47 states the champion will win 5000 a trophy cup and 
special prizes from encyclopaedia britannica in all there are 
26550 in cash prizes 
in wednesdays competition eight spellers were eliminated in 
the first round 
the tougher second round took 33 additional contestants 
including erika harrell the only 9yearold and the youngest 
competitor this year the fourthgrader from muncie ind stumbled 
on soliterraneous forgetting the second r 
thirty other contestants fell in the third round 
the youngsters ages 9 to 14 sat on rows of chairs on a stage 
and when it was their turn walked to the microphone to be 
challenged to some the wait was worse than the word 
waiting for your number to come around is the hardest 
melissa lake 14 an eighth grader from denver said between 
rounds she had just spelled correctly erubescent and survived 
the third round with segue

germany loomed as the potential spoiler as 
president bush and soviet president mikhail s gorbachev opened 
talks today gently sparring over the future of the powerful 
european nation 
bush in a white house arrival ceremony for the soviet leader 
hailed the impending unification of east germany with west germany 
as a milestone toward enduring cooperation in a europe whole and 
free 
but mindful of gorbachevs reservations about a more powerful 
neighbor the president assured him we can work together at this 
historic moment to reduce remaining eastwest tensions 
the trenches of the cold war are disappearing gorbachev 
said in response 
but in a thinly veiled reference to his concerns about german 
unification and us demands that the new country have nato 
membership the soviet leader recalled the allies victory over 
nazism in world war ii and earlier the defeat of germany in world 
war i 
gorbachev then pointedly expressed a hope that these horrible 
wars will forever remain a thing of the past 
earlier secretary of state james a baker iii said that all the 
western allies and even some warsaw pact members agree that a 
unified germanys full membership in nato is important to assure 
european stability 
so the soviet union is to some extent alone among the 
nations involved in this who have a problem with it baker said 
on abctvs good morning america 
so our job is to see if we can better explain it see if we 
can find other things that the soviets can point to to justify 
germanys membership in nato to their domestic population 
there were indications the two sides may be in a mood to 
compromise us officials are hinting at negotiations in the 
future to scale down both the german and soviet armies a soviet 
official speaking today on condition of anonymity said the german 
problem should be taken up by the 35 nations that form the european 
security conference 
it was not clear at the outset if the two leaders would find 
ways to resolve the nettlesome issue of germany before it obscures 
the arms control agreements and other accords bush and gorbachev 
have on their agenda 
there should be no attempt to dictate a solution gorbachev 
said in ottawa just before leaving canada for his date with bush 
the soviet leader has repeatedly declared however that the 
united states should find an alternative to nato membership for the 
powerful nation that will be formed when east germany is merged 
with west germany but us officials said there would be no 
retreat from that position nor any deal cut by bush to scale down 
the size of the new german army 
gorbachevs reservations are behind a soviet slowdown in 
multilateral negotiations to cut conventional forces in europe 
including troop levels tanks aircraft helicopters and other 
nonnuclear weapons 
and the issue has clouded other key issues on the summit agenda 
including a framework agreement to slash longrange nuclear 
missiles a halt in the production of chemical weapons and a 
commercial pact to nearly quadruple travel between the two nations 
gorbachev has said time and again as he did in ottawa on 
wednesday that for a united germany to rejoin nato in an era of 
sweeping change and cooperation throughout europe would be a cold 
war affront to the sensibilities of the soviet people who suffered 
greater losses than any other to nazi germany in world war ii 
canadas prime minister brian mulroney expressed some sympathy 
for that point saying he hoped each side would explore 
alternatives 
american and soviet representatives for the fifth day held a 
round of talks at the state department to try to overcome the 
negotiating slump on conventional forces and to expand on the 
categories of longrange nuclear weapons to be reduced in another 
treaty 
they met for an hour and a half in the morning wednesday but 
did not resume in the afternoon everybody would like to see 
things progress but there isnt a lot of progress a us 
official said they are waiting for the rest of the team 
the only evident accomplishment over the four days was an 
agreement tuesday on a definition of tanks and armored personnel 
carriers this will make it easier to reduce us and soviet 
arsenals of the weapons and also to police compliance with a treaty 
but the two leaders will issue joint statements setting goals 
and calling for quick followup talks on future nuclear and 
conventional cutbacks once a new strategic arms reduction treaty is 
finished us officials said 
baker who made arrangements to meet separately at the white 
house with soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze said 
last thursday that bush would press gorbachev at the summit to 
accelerate the troop reduction negotiations 
but gorbachev who got the ball rolling in the first place by 
volunteering to withdraw red army units and tanks from eastern and 
central europe threatened on friday to reconsider his policies if 
the western allies kept insisting on nato membership for germany 
the soviets suffered a loss of at least 20 million people in 
world war ii and with the warsaw pact weakening gorbachev is 
concerned about the reemergency of german military power 
administration officials said last thursday that bush will cut 
no deal with gorbachev to limit german troops but he is prepared 
to discuss a formula that might scale down the size of the red army 
as well 
but the officials said any settlement would require the 
participation and consent of west germany and the other partners in 
the 16nation north atlantic treaty organization 
we are opposed to any proposal which would single out germany 
for special limits marlin fitzwater the white house spokesman 
said 
however bush and gorbachev will discuss the general 
question of german unification and we want to hear their 
concerns and interests fitzwater said 
the formula other us officials said bush was ready to take up 
with gorbachev involved a tradeoff to be negotiated by nato and 
the warsaw pact in vienna after the treaty governing us and 
soviet conventional forces in europe is completed 
the western allies would consider imposing limitations on the 
size of the german army but in exchange the soviets would have to 
agree to cut down the red army proportionally within the soviet 
union said the officials who spoke on condition of anonymity 
and in a concession to gorbachev nato troops would keep out of 
what is now east germany while some red army troops could stay 
there for a transitional period the official said

a wide variety of political and religious 
demonstrators protested discreetly and without incident in 
lafayette square today as president bush and soviet leader mikhail 
s gorbachev began summit talks across the street in the white 
house 
two dozen vietnamese refugees demanding democracy in their 
homeland sang patriotic songs and waved the former flag of south 
vietnam nearby 30 members of the new testament church carried 
banners denouncing the summit both communist bloc and democratic 
rule are satans deceptions read one sign 
a selfdescribed former soviet political prisoner michail 
makarenko was accompanied by a man wearing a gas mask and a 
translator who carried signs calling for the soviet union to get 
out of lithuania 
makarenko criticized the use of poison gas to put down an 
uprising in the soviet republic of georgia and alleged that 8000 
forced labor camps containing 14 million prisoners dot the soviet 
union 
meanwhile a halfdozen buddhists who favor total disarmament 
pounded drums as they sat crosslegged on the ground facing a small 
statue of buddha and burned incense across the park the moscow 
rock group gaza played for the second consecutive day in support of 
a cure for aids 
about a dozen horsemounted police officers and nearly 100 local 
and federal officers patrolled the park and adjacent streets by 
midday there were no arrests of demonstrators 
trees blocked most of the view of the park from the white house 
and the only electronic amplifiers were used by the rock band so 
it was unlikely that bush and gorbachev saw or heard any of the 
colorful protests on the other side of pennsylvania avenue 
us park police sgt peter gentile said about a halfdozen 
organizations involving up to 2000 people had been granted permits 
to demonstrate thursday but gentile estimated that only 150 
protesters had shown up by midmorning 
vietnamese refugee le tuy a 32yearold car restorer who 
arrived in the united states in 1981 said he doubted the us and 
soviet leaders would see his groups prodemocracy demonstration 
we try the best we can to raise our voice the real voice of 
the vietnamese people tuy said with the help of the media we 
can carry our message to the two presidents 
tuys uncle nguyen ngoc bich said the us government still 
has some sway over vietnams leaders 
they need several things from the united states said bich 
who arrived in this country in 1975 they want normalization 
they want to lift the trade embargo we think there should be quid 
pro quo were asking for respect for human rights for freedom to 
be restored and for a return to a more democratic system of 
government 
many groups that reserved space for the entire week at lafayette 
square on the ellipse behind the white house and at the capitols 
reflecting pool planned to make appearances only on certain days 
saturday should be the biggest day for demonstrations said park 
police maj carl holmberg he noted that gorbachev and bush plan to 
spend saturday at camp david the presidential retreat in the 
mountains of western maryland 
in lafayette square on wednesday before gorbachevs arrival 
from canada was concepcion picciotto 45 who has been there since 
1981 as part of an antinuclear peace vigil 
i want to do something for humanity she said she handed 
out leaflets that read every gun that is made every warship 
launched ever rocket fired signifies a theft from those who are 
hungry and are not fed from those who are cold and are not

authorities investigating the killings of 
three young women in five days were trying to determine thursday if 
they were linked to the apparent homicides of five prostitutes over 
the past year in the washington area 
the latest deaths have renewed fears among prostitutes who 
recall that last years epidemic of slayings was never solved said 
prissy williamsgodfrey head of a prostitutionadvocacy group 
alexandria police officer don hayes said detectives are going 
over the background of a woman found dead late wednesday to find if 
she was ever arrested or had any connection to the other women 
killed recently 
the woman whose identity was withheld pending notification of 
relatives was found at the bottom of a grassy embankment she was 
partially clothed wrapped in a plastic bag and had her hands tied 
there was no immediate word on how or when the woman had died 
the bodies of two other women who police said had been arrested 
in the past on prostitution charges were found over the memorial 
day weekend within a mile of each other in neighboring arlington 
county 
we are working with other jurisdictions in the area trying to 
cover all possibilities at this time said arlington detective 
mike rocconi we are following several leads 
he said he could not comment on whether there were similarities 
between the victims and the circumstances of their deaths 
the two deaths followed five killings since april 1989 of women 
authorities said had worked as prostitutes 
autopsies of 20yearold sandra r johnson and 26yearold 
sherry larman showed both women died of asphyxiation

recent tests show that consumers run little 
health risk from drug chemical and pesticide residues in meat and 
poultry agriculture department officials said thursday 
the residue rates are the lowest theyve been in years said 
richard l carnevale assistant deputy administrator of usdas food 
safety and inspection service he released the latest testing 
results at a news briefing 
the tests were performed on a broad range of food animals 
including cattle calves swine goats sheep chickens turkeys 
and ducks 
department officials acknowledged growing consumer concern about 
the residues of pesticides other farm chemicals such as 
fertilizers and drugs in the food that they buy at the grocery 
store 
such residues are found when drugs have been administered 
improperly and when the animals have eaten crops sprayed with 
chemicals 
carnevale however said pesticide and chemical residues were 
not shown to exist in illegal levels in the most recent tests and 
that only a few problems were found with drug residues young veal 
calves were one area of concern he said 
illegal levels of residues were found in only 03 percent of the 
41505 samples tested in the agencys routine monitoring last year 
he said 
the food safety and inspection service conducts three types of 
residue testing programs carnevale said the routine monitoring 
system provides us with the most meaningful residue statistics 
he said the results of testing 41000 samples showed that 
statistically fewer than one out of 100 animals marketed contained 
illegal residues and perhaps as few as one in 1000 
he did announce that as a result of the test findings producers 
and others will have to present a full complement of signed 
statements before socalled bob veal calves less than 3 weeks old 
or 150 pounds would be accepted for slaughter 
carnevale said that certification program was needed because the 
monitoring program found 38 instances in which calves primarily of 
the bob veal variety contained excessive levels of sulfa and 
antibiotic compounds 
tests also showed high levels of sulfa residues in cull dairy 
cows ones that are no longer producing milk and are on their way 
to slaughter carnevale said he said the potent antibiotic 
gentamicin is being used frequently in food animals even though 
that is not permitted 
he said usda officials are notifying dairy producers through 
organizations such as the national milk producers federation that 
better control of the use of such drugs in cull animals is needed 
carnevale said the high levels of sulfa and antibiotics are 
being found in the bob veal calves and cull animals because they 
are the most susceptible to infection and in some cases the 
farmer is trying to keep them alive and using everything he can 
find to get them to market

more than 50 years after their deaths 
circus magnate john ringling and his wife mable may be on their 
way to a final resting place 
the 2nd district court of appeal in lakeland on wednesday upheld 
a judges order last year allowing burial of the ringlings at the 
sarasota art museum that bears their name 
sarasota was the winter home of the ringling bros and barnum amp 
bailey circus and the ringlings were benefactors of the museum 
ringling died in 1936 seven years after his wife 
it means were prepared to move forward with the appropriate 
memorial said lawyer lamar matthews 
matthews represents ringlings nephew henry ringling north in 
his quest to have the couple buried at the museum alongside norths 
mother ida north who was ringlings sister 
pat buck a grandniece of ringling had opposed burying mrs 
north with the ringlings because she had nothing to do with the 
circus 
because of the dispute mrs norths body has been in storage at 
a sarasota funeral home since her death in 1950 
north had the ringlings bodies moved in 1987 from fairview 
nj to crypts at a cemetery in nearby port charlotte 
buck and other relatives had taken the burial dispute into 
court family discord dates back over decades 
the stateowned museums board of trustees voted 81 last year 
to allow the burials on the museum grounds provided family 
differences could be worked out museum director laurence ruggiero 
said he believes the appeals ruling will settle that question and 
allow the burials 
as soon as i get assured by our attorney that the legal stuff 
is over with were going to proceed ruggiero said 
secretary of state jim smith whose office oversees the museum 
also has endorsed the burials

orders to us factories slumped 23 percent in 
april helping to push orders for the year so far down 2 percent 
the government said thursday in a report showing further evidence of 
a slow manufacturing economy 
basically it shows the manufacturing sector is still dead in 
the water said evelina tainer senior domestic economist with the 
first national bank of chicago its just not going anywhere 
the commerce department said orders to factories for both durable 
and nondurable manufactured goods totaled a seasonally adjusted 
2356 billion that followed gains of 4 percent in march and 18 
percent in february 
despite the gains the april decline and a 55 percent drop in 
january means factory orders have fallen 2 percent in the years 
first four months and the department said orders have been 
relatively flat since the beginning of 1989 
the january decline was the steepest since a 7 percent plunge in 
december 1974 
factory orders are a key economic barometer of manufacturing 
industry plans for production a decrease in orders may forecast a 
slump in that sector and layoffs in the future 
the decrease in april new orders was concentrated in the 
durable goods sector which declined 43 percent to 1234 
billion the department said revising the drop in durable orders 
from the 41 percent decline first reported last week 
the largest decrease was in transportation equipment down 
147 percent to 317 billion it added both motor vehicles and 
aircraft were down excluding transportation orders were 
unchanged 
transportation orders had risen 241 percent in march and 101 
percent in february 
also unchanged during april were nondurable orders which 
remained at 1122 billion 
in the key category of nondefense capital goods a barometer of 
business investment plans orders fell 98 percent to 369 billion 
after a 133 percent gain the previous month excluding aircraft 
they were off 02 percent in april and 11 percent in march 
michael k evans of evans economics inc a washington 
forecasting firm said the capital goods spending report spells bad 
news for industrial production 
businesses are starting to pull in their horns evans said 
because of high interest rates and a 16 percent decline in profits 
last year and in the first quarter theyre not getting any 
better 
the volatile defense category posted a 2 percent gain to 8 
billion after advances of 45 percent in march and 183 percent in 
february excluding defense orders fell 24 percent 
inventories ticked up 01 percent to 3723 billion following two 
months of declines but ms tainer said they remain lean 
if inventories were to increase without a corresponding gain in 
orders production cutbacks could occur as factories try to get rid 
of goods stored on shelves and backlots often causing job layoffs 
besides transportation orders other durable declines included 
orders for nonelectrical machinery down 29 percent to 217 
billion and primary metals down 14 percent to 116 billion 
electrical machinery orders rose 4 percent to 204 billion after 
falling 17 percent in march and rising 28 percent in february

robert edward turner iii aka terrible 
ted mouth of the south and captain outrageous is short 
on words and long on bravado 
even when someone is writing a book about his baby the cable 
news network 
teds out there said author hank whittemore in what may be 
one of the understatements of the decade hes like a brief 
tornado in your life 
whittemore has written cnn the inside story a 308page 
chronicle of the little network that could its release friday by 
little brown amp co coincides with cnns 10th birthday 
excerpts have appeared in tv guide some of the stories in the 
book have been told more times in more journalistic watering holes 
than dan rathers infamous sevenminute stroll off a live cbs 
newscast 
take for example the time a light bulb exploded in the cnn 
washington bureau and ignited the clothing of oncamera reporter dan 
schorr or the time weatherman stu siroka was victimized by the 
chromakey process which allows one picture to be placed behind 
another all viewers saw was sirokas bald head suspended above the 
weather map 
take turner who after agreeing to cooperate with whittemore 
would walk in to scheduled interviews and say hi hank how much 
time you want ive got about nine minutes 
whittemore spent six months interviewing present and former cnn 
movers and shakers his account tells a spirited and sometimes 
bizarre tale of how turner equipped with 100 million and even more 
chutzpah screamed bullied sued cajoled and bankrolled his way 
into television history by launching the first 24hour allnews 
network 
on cable 
and here is whittemore the author a best seller called the 
super cops magazine articles and television documentaries on a 
nationwide tour to promote his book and calling from a pay phone in 
washingtons national airport 
asked to explain turner whittemore pauses there was an awards 
dinner in kansas city that whittemore attended recently now im 
still working on the book whittemore recounted and he comes up 
to me and says what are you going to write about me just dont 
make me out to be an ass 
then he looks around and kind of beams and says well maybe i 
was 
i felt like i was in a harold robbins novel whittemore says 
and laughs 
the man will say the most outrageous things and you wonder is 
the man just not thinking or is he being very calculating 
whittemore talked not only to turner he spent hours with ted 
kavanau an early cnn executive who became president of headline 
news only to be forced out and reese schonfeld the networks 
founding president who also left as well as former anchor mary 
alice williams now with nbc and several others 
cnn the inside story begins in a dilapidated white clapboard 
house that was the networks first home and ends in the megalomaniac 
structure in atlanta that now houses the international news agency 
it copiously notes many weird tales of the upstart network from 
the early days when work crews were literally finishing the set as 
anchor bernard shaw read the news 
and the time a cleaning woman not knowing shaw was on live 
walked right up to his desk and emptied his trash basket and the 
time a reporter said that mary ass williams was standing by and 
yet another instance when a correspondent reported that scientists 
were trying to grow genetically engineered orgasms in the 
laboratory 
but gaffes are not the only events noted loud and clear 
whittemores book comes through with the underlying theme that cnn 
made television history by making the big three sit up and take 
notice 
and by making cbs nbc and abc reluctantly admit they were no 
longer the only games in town 
roundtheclock news coverage gave cnn a number of firsts 
president reagan walking into a washington dc hospital after 
being shot a splitscreen of the hostages being released in iran as 
reagan was sworn into office and a lonely cameraman perched atop a 
cherrypicker with the only live feed of a nuclear warhead being 
removed after an air force explosion in arkansas 
it seems to me that what they want to do is wire the entire 
world whittemore said they want to be totally global in terms 
of sending and receiving signals so that you get what turner calls 
the world talking to itself

a defunct storage company and its former 
president have been charged with conspiracy to illegally dispose of 
hazardous wastes including surplus napalm bombs near peoples 
homes officials said today 
this case represents perhaps the most serious type of 
environmental misconduct us attorney general dick thornburgh 
said at a news conference 
he said that the 12count federal grand jury indictment was the 
first federal felony prosecution of environmental crime in utah 
the company ekotek and its officers had duped environmentally 
conscious businesses into believing that waste materials were being 
properly disposed of thornburgh said 
the indictment alleges the company knowingly burned poured out 
and improperly stored a variety of hazardous wastes in violation of 
an array of state and federal laws in the middle and late 1980s 
the site is now on the superfund cleanup list 
among the incidents leading to the indictment was that of a 
17yearold boy who reported that his shoe began to bubble and 
disintegrate after he accidentally stepped in some liquid while 
running near the site officials said tests have been conducted 
around 125 homes near the site 
the charges were filed wednesday afternoon in us district 
court 
named in the indictment were ekotek and steven m self the 
companys president the company was involuntarily dissolved nov 1 
if convicted on all charges self could face a prison term of up 
to 45 years and he and the company would face up to 24 million in 
fine 
company vice president steven f miller pleaded guilty wednesday 
to felony charges of conspiracy and violations of federal resource 
conservation and recovery laws and the clean water act thornburgh 
said 
miller was allowed to plead guilty in exchange for his 
cooperation in the prosecution of self authorities said he could 
face up to 13 years in prison and a 750000 fine sentencing was 
set for july 10 
self and his company are alleged to have purchased millions of 
gallons of oil and solvents and burned them as fuel in a refinery 
in northern salt lake city about three miles northwest of the 
downtown area the burning violated the federal clean air act in 
other cases wastes were illegally poured into storm drains or 
stored in an improper manner 
state department of health officials said tens of thousands of 
gallons of the wastes have leaked into the ground and contaminated 
nearby homes 
in addition the indictment alleges that in july 1986 self 
arranged to accept two napalm bombs for testing storage and 
treatment from the navy weapons support center in fallbrook 
calif state explosives experts had to haul the bombs away and 
dispose of them in 1987 
the site currently being cleaned up through the environmental 
protection agencys superfund program reportedly still contains 
almost a half million gallons of used petroleum products and other 
toxic wastes in leaking tanks and drums 
among the chemicals found at the plant were poisonous 
polychlorinated biphenyls or pcbs methylene chloride which has 
been linked to tumors and the toxic solvents nbutyl acetate 
methyl ethyl ketone toluene and xylene 
the site was identified for epa cleanup in 1988 the agency has 
identified 32 companies as being responsible for cleanup of 
approximately 500000 gallons of aging used petroleum products and 
other hazardous wastes at the site 
ekotekpetrochem formerly operated an oil refinery on the site 
the state division of environmental health had determined it might 
pose a risk to nearby residents and the epa took soil samples from 
land surrounding about 125 homes earlier this year

schools and other owners of old water coolers 
that put too much lead into drinking water can receive free 
replacements under a final agreement announced thursday by the us 
consumer product safety commission 
under terms of the consent agreement the halsey taylor division 
of scotsman group inc will mail notices of the replacement offer to 
public and private school officials universities and colleges day 
care centers with enrollments of 10 or more and headquarters for 
the ymca the ywca and boys and girls clubs 
it also will run advertisements in trade journals aimed at public 
building managers 
the offer to provide either a replacement cooler or a cash refund 
at the option of the cooler owner applies to any halsey taylor 
model made prior to 1979 that tests show emits excessive amounts of 
lead more than 20 parts per billion into the water passing 
through it 
halsey taylor models made since 1979 do not have internal water 
storage tanks and are not under suspicion the consumer product 
safety commission maintains that a leaddip used on the exterior of 
some pre1979 models to help attach cooling coils to the tank 
resulted in lead migrating to the inside of the tank and into the 
stored water 
the vernon hills ill company denied that any of its products 
constituted a health risk but said in a statement signed on april 2 
by scotsman group president richard c osborne that it was agreeing 
to the replacement program for the purpose of resolving this 
matter without resorting to protracted administrative and judicial 
proceedings 
at a news conference to publicize the replacement program 
commission officials said they could not estimate how many of the 
thousands of pre1979 halsey taylor water coolers might dispense 
water with unacceptably high lead levels and that the only way to 
be sure is to test each cooler 
one complication is that such lead levels could be in the water 
before it reached the cooler 
michael cooke head of the environmental protection agencys 
drinking water office said thousands of epa tests at schools have 
disclosed unacceptably high lead levels at 10 percent to 20 percent 
of outlets tested however outlets are not limited to water 
coolers they also include bathroom and kitchen sinks and uncooled 
water fountains 
the company has established a tollfree number to provide further 
information 18006352358 and has designated a special mailing 
address halsey taylor water cooler program 775 corporate woods

boris n yeltsin the new president of the russian 
federation and a leading critic of mikhail s gorbachev said 
thursday he will try to make peace in his personal feud with the 
soviet president 
yeltsin a radical reformer was quoted by the official tass news 
agency as saying he would put aside personal differences with 
gorbachev when the president returns from the washington summit 
yeltsin was seeking to calm the fears of the deputies of the 
republics congress about his stormy relationship with gorbachev 
his former mentor 
in his new position as president of russia the largest soviet 
republic yeltsin has a formidable platform from which to challenge 
and criticize gorbachev who opposed his election 
deputies speaking thursday at the russian congress expressed 
concern over the exchange of statements about each other by 
yeltsin and gorbachev tass reported 
yeltsin answered that after gorbachev returns june 4 from the 
summit in washington i think well have an appropriate 
conversation and well resolve most issues without damaging the 
sovereignty and aims of russia tass said 
at a news conference wednesday yeltsin called for achieving 
russian sovereignty within 100 days the term is used here to 
mean not independence but autonomy in most internal decisions 
yeltsin also urged the kremlin to allow the other 14 republics to 
enjoy the same autonomy making the country a federation of states 
that could overrule the central government on most matters 
although yeltsin said he wanted a businesslike relationship 
with gorbachev he also made an oblique call thursday for gorbachev 
to give up one of his posts either soviet president or communist 
party general secretary 
i am against combining any post in one person and i am talking 
not just about the chairmanship of the party at the russian level 
at the regional level or at the local level he said 
in ottawa on tuesday gorbachev said he was somewhat 
concerned about yeltsins victory and feared that if yeltsin is 
playing a political game then we may be in for a difficult time 
there have been no reports that gorbachev sent congratulations to 
yeltsin on his election 
gorbachev brought yeltsin to moscow to head the citys communist 
party but fired him in 1987 after yeltsin publicly criticized the 
pace of reform relations have been strained ever since 
yeltsin capped a remarkable political comeback by winning 
election tuesday as russian president 
however at thursdays session of the russian congress deputy 
ivan galushko from the jewish autonomous region in the soviet far 
east said yeltsin was overstepping his authority with some of his 
statements the day before 
he called on yeltsin to refrain from hasty statements on 
questions that are within the competence of the congress or supreme 
soviet 
tass said many deputies seconded galushkos opinion 
in his reply yeltsin acknowledged disagreements with gorbachev 
but said he would put them aside 
true we have our differences said yeltsin i renounce all 
these personal aspects fully and completely i leave that behind 
a deputy of the national supreme soviet legislature anatoly 
denisov said in an interview that the differences between yeltsin 
and gorbachev are so pronounced they portend very bad 
consequences and difficult conflicts for the nation 
he said they could lead to the imposition of soviet presidential 
rule nationwide

two dozen vietnamese refugees waved the former 
south vietnamese flag and sang patriotic songs as they urged 
president bush and soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev on thursday to 
push for democracy in their homeland 
they were but one of many ethnic political and religious groups 
trying to send a message across pennsylvania avenue to the 
superpower leaders meeting in the white house 
at the height there were some 400 people massed in lafayette 
park according to maj carl holmberg of the us park police he 
said there were no arrests by early afternoon 
the orderly protesters included a selfdescribed former soviet 
political prisoner a halfdozen koreans and the same number of 
buddhists and about 75 cubans who were moved to the ellipse behind 
the white house also gathered there were some 30 members of the new 
testament church afghans who want the soviet union to stop 
supporting the government there and a moscow rock band that wants 
the two nations to cure aids not build more missiles 
police presence was heavy about a dozen horsemounted officers 
plus close to 100 local and federal officers patrolled the park and 
kept demonstrators and pedestrians away from pennsylvania avenue 
when gorbachev was inside the white house 
trees block most of the view between the park and the white 
house and the only electronic amplification was used by the rock 
group so it was unlikely gorbachev or bush heard or saw any of the 
colorful protests 
holmberg predicted that saturday would be the biggest day for 
demonstrations even though bush and gorbachev are scheduled to be 
out of town then at camp david the president retreat in maryland 
vietnamese refugee le tuy who arrived here in 1981 said he 
expected the us and soviet leaders would not see his groups signs 
or hear its songs but he said with the help of the media we can 
carry our message to the two presidents 
tuys uncle nguyen ngoc bich contended that despite the vietnam 
war the us government still has some sway over the current 
leaders in vietnam 
they need several things from the united states said bich 
who arrived here in 1975 they want normalization they want to 
lift the trade embargo we think there should be quid pro quo were 
asking for respect for human rights for freedom to be restored and 
for a return to a more democratic system of government

a former mental patient who once tried to 
hijack a plane killed his 75yearold father took a woman hostage 
at an eye clinic and cut his own throat before police captured him 
authorities said 
ralph adolphys hughes 38 was in stable condition at a tyler 
hospital thursday with a selfinflicted knife wound to his throat 
and two police gunshot wounds to the leg authorities said 
the tactical officers fired two shots when they went in but 
none were lifethreatening said lt robin roberts he did cut 
his throat he cut a fairly good gash but nothing lifethreatening 
the woman hughes held hostage for 3 hours wednesday wasnt 
injured 
police found the body of hughes father leon in the vehicle the 
younger hughes drove to the dehaven eye associates clinic where 
barbara shamburger was taken hostage 
right now it looks like they had some kind of argument in the 
car said tom giorgio a police spokesman 
he said god made him do it thats what he told his mother on 
the phone justice of the peace bill beaird said 
he said an autopsy showed the elder hughes died of two stab 
wounds to the heart 
investigators filed murder aggravated assault and aggravated 
kidnapping charges against hughes beaird recommended that hughes be 
held in lieu of 1 million bond when he is arraigned 
in 1987 hughes was acquitted of an air piracy charge by reason 
of insanity he was accused of holding a flight attendant at 
knifepoint moments before a plane carrying 200 people landed at 
dallasfort worth international airport on feb 5 1986 no one was 
harmed 
defense attorney rh wallace said at the time that hughes had 
regained his sanity and would be all right as long as hes on 
medication 
police said hughes appeared wednesday at television station kltv 
brandishing a knife he was covered with blood and demanded to be 
allowed on the air he left after station employees called police 
said giorgio 
shortly after that hughes entered the eye clinic said donna 
rayborn the clinics manager of administrative services ms 
rayborn said the clinic employs about 60 people and had about 10 
patients inside at the time 
detectives had not determined a reason for hughes behavior 
giorgio said 
we tried to negotiate with him giorgio said they waited 
as long as they could but about 3 hours into it they decided the 
negotiations were going nowhere and they went in 
police knocked out a window at the clinic and threw in a stun 
grenade before rescuing mrs shamburger 
psychiatrists who treated hughes after the plane incident said he 
was schizophrenic and unable to distinguish friends from enemies 
during the hijacking attempt authorities said hughes demanded 
protection for himself and his family from mob killers who he 
believed were on the plane he said killers were after him because 
of a romantic relationship he had with the girlfriend of a narcotics 
kingpin

lawmakers on thursday repealed a 
40yearold law giving east german resettlers special benefits and 
they tightened rules on ethnic germans emigrating from elsewhere in 
eastern europe 
the decision to repeal the law on resettlers is expected to gain 
automatic approval of the bundesrat or upper house of parliament 
the effective date for repealing the law is july 1 one day 
before monetary social and economic union of the two germanys is to 
take effect 
the law provided special benefits including housing and 
financial assistance for east german resettlers to west germany and 
granted them automatic west german citizenship 
repealing the law means that east germans will be treated exactly 
like west germans who decide to move to other parts of the country 
more than 500000 east germans have resettled in west germany 
since january 1989 
the influx last fall brought on the downfall of the hardline 
east german communist government and led to the countrys first free 
elections in march 
but east germans continued to flood into west germany straining 
west germanys already tight housing and social services 
chancellor helmut kohls government resisted cutting the 
resettlers benefits until the monetary union takes effect 
in addition to the east germans some 175000 ethnic germans from 
other east european countries have arrived in west germany this year 
the legislators thursday tightened requirements for ethnic 
germans emirgating from east europe they must now apply at west 
german embassies to be recognized as ethnic germans in their 
homelands before they are granted permission to immigrate to west 
germany 
in the past the emigres could arrive in west germany and then 
apply to be recognized as ethnic germans

usdas agricultural marketing service is 
proposing to lower from 25 percent to 22 percent the limit on fat in 
ground beef under its institutional meat purchase specifications 
used by schools hospitals and the armed services 
the change would be part of a broader revision of the 
institutional meat specifications the department announced it said 
the move was designed to reflect increased consumer interest in 
lowerfat beef 
its a step in the right direction said bonnie liebman 
director of nutrition for the washingtonbased center for science in 
the public interest they could do more 
currently usda defines lean beef as having no more than 10 
percent fat by weight but makes an exception for ground beef and 
puts its level at 225 percent thats why i like to speak of 
socalled lean ground beef liebman said regular ground beef can 
range up to 30 percent fat by weight 
under the institutional purchase specifications the limit 
applies only if the buyer does not negotiate to obtain the beef at a 
different level of fat

the british mad cow disease has now made britain 
mad at france which rejected demands thursday that it lift its ban 
on imports of beef from across the channel 
british officials were irate when france imposed the temporary 
ban on british beef wednesday the french say the beef may be 
tainted by bovine spongiform encephalitis the nervous disorder 
known as mad cow disease 
taking up britains cause the european community on thursday 
criticized the french action and demanded the ban be lifted 
but french agriculture minister henri nallet said the ban will 
stay in place at least until the return this weekend of a team of 
french veterinarians sent to britain to assess the disease 
nallet acknowledged that his difficult decision had been 
denounced abroad but said he acted to avert worry and panic 
among french consumers 
france buys more than half of britains beef exports by far the 
biggest market british officials accused france of using the 
disease as an excuse to protect frances domestic market 
they ought to lift that ban straightaway said francis maud 
british minister of state in the foreign and commonwealth office 
british beef is perfectly safe all the scientific evidence 
points in that direction this french ban is unjustified and clearly 
in breach of community law and as good europeans we find that 
intolerable 
other western european countries have banned imports of cattle 
from britain but they have not banned beef imports 
two associations representing the french beef industry praised 
the ban saying their profits were being hurt by a flood of 
lowpriced beef imports after british customers began shying away 
from the product 
not all the french took the ban seriously jacques cagna a 
wellknown paris chef posed for a photograph in his restaurant 
holding a platter of british beef which he vowed to serve to his 
patrons 
the cause of the disease is not known because the symptoms are 
similar to scrapie a sheep disease it is assumed the disease was 
transmitted through cattle feeds they use sheep offal as a protein 
supplement 
the british government is sponsoring research on the disease 
which was identified in britain in 1986 the outbreak has largely 
been confined there 
the disease which has killed 13648 cows in britain eats holes 
in the brains of infected cattle and makes their tissue spongy 
british officials say there is no indication the disease can be 
transmitted to humans but beef sales have dropped sharply in 
britain 
the european community commission in its statement thursday 
said it regrets the action of the french authorities taken 
without prior consultation 
ec agricultural commissioner ray mcsharry said there was 
absolutely no justification for frances action

lower prices and higher consumer incomes 
boosted the typical american familys ability to buy an existing 
singlefamily home in april a real estate trade group said thursday 
the national association of realtors said its housing 
affordability index reached 1046 in april up from 1039 in march 
that means a family earning the median income of 34032 had 
1046 percent of the income needed to qualify for conventional 
financing covering 80 percent of a medianpriced home costing 
95300 
the median income means half the families earned more and half 
less the median price means half of the homes cost more half less 
the median price of a home in april declined 1000 from march 
meaning the income needed to qualify for a loan dropped 96 to 
32544 at the same time the median family income rose 108 
realtors president norman d flynn said the typical price of an 
existing home in many cities is below the national median 
the commerce department reported on wednesday that the median 
price of a new home was 135900 in april but analysts generally 
agreed that reflected a big jump in new home sales in the expensive 
northeastern market that month the median had been 119400 in 
march 
the housing affordability index would have been higher in april 
the realtors said except for an increase in the interest rate used 
to compute the index from 1007 percent in march to 1015 percent in 
april 
the mortgage rate used to calculate the index is a composite of 
closing rates offered for both fixedrate mortgages and 
adjustablerate mortgages for existing homes as reported by the 
federal housing finance board 
we do expect a gradual decline in rates in the third quarter to 
stimulate a healthy home buying season this summer said john a 
tuccillo the realtors chief economist 
the realtors said the changes in the index home price mortgage 
rate and income resulted in a 2 decrease in monthly mortgage 
payments to 678 
under aprils affordability conditions the realtors said a 
family earning 20000 would qualify for a 58500 home using a 
46800 loan a family earning 30000 would qualify for a 87500 
home with a 70200 loan a family earning 40000 would qualify for 
a 117000 home with a 93600 loan and a family with 50000 
income would qualify for a 146300 home with a 117000 loan 
but flynn noted buyers may still face a major hurdle in obtaining 
down payments even with incomes sufficient to qualify for loans

is stable and she will be admitted to the hospital he said 
asked whether the condition she suffered today could be 
stressrelated he said it could be asked if it was 
lifethreatening he said not at the moment

mrs marcos lawyers 
it was the third time in the past month and the most serious 
that mrs marcos became ill in court prompting the judge to call a

after several minutes of confusion

in the day when informed that mrs marcos was feeling ill but that 
mrs marcos wanted to continue she didnt want the trial 
recessed 
according to james linn attorney for mrs marcos codefendant 
adnan khashoggi mrs marcos hemorrhaged from her nose and mouth as 
she fell forward and clutched her left hand to the side of her head 
it was terrible said khashoggi i never saw so much blood 
come out of someone 
linn who was sitting with his client about eight feet from mrs 
marcos said she appeared to have fainted others said she 
apparently was not fully conscious as she was taken from the 
courtroom 
keenan recessed the trial until tuesday

involving her family was being heard the witness robert shaheen 
had just finished telling about dealings between mrs marcos and her 
husband the late president ferdinand marcos and khashoggi 
mrs marcos is accused of having helped her late husband steal 
more than 220 million from their countrys treasury he was deposed

hawaii 
khashoggi is charged with fraud and obstructing justice for 
allegedly faking documents to show that he owned real estate and

east german lawmakers thursday gave the 
government broad powers to seize land houses and businesses 
controlled by the privileged elite of the old communist regime 
the action freezes the partys vast holdings amassed after it 
came to power after world war ii just four weeks before the nation 
merges its economy with west germanys and begins shifting state 
property to the private sector 
lawmakers also voted to remove the old communist insignia a 
hammer and drafting compass from state buildings 
the government of prime minister lothar de maiziere had asked 
parliament to let him form a commission that would have the power to 
wrest away the holdings of the many organizations that existed under 
the former government 
de maiziere is to form the commission in the coming days after 
which all land buildings and enterprises owned by the communists 
would be held in trust pending an investigation of their value and 
legitimacy 
the new law also gives the commission power to interrogate 
witnesses search houses and seize evidence during its investigation 
the law calls for a system to be set up under which the 
government could reclaim the property in the public interest even 
if the property is in other countries 
the proposal came as the young democratic government grapples 
with the monumental task of converting stateowned property to 
private ownership a prerequisite to unification with west germany 
the german states are to merge their economies and social 
institutions on july 2 when west german currency will become the 
currency of east germany 
the independent property commission is to report its findings to 
parliament just two days before the economic union becomes official 
lawmaker gregor gysi leader of the reconstituted communist party 
that now supports a form of democratic socialism sharply criticized 
the proposal during a bitter ninehour parliament session 
they want all opposition eliminated said gysi whose party 
is now called the party of democratic socialism that is the goal 
and nothing else 
he said his party already has surrendered a large part of its 
property 
richard schroeder leader of the social democratic lawmakers in 
parliament said the proposal is aimed at shedding light on who owns 
what in the country 
we should bring clarity and light to the property proportion 
he said we have the impression that the history of the former 
communist party property is still being written 
the property investigation would cover all parties unions and 
organizations that came into being after 1945 but is clearly aimed 
at the assets of the old regime 
it would technically include de maizieres own christian 
democrats who were allowed to exist as a formal party 
large amounts of property are believed held by former communists 
prosecutors on thursday charged a former district communist party 
chief from the city of erfurt gerhard mueller with breach of trust 
and theft the government news agency adn said 
mueller 62 was arrested in december he is accused of building 
a luxurious hunting lodge with three baths at a cost of 210000 in 
public money 
many questions remain about the pace and process of distributing 
land and industries owned by the state to private hands 
west germany wants west germans to be able to reclaim any 
property they lost in east germany when the communists came to 
power east germany wants its citizens to have first crack at the 
property 
east germans are expected to face a rough transition to a free 
market in july widespread joblessness and rising prices are 
expected as socialist subsidies are eliminated and outmoded 
statesupported factories are forced to compete 
east germans fearing higher prices have been lining up at grocery 
stores to stock up on food and other household goods creating huge 
shortages of meat milk and other necessities officials said 
lawmaker vera wollenberger said meat was selling out in stores 
within one hour of opening in the cities of east berlin and halle 
commerce minister sybille reider said consumer demand has 
increased 300 percent to 400 percent in recent days soap bread and 
other goods are selling out she said 
a line formed early thursday at a large east berlin grocery store 
selling both east german and west german goods 
clerk jutta petrick said the crush of hoarders began about two 
weeks ago we are running out of everything she said gesturing 
to the sparse shelves

san francisco officials dont want to wait 
until the next big earthquake to repair and protect about two dozen 
municipal buildings including city hall from the ravages of a 
major tremor 
so nearly eight months after the oct 17 quake voters are being 
asked tuesday to approve the citys largestever bond measure to pay 
for quake repairs and quakeproofing 
mayor art agnos and other city leaders are pushing proposition a 
which would allow the city to raise 332 million to pay for quake 
repairs and seismic improvements to the cityowned buildings during 
the next decade 
you cannot escape the reality that this work has to be done 
said rudy nothenberg the citys chief administrative officer 
there has been little controversy surrounding proposition a he 
said the measure has been unanimously endorsed by the city board of 
supervisors and faces no opposition from other groups 
this is work the city would have had to do in any event sooner 
or later and given our experience in the last year we thought 
sooner rather than later said nothenberg 
the biggest chunk of the money 207 million would be spent 
preparing about 20 buildings including city hall and the war 
memorial opera house for another quake 
the second priority would be addressing the estimated 53 million 
in needed earthquakedamage repairs left over from the october quake 
an additional 26 million would be spent to fix underground sewer 
lines and pipes at the san francisco zoo that fractured in the quake 
the federal government may eventually reimburse the city for an 
undetermined amount of the repair costs nothenberg said 
the quake which measured 71 on the richter scale caused more 
than 7 billion in damage in northern california 
a month after the earthquake voters approved an 60 million bond 
issue for emergency repairs and some initial seismic strengthening 
most of the buildings on the proposition a list are in critical 
need of strengthening or repairs because of the numbers of people 
that use them 
city hall requires the most timeconsuming and expensive work 
it will cost about 94 million to make the building more quake 
resistant through a method called base isolation nothenberg 
said 
city hall would be separated from its foundation and placed on 
rollers that would absorb some of the shock when the next quake 
hits he said an additional 23 million would be spent to fix a 
crack in the plaster of the rotunda and reattach loose marble on 
walls and archways 
the bond issue also would pay for less expensive repairs and 
reinforcements to the 3000seat opera house the 10000seat civic 
auditorium the veterans building and the public health building

however big the headlines this weeks summit 
seems unlikely to provide mikhail s gorbachev with any quick 
solutions to the burgeoning economic and political trouble at home 
the soviet leader said as much thursday telling an enrapt american 
audience that his reforms will depend on time and ingenuity 
one has to wait nine months before a child is born he said 
one translation quoted gorbachev this way soviet thinkers he said 
will have to twist their brains to achieve a successful 
marketoriented economy 
in his animated luncheon remarks gorbachev appealed for western 
patience as he grapples with the lithuanian independence movement 
his approach he said is to be very cautious to consider a 
matter seven times or even 100 times before one takes a decision 
his summit partner president bush has questioned gorbachevs 
action not his caution over lithuania the kremlin leader 
slapped an economic blockade on the republic and has declined to 
lift it 
even as gorbachev asked for forbearance bush pointedly mentioned 
lithuania as an area that divides the two nations and there is 
little on the summit agenda that is likely to ease the baltic 
rebellion or help the soviet economy 
over the next four days were not going to solve all of the 
worlds problems bush said in his welcoming remarks to gorbachev 
he might have added nor the soviet unions 
burning ethnic rivalries and growing nationalism in several 
soviet republics continue to threaten the stability of the union 
gorbachevs plan to raise food prices touched off panic buying and 
emptied store shelves 
and political nemesis boris yeltsin won the presidency of russia 
the vast republic that stretches the length of the soviet union with 
more land and people than the other 14 republics combined yeltsin 
immediately announced he would seek sovereignty for russia giving 
its laws precedence over national law and effectively weakening the 
union over which gorbachev presides 
the white house in recent months has expressed a desire to 
buttress gorbachev at home after concluding that soviet stability 
and gorbachevs political survival are in the us interest 
overriding anxiety over issues such as lithuania 
agreement on a new trade pact which would provide some tangible 
benefits for the soviets is essentially at hand but bush has 
backed away from signing it he initially cited the soviet 
parliaments postponement of passage of a new law liberalizing 
emigration policies now the administration is linking agreement on 
trade with the lifting of moscows economic blockade against the 
tiny baltic republic 
even with a trade agreement the soviets would enjoy few 
immediate benefits because their industries do not now produce much 
that could compete on world markets improving production through 
better training quality control and industrial design will take 
years in an economy that has effectively destroyed the work ethic 
and has yet to implement longpromised market incentives 
the soviet president has argued passionately for trade 
concessions to help his country pull out of its economic tailspin 
but few suggest there is anything short of a massive airlift that 
could work fast enough to have an impact on the problems feeding 
present public anxieties 
gorbachevs other summit goals agreement on cutting nuclear 
weapons by 50 percent eliminating chemical weapons and establishing 
a nonthreatening military posture for a unified germany are 
unlikely to help him much at home where he already has established 
his credentials as a peacemaker but returning empty handed could 
further weaken his stature if he were viewed as losing his 
effectiveness in the international arena 
at their first summit meeting in malta last december gorbachev 
and bush announced they would try to reach broad agreement on 
reducing troops and conventional weapons in europe by their next 
meeting 
that goal has proved elusive and us officials say the soviets 
are stalling and attribute the lack of progress to soviet concern 
about the future of germany other observers have suggested 
gorbachev may want to slow the pace of withdrawal from europe not 
just for security reasons but because he is under pressure from his 
own military which has no place to house homecoming troops and 
little enthusiasm for mustering out large numbers of career officers 
in the shrinking of defense forces

the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff 
welcomed 895 west point cadets to the ranks of commissioned army 
officers thursday and learned that one of them already is gunning 
for his job 
the ambitious cadet is kristin baker 22 who had already risen 
to the top of the academy by becoming brigade commander and the 
first female captain of the corps of cadets 
after gen colin powell told the graduates of the us military 
academy that the united states must maintain a strong military even 
though the prospect of peace is now more than a dream he 
appeared at a news conference with baker 
powell noted that he and baker had been appointed the same day 
last october baker than admitted having aspirations to his job 
it takes a long time she said 
about 30 years powell said 
see me in about 30 years said baker 
powell 53 said the world has changed greatly since he entered 
the military in the 1950s but advised the newly commissioned second 
lieutenants to recognize what has changed and what has not we 
must identify what threats have receded and which have not 
powell said he believes soviet president mikhail gorbachev is 
sincere in wanting to reform his country as he is in making sure 
it continues to play a dominant role in world affairs 
but powell said that despite any economic revolutions one fact 
remains the soviet union will still possess thousands of nuclear 
warheads that can destroy america in 30 minutes we must never allow 
ourselves to be at a nuclear disadvantage 
west points 806 male and 89 female graduates this year list that 
includes robert e lee ulysses s grant douglas macarthur and 
dwight d eisenhower 
women were admitted to west point beginning in 1976 the two 
rhodes scholarships awarded to cadets this year went to women 
jennie koch of potomac md and carolyn ford of pensacola fla 
baker born in dickinson nd deemphasized her role as a woman 
in her job as brigade commander and said there was still a lot to be 
done for women at west point she called her appointment another 
step in a long line of steps being taken for women at the 
188yearold school

israel today urged the united states to end all 
contacts with the plo after seaborne palestinian guerrillas loyal to 
a top plo official tried to attack crowded beaches and hotels on a 
jewish holiday 
but plo chief yasser arafat said the plo was not responsible for 
the attack and that he does not have the authority to take action 
against the plo official whose guerrillas claimed responsibility 
even if he wanted to 
four guerrillas were killed and 12 captured by israeli forces in 
wednesdays libyansponsored infiltration no israelis were harmed 
in the attack even though tens of thousands were on beaches for 
shavuot the jewish holiday that marks the giving of the ten 
commandments 
the palestine liberation front headed by mohammed abbas claimed 
responsibility abbas known as abul abbas is a member of the plo 
executive committee and loyal to arafat he planned the 1985 
hijacking of the italian cruise ship achille lauro 
israel radio said today the government had sent washington 
details of the interrogations of the 12 captured plo guerrillas 
israeli leaders called wednesdays attack proof that arafat had 
violated his december 1988 pledge to renounce terror it was 
arafats pledge that led the united states to open a dialogue with 
the plo 
arafat said today in baghdad where he attended a summit of arab 
leaders that the plo was not responsible for the guerrilla attack 
on israeli beaches 
asked whether he would expel abbas from the elected plo executive 
committee for carrying out the attack arafat said 
he was elected in a democratic way by the palestine national 
council and only the council has a say on that he added we 
are a democratic organization and decisions should be taken 
democratically 
israeli foreign ministry spokesman motti amihai claimed today 
that abbas and arafat met in tunis tunisia five days before the 
attack 
we believe that abul abbas at that time knew for sure that this 
operation is going to take place amihai said i think there is 
little doubt that arafat personally and also probably libyan 
leader moammar gadhafi knew beforehand about this operation 
the plo is an umbrella group for several factions the smaller 
groups sometimes fight among themselves or launch independent 
attacks on israel 
foreign minister moshe arens said israel would try to persuade 
the united states to abandon contacts with the plo 
if we can convince them there that the basic assumption for 
dialogue no longer exists then its possible that the united states 
will decide to cease the dialogue he said on israel radio 
the only question is whether they the americans will see 
reality as it is said deputy foreign minister benjamin netanyahu 
in washington us state department spokeswoman margaret 
tutwiler said it was too early to say whether the attack would 
affect the 17month dialogue but added that we would view this as 
a very serious matter 
she said the united states was horrified at this terrorist 
attack and was pleased that all terrorists were apprehended or 
killed in action 
the infiltrators were trained in libya with the aim of attacking 
the hotels in the tel aviv region to conduct a massacre said 
maj geb amnon shahak chief of army intelligence 
the army said that on maps of tel aviv found in the possession of 
the guerrillas circles had been drawn the kolbo hashalom department 
store and kings square next to tel aviv city hall 
prime minister yitzhak shamir did not say whether israel would 
retaliate against libya asked on israel television about the libyan 
involvement he said we have to take this into account 
according to army chief of staff lt gen dan shomron the 
infiltration began three days ago when a libyan merchant ship 
carrying five fiberglass speedboats and a refueling vessel left the 
libyan port of benghazi about 800 miles from israel 
before dawn wednesday the mother ship cast off its cargo 120 
miles off israel three speedboats malfunctioned and the mother ship 
and the refueling vessel sailed toward egypt shomron said 
two boats equipped with rockets machine guns and antiaircraft 
missiles headed toward the israel coast 
one of the boats carrying 11 palestinians was attacked by 
helicopters and troops of the elite givati brigade as it sliced into 
an almost empty beach near nizzanim 18 miles south of tel aviv 
four guerrillas were killed there and seven captured 
israeli gunboats intercepted another boat near the communal farm 
of gaash about 12 miles north of tel aviv and five guerrillas 
surrendered 
police ordered the evacuation of a 30mile stretch of beaches 
south of tel aviv jammed with people for shavuot 
some bloodthirsty terrorists tried to turn our holiday into a 
day of mourning shamir said but the guardians of israel 
succeeded once again the campaign organized by abul abbas was a 
complete failure 
in the iraqi capital of baghdad palestine liberation front 
representative hussein elabed said the attack was aimed at 
teaching the enemy a new lesson on the road to liberating 
palestine 
the faction supports armed struggle to establish a palestinian 
state 
the infiltration came on the last day of the emergency arab 
summit in baghdad in a final communique the summit blamed the 
united states for the explosive situation in the middle east the 
arab leaders said us backing for israel encourages the jewish 
state to resist peace initiatives and settle jews in the occupied 
west bank and gaza strip

a farmer in a oncerural area has been arrested 
for plowing his fields too late at night after a neighbor in an 
adjoining subdivision complained that the drone of the tractor was 
keeping him awake 
the way i feel he moved next to the field the field didnt 
move next to him said ray dettmering who farms 600 acres about 
30 miles south of chicago 
the only question i have is this fall when i go to harvest it 
what happens then 
dettmerings neighbor leonard reh said he too must make a 
living and he cant because of the noise 
i dont want to stop him from making his living said reh a 
postal service employee but farming land at midnight is just a 
little bit too outrageous 
rehs home is in a new subdivision in matteson about 30 miles 
southwest of chicago the village has seen an influx of middle and 
uppermiddle class commuters in recent years 
reh and other neighbors say that since they must turn their 
lawnmowers off at 7 pm because of village ordinances why should a 
farm tractor be different 
and so about 11 pm on april 26 police responded to rehs 
complaint they tromped through muddy fields to arrest dettmering as 
he his wife kathy and a hired hand finished plowing the land he 
leases 
dettmering faces a june 11 hearing on two counts of disturbing 
the peace each count carries a maximum fine of 500 and six months 
in jail 
dettmering 28 of peotone has a day job and farms someone 
elses land on nights and weekends 
almost all producers depend to a certain extent on rented 
land especially in rapidly urbanizing areas said ralph heimlich 
an agricultural economist for the us department of agriculture in 
washington dc 
heimlich said suburban growth areas while attractive to the 
middleclass often pose conflicts between suburbanites and their 
farm neighbors 
people want to move out in the country and enjoy the open 
space but some of the things that go with it arent so pleasant 
such as spreading manure from a dairy operation or dust and 
noise with a tillage operation he said 
dettmering who grew up in a farm family said in a telephone 
interview thursday hed like to be a fulltime farmer but cant 
afford it he said he depends on his second job as a farm equipment 
mechanic to make ends meet 
ive got an eighthouraday job he said theres not 
enough money on the farm to be living off of 
the illinois farm bureau estimates 25 percent of the family 
farmers in the state work 200 or more days off the farm 
if you have a small or mediumsized operation for many people 
they find it a necessity its just one of those facts of life 
said dennis vercler a bureau spokesman 
this year dettmering said a wet spring has put him behind in 
preparing the land for corn the days when it wasnt raining meant 
even longer days and nights in the field he said 
reh said however he just wants a good nights sleep 
i have to get up at 4 oclock in the morning to go to work 
he said whoever owned this land before used to work the land 
during the day he never bothered anybody

ephemeral clean blue will signal the brash 
new fashion statement of traffic agents long saddled with the 
nickname brownies because of their ohsodrab uniforms 
brown looks dirty it seems to remind you of congestion said 
joe deplasco spokesman for the city department of transportation 
and so on friday at ceremonies marking the 30th anniversary of 
the traffic enforcement division the department will reveal all 
via mannequins adorned with uniforms past present and future 
much has changed since june 1 1960 when the city sent forth its 
first corps of socalled meter maids 
that allwoman ticketwriting force wore white blouses navy blue 
skirts and scarves black kid pumps and a hat modeled after that 
worn by the eras airline stewardesses a mens version was created 
when the force went coed in 1967 
in 1974 the duds du jour became a brown skirt or pants brown 
jacket and overcoat brown shoes brown tie and white shirt 
you might say that brown became all the rage after that in 
recent years the color has become to some belligerent motorists 
what red is to a bull 
there is a lot of brownie bashing that is going on in the 
streets said deplasco wed like to change the image that 
traffic agents can be abused by the public 
in the first four months of 1990 167 traffic agents were 
assaulted or otherwise confronted by unruly motorists in the same 
period last year the number was 114 
besides says deplasco the brownies er traffic enforcement 
agents found their nickname to be pejorative they hope the new 
garb will signal a new era of respect 
we think the uniform could give a greater sense of pride would 
be cleaner look nicer make the person feel happier about 
themselves and win more respect from the public said deplasco 
the citys 1900 traffic agents will phase in the new look using 
their 480 a year uniform allowance 
it will feature a navy blue hat white shirt navy blue tie navy 
blue jacket gray trousers with a navy stripe and black shoes a 
committee is being formed to add the finishing touches and the 
final creation is expected by fall 
were willing to take suggestions from renowned new york 
fashion designers said deplasco

a 9yearold who flattened a 
schoolmates nose after the boy called him fatso faces a felony 
charge and the father of the accused is outraged 
bobby woods of suburban sunrise is charged with aggravated 
battery a seconddegree felony in the fight with khalid fathallah 
at an elementary school where both were attending summer school 
this is incredible bobbys father nolan said wednesday 
i think this kind of court time should be spent on kids who need 
it kids vandalizing raping stealing not over a little 
fistfight 
bobby was charged partly because khalid suffered a broken nose 
that raises it above a simple schoolyard incident said 
assistant state attorney gary ford 
but defense attorney paul stark said he would ask a judge next 
week to dismiss the case 
bobby who at 5 feet and 101 pounds is bigger than the average 
9yearold said the fight started after khalid and another boy 
called him names fatso hey fatso like cookies oink oink 
and all that he said 
if convicted bobbys sentence could range from a reprimand to 
being put in state custody ford said ford said the youngster is 
unlikely to suffer a heavy penalty because the 9yearold has no 
criminal record

an international team that includes two 
blind climbers a deaf climber and an amputee nearly made it to the 
top of mount mckinley but 50 mph winds forced them to turn around 
officials said thursday 
the group got up to at least 18000 feet said roger robinson a 
us park service ranger at 20320 feet mount mckinley is north 
americas highest mountain 
theyve all descended theyre at 14000 now indications are 
theyre not going back up he said 
they did very good considering that only about half the folks 
that try mckinley make it to the top 
the ascent was attempted by 1009 climbers last year only 524 
reached the summit 
adaptations were made for the disabled climbers 
apparently theyve got ropes stretched out to the latrines when 
theyre at camps said bob seiber chief mountaineering ranger 
they work extremely well together and develop their other senses 
i guess 
patrick reinhart a member of the expedition and director of 
challenge alaska a group that helps develop recreational and sports 
opportunities for disabled climbers came up with the idea for the 
ascent 
reinhart who has an artificial foot always wanted to climb 
mckinley so did ross watson a canadian member of the expedition 
who lost his sight at age 12 in a pellet gun accident 
patrick hurst a 27yearold englishman who teaches outdoor 
sports to physically disabled people also is blind 
lkakpa sonam a sherpa from nepal is deaf 
in overall charge of the expedition is george rooney a member of 
the american alpine club whos been up mckinley twice and tried 
climbing everest in a joint americanpolish expediton hes also an 
emergency medical technician and a specialist in mountain rescue

the normally placid rolling lawns of 
exclusive wellesley college were crawling thursday with secret 
service agents reporters and harried college administrators in 
preparing for fridays arrival of barbara bush and raisa gorbachev 
but the earlier commotion over mrs bushs selection as 
commencement speaker has all but disappeared 
instead many of the students teachers and alumnae trying to 
dodge television camera crews inside the enormous tent had a new 
gripe 
in the words of graduating senior kelly brown 21 now we have 
this big circus and we just wanted a quiet graduation ceremony 
graduation for the class of 1990 at wellesley an oasis of brick 
towers and woodsy green meadows in this affluent suburb 10 miles 
west of boston will be anything but quiet 
that was guaranteed last month when about 150 of wellesleys 
2200 students signed a petition complaining that mrs bush had 
gained recognition through her husbands achievements that they 
complained contradicted the schools philosophy that women should 
stand on their own 
mrs bush will now address the 600 graduating seniors with mrs 
gorbachev at the friday morning ceremony the gorbachevs arrived in 
the united states wednesday night for the start of a fourday summit 
the two first ladies will speak for six minutes each a phalanx 
of secret service agents has been on campus for five days wellesley 
security officials said the graduation tent which will accommodate 
5500 was the biggest they have ever put up 
the petition coauthored by seniors peggy reid 21 and susana 
cardenas 21 gained national attention the two women said thursday 
that they still oppose the selection of mrs bush as speaker but 
plan no protests 
when she comes to speak im going to welcome her on her own 
merits and not because shes the presidents wife said reid a 
religion major who plans to teach english in costa rica next year 
cardenas an american citizen from lima peru echoed many on 
campus when she said the media had distorted the intent of the 
petition she said students never wanted publicity about the 
controversy and did not want to be discourteous to mrs bush 
we didnt intend it to be a personal judgment against her 
said cardenas we brought the petition to the college president 
and she was very sympathetic but said we couldnt change speakers 
and it was resolved 
others on campus said the petition signed by about 150 students 
represented only a tiny minority of students 
marion patterson 82 president of the class of 1927 said she 
attends every wellesley graduation and is a great admirer of 
barbara bush she grew up in an era when careers werent the mode 
she married and raised five children and i think shes a great asset 
to the country 
patterson took a dim view over the controversy about mrs bush 
i was distressed by it she said it was fostered by a 
south american student here on scholarship 
susan hand a college librarian whose two daughters have attended 
wellesley said she was very angry about the medias 
distortion of events 
i never heard anybody talking out against it hand said i 
think barbara bush coming will be neat and interesting for the kids 
she has a different point of view from a lot of them but its good 
to have a different point of view 
karen tucker 22 a graduating senior from cambridge said 
thursday that most people are happy with the decision 
when you think of a commencement speaker you look for 
inspiration and i think mrs bush proved herself of being capable of 
providing inspiration she said 
mary griffin 21 a junior who was jogging across campus thursday 
morning looked wistfully over at the graduation tent 
i wish it was my year she said i was really excited when 
i heard about them coming its exciting when you think were 
going to have the first ladies of the two superpowers here

if you can tell a lot about people by 
the shoes they wear archaeologists in the nations oldest city hope 
to learn something about whoever lost a pair in a well 200 years ago 
city archaeologist carl d halbirt retrieved the shoes and other 
valuable finds during the past month from an underground well 
its kind of a rarity to find leather shoes halbirt said 
wednesday it doesnt happen all the time and ive got two of 
them 
the worn leather shoes are wet but preserved they have heels 
with the cobbler nails still in them and an area on the front where 
buckles would fit 
the water in the well area is slightly alkaline which helped 
preserve everything he said 
the shoes are probably about the equivalent of size 88 in 
contemporary mens shoes said halbirt 
lab work will be needed to determine their exact age 
other items found in the well include a pocket knife bucket 
handle and some nails all of which date to about 17801800 
the well was discovered during the citys installation of new 
utility lines under a street

was the third major earthquake since 1977 with its epicenter in the 
romanian carpathians 
the uppsala seismological center in sweden said it was felt so 
widely because it was about 63 miles deep 
i think it was this deafening sound of cracking walls that 
scared people said clerical worker sica burcea 52 the 
building was swinging horizontally and vertically we were lucky 
only to have some cracks in the walls i shivered when i realized 
1977 was coming back 
more than 1500 romanians died in a 1977 earthquake

mikhail s gorbachev used a wily politicians 
old trick to win over his audience at lunch flatter them and call 
out to some by name 
there was henry kissinger and gorbachev ribbed him gently 
calling him my old man who always contests things 
there was musician van cliburn and said gorbachev i 
heartily welcome him here because he has done much to promote 
understanding between our two peoples 
cliburn was accompanied by his mother rildia bee who will be 94 
in october the concert pianist responded to gorbachevs greeting 
saying how much he appreciated gorbachevs hospitality in the soviet 
union last summer 
he said gorbachevs attendance at his concert there thrilled 
all my friends in texas 
there was john kenneth galbraith the harvard economist 
gorbachev called him a wise man being loaded with knowledge 
the soviet president twitted him too noting that galbraith had 
switched to another table so that we could see him better 
the occasion was a chicken kiev and caviar lunch at the soviet 
embassy it came between summit session one and two 
the guests bearing invitations in oversized envelopes climbed a 
wide carpeted staircase in the old mansion passed a portrait of a 
glaring lenin and sat down at round tables covered with pink linen 
and laden with china and were treated to a long long rambling 
welcome from their host 
his theme the age of sovietamerican alienation is over 
we are living in one civilization he said regardless of 
all the differences that we have and i believe the differences are 
not a liability it is a plus to a certain extent because it 
provides a good foundation for reaching a higher level plane of 
knowledge 
the flattery came when gorbachev called his guests members of 
the american intellectual community 
some would fit that title certainly galbraith certainly 
cowboyboot clad stephen cohen of princeton one of americas 
keenest analysts of the soviet system but most probably would 
reject being called intellectuals 
the old hollywood was represented by gregory peck from the new 
hollywood came jane fonda wearing a short and clingy orange suit 
and holding hands with her latest escort cable television mogul ted 
turner 
raisa gorbachev reportedly had especially wanted to meet some 
movie stars 
it was an eclectic group jesse jackson was the only outandout 
politician the washington cultural community was represented by 
james billington the librarian of congress and also a noted 
sovietologist and by robert mcc adams head of the smithsonian 
also present susan eisenhower granddaughter of a us 
president and her soviet husband physicist roald sagdeev and 
pamela harriman doyenne of the democratic party and widow of fdrs 
wartime ambassador to moscow science fiction writers isaac asimov 
and ray bradbury two authors who gorbachev said turning on the 
flattery again were his daughters favorites 
mingling among the guests were 40 soviet members of the soviet 
academy of sciences wesley posvar president of the university of 
pittsburgh said the fact they were flown to washington just for the 
occasion was important more than symbolic 
after lunch kissinger said the affair was a disaster for my 
diet 
he called gorbachev serene the rev leo j odonovan 
president of georgetown university said the soviet leader was 
extraordinarily relaxed and a smile played constantly around his 
mouth 
for cliburn the occasion must have brought forth old memories 
he won a reputation and esteem for american musicianship when he won 
the tschaikowsky music competition in moscow in 1958 and was 
welcomed home as a national hero the new american sputnik 
during gorbachevs first american summit with ronald reagan in 
december 1987 american intellectuals were also gorbachevs 
guests at a mixandmingle reception at the embassy kissinger was 
there then too 
last time yoko ono and billy graham were guests ms ono wasnt 
there this time and religion was represented this time by robert 
schuller the televangelist who has been asked to prepare 12 
spiritual messages to be aired on television to the soviet people 
over the next year

8feetdeep water for a second canoe and a raft said brian burnap 
a park visitor from sacramento 
burnap said they didnt panic in fact most of the riders 
remained stoically in their seats as the canoe took on water 
life preservers were stowed at both ends of the canoe but in the 
confusion they werent distributed said disneyland spokesman bob 
roth 
the sinking was blamed in part on two young men who splashed and 
rocked the canoe causing it to take on water roth said 
the only injury was a bruised toe roth said the soggy riders 
were taken to a firstaid station where they were given clothes to 
wear while theirs dried 
the canoes continuously loop tom sawyer island in the theme

police have begun evicting the citys panhandlers 
and homeless from their last great public refuges the subways 
pennsylvania station and grand central terminal 
the transit authority on wednesday began aggressively ejecting 
panhandlers from the subways and removing sleeping people from 
station floors and benches 
the metronorth commuter railroad and the long island rail road 
said that on friday they will begin enforcing courtapproved 
regulations banning begging and various activities such as sleeping 
or using more than one bench seat primarily associated with the 
homeless 
the evictions have drawn criticism from advocates for the 
homeless 
in recent years the homeless have gone to grand central penn 
station and the subways in search of warmth during the winter and 
for safety yearround 
on may 10 the 2nd us circuit court of appeals ruled that 
panhandling in transit systems didnt amount to constitutionally 
protected free speech 
the courts clearly said the subways are not the place to wage 
the social battles transit authority police chief william j 
bratton said thursday they have to be waged elsewhere 
bratton said authorities have to demonstrate that they are in 
control of the subways its been quite apparent that the previous 
approach to panhandling was not giving that sense at all that we 
were being laughed at he said 
an estimated 400 people a night have been spending the night at 
penn station officials said a count for grand central wasnt 
immediately available 
the prohibition on panhandling was part of operation enforcement 
a set of rules outlined by the transit authority last october 
in april the metropolitan transit authority which overesees the 
transit authority and the commuter railroads approved regulations 
for behavior in railroad stations 
under brattons orders beggars are to be ejected without warning 
regardless of whether they are aggressive or passive the police 
chief said he would be satisfied with a 25 percent reduction in 
panhandling 
he also labeled as bogus and baloney accusations that the 
effort against begging would divert officers from fighting 
escalating crime in the subways 
among those criticizing the evictions was peter smith of the 
partnership for the homeless advocacy group 
where are the homeless supposed to go where are they supposed 
to beg smith said is the mta going to put together a shuttle 
to the moon its getting absurd 
but the eviction plan is supported by shopkeepers at penn station 
its not good for business to have people sleeping down here 
said singh cheema who runs a jewelry store near track 17 some 
customers are offended 
at 2 am on any given night at penn station the homeless sleep 
side by side pregnant women children grayhaired men with 
crutches by their sides an occasional person with a dirty plaster 
cast on an arm the huddled line stretches for a block 
until friday the sleepers were rousted at 5 am on friday 
anyone lying down at any time or using more than one bench seat will 
be awakened and told about available social services said long 
island rail road spokesman brian dolan 
if they refuse to take advantage of the assistance offered 
they will be told to leave the station dolan said they will be 
ejected 
at grand central metro north has already closed off many areas 
previously inhabited by the homeless and began enforcing the 
panhandling ban the day after the may 10 court ruling social 
services are available there also

ground 
the pilots were released from a spencer hospital after treatment 
of minor injuries 
bushee who was invited to join the flight as part of the guards 
public relations program was listed in fair condition at mckennan 
hospital in sioux falls the hospital would not comment on the 
extent of bushees injuries or when he would be released 
bushee said from the hospital that his sixth vertebra was chipped 
and he suffered burns on his left arm shoulders and knees bushee 
said he wouldnt need surgery and expected to be released saturday 
christopherson said taking civilians on a flight is a lengthy 
process that goes through the public affairs office at the pentagon 
an editorial by bushee in august that criticized ceremonial flyovers 
did not affect that decision he said 
bushee gave his newspaper an account of his flight with maj 
duncan keirnes of sioux falls saying it started smoothly and that 
they later went into a dogfight exercise with another jet then the 
two planes collided 
duncan hit the ejector button as soon as we hit he said 
sending me exploding through the canopy and him following a second 
later then everything came apart it was just a ball of flame 
duncan later told me that if he had waited a couple of seconds 
longer to eject we would have been crispy critters 
it was just a surreal scene i was floating up in the air and 
my flight suit was burning like a torch my first thought was ill 
never see my wife and kids again this is it 
pieces of the plane were going by flames were all over me i 
couldnt remember where the cord was to open the parachute but it 
went open automatically 
christopherson said the units guestride program is part of the 
guards national public relations program 
we probably do two to four of these a year he said the 
program will probably continue he said i dont see any reason 
why it shouldnt 
christopherson said neither of the pilots faced disciplinary 
action and both could continue to fly military missions 
any restrictions would be strictly limited to medical 
decisions he said i dont see any reason why they wouldnt be 
returned to flying status 
keirnes and the other pilot maj gregory gore of collierville 
tenn are pilots for civilian air lines but christopherson 
declined to say which ones 
the guard would not release names of two other pilots flying in 
the same exercise and would not permit interviews with any pilots 
christopherson said the accident was the first since the south 
dakota air national guard unit began flying the a7s in 1977 and 
that the guard last lost a plane in 1974 
the airplanes probably wont be replaced he said we are 
scheduled to convert from a7s to f16s in early 1992 
christopherson said he talked to both pilots early thursday but 
that there was no discussion on what caused the crash 
the guard is determined to get to the bottom of what happened 
christopherson said 
its in no ones best interest to hide anything he said 
the objective is to learn from what went wrong

the legislature of soviet moldavia on thursday 
recognized lithuanias independence the tass news agency reported 
making it the first soviet republic outside the baltics to do so 
the move by lawmakers in the southwestern republic represented a 
direct challenge to soviet president mikhail s gorbachevs efforts 
to isolate lithuania from the rest of the soviet union 
gorbachev imposed an economic embargo of key raw materials to the 
baltic republic for failure to rescind its proindependence laws 
and he has decreed lithuanias march 11 declaration of independence 
to be unconstitutional 
according to the official news agency tass deputies of the 
moldavian supreme soviet meeting in the capital of kishinev 
favored the establishment of direct diplomatic economic political 
and cultural relations with lithuania 
the legislature also proposed to exchange permanent missions 
with the lithuanian parliament or supreme council tass reported 
the news agency did not give vote totals on the measure 
so far only the baltic republics of latvia and estonia have 
formally acted to cooperate on such levels with lithuania on may 
12 the three baltic republics revived a 1934 political alliance 
pledging mutual cooperation 
tass noted promoscow deputies who are members of the soviet 
moldavia alliance opposed the decision on recognition 
specifically objecting to the term diplomatic ties they said 
that term cannot be applied between republics that are part of the 
same nation tass said 
the news agency added that some members of the group were not 
represented at the session because deputies from predominantly 
russianspeaking towns have not attended parliament since may 22 it 
gave no reason for their absence 
like the baltic states the region that is now moldavia was 
forcibly annexed into the soviet union by josef stalin in 1940 
before the annexation moldavia then called bessarabia was part 
of romania and had long been regarded as a cradle of romanian 
culture 
the moldavian peoples front an independent political movement 
has been pressing demands for greater autonomy from moscow although 
it has moved cautiously on any reunification with romania 
the peoples front won a battle to establish moldavian as the 
official language of the republic and return to the latin alphabet 
used by romanians dropping the cyrillic letters of the russian 
alphabet imposed under stalin 
gorbachevs embargo imposed april 18 cut off all oil most 
supplies of natural gas and other key raw materials to lithuania 
after it failed to rescind proindependence laws 
since then lithuanian officials have sought to establish ties 
with other soviet republics to trade for materials the republic 
desperately needs one major obstacle to such an arrangement 
however is that moscow controls rail lines and highways needed to 
transport goods to lithuania

regional telephone giant nynex corp was 
indicted thursday on a charge of violating the 1982 court order that 
broke up the old bell system 
the new york citybased company was indicted on one count of 
criminal contempt of court for allegedly providing information 
services to customers in violation of the 1982 consent decree 
nynex denied any wrongdoing thursday 
the indictment is likely to provide ammunition to those opposing 
efforts in congress to lift some of the restrictions the 1982 decree 
imposed on the regional bell companies 
the landmark 1982 ruling by us district judge harold h greene 
had prohibited the seven regional bell holding companies from 
engaging in certain types of business including processing 
computerized data 
the indictment obtained by the justice departments antitrust 
division accused nynex through its nashville tenn subsidiary 
telco research corp of providing data processing and information 
retrieval services over telephone lines from april 1986 to february 
1987 
the indictment did not cite possible penalties 
telco provided a computer and software to the longdistance 
company mci communications corp to aid in making mcis network 
more efficient nynex spokesman bob obrien said thursday he said 
justice alleged that nynex did not provide enough of the computer to 
mci 
justice said nynex violated terms of the 1982 consent decree 
known as the modification of final judgment that prohibit nynex and 
the other regional bell companies from providing information 
services 
the consent decree was set up to divide different types of 
communication services between american telephone amp telegraph co 
and the spinoff companies 
our position is that there was no violation of the mfj 
obrien said 
nynex purchased telco in april 1985 and telco was providing 
service through mci prior to our acquisition obrien said nynex 
in may 1986 asked justice to scrutinize the computer service to 
avoid any possible violation he added 
the indictment said nynex modified the mci agreement on two 
occasions in april and october 1986 
nynex with justice approval subsequently tried to transfer 
title of the computer to mci but mci didnt want it and nynex ended 
the agreement in february 1987 obrien said 
in a statement assistant attorney general james f rill said 
a willful violation of any consent decree is a very serious matter 
deserving of criminal penalties 
a court order is the law and companies bound by a decree are 
not free to deliberately or recklessly disregard that decree rill 
said 
the federal communications commission in february fined nynex a 
record 14 million for alleged 1185 million in overcharges sold 
by nynexs purchasing arm to its two telephone companies new york 
telephone and new england telephone 
nynex appealed the fine

a judge accepted a california evangelists 
7 million bid for the ptl television network thursday as the first 
step toward selling the rest of jim bakkers bankrupt empire for an 
additional 45 million 
the religious cable network was sold to morris cerullo an 
assemblies of god pastor who heads morris cerullo world evangalism 
inc of san diego the deal must also be approved by the federal 
communications commission 
cerullo on wednesday signed a 52 million contract to purchase 
all ptl assets if he could be guaranteed the cable network ptl 
trustee dennis shedd told us bankruptcy judge thurmond bishop 
cerullo can back out of the deal to buy the rest of ptl 
including heritage usa a retreat and religious theme park 10 miles 
south of charlotte nc but shedd expects cerullo will make good on 
his offer 
hes the only person who went through the whole process of 
negotiations and he put his money on the table shedd told 
reporters after the hearing 
this may not be the terms everyone wants but its the only 
terms we could get shedd said its the best thing out there 
cerullo on wednesday deposited the 7 million for the network in 
an escrow account said brad leggett an attorney representing shedd 
shedd said he will ask bishop to set a date before midjuly for a 
hearing on selling the rest of the assets 
cerullos organization has branches in great britain canada 
israel and zimbabwe in 1978 he unveiled plans for a 100 million 
world outreach center in san diego but unlike heritage usa it 
never materialized 
it is our hope to go back and achieve what the bakkers failed 
to do said cerullos attorney tim treadwell cerullo didnt 
attend the hearing 
treadwell said the ministry will most likely be moved to 
california 
earlier this month evangelist oral roberts signed a 645 
million contract giving him the right to buy the cable network 
unless someone else bid more or agreed to buy all of ptls assets as 
a package 
roberts didnt return a telephone message left thursday at his 
office in tulsa okla 
bishop rejected four other offers including an 8 million bid 
from media arts international ltd to purchase the cable network 
because the bidders wanted more time to negotiate 
treadwell said cerullo would withdraw his offer if a delay was 
granted 
in approving cerullos offer the judge included a stipulation 
that cable televisions home box office must come to an agreement 
with cerullo over transfer of lease arrangements hbo provides a 
satellite for ptl 
hbo had asked the court to block shedds deal with roberts 
because it doubted the evangelist could make the 242000 monthly 
payments for the use of its satellite 
the closing date on the deal is aug 31 but can be extended if 
the fcc doesnt grant cerullo a license by then leggett said if 
the fcc rejects the license transfer due to some fault of cerullos 
ptl could keep 1 million of the 7 million cerullo would have paid 
for the network 
ptl has been in bankruptcy proceedings since june 1987 three 
months after bakker resigned in the sexandmoney scandal that led 
to his 45year federal prison term for fraud and conspiracy 
the failed ministry owes creditors millions of dollars 
the ptl network still carries other evangelists taped programs 
but heritage usa where bakker had his studios and church has been 
closed since september the 500acre retreat also has five 
restaurants a 10 million water park and two 500room hotels one 
of them unfinished it includes about 1700 undeveloped acres 
last year toronto businessman stephen mernick failed to close on 
a 65 million deal to buy ptl with bank financing the lenders 
wanted title insurance for heritage usa mernick could not obtain it 
because of a catawba indian lawsuit claiming that 144000 acres 
including the heritage usa site was illegally sold to the state in 
1840

thursday that it differed with the governments pace and terms for a 
monetary union with east germany 
in a statement issued at a policymaking meeting the bundesbank 
said it wanted to counter recent impressions in the news media 
that the bank had not played a large enough role in negotiations on 
the monetary union agreement 
the central bank also said it was satisfied that its 
requirements for a monetary union were met 
the statement was similar to comments made late wednesday by 
bundesbank president karl otto poehl who said the central bank was 
in agreement with chancellor helmut kohls government on the 
monetary union pact 
i regret that the impression has arisen of a great 
confrontation a war between the bundesbank and bonn the impression 
is wrong poehl said wednesday night 
earlier this year the bundesbank indicated it was opposed to 
rapid monetary union but it soon altered its stance and expressed 
support for kohls push for quick union 
two weeks ago the two german states signed a treaty under which 
they will become a single economic entity beginning july 2 
under the treaty west germanys deutsche mark will be legal 
tender for east germans and all banking and monetary policy in east 
germany will come under the bundesbanks jurisdiction

a defunct petroleum disposal company was 
charged thursday with illegally burning dumping and storing 
hazardous waste including surplus napalm bombs 
prosecutors alleged that a puddle of waste from the company was 
so noxious it melted the shoe soles of a passing jogger 
an environmental crime is like a robbery or assault against all 
of us said attorney general richard thornburgh who came to town 
to announce the first federal felony environmental prosecution in 
utah 
a 12count indictment alleges steven f self of fallbrook 
calif and his defunct ekotek inc of knowingly ignoring federal 
environmental laws 
the indictment provides a clear signal to environmental 
profiteers seeking to improperly cash in on the growing 
wastehandling business thornburgh said 
the indictment alleges ekotek duped environmentally conscious 
businesses into believing that waste materials were being properly 
disposed of 
the indictment alleges conspiracy to violate the clean air water 
and resources conservation and recovery acts and involves charges 
that self and others illegally burned and discharged solvents oils 
grease and contaminated runoff then concealed the violations by 
falsifying manifests and logs 
selfs attorney in salt lake city didnt respond to telephone 
requests for comment 
before ekotek was shut down by state regulators in october 1987 
residents of nearby homes complained of malodorous smoke coming from 
the site 
prosecutors said a 17yearold boy reported his shoe began to 
bubble and disintegrate after he accidentally stepped in a 
puddle while running by the site 
ekotek which was in the business of recycling or destroying 
waste oil products discharged into the public sewer system 
approximately 10000 gallons of wastewater per day the indictment 
said 
the indictment alleges that in july 1986 self arranged to accept 
two napalm bombs for testing storage and treatment from the 
navy weapons support center in fallbrook and later told state 
officials they had been properly disposed of state explosives 
experts had to haul the bombs away the following year

gallons of wastes have leaked or been dumped into the ground and 
have contaminated nearby homes

nasa workers found a tiny leak in 
columbias rear engine compartment thursday but judged it too small 
to have caused the hydrogen leak that delayed the shuttle launch 
the feeling is at this point thats probably not what theyre 
looking for said bruce buckingham a spokesman for the national 
aeronautics and space administration 
the search continued until late afternoon then was halted so 
columbias onboard fuel tanks could be drained officials planned 
to increase pressure on the shuttles external tank which was 
filled with nonflammable helium to find the main leak buckingham 
said 
at a news conference in washington nasa administrator richard 
truly said a special test using another gas chilled to a liquid 
state might have to be run because the leak appeared only when 
the temperature got so cold 
the external tank was being filled with more than a halfmillion 
gallons of supercold liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen tuesday when 
the leak was detected nasa called off the launch set for 1238 
am edt wednesday and drained the explosive propellant 
truly called the news conference to announce that nasa has 
launched a program to solicit new and innovative ideas to carry out 
president bushs call for establishing a manned base on the moon and 
sending a human expedition to mars in the next 30 years 
he named retired air force lt gen thomas p stafford a veteran 
of two gemini and two apollo space flights to head the effort 
which will receive 45 million 
engineers believe columbias leak is in or near a 17inch valve 
in a pipe that carries fuel from the external tank to the main 
engines 
if the leak is detected and repairs can be made at the launch 
pad columbia might be ready to lift off by the middle of next week 
but if columbia has to be returned to a hangar the delay would be 
about a month nasa officials said 
columbias astronomy mission with a 150 million observatory 
called astro already had been delayed two weeks because of repairs 
to the shuttles cooling system the latest postponement will mean 
even more changes to astros observing schedule 
one of the prime targets comet austin is speeding away from 
earth making observations more difficult with every passing day 
halleys comet was to have been studied had the mission proceeded as 
scheduled in march 1986 but the challenger explosion pushed 
everything back

here is a transcript of soviet president 
mikhail s gorbachevs comments to reporters thursday after his 
second meeting with president bush as translated by gorbachevs 
interpreter 
q have you resolved the german question with a new melody 
gorbachev well i think it is not here that the german 
question will be resolved 
q why not 
gorbachev ill explain but this extended meeting of two 
delegations was dedicated to an exchange of views about the 
development of the situation in europe with due regard to the 
settlement of all aspects relating to the external aspects of german 
unification i think that we have had a very substantive discussion 
with the president and also with other members of both the 
delegations who participated we understand the positions of each 
other 
i hope that we understand each others concerns better as well 
and in this context both the us side and the soviet side put forward 
certain ideas certain suggestions and i believe and the president 
has agreed that this exchange of views now requires that our 
foreign ministers have a more indepth discussion of these issues 
and the experts who also participate and we have instructed the 
ministers to have that discussion i understand that of course you 
would like to find out more than ive said but we dont know 
everything yet 
q do you still think president bush is dictating nato in 
germany germany inside nato 
gorbachev well i will say this to this president bush is 
what president bush is doing is probably protecting defending 
his viewpoint i think that dictating is unacceptable in situations 
when there are so many participants involved in this problem 
q have you heard a different melody today or the 
gorbachev well i think since since we have decided that 
our ministers and experts should have a more indepth discussion of 
what was discussed today i think that means that something has 
emerged that requires such and our view is that our view is 
our view is that our view is that as a result of this 
settlement of this question not only the security of the soviet 
union and of other countries should not be diminished but also no 
damage should be done to the positive processes underway now in 
europe and elsewhere in the world and certainly no damage should be 
done to the sovietus relationship which is very important and 
thats why we have to act in a very very responsible way 
q have you discussed economic assistance and are you going to 
ask for seek more assistance economically 
gorbachev well lets just say well lets just say that 
let me say that in the morning we had a rather conceptual 
philosophical discussion with the president specifically broadly 
on ussoviet relationship in this rapidlychanging world and we 
said that without malta without that meeting that we had in malta 
and the exchange of views that we had there really developments 
could have taken a rather different course and we predicted over 
there in malta that there might be problems that we challenges 
that we will have to meet and it is very important to act in a 
responsible and prudent way and that is how we really acted after 
malta 
and we have said that it is very important to have 
understanding between our countries and to continue to have that 
understanding so that was a rather broad and conceptual discussion 
about the role of our two countries and in that context we did 
discuss also the economic trends and i made some explanations to 
the president about the situation the economic reforms that we 
are undertaking in the soviet union 
but i would say that that was a discussion in that kind of 
broad context in addition those economic matters the matters of 
economic cooperation were discussed by our ministers and tomorrow 
the presidents will continue this discussion 
thank you

the white house on thursday rebuffed israels 
plea to end all contacts with the palestine liberation organization 
after an attempted beachfront attack on israeli civilians but the 
white house condemned the action as a cowardly attempt to target 
innocent people 
we are deeply concerned about the responsibility for this 
attack and we are looking into it said white house press 
secretary marlin fitzwater said about wednesdays foiled attack on 
beaches south of tel aviv by seaborne palestinian guerillas loyal to 
a top plo official 
other officials speaking on condition of anonymity stressed 
that no decision had been made on whether to keep talking with the 
plo or break off the discussions 
plo chief yasser arafat said in baghdad the plo was not 
responsible for the attack and that he does not have the authority 
to take action against the plo official whose guerrillas claimed 
responsibility even if he wanted to 
he said only the plo council could expel that official mohammed 
abbas also known as abul abbas an arafat loyalist and member of 
the plo executive committee who planned the 1985 hijacking of the 
italian cruise ship achille lauro 
fitzwater told reporters we dont have any conclusions at this 
point we are investigating this matter and reviewing all the 
information we can gather on it we are very concerned about what 
the ramifications might be but at this point we do not want to 
express any conclusions 
asked if continued discussions with the plo was under review in 
light of the fact that the administration has conditioned such talks 
on plo renunciation of terrorism fitzwater said no not at this 
point 
he said the united states first wants to investigate the matter 
and see who is responsible 
president bush condemns the terrorist attack yesterday in 
israel and is outraged by what appears to be a cowardly attempt to 
target innocent people fitzwater said in a prepared statement 
other us officials asking not to be identified said they 
dont consider arafats remarks to be the official plo response 
at the same time arafat spoke the us ambassador to tunisia 
robert pelletreau was meeting in tunis with plo officials the us 
officials said they are awaiting a reply from the plo to questions 
set forth by pelletreau 
once all the information is made available from the plo and other 
sources the officials said a judgment will be made on how to 
proceed 
on wednesday state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler said 
it was too early to say whether the attack would affect the 17month 
dialogue with the plo on ways to peace talks started between israel 
and palestinians but added that we would view this as a very 
serious matter 
thursday the state department referred all queries to fitzwater 
israel urged the united states to end all contacts with the plo 
after seaborne palestinian guerrillas loyal to abbas tried to attack 
crowded beaches and hotels 
israeli leaders called wednesdays attack proof that plo leader 
yasser arafat had violated his december 1988 pledge to renounce 
terror it was arafats pledge that led the united states to open a 
dialogue with the plo after years of refusing to negotiate with the 
organization 
four guerrillas were killed and 12 captured by israeli forces who 
headed off the attack no israelis were hurt in the attack even 
though tens of thousands were on beaches for the jewish holiday of 
shavuot 
fitzwater said bush commended the action of israeli forces 
israeli officials claimed abbas and arafat must have known about 
the attack in advance 
israeli foreign ministry spokesman motti amihai said abbas and 
arafat met in tunis tunisia five days before the attack 
we believe that abul abbas at that time knew for sure that this 
operation is going to take place amihai said i think there is 
little doubt that arafat personally and also probably libyan 
leader moammar gadhafi knew beforehand about this operation 
foreign minister moshe arens said on israeli radio that israel 
would try to persuade the united states to abandon contacts with the 
plo 
if we can convince them the united states there that the 
basic assumption for dialogue no longer exists then its possible 
that the united states will decide to cease the dialogue he said

following the resignation of the 
controversial president of the university of south carolina some 
legislators called thursday for strict spending guidelines for his 
successor 
the surprise resignation wednesday of the universitys president 
james b holderman followed weeks of controversy over his spending 
during fundraising drives he was criticized for using luxury 
hotels chartered jets and chauffeured limousines 
in announcing his resignation which is effective july 1 
holderman didnt refer to the controversy the 54yearold 
administrator said he was seeking new personal and professional 
challenges 
some lawmakers said the university should take a lesson from 
other southeastern schools where less is spent on fundraising at 
the other universities presidents enjoy much smaller discretionary 
accounts than holdermans 533000 personal account funded by 
concessions 
itll be important for the new president to get out into the 
state to get people to know him and not give the impression that 
hes a jetsetter said state rep mike fair 
fair and state reps herb kirsh and david beasley said spending 
guidelines imposed on holderman two weeks ago by uscs board of 
trustees should be vigorously applied to his successor 
the board needs to have a long hard solid meeting to 
determine what they are looking for in a president beasley said 
holderman 54 ran the university since 1977 
he regularly used luxury hotels on fundraising trips hired 
35anhour chauffeured limousines in washington and chartered jets 
or flew first class according to records from the university and 
private foundations affiliated with the school 
holderman argued that expensive hotel rooms were necessary to woo 
wealthy donors 
holderman first came under criticism in 1986 for spending on his 
travels giving expensive gifts to donors and students and paying 
top dollar to lure celebrity lecturers and speakers to the school 
jihan sadat widow of egyptian president anwar sadat was paid 
200000 to teach a course in egyptian culture for three semesters 
in 1985 and 1986 
more recently the school has drawn criticism for paying 
actordirector robby benson 158367 to teach filmmaking and 15600 
for rent with holderman kicking in 10000 from his discretionary 
fund for travel and moving expenses benson announced thursday he 
wasnt renewing his contract and cited holdermans resignation as 
the reason 
trustee charlie g williams state superintendent of education 
said revisions in the powers of the president of the 40000student 
school have yet to be discussed by the 23 trustees 
the board should look at what other universities are doing in 
fundraising we should not be so proud as to not look at clemson 
theyre spending modest amounts and raising a lot of money fair 
said

soviet president mikhail s gorbachev waded 
into a rushhour crowd on a downtown washington sidewalk thursday 
shaking hands with pedestrians and declaring i feel really at 
home 
the bystanders cheered and applauded and some pedestrians 
yelled gorby over here a few in the crowd waved small 
american flags 
gorbachev had just concluded his second round of talks with 
president bush when he stopped his motorcade en route from the white 
house to the soviet embassy he walked calmly up to the crowd of 500 
or more people who had been waiting in hopes of catching a glimpse 
of him after a few seconds on the sidewalk he walked the street 
trailed by a phalanx of security officials 
asked about the summit gorbachev told onlookers we want to 
further our relationship 
he said people want a better tomorrow and the rest he said 
is not too important 
at one point gorbachev could hardly be seen as the crowd pushed 
toward him most of the men and women holding out their hands 
gorbachev shook several during the encounter near the corner of 
pennsylvania avenue and 15th street 
within a few moments he was back inside his car on his way to 
the soviet embassy journalists crowded around as word spread of his 
stroll 
such unscheduled stops have become something of a gorbachev 
trademark he did much the same thing in 1987 while visiting 
washington 
on a canadian stopover in ottawa earlier this week gorbachev 
walked through the downtown shopping district for 45 minutes 
shaking hands and chatting with canadians who rushed to the scene 
when they heard broadcast reports he was walking about 
on wednesday morning after laying a wreath at a canadian war 
memorial gorbachev and his host prime minister brian mulroney 
left their cars and walked several hundred yards toward parliament 
hill making their way through crowds of delighted people

here is the text of remarks by president bush 
during a toast thursday night honoring soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachev 
friends distinguished guests and especially mr president 
and mrs gorbachev barbara and i are delighted to welcome you to 
the white house to share bread and salt with us on this 
special evening 
were now nearing the end of a momentous day the first of four 
in this washington summit 
and here in the white house mr president we will meet again 
this time to sign our names to a series of agreements that signify 
the progress our two nations have made in forging a new 
relationship agreements on everything from nuclear testing and 
chemical weapons to expanded contacts between the people of 
america and the soviet union 
these agreements are a continuation of all that began in malta 
just six months ago a foundation we can build on proof that 
differences can be resolved even while others remain and let me 
assure president gorbachev whatever deep differences divided us in 
the past the united states and the american people approach every 
issue with a sincere belief that our two nations can find common 
ground indeed because of our unique positions in the world we 
must find common ground 
we meet at a time of great and historic change in the soviet 
union in europe and around the world such profound change is 
unsettling but also exhilarating we do not shrink from the 
challenges before us but welcome them determined to build the 
foundations of enduring peace and security 
mr president you deserve great credit for the course youve 
chosen for the political and economic reforms youve introduced 
and for creating within the soviet union a commitment to change as 
i said this morning as i welcomed you to the white house we want to 
see perestrokia succeed we want to see this transition now under 
way in the soviet union maintain its momentum 
mr president it is said that your country is the land of 
possibilities you have demonstrated the truth of that statement 
and weve seen this past year that ours is a world of possibilities 
that our time is a time of historic change a time when men and 
nations can transform history can turn possibility into progress 
into peace 
so let us raise our glasses 
to our guests president and mrs gorbachev to the growing 
friendship between the american and soviet people and to the 
possibilities now open to us to the prospect of progress and 
lasting peace

when phoenix builds a japanese tea garden it 
doesnt fool around the city has bought 900 tons of rocks and 
wants to put the garden over an interstate 
phoenix plans to build the 29 million garden and a 400000 
replica of an irish farmhouse in honor of himeji japan and ennis 
ireland two of its sister cities 
the garden and the farmhouse are to be part of deck park planned 
for a deck over interstate 10 downtown the park is scheduled to 
open late next year 
architects and landscapers from himeji picked 14000 worth of 
rocks for the 2acre garden 
i dont think they realize how big these rocks are because by 
the time we dug out some of these monsters they were 8 to 10 feet 
across said dale longbreak of red mountain mining co which 
collected the rocks north of mesa and delivered them wednesday 
but sometimes 1800000 pounds of rocks isnt enough the 
architects and landscapers want 15 more kinds of rock to make the 
garden authentic said parks official mike whiting

president bush was nearly upstaged by summit 
guest mikhail s gorbachev on thursday as he sought to maintain a 
low profile while gorbachev made frequent public appearances and 
pronounceents 
finally bush emerged at the white house in early evening to give 
to reporters his side of his two opening days sessions and his 
impressions of the soviet leaders 
i feel very comfortable with him i feel very free to bring up 
positions i know he doesnt agree with that hasnt always been the 
case there have been times when people banged their shoes when they 
didnt agree thats not the tone of this meeting bush said 
but by the time bush made his originally unplanned remarks 
gorbachev had already spoken to a group of american thinkers 
answered questions and held two impromptu news conferences outside 
the white house 
white house press officials who had moved their entire operation 
out of the white house and to a college gymnasium about a half mile 
away were clearly taken by surprise by gorbachevs tactics 
earlier bush quickly got down to business in welcoming remarks 
by telling gorbachev not to lose sight of the differences 
between the superpowers and specifying lithuania as a prime example 
although bush and gorbachev exchanged cordial and upbeat 
greetings at a welcoming ceremony on the south lawn of the white 
house bushs remarks were pointed in places 
but after their initial session bush laid low for the afternoon 
gorbachev meanwhile was busy presenting his case 
finally bush apparently smoked out by gorbachevs constant 
public comments echoed the soviet leaders comments on their 
progress in striving for reaching common ground on the issue of 
german unity 
weve got a big agenda bush said i am convinced that out 
of this meeting we will narrow our differences 
he described gorbachev as a man he could talk to when he 
talks i listen when i talk he listens there is no shouting 
bush said 
in his welcoming remarks bush referred to the late soviet 
dissident andrei sakharov as one of the worlds great minds 
quoted him and declared sakharov knew that lasting peace and 
progress are inseparable from freedom that nations will only be 
fully safe when all people are fully free 
the agreements weve reached cannot cause us to lose sight of 
some of the differences that remain lithuania is one such issue 
bush said we believe that good faith dialogue between the soviet 
leaders and representatives of the baltic people is the proper 
approach and we hope to see the process go forward 
as recently as wednesday in canada gorbachev had spoken harshly 
of the methods used by the lithuanians in their independence effort 
but the soviet leader who also had complained about western 
pressure on what he considers an internal problem did not mention 
the rebellious baltic state in his welcoming remarks 
bush called his schedule with gorbachev a working summit in the 
strictest sense of the term and said they would join in an open 
and honest search for common ground 
between their opening morning session and a 4 pm second 
session the president had no public events scheduled by contrast 
ronald reagan made a number of separate appearances while gorbachev 
was maintaining his own schedule during their summits 
white house spokesman roman popadiuk said that bush was using the 
time to meet with advisers to discuss the first summit session 
hes also got a country to run popadiuk said

the charred apollo capsule in which 
three astronauts died 23 years ago will remain in storage in 
virginia rather than be buried in an abandoned missile silo or given 
to a museum nasa said thursday 
the capsule was to have been shipped in may from langley research 
center in hampton va to its final resting place in a silo at cape 
canaveral air force station it was to have been buried on top of 
debris from the 1986 challenger explosion americas only other 
space tragedy 
the transfer temporarily was halted after curators at the 
smithsonian institutions national air and space museum said they 
would like to acquire the capsule as an historic artifact the 
kansas cosmosphere and space center in hutchinson kan also had 
expressed interest 
nasa spokesman mark hess said the decision to keep the capsule at 
langley indefinitely was made after conferring with relatives of the 
three astronauts who died and former apollo astronauts 
they just asked us to reconsider and keep it or store it in 
another way hess said 
displaying the capsule at the smithsonian or anywhere else was 
never seriously considered hess said 
i dont think youd find a soul in nasa who thought that was an 
appropriate alternative he said 
mike stephenson associate director of the kansas cosmosphere and 
space center said hes pleased the capsule will not be buried in 
the silo his museum had been interested in the capsule and still 
would be for memorial purposes rather than for display 
its certainly important that the artifact be preserved 
stephenson said 
the capsule has been stored in a locked container at langley 
since the 1967 fire which claimed the lives of astronauts virgil 
gus grissom roger b chaffee and edward h white ii it briefly 
was removed a few weeks ago so its heat shield could be cut into 
pieces for shipping 
the astronauts died when fire engulfed the capsule during a 
countdown rehearsal for the first manned apollo mission the fire 
in a cabin filled with 100 percent oxygen was triggered by a spark 
when a broken or bruised wire beneath grissoms couch contacted 
metal 
thirtyone cartons of hardware and investigative material were 
moved to kennedy space center in late april for burial with the 
capsule they will be returned to langley

here is a transcript of president bushs 
comments to reporters thursday after his second meeting with soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachev 
bush well id just say at the end of a very interesting day 
that the talks have gone reasonably well the mood is very positive 
in the sense that i had a very good and i mean genuinely not in a 
diplomatic sense very good exchange for a couple of hours this 
morning with president gorbachev im very well pleased with the 
ground we covered 
this afternoons meeting the tone was positive differences 
remain we talked about the german question there i believe 
president gorbachev indicated after the meeting that he didnt think 
the whole question of germany would be resolved certainly were not 
in any position to resolve that entire question but when he said 
that the differences were had been narrowed somewhat im taking 
some heart from that and well continue these discussions tomorrow 
but i think given the difficulties of some of the problems we 
face the talks have gone certainly as well as i could have expected 
up to now and we still have a lot of discussion but weve touched 
on almost every contentious issue as well as spelling out the areas 
in which we have common interests and where things are going very 
well between us 
so thats a report for tonight and tomorrow ill be able to 
say a little bit more but i wont go into details that weve agreed 
were not going to talk about 
q none of us understand why you cant sign a trade agreement 
if its all wrapped up 
bush well we havent said whether we can sign a trade 
agreement or not yet 
q why 
bush will get we havent discussed that yet 
q inaudible instructed the foreign ministers to discuss 
something that emerged today about germany sir could you tell us 
about that 
bush no because we agreed we wouldnt we agreed wed let 
them discuss it 
q will you confirm that 
bush and i will say i think i think when i heard what 
president gorbachev said that is exactly what we agreed he would 
talk about so were just going to stay with that guidance 
q when will they meet 
bush i dont know probably tomorrow probably tomorrow 
q was there some narrowing of differences that made you decide 
the foreign ministers should get together with some specific details 
you have them working on 
bush well that was a proposal that president gorbachev made 
and i think the foreign ministers need to discuss in great detail 
the subjects we discussed to see but i was i took i must 
say michael i took some heart from that i was encouraged by that 
our position has been stated and restated and well see where we go 
but i think the important point is we could talk very frankly 
no rancor there and lets hope some of the differences have been 
narrowed but when he says this whole german question will not be 
solved at a meeting of this nature i would agree with that we 
consult our allies and we dont and he knows that he knows 
that we have a lot of consultation but basically my position is 
the same as it was when we went into the meetings but im listening 
very carefully listening to their views and trying to understand 
their positions 
q did you offer something specific for the foreign ministers 
to discuss on germany bush i think they do have some specifics 
to discuss but theres that can be discussed after they get 
through talking about those things 
q mr president did you offer any concessions did you 
bush no i want to stay with the guidance that we agreed on 
but i our position is well known and the fundamentals have not 
changed the fundamentals have not changed 
q has he taken offense to your stand on lithuania or your 
remarks today at the welcoming ceremony 
bush he didnt seem to take offense to anything he knows that 
we had differences ive been very upfront with him and hes been 
very very direct and upfront with me so thats one of the good 
things about the meeting when great powers have differences 
sometimes they havent been able to talk about them in a civil way 
we are talking about them in a very civil way and i commend him for 
that approach its one i like its one i understand and its one i 
think benefits not just the united states and the soviet union but a 
lot of other countries as well 
q would a trade bill be contingent on what you hear on 
lithuania 
bush well were going to discuss the details of that 
probably get into some of that tomorrow 
q do he feel like you have a better understanding on about 
on germany being that hes more ready to come your way than you are 
to his 
bush were not dealing on that look we agreed to some 
guidance he and i and im going to stick with it and he did and 
i think thats a good sign were in the middle of some discussions 
about where it stands

q why do you think that its going so well both of you have 
talked about a really good relationship that the two of you in the 
talks the hours youve spent why do you think this time there has 
been such a is it a good chemistry 
bush well i dont know its a good question and i feel very 
comfortable with him i feel very free to bring up positions that i 
know he doesnt agree with and as ive said that hasnt always been 
the case thereve been times when people banged their shoes when 
they didnt agree and we dont thats not the mood or the tone 
of this meeting and we have both realized were engaged in very 
very historic and important work here 
and i think his i think when these meetings are over the 
people in this country are going to be pleased with some of the 
positions he takes concerning us interests and hopefully i can 
be reassuring to the people in the soviet union about the kind of 
relationship we want so the tone of it is important so that we can 
try to quote narrow differences unquote 
q mr president does either side have a better understanding 
of the others position on lithuania now have you narrowed any 
differences 
bush that subject has been dicussed but not in the plenary 
meetings and not in great detail yet it will certainly be discussed 
in much more detail 
q inaudible your discussion on germany was there any 
similar encourage around lithuania 
bush as i say that matter has not been discussed and i cant 
quantify for you my hopes one each important question and that is an 
important question 
q mr president have you backed off anything since his 
comments yesterday about dictating to the soviets 
bush i dont recall you mean something he said in canada 
q yes sir 
bush well i think when i said out there that were dealing 
from positions of unique responsibility i think he understood that 
i have a certain respect for the standing of the soviet union and 
im not attempting to dictate im but i clearly am entitled to 
and will put forward the views of the american side as forcefully as 
i can 
but you dont get any progress if you if you give the 
impression that youre in a situation of dictation the age of the 
dictator is over dont you remember my speech here a while back 
q well mulroney seems to think that youre most of the 
west is insensitive to what the soviets suffered in world war ii 
bush i think mulroney with whom ive talked twice in the last 
two days knows very well that the united states is not insensitive 
to the fact that the soviets lost 27 million lives in a war and i 
know mr gorbachev understands that im quite sensitive to that 
i think hes also sensitive to the fact that a lot of american 
kids lost their lives i reminded him that i was the only one of the 
two of us that was old enough to remember it from being there 
q thats why he doesnt want germany in nato 
bush well youre putting words into his mouth 
q do you have enough time in three days or is that too 
short a period of time 
bush well i dont know i think the camp david meeting where 
we have a lot of oneonone time is going to be fruitful i think 
the i think weve got to do better on simultaneous as opposed to 
consecutive translations to speed things up and today we in the 
oval office we had the we had the longer version so id like 
to move that up a little bit but i guess theres never enough time 
when youre dealing with an agenda that is this important 
weve got regional questions that we havent touched on yet we 
have more refinement on each side to refine its views on the 
european questions we have arms control thats still being talked 
about behind the scenes but that he and i have not gone into so 
weve got a big agenda and whether well have enough time to do 
everything that he wants and that i want i dont know i am 
convinced that out of this meeting we will narrow differences and 
that two ships are less apt to pass in the night based on simple 
misunderstanding and im convinced of that because i can talk very 
frankly with him and when he talks i listen and when i talk he 
listens were not shouting at each other theres not a rancor in 
there 
and once in a while both of us we feel strongly about

q mr president may i try once more on the question of 
germany 
bush you can try but im not going to give you any more 
because we agreed with the president of the soviet union on a 
guidance if you want me to read it to you again ill get my 
notes out but i cant help you on it nice try another question 
though maybe 
q mr president have you noticed a change in the soviet 
president since malta have his domestic problems constrained him at 
all in your talks 
bush hes six months older no i dont really i dont 
 
q has he brought up his own domestic problems and offered that 
as a stumbling block to any solutions 
bush no no hes not done that hes not trying to hide 
anything nor is he wringing his hands to me there is a certain 
and i dont know if his friends felt this way but a certain 
strength and confidence that was there in malta and is certainly 
still there now and you could feel that i mean this wasnt just a 
casual observation you i felt strongly about that so i dont 
feel a weakened presence or anything of that nature i feel a man 
determined to do his job 
q do you think theres anything you can or should do to help 
him in the short term 
bush well i think im going to do whats in the national 
interest of the united states our security interests our global 
interests and working closely with the soviet union a lot of 
questions is in our interest and so with that approach in mind 
i think maybe we can he can go away feeling that hes got people 
here that are not just dealing from some innate animosity towards 
the soviet union 
were in a fantastic era of change and we focus on the 
problems at meetings like this but we ought not to neglect the fact 
that were sitting here talking to the head of the soviet union at a 
time when eastern europe for the most part enjoys the democratic 
process and enjoys a freedom that none of us would have predicted 
possible and a lot of that is because of the way in which mr 
gorbachev has conducted himself 
so theres some problems out there but we ought not to 
overlook the fact that weve come a long long way and there is 
less tension in terms of world catastrophe but theres still some 
big problems so its that kind of an approach that im bringing to 
these meetings 
q sir was there any progress today on start or cfe 
bush well thats going on but not it didnt come up 
the arms control agenda was not discussed today 
q do you think youre going to moscow 
bush huh 
q do you think hell invite you to moscow 
bush eventually 
q did you watch him out of the car sir 
bush eventually huh 
q did you watch him when he get out of the car down there on 
15th street 
bush no i didnt see that 
q a big crowd 
bush was it 
q a big crowd yes i think hes taking your advice about 
parades

q when he left he indicated that he was hoping there would be 
more indepth discussion were there indepth discussions today

bush well i dont know i think he thinks they were 
indepth chuckles

street inaudible

former philippines first lady imelda marcos 
collapsed and coughed up blood thursday during her federal 
racketeering trial and was taken by ambulance to a hospital 
mrs marcos who twice in the last month had fallen ill with high 
blood pressure was carried out on a stretcher an oxygen mask on 
her face and was taken to new york hospital 
tests showed evidence of bleeding in her stomach said jonathan 
weil a hospital spokesman her condition was listed as stable 
he said doctors concluded that she has erosive gastritis a 
condition in which acid produced by the stomach erodes the organs 
lining 
mrs marcos 60 was treated with intravenous medication to 
suppress the production of acid weil said 
it is expected that she will be in the hospital for several 
days until her condition which is not lifethreatening has 
improved he said 
the spokesman said mrs marcos was alert conscious awake and 
not excessively in pain 
the condition wasnt thought to be related to the blood pressure 
problem said dr david case an internist who has been treating 
mrs marcos for high blood pressure 
asked if the problem could be stressrelated he said it could 
be 
the incident occurred just as mrs marcos attorney gerry 
spence completed cross examining a witness 
mrs marcos began coughing into a black handkerchief and then 
slumped forward in her chair 
i heard a deep groan and she passed out on the table spence 
said 
jurors watched as her lawyers and supporters rushed to her aid 
us district judge john f keenan quickly excused the jurors until 
tuesday and cleared the courtroom 
an attorney for mrs marcos benjamin cassiday said that she was 
gagging on her own blood and that her doctor who was in 
attendance instructed aides to hold her head up as he administered 
to her 
when i saw her face and throwing up blood i thought she was 
going to die cassiday said 
according to james linn attorney for mrs marcos codefendant 
adnan khashoggi mrs marcos hemorrhaged from her nose and mouth as 
she fell forward and clutched her left hand to the side of her head 
it was terrible i never saw so much blood come out of 
someone khashoggi said 
linn who was sitting with his client about 8 feet from mrs 
marcos said she appeared to have fainted others said she 
apparently was not fully conscious as she was taken from the 
courtroom to the nurses office 
since her first attack on april 26 mrs marcos has worn a 
special blood pressure monitoring device that intermittenly buzzes 
she was wearing it on thursday when she collapsed 
if shes not well enough to participate in her own defense and 
if the doctors dont think shes well enough i wont let her back 
for all the tea in china said another marcos lawyer john bartko 
mrs marcos has been on trial since march 20 on charges of 
racketeering racketeering conspiracy mail fraud and obstruction of 
justice 
she is accused of having helped her late husband former 
philippines president ferdinand marcos steal more than 220 million 
from their countrys treasury to buy four new york buildings and 
artwork 
khashoggi is charged with fraud and obstructing justice for 
allegedly faking documents to show that he owned the real estate and 
paintings 
i think the agony of a lengthy drawnout trial is taking its 
toll on her as it has on all of us cassiday said 
family members at the hospital included mrs marcos daughter 
irene her sisterinlaw fortuna barba and her stepsister a nun 
sister bellarmine 
her illness came one day after mrs marcos became upset when the 
judge angrily rebuked spence in front of the jury 
mrs marcos had appeared close to tears as spence and keenan had 
a heated exchange about whether the attorney had made misleading 
statements to the jury

the brand family scurried thursday to 
get the farm spruced up for some special guests soviet president 
mikhail s gorbachev and his wife raisa 
ill clean the house if i have time said cecilia brand who 
learned wednesday that the russians might be coming to the farm 
about 20 miles south of minneapolis 
this was a total surprise said mrs brand 54 im 
excited and nervous 
it wasnt certain the gorbachevs would visit the farm during 
their stop in minnesota on sunday but mrs brand said shed been 
told the soviet president would probably arrive that evening after 
meeting with business and agricultural leaders in minneapolis 
we think of ours as a typical american farm and want to convey 
what american farm life is like mrs brand said as she stopped to 
relax for a few minutes during a hectic thursday 
the brands were trying to keep up with their chores and field 
work as they clean the barn and other areas and mow the lawn 
if the weather is nice the brands would like to sit around the 
picnic table in their large yard and talk with the gorbachevs 
telling them about their family and the farm 
if its rainy the visit will be around the kitchen table 
we want to welcome them here mrs brand said this is our 
opportunity to promote some little bit of international 
understanding 
mrs brand and her 58yearold husband richard have a large 
dairy operation milking about 75 cows their total herd including 
calves and animals that will be sold for beef numbers about 250 
they also raise alfalfa corn and soybeans on their 240acre farm 
and additional acres that they rent and sell seed corn and about 
20 to 25 cats prowl the property 
the brands have farmed their land for 32 years theyre helped by 
sons greg 31 and john 27 who both live nearby 
the brands arent strangers to the job of entertaining foreign 
visitors and think that may be one reason they were chosen as 
potential hosts to the gorbachevs 
we do have a lot of foreign people who come here weve had 
several chinese and japanese and quite a few european groups mrs 
brand said she speculated that the farms closeness to the twin 
cities could help explain why state officials frequently steer 
visitors her way 
however a gorbachev visit would be far different 
security will be very very tight mrs brand said

tickets on us airlines 
that will open up travel to many soviet citizens who do not have 
access to us dollars or other easilyconvertible currencies with 
which to purchase tickets the soviet ruble generally cannot be 
exchanged for other forms of currency 
under the agreement soviet airlines would serve as a middleman 
in selling such tickets to soviet travelers the pact calls for up 
to 875 percent of tickets on any given flight to be made available 
to purchasers with rubles 
the pact would increase from the current four to 14 us and 
soviet cities served now flights are allowed only between moscow

nearly 500 contra rebels surrendered 
their weapons on the first day of a renewed disarmament agreement a 
united nations spokesman said thursday 
the spokesman fernando castanon said the disarmament of 498 
guerrillas from five security zones brings to 2482 the number of 
rebels who have demobilized since the process began may 8 about 
11500 remain in the security zones policed by un forces 
also thursday the united states turned over to nicaragua 60 
million the first payment of 300 million in aid approved by 
congress john leonard charges daffaires at the us embassy 
presented the check to foreign minister enrique dreyfus the 
nicaraguan economy is in serious financial straits 
the rebels agreed wednesday to renew the demobilization process 
and to disarm the entire contra army by a previously agreedto 
deadline of june 10 
in return the government agreed to provide more than 20 
development zones in combat areas where contras and their families 
can settle it provides them with their own police forces and with 
voices in local town councils and government ministries aiding in 
the resettlement 
the rebels will get title to land and be given priority in 
getting compensation for property confiscated by the former 
sandinista government 
the contras agreed to demobilize at least 100 rebels from each 
zone daily although they will have to double that rate to meet the 
june 10 deadline 
the latest agreement is one of a number reached between the 
contras and the government of president violetta barrios de chamorro 
the demobilization process was stopped by the contras once after 
a series of crippling strikes by the public sector in which the 
sandinistaled strikers got virtually everything they wanted 
the contras said this made them worry about the stability of the 
government in the face of the sandinista opposition 
the contras with american backing fought the leftist sandinista 
regime for nine of the 10 years it held power in a war that cost 
about 30000 lives 
the sandinista newspaper barricada said thursday that the 
government gave the contras too much 
it said the deal lacks an obligatory clause that offers the 
citizenry guarantees on the disarmament of the contras 
mrs chamorro said wednesday that gen humberto ortega the 
former sandinista defense minister who remains in charge of the 
army will develop a plan to reduce the armys size after the 
contras have disarmed 
her retention of ortega brother of former sandinista president 
daniel ortega also has been a point of controversy among the 
contras and one of a number of pressures on her new administration

mcmartin preschool 10 years ago and cut the ears off a rabbit to 
keep her silent 
the last of three child witnesses in buckeys retrial also said 
he squeezed birds to death to scare her into silence 
but the girl said she could remember nothing else about the years 
she attended the familyowned manhattan beach preschool 
most of her answers on crossexamination were i dont 
remember and she flatly denied accusations she made against 
buckeys mother peggy mcmartin buckey during her testimony in the 
case five years ago 
under questioning by deputy district attorney pam ferrero the 
girl said buckey molested her while playing the horsey game in a 
classroom at the preschool 
buckey 32 is charged with raping the girl and using a finger to 
rape and sodomize her 
under crossexamination by buckeys attorney danny davis the 
girl said both she and buckey were naked during the incident 
in a classroom on a regular school day davis asked 
incredulously 
yes said the girl 
she acknowledged that she didnt remember buckey being her 
teacher nor did she remember who any of her teachers were 
the defense has said buckey didnt teach at the school from 1979 
to 1981 when the girl attended witnesses have said he may have 
been a teachers helper for part of the time

the naacp agreed to drop a lawsuit against 
former staff attorneys who it alleged kept more than 2 million in 
fees illegally the organization said thursday 
a statement issued by the national association for the 
advancement of colored people gave no details on the disposition of 
the fees 
it said only that an agreement was reached with former naacp 
general counsel nathaniel jones who is now a judge on the sixth 
us circuit court of appeals 
naacp president benjamin hooks said in the statement the dispute 
was an honest difference of opinion as to how these fees should be 
distributed 
a lawsuit pending in cleveland was being dismissed as part of the 
agreement the statement said others besides jones were parties to 
the case but the statement did not mention them and the naacp 
office did not answer a telephone call seeking clarification 
the legal fees resulted from five discrimination cases dating to 
1970

president bush and mikhail s gorbachev 
grappled over terms of german unity after an opening round of 
summitry thursday that set the stage for major agreements on 
chemical and nuclear weapons overall bush declared the mood is 
very positive 
the two leaders began their talks proclaiming a new era of 
cooperation in spite of their differences the trenches of the 
cold war are disappearing gorbachev said 
bush saluted gorbachevs leadership in a tacit boost for his 
plunging popularity at home and vowed to end decades of division 
and discord 
after nearly five hours of discussions bush and gorbachev 
readily acknowledged they could not settle nettlesome questions this 
week over the shape of conventional forces in europe or the military 
bearing of a unified germany 
it is not here that the german question will be resolved the 
soviet president told reporters separately bush said certainly 
were not going to solve the whole issue at this summit 
secretary of state james a baker iii and soviet foreign minister 
eduard shevardnadze will take up the issue next week in copenhagen 
during a meeting of the 35nation european security conference 
there was confusion over whether the superpowers were making any 
progress on germany gorbachev said at one point that both sides had 
advanced certain ideas certain suggestions and white house 
press secretary marlin fitzwater said new ideas amounted to a 
way to meld the concerns of the united states and the soviet union 
but several hours later a us official told reporters there 
are no new ideas and let it be known that bush would call west 
german chancellor helmut kohl and reassure him of bushs fidelity to 
the new germanys membership in the wests nato alliance gorbachev 
favors some formula that guarantees a renewed german militarism 
the impasse didnt stay the leaders from providing an upbeat view 
of the summit bush said id just say at the end of a very 
interesting day that the talks have gone reasonably well 
gorbachev who told a state dinner audience that the enemy 
image is becoming a thing of the past sprinkled the day with a 
series of unexpected appearances that have become his trademark 
as he did during his 1987 visit to washington gorbachev 
delighted a downtown crowd by hopping out of his limousine and 
shaking hands the throng of about 500 people cheered and applauded 
gorby over here some shouted 
twice he made a beeline to reporters waiting in the white house 
driveway for impromptu news conferences 
after largely ceding the limelight to gorbachev during the day 
bush made an unscheduled appearance in the rose garden to respond to 
questions the talks have certainly gone as well as i could have 
expected up to now he said 
the white house said agreements would be signed friday ending 
production of chemical weapons and sealing the major elements of a 
treaty to slash longrange nuclear arms the leaders will also 
commit themselves to deeper cuts in the years ahead 
hopes faded for progress on reducing tanks and troops in europe 
an issue intertwined with the thornier question of german unity 
bush said he spoke frankly with gorbachev he didnt seem to 
take offense at anything i feel very comfortable with him i 
feel very free to bring up positions that i know he doesnt agree 
with bush said 
gorbachev said he and bush understand each others concerns 
better

president bush and soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachev on thursday directed their top diplomatic aides to meet 
next week to seek a postsummit agreement on the military face of a 
united germany 
a meeting between secretary of state james a baker iii and 
soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze was set for tuesday 
in copenhagen after bush and gorbachev reached an impasse on 
whether a new germany would be a member of nato a second june 
session in berlin was tentatively scheduled for the two aides 
bush and gorbachev exchanged what the soviet leader called new 
approaches and marlin fitzwater the white house spokesman said 
optimistically the ideas presented amount to a way to meld the 
concerns of the united states and the soviet union 
later a bush administration official sought to play down any 
perception that there had been a breakthrough the official who 
spoke on condition of anonymity said bush would call west german 
chancellor helmut kohl within the next day or so to reassure him 
that we have not changed our position on a united germany 
bush is determined to secure nato membership for the new germany 
once it is created while gorbachev is equally intent on keeping the 
country out of the western alliance or at least restricting the size 
of the german army 
both the us side and the soviet side put forth certain ideas 
and suggestions on thursday gorbachev said he gave no details 
but a soviet official told the associated press the soviets wanted 
germanys future taken up by the 35nation european security 
conference 
i hope that we understand each others concerns better 
gorbachev said as he left the white house 
this exchange of views now requires that our foreign ministers 
have a more indepth discussion he told reporters i think it 
is not here that the german question will be resolved 
bush said later that certainly was the case but the us 
president who appeared outside the white house shortly after 
gorbachev left added when he said that differences had been 
narrowed somewhat im taking some heart from that and well 
continue these discussions tomorrow 
fundamental positions have not changed he said 
bush offered his own public assurances to gorbachev that we can 
work together to reduce eastwest tensions on a broad front 
the two leaders aired their differences on germany publicly at a 
morning arrival ceremony and then privately in the oval office 
in addition to the bakershevardnadze session in copenhagen us 
officials said baker also will meet separately in the danish capital 
with west german foreign minister hansdietrich genscher who has 
been the point man for the west in trying to work out an 
accommodation with moscow 
genscher for instance proposed keeping nato troops out of what 
is now east germany after the merger with west germany 
baker shevardnadze and genscher had all planned to be in 
copenhagen to attend a 35nation conference on human rights a 
meeting also had previously been scheduled among the four world war 
ii allies and the two germanys in berlin on the subject of germanys 
future 
gorbachev told reporters in a white house driveway that bush 
defended his viewpoint on germany during their talks 
i think dictation is unacceptable the soviet leader said 
but he did not renew his accusation of the previous day that the 
united states was indeed trying to dictate to the soviet union 
meanwhile germany and unrest in the baltics dominated the 
meeting baker held with shevardnadze at the white house while the 
two presidents were in the oval office us officials said 
just a few blocks away meanwhile toplevel us and soviet 
negotiators held a fifth day of talks on what will be the summits 
crowning achievements a declaration of basic accord to cut 
longrange nuclear missiles and a pledge to quickly launch 
negotiations for even deeper reductions once the treaty is finished 
but deputy soviet prime minister viktor k karpov and under 
secretary of state reginald bartholomew and their aides evidently 
were unable to make significant progress in arrangements for the 
withdrawal of tens of thousands of us and soviet troops and tanks 
from europe 
this is an area where we will probably not be able to reach 
specific agreement at this point fitzwater said 
gorbachev has slowed work on this parallel treaty partly out of 
concern that a strengthened germany would be enrolled in the western 
alliance while his own allies in the warsaw pact drift away from the 
soviet orbit 
us and soviet negotiators held three rounds of talks thursday 
at the state department 
baker appearing on abctvs good morning america made plain 
there would be no retreat in the us position 
all of the western allies all of the countries of western 
europe and indeed three countries of the warsaw pact think that 
this would promote stability in europe that its important that 
that happen baker said 
so the soviet union is to some extent alone among the nations 
involved in this who have a problem with it so our job is to see if 
we can better explain it baker said 
bush in a white house arrival ceremony for the soviet leader 
hailed the impending unification of east germany with west germany 
as a milestone toward enduring cooperation in a europe whole and 
free 
but mindful of gorbachevs reservations about a more powerful 
neighbor the president assured him we can work together at this 
historic moment to reduce remaining eastwest tensions 
the trenches of the cold war are disappearing gorbachev said 
in response 
in a thinly veiled reference to his concerns about german 
unification and us demands that the new country have nato 
membership the soviet leader recalled the allies victory over 
nazism in world war ii and earlier the defeat of germany in world 
war i 
gorbachev then pointedly expressed a hope that these horrible 
wars will forever remain a thing of the past 
there were indications the two sides may be in a mood to 
compromise us officials are hinting at negotiations in the future 
to scale down both the german and soviet armies in a tradeoff deal 
between nato and the warsaw pact

he almost missed his american debut 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater waited more than an 
hour for his new counterpart arkady afrikanovich maslennikov to 
appear at the summit press center then decided to go ahead without 
him 
we have received differing reports on my counterparts 
progress fitzwater told the hundreds of assembled journalists 
who had been waiting with growing impatience for the first joint 
ussoviet briefing on the start of the summit meeting between 
presidents bush and mikhail s gorbachev 
maslennikov eventually did appear explaining his tardiness with 
a quip that instantly pitted him against fitzwater as a 
spokesmancumhumorist 
i was trying to get more information so i could be more 
specific than my counterpart mr fitzwater the new soviet 
presidential spokesman said 
maslennikov 58 replaced the familiar face of gennady i 
gerasimov who remains chief spokesman for the soviet foreign 
ministry but no longer speaks for gorbachev who appointed his own 
press secretary in april after assuming his new stronger 
presidency there has been speculation that gerasimov was passed 
over for the job because he did not get along with the western press 
corps which has become increasingly important to gorbachev 
a longtime pravda reporter who speaks heavily accented but quite 
fluent english acquired during tours in india pakistan and britain 
maslennikov paried reporters questions like an old pro joking 
occasionally but never varying from his bosss familiar positions on 
prospects for a ussoviet trade agreement the disagreement over 
the military future of a united germany and the agreements the 
leaders are scheduled to sign on friday 
he said he would speak in russian and use a translator for the 
largely englishspeaking press corps because i just dont want to 
use my very ugly english but he quickly found his english was up 
to the task and more convenient than wrestling with the earphones 
and wireless receiver used for listening to the interpretation 
he confessed he had spoken to fitzwater in advance for some 
pointers on handling the horde of reporters that far outnumbers the 
moscow press corps but as he was surrounded after the formal 
briefing and peppered with an unceasing string of more questions he 
pleaded dont squeeze me dry leave something for next time

the soviet union has protested illegal japanese 
fishing in its waters and is seeking millions of dollars in 
compensation for losses an official said thursday 
the foreign ministry delivered a protest note to the japanese 
embassy in moscow complaining of systematic violations of fishing 
treaties to the point that the agreements themselves are 
threatened spokesman vadim p perfiliev said 
perfiliev told reporters that illegal fishing exhausts stock 
reserves costing the soviet union millions of dollars he said the 
illegal fishing must be stopped and the damages paid 
in tokyo soviet diplomatic sources said a protest was addressed 
to north korea as well concerning the illegal salmon fishing in 
sovietclaimed waters of the north pacific 
it referred to the seizure of six japanese fishing boats may 913 
off sovietheld sakhalin island said the diplomats who spoke on 
condition of anonymity the boats and their crews were released soon 
after the seizures 
perfiliev said the actions of the japanese side were to blame 
for the incidents its obvious that if not for such crude 
violations the soviet side would not have seen the necessity of 
acting to correct the situation 
the protest lodged with japan did not however mention the 
highly publicized seizures may 1922 of 10 north korean vessels 
manned mostly by japanese fishermen that were also found operating 
illegally in soviet waters 
moscow has filed a separate complaint with the north korean 
embassy over those seizures the diplomatic sources said 
i believe this is the most largescale case to date one 
source said they were caught with 170000 salmon on board thats 
quite a lot 
although 70 percent to 80 percent of the crew members and much of 
the equipment aboard the vessels were japanese the sources said 
the soviet union believes legal responsibility remains with north 
korea because the ships flew the north korean flag and had north 
korean captains 
the japanese foreign ministry on thursday announced that 169 
japanese fishermen were being held by the soviets on shikotan a 
small island in the kurile chain just off the northern japanese 
island of hokkaido 
the soviet sources could not confirm the number of japanese 
fishermen being detained 
the japanese fishermen are believed to have thought they would be 
given more lenient treatment if caught while flying the north korean 
flag north korea is a soviet ally 
the north koreanflagged ships were seized outside the 200mile 
soviet zone the foreign ministry said but under international 
rules migratory fish such as salmon belong to the country where 
they were spawned 
one of the soviet sources denied speculation that the seizures 
indicate a worsening of relations between moscow and north korea 
japan and north korea have no diplomatic relations

trimmed in white over a white skirt and her trademark triple strand 
of fake pearls mrs gorbachev wore a scarlet doublebreasted jacket 
over a black skirt 
even in her black high heels mrs gorbachev was a couple of 
inches shorter than mrs bush who had on white pumps 
mrs bush led the applause when her husband said mrs gorbachevs 
return to the white house brings joy to all of our hearts 
the two women had tea with two of mrs bushs daughtersinlaw 
margaret bush of alexandria va and sharon bush of denver as well 
as the wives of vice president dan quayle secretary of state james 
a baker iii assistant secretary of state ray seitz jack matlock 
the us ambassador to the soviet union and aleksandr bessmertnykh 
the new soviet ambassador to washington 
later mrs gorbachev and her husband lunched at the soviet 
embassy with american film stars intellectuals and other luminaries

and manuscripts that she said convey the national spirit of 
russia 
several hundred guests packed a newly renovated gallery at the

a nurse accused of slashing seven patients 
intravenous feeding tubes because he was angry at the hospital where 
he worked was arrested thursday on a felony charge 
no one was seriously injured although the last incident 
discovered monday involving an 83yearold woman whose tube had 
also been slashed saturday was potentially lifethreatening 
authorities said 
kevin koss 38 of broward county was charged with tampering with 
products with intent to do great bodily harm or death and was being 
held late thursday in the broward county jail awaiting a bond 
hearing 
if convicted he faces up to 30 years in prison 
kloss a licensed practical nurse was working on the fourth 
floor of university community hospital in this fort lauderdale 
suburb where eight slashing incidents occurred over the memorial 
day weekend the county sheriffs office said 
kloss who police say confessed under questioning had worked the 
overnight shift when nearly all the incidents occurred said 
sheriffs spokesman jim leljedal 
his motive was that he was angry at the hospital for some 
disciplinary action and he wanted to get back at the hospital 
said sheriff nick navarro 
detectives were still investigating and it wasnt clear what 
prompted the disciplinary action leljedal said 
we know that he had some disciplinary problems with the 
hospital and as a result of that the hospital had taken away his 
key to the narcotics cabinet and he took that as a personal 
affront leljedal said 
kloss had worked at the hospital for more than two years the 
sheriffs office said

senators padded their incomes by 27 million 
last year by speaking to specialinterest groups but the practice 
seems to be losing some of its appeal 
the total honoraria income for senators in 1989 reported 
wednesday in annual financial disclosures was slightly below the 
levels for the two previous years and the lobbying group common 
cause said that for this year more than onethird of the senate 
34 members up from 19 in 1988 have sworn off keeping speaking 
fees for their personal use 
one member on the common cause list sen rudy boschwitz has 
relapsed after declining in the past to keep honoraria he 
retained 11284 last year saying he was strapped for funds 
because of the cost of maintaining three houses boschwitz 
president of a lumber company has holdings that could be worth 
more than 34 million common cause said he has promised to resume 
his old policy this year 
as usual the top talker was senate minority leader bob dole 
rkan who raked in 108900 senators are not allowed to keep 
more than 40 percent of their salaries in honoraria so dole gave 
all but 35750 to charity

in swedish sports history harry 
persson was a tragic figure 
a talented heavyweight he went to the united states in 1926 to 
try to take the world boxing title from jack dempsey he was beaten 
by his own naivete and honesty 
now two swedes are putting perssons story to music for a 
fulllength opera commissioned by the royal opera house 
it is a tearjerker full of hard punches against the tear 
glands said novelist torbjorn savfe author of the libretto the 
score is being composed by larsake frankeblom for a 1992 
premiere 
savfe said the opera understood to be the first written about a 
boxer is full of ring action even the statue of liberty wears a 
boxing glove in one scene 
the music is modern interwoven with hits from the 1920s 
persson was a stone worker with a rockhard right who beat every 
european he met in the ring he was an idol whose popularity in the 
economically depressed sweden of the 20s matched that of another 
sports hero of the early 80s tennis champion bjorn borg 
the americans longed for a european who could match jack 
dempsey savfe said dempsey was heavyweight champion 19191926 
persson crossed the atlantic with hopes of punching his way to 
wealth and fame his swedish compatriot the late actress greta 
garbo arrived a year ahead of him 
but reality dealt persson a knockout blow he was confronted by 
a boxing world controlled by cheats and intriguers anyone who 
refused to play by their rules was crushed 
persson was the honest swede filled with romantic ideas of the 
american dream of success he believed he could beat his way to the 
gold through good craftsmanship savfe said he was completely 
outwitted 
persson began well defeating johnny risco carl carter and jack 
adams 
but persson insisted on doing things his way he refused to fire 
his swedish manager and sign on with american promoters suddenly 
he started losing 
in a match against bud gorman persson was disqualified for 
hitting below the belt after gorman had lifted his shorts high over 
his abdomen 
he lost on points against pat mccarthy although he won 10 
rounds he was the victim of con tricks safve said 
persson never got a chance to meet dempsey he returned to 
sweden in 1927 disillusioned his boxing career virtually over 
his wife took his money and their son and deserted him savfe said 
the staging of the opera includes several of perssons 
successful matches and his disqualification in the gorman fight in 
a final scene four years after he returns to sweden a fallen hero 
persson fights norwegian otto von porat 
he goes down and just sits on the mat in the ring after the 
first blow in the first round and he shakes his head the tragedy 
is completed savfe said 
persson died in 1979 at age 81 savfe said no one visited him 
in a sanatorium outside stockholm during the last seven years of 
his life 
sweden got a world heavyweight champion in 1959 when ingemar 
johansson beat floyd patterson patterson retook the title a year 
later johansson is now 57 and occasionally appears as a sports 
commentator on television

success has taught lisa stansfield a new way to 
walk 
i never look at anybody says the 23yearold british soul 
singer whose debut album affection quickly went gold 
i just look straight ahead or at the floor and hope i go the 
right way when you walk down the street theres going to someone 
whos going to start whispering and pointing thats part of what i 
am now 
a few years ago she and songwriting partners ian devaney and 
andy morris were sitting in a manchester pub sharing stories of 
boring jobs and deadend bands wondering if they should take a 
crack at forming a group 
now stansfield sits at a small table in the lounge of a 
manhattan hotel still tired from playing the night before in 
philadelphia the first time she had visited the city of teddy 
pendergrass the ojays and other soul performers of the 70s she 
heard as a kid 
when youre really young you think of american musicians of 
being different on the other side of the world completely 
different people said stansfield wearily pouring herself tea 
its like theyre not real in a way you build them up in your 
own mind 
i remember my sister used to be into the beach boys she 
always used to go babysitting on a saturday night and she always 
used to put the beach boys on you did have the picture of going on 
the beach surfing it always seemed like a dream world far from 
what i am 
over an hour long affection sounds as if it were a a 
minihistory of soul music in stansfields lifetime from the 
supremes to aretha franklin to the philadelphia groups stansfield 
born in roachdale england is something of a minihistorian 
herself starting her musical education at age 4 with motown 
records 
a lot of english bands and english people were influenced by 
soul music said stansfield referring to soul ii soul simply 
red sade and other performers of britsoul 
obviously they imitated that sound and that kind of singing 
ive got an accent like this because of my parents i sing like 
this because of those records 
by the time she was 10 stansfield had decided she wanted to 
sing and had already met her future musical partners she attended 
the same school as devaney while morris was a friend from another 
school 
together these three blueeyed soul artists blue zone they 
call themselves do their best to copy sounds they were too young 
to hear the first time around the single all around the world 
is a perfect example a dance song complete with opening rap sharp 
string breaks philadelphia style and stansfields gospel turns on 
the chorus 
ian came up with the riff melody and chorus and he said 
can you do something to this write some lyrics do some verses 
and bridge stansfield explained its quite simple a lot of 
the songs on the album were like that i think thats where the 
magic lies in the spontaneity 
writing is a little like walking the streets for stansfield a 
matter of closing her eyes and hoping she heads in the right 
direction at that same sob session in manchester morris and 
devaney argued with her about writing songs she had never tried 
and didnt want to 
her friends persisted pointing out her gift for improvising and 
insisting that writing required the same skills 
whatever comes out of my fingers comes out basically 
stansfield said 
its really strange sometimes your mind thinks so quickly 
its got a word ready before youve written the last one five 
minutes later youve got two verses and a chorus you look at it 
and it makes complete sense you think where did that come from 
 
if meeting people on the street is no longer possible 
stansfield can at least check out the fans while on stage a 
surprising mix she says black and white old and young she can 
also shake hands with some famous strangers the ones who taught 
her to sing the kind of people whove spent years listening to 
whispers on the street 
its so weird when you meet all these people its like youve 
idolized these people all this time stansfield said i met 
dionne warwick and she was so complimentary just a normal woman 
just like me i just thought yeah right on

the sex business has been a fast track to success 
for kimiko matsuzaka queen of porno videos but japanese social 
values are changing and someday that road may close 
ms matsuzaka earns more than five times the average for a 
working woman of her age which is 21 and now is moving into more 
conventional entertainment she recently completed a series of 
appearances fully dressed in a primetime television drama and is 
a regular on a television talk show 
i see myself as a success story she said in an interview at 
the offices of diamond visual inc one of japans most prolific 
makers of adult videos im happy doing what im doing 
other porno stars have moved smoothly into mainstream 
entertainment before ms matsuzaka who made 15 videos last year 
and many more may want to follow 
opposition is growing to japans anythinggoes pink world 
which ranges from geisha liaisons with politicians to neonlit 
strip joints and bathhouses that sell sex 
it is abnormal for a society to nurture the sex business the 
way japans does said mizuho matsuda director of help a 
shelter for women major tv networks and magazines praise it 
without the awareness that this just isnt right 
critics of sex on television won a major victory in april with 
the cancellation of a talkvariety program that had pushed the 
limits of discretion for 25 years it mixed trendy themes with 
nudity scenes from porno videos and reviews of sex shops 
a few years ago programming was such that the networks were 
even criticized in parliament said an official of the national 
association of commercial broadcasters to which all five major 
private networks belong 
no legislation was enacted and each network made changes 
voluntarily said the official who spoke on condition of anonymity 
ms matsuda of help said social values are changing but she 
believes the main reason for less sex on television is that it has 
become less profitable 
sex stopped boosting tv ratings because of the increasing 
abundance of porno videos books and other materials she said 
people who want to watch that kind of thing no longer look for it 
on television 
there are other signs of changing values 
a scandal arising from allegations that prime minister sousuke 
uno had kept a paid mistress helped drive him from office last 
summer and a tokyo district packed with highprofile sex 
businesses is in decline 
the notorious kabukicho was noted for bars glitzy massage 
parlors and streets of love hotels with special rates for stays 
of an hour or so 
norio iwabuchi chairman of an association of sex business 
owners in the district said kabukicho peaked about five years ago 
with about 200 businesses tougher rules were enforced in 1985 and 
the number has declined by twothirds he said 
iwabuchi said he believed authorities imposed stricter zoning 
and restrictions on operating hours because the industry became too 
gaudy 
the police look at prostitution this way dont get rid of it 
all leave some and close your eyes so long as it stays in its 
place and there isnt any trouble he said we stood out too 
much 
it used to be possible for a woman to start in a peep show and 
go on to become a star but those days are gone iwabuchi said 
as a seminude filipina danced before oneway mirrors at one of the 
kabukicho peep shows he owns 
he attributed much of the change to japans growing wealth and 
greater opportunity for women to earn good pay in other work 
money used to justify just about anything but japan now can 
afford to look down on people who make it the way we do he said 
not many years ago travel agencies helped organize sex tours to 
asian countries where more than 1 million japanese men sought the 
services of prostitutes in the early 1980s 
criticism from southeast asian countries helped cool that fad 
but at about the same time tens of thousands of asian women began 
arriving in japan each year 
since 1986 ms matsudas center has helped nearly 1000 women 
escape exploitation in the sex business most of them from thailand 
or the philippines 
the women are called japayuki meaning those who go to 
japan ironically the word comes from karayuki for japanese 
women who went abroad as maids or prostitutes early in the century 
many karayuki were sold by their families as a way to escape 
poverty sending a daughter into prostitution was never honorable 
but in those days japanese authorities licensed brothels and they 
were an accepted aspect of society 
japans long history of sexual freedom for men lives on in a 
multibilliondollar sex industry 
telephone booths near railroad stations are plastered with 
stickers advertising clubs where prostitutes can be contacted 
young businessmen paging through sexually explicit comic books are 
a common sight 
pornographic magazines are on the racks in neighborhood 
convenience stores and campaigners against sexforsale find it a 
tough target 
prostitution wasnt outlawed until 1958 and then only because 
japan felt pressure from the united states so the social awareness 
of the sex industry as bad is still shallow ms matsuda said 
japan has 1463 soaplands or bathhouses that sell sex 
police say according to statistics from 1988 the most recent 
available 3337 people were arrested for prostitution and related 
offenses 
police officials acknowledge privately that the statistics 
represent only a small fraction of the activity 
this is a mans paradise said nobuko oba a member of the 
tokyo city council anything you might want you can find it 
here 
she added however that unos geisha scandal showed social 
values were changing 
ms oba granted that the reports of the prime minister having 
paid a former geisha to be his mistress shocked the political world 
because the woman and media broke the code of silence not because 
of the moral implications of unos conduct 
but the fact that it created a controversy is enough for me 
she said i think the sex scandal proved that at least the 
publics way of looking at women and the sex industry is changing 
ms oba has created a stir by demanding the tokyo city 
government stop supporting bus tours to oiran shows in 
yoshiwara the former brothel district 
oiran were highclass prostitutes in the samurai days the tours 
are promoted as a cultural outing to see an elaborately costumed 
woman perform an oirans dance and play traditional instruments 
tokyo is the bus companys major shareholder the oiran tours 
continue

the narrow hot smoky corridors of a 
resettlement office are crammed with soviet jews young and 
middleaged couples elderly women world war ii veterans with rows 
of medals on their chests 
hysterical arguments flare up in the long lines besieged 
officials look exhausted a woman tries to push ahead of others to 
a lawyer who is supposed to help immigrants deal with landlords 
several people shout angrily finally someone cries please 
please stop it are we all animals 
confusion is everywhere as israel struggles to absorb a huge 
influx of soviet jews that caught the government by surprise 
threatening to overwhelm social services and balloon the national 
debt and unemployment 
the surge of arrivals also complicates the middle east 
situation artab nations see the immigration as a threat to 
palestinians in the occupied west bank and gaza strip 
officials and private citizens in israel welcome the newcomers 
whatever the problems they pose as a fulfillment of the ageold 
dream of ingathering jewish exiles 
israelis hope the tide will result in the country having enough 
jews to survive economically and militarily to keep abreast of an 
arab population with a much higher birth rate 
the soviet immigants also may break the deadlock in the struggle 
for political control between the centerleft labor party of shimon 
peres and the rightwing likud bloc led by yitzhak shamir the 
caretaker prime minister 
they will tip the ethnic balance between the jews of european 
origin and those from middle east countries how virtually equal in 
number and influence the relative weight given to religious and 
secular issues 
already their presence has changed the face of israeli society 
television news carries subtitles in the cyrillic alphabet 
banks advertise savings plans in russian 
department store chains hire russianspeaking personnel and 
offer the newcomers special installment plans liquor stores stock 
israelimade vodka called by such familiar names as stolichnaya and 
zubrowka a polish brand popular in the soviet union 
satellite dishes on immigrants houses are tuned to moscow 
television newspaper stands offer russianlanguage weeklies 
british tycoon robert maxwell and the hebrew newspaper maariv plan 
to publish a daily in russian 
state television has devoted hours of programming to the new 
israelis including a threehour broadcast with live hookups to 
moscow and a to plane carrying immigrants from from budapest 
hungary 
pushed by growing uncertainty and antisemitism in the soviet 
union and new restrictions on us immigration soviet arrivals 
rose from a trickle to a record 35000 so far in 1990 
forecasts say 500000 to 1 million soviet jews could come 
eventually that would be the largest influx since 19481951 when 
the new nation took in 685000 immigrants from 42 countries 
doubling its population 
months passed before israeli officials fully comprehended the 
sheer volume which has reached 1000 on some days 
the official forecast of 40000 immigrants in 1990 has been 
raised to at least 100000 and possibly 150000 
israel is now in the midst of an emergency said yitzhak 
peretz the absorption minister the wave of immigration grows 
every day we must act urgently 
jews abroad have undertaken a major fundraising effort 
including a pledge of 420 million by us jews but it is far from 
enough 
in early may the government added 125 billion to the 900 
million budgeted for settling immigrants that meant budget cuts 
and more borrowing abroad 
the system cant keep up 
in holon a tel aviv suburb nissim spiegelmacher gets up at 4 
am an hour later he joins a line forming outside the absorption 
ministry office which opens at 7 am other immigrants who 
arrive later are turned away 
an official has to deal with 35 families a day said 
spiegelmacher 49 a bearded engineer from odessa the rooms are 
crowded the organization is terrible 
his wife nora a 47yearold chemist complained that 
government offices were open only in the morning while they were 
in hebrew class one of them has to miss class in order to get the 
paperwork done she said 
alexei streimushov a theater director from kiev in his late 
20s mused that long lines were familiar to soviet immigrants 
in those lines people bark at each other they start to hate 
each other just like in the soviet union he said 
housing and employment are the main problems the government 
wants to start building 70000 apartments this year including 
45000 public housing units but officials say the first units 
would take 16 months to complete 
the government system of subsidizing rental apartments has 
pushed prices up and led to a projected shortage of 29000 units in 
the mediumprice range by the end of this year 
nathan sharansky who spent nine years in soviet prison camps 
for human rights activism and immigrated in 1986 said his warnings 
about an immigration boom had been ignored and he fears the housing 
crisis is not taken seriously 
we have lines of people seeking apartments and its already 
clear that we would not have a single apartment in a few months 
he said for a year we speak about construction and we are not 
building 
israels economy still staggers from loss of tourism and extra 
military costs resulting from the 2yearold palestinian uprising 
unemployment has averaged 93 percent so far this year 
finding jobs for the soviet jews is especially difficult because 
one in four is a highly educated professional they face tough 
competition in a labor market that already has 24 percent 
professionals compared to 16 percent in the united states 
david mena head of the staterun employment service said most 
immigrants would start hunting jobs late this summer when their 
hebrew language courses are completed 
when we have six people competing for every job and no new 
jobs being created these immigrants would not find jobs in their 
profession he said 
immigration has inflamed ethnic tensions among jews a debate on 
resettlement costs has pitted many ashkenazis of european descent 
including soviet jews against sephardis of middle eastern origin 
there are fears that financial resources are being diverted from 
the negev and other predominantly sephardi areas where factories 
have been closing and laying off workers 
some callers to radio shows and letters to newspapers have 
suggested the immigrants be put in tent camps like the sephardis 
were in the 1950s 
whether more of the newcomers will choose likud or labor is not 
known but most are secular and may upset the ultraorthodox 
political factions ability to be a kingmaker in coalition 
governments 
the interior ministry is controlled by the shas party which 
represents ultraorthodox sephardi jews it demanded proof that the 
immigrants were jewish 
this angered the soviet jews officials said many had mixed 
marriages and were even nonjews by orthodox definition 
the influx has stirred national pride israelis have volunteered 
to help adopting families and taking gifts of furniture and 
kitchen utensils to immigrant homes at least 50 volunteer groups 
have been formed 
in many places we have more volunteers ready to help the 
immigrants than we have immigrants said yuri stern an adviser 
to parliaments committee on absorption 
uri gordon head of the jewish agencys immigration department 
said israel needs 6 million jews to be secure enough to make peace 
with the arabs 
negotiations with our neighbors will then be easier he 
said every jew who comes from russia makes the prospects for 
peace stronger 
arabs especially the palestine liberation organization have 
expressed fear that immigrants will flood the occupied territories 
displacing palestinians 
israeli officials said only about 200 soviet jews had settled in 
the occupied lands

the horshaks are afraid of leaving of 
what the future in israel will bring but uncertainty and 
antisemitism in the soviet union are more frightening still 
they have joined hundreds of thousands of other soviet jews in 
applying to leave for israel a record 35000 have gone so far in 
1990 and israeli officials expect up to 150000 soviet jews to 
arrive by years end 
we want to leave because the situation in general is very 
unstable said svetlana horshak a plump 45yearold chemist 
the possibility of some nationalistic outbursts in the country is 
also very unpleasant 
russian nationalist movements have had little impact in this 
black sea port city of 11 million once a thriving jewish center 
but odessa is in the ukraine which has a long history of 
antisemitism 
mrs horshak said i almost dont feel it here especially 
among my friends but even the talk about possible pogroms 
elsewhere is quite unpleasant and i think there is a 50 percent 
possibility it may happen here what is important is that i 
cannot say what i can expect from people with whom i have normal 
good relations under extreme conditions 
for her husband mikhail a 43yearold engineer fears and 
uncertainty about the future are embodied in marina their 
13yearold daughter 
she is the reason i want to leave horshak said 
he sat at a table bearing thin tablets of unleavened matzo bread 
made for passover which commemorates the flight of jews from 
ancient egypt 
the solitary reminder of the holiday illustrated the frail links 
many families in the soviet union have with jewish tradition 
it took the horshaks nearly two decades to decide to leave 
mrs horshak wanted to emigrate in the early 1970s when some of 
her relatives and friends left for israel and the united states at 
the time she thought of going to america 
mikhail felt he could not abandon his native country and the 
town of his birth and there was no pressing need to impove their 
living standard 
the family has spent four generations in a comparatively 
spacious apartment first occupied by mrs horshaks 
greatgrandmother who moved to odessa in the 1920s 
the horshaks earn 500 rubles a month a medium income that kept 
them here while others sought a better living abroad 
svetlana does environmental research for the city sanitation 
department and mikhail a maritime engineer is an expert on 
industrial waste disposal 
after deciding to leave they asked relatives in israel to send 
them an invitation which is needed to start emigration procedures 
the document arrived in april and now the horshaks are waiting 
to apply for an exit visa they are no 180 on the list 
even after many radio broadcasts letters and conversations with 
tourists israel remains a mystery to the horshaks 
they pepper a visitor from israel with questions whats the 
climate like should they take winter clothes mikhails tools is 
hebrew a difficult language is this furniture worth packing would 
mikhail be doing army reserve duty 
most of all they fear having to live in the occupied 
territoris where 70000 israeli settlers are surrounded by 17 
million palestinians 
is that true that we are going to be sent to the territories 
to become a buffer between israelis and palestinians mikhail 
asked the visitor 
israel says there is no policy of settling jews in the west bank 
and gaza strip and that only 200 soviet immigrants live there 
for marina submerged in reading aerobics and pop music the 
prospect of leaving seems like an adventure 
her parents are more realistic mikhail a selfstyled mechanic

vladimir kislik a nuclear physicist who worked 
in a soviet atomic weapons program has had to take a job analyzing 
coal ashes 
kislik who arrived a year ago is lucky to have work nearly 
one of every four soviet jewish immigrants is a highly educated 
professional and israel is having trouble absorbing such an influx 
of brain power 
israel cannot provide employment for the thousands of 
scientists who will immigrate in the next two years absorption 
minister yitzhak peretz said recently 
amos rubin prime minister yitzhak shamirs economics adviser 
said of the highly qualified professionals if we absorb even one 
in 10 successfully we know we are on the right track 
this years immigration figures are staggering and the volume 
caught israeli officials by surprise 
the jewish agency which assists immigrants says each 100000 
immigrants from the soviet union includes nearly 23000 
professionals about 11000 engineers 2500 doctors and dentists 
2000 scientists and roughly 7000 others such as computer 
specialists and nurses 
up to 150000 soviet jews are expected to arrive this year 
no figures are available on how the 10000 professionals who 
arrived in the past six months have fared but employment 
opportunities are limited 
universities and government laboratories have places for only a 
small number engineers and researchers few hightech jobs are 
being created in private industry because of a recession brought 
on in part by the 2yearold palestinian uprising in the 
occupied west bank and gaza strip 
there is fierce competition from israels highly skilled labor 
force of which professionals make up 24 percent compared to 16 
percent in the united states 
israeli officials say unemployment for university graduates 
exceeds the nationwide average rate of 9 percent thousands of 
engineers and scientists have sought work abroad mainly in the 
united states 
haim harari a physicist who heads the respected weizmann 
institute in rehovot said earlier this year the soviet immigrants 
should not receive preferential treatment 
i cant accept a situation where we create jobs only open to 
russian immigrants and israelis are in the united states waiting to 
come back but cant find jobs he said its sheer idiocy to 
export our people to the united states and import russians 
problems of settling the immigrants have been exacerbated by 
political instability since the collapse march 15 of the coalition 
government of the rightwing likud bloc and centerleft labor party 
among other things it delayed appropriation of an extra 1 
billion for the program 
private programs have been organized but they help only a 
relative few of the newcomers 
for example satec a small hightech firm in jerusalem that 
hired kislik was founded two years ago to hire soviet scientists 
australian businessman joseph gunick put up 3 million 
the company which makes digital electricity meters and 
technology to extract gold from lowgrade ores employs 35 recent 
arrivals from the soviet union scientific director herman 
branover who came from the soviet union in 1972 said the company 
was making a modest profit 
satec remains unique branover said he tried to duplicate it 
but failed because foreign investors would not finance highrisk 
ventures in a country with unstable politics and an infamous 
bureaucracy 
im very angry especially with the american jews branover 
said they have been marching for years on fifth avenue shouting 
let my people go now that the russians are indeed coming the 
american jews are doing very little 
rubin the adviser to shamir said any government employment 
program for soviet professionals must focus on investment in 
hightech firms as a way to lure foreign capital rubin said he 
had proposed that the government guarantee twothirds of an 
investment 
he predicted rising unemployment tax increases and a reduction 
in social services for all israelis because of an immigration rate 
that on a per capita basis would amount to 20 million arrivals a 
year in the united states 
branover said most of the newcomers were ready to make 
sacrifices 
we have people here who used to be managers of giant factories 
with 5000 employees and they are happy to get a job as a simple 
engineer he said 
kislik 54 knows about sacrifices 
after requesting permission to emigrate to israel in 1973 he 
was sent to a soviet labor camp for three years confined to a 
psychiatric hospital for a month and beaten repeatedly by agents of 
the kgb secret police 
his wife divorced him he couldnt work as a scientist and made 
a living as a bookbinder and ticket seller in kiev 
he longs to work again in nuclear physics but has resigned 
himself to analyzing coal ashes in his tiny lavender cubicle at 
satec 
it was my dream to come to israel and i fought for this and 
i think it has been worth it kislik said

rain has poured down all morning 
but as the trail dips into rain forest any thoughts of discomfort 
vanish amid the lush undergrowth 
there is almost a sense of entering a sanctuary as the damp 
ground cover muffles the thud of boots the only sounds are water 
dripping from the canopy of branches onto huge ferns the gurgle of 
a distant brook and the occasional trill or shriek of an unseen 
bird 
the fresh scent of rain mingles with the smells of the verdant 
forest 
sunlight begins to break through the lowhanging trees 
vibrantly highlighting every possible shade of green rocks and 
limbs are covered with moss so thick it seems possible to take a 
nap and wake up covered with it 
after a few hours the trail climbs above the tree line to 
reveal stunning views of deep blue lakes below and craggy mountains 
still covered with snow in late summer clouds begin to move back 
in obscuring the sheer cliffs of distant fjords in mist 
this is hiking in new zealand which attracts nature lovers from 
thousands of miles away even the main industries help create an 
idyllic landscape rolling green hills of rich farmland and pasture 
dotted with millions of sheep 
hiking and bicycling seem a way of life for the hardy residents 
who protect and enjoy their environment they have built thousands 
of miles of hiking trails that are virtually free of debris 
in most places the water remains clean enough to drink from the 
streams at night the sky is so clear the bright stars barely 
twinkle only a sliver of moon is needed to see clearly without a 
flashlight 
for those tired of carrying and pitching tents many trails have 
the added advantage of communal wooden huts that provide warmth and 
shelter they also offer a welcome bit of camaraderie for people of 
various nationalities who range from couples carrying infants to 
people in their early 70s 
a few huts are near hot springs where a long soak can ease the 
aches of a days hiking shelters on the most popular trails fill 
quickly especially in peak seasons so early arrivals get the 
bunks and latecomers sleep on the floor 
its lovely to fall asleep with rain drumming on the roof but 
there are some inherent problems with communal living not the 
least of them are people who snore and others who like late parties 
many of the trails known here as tracks are far from easy new 
zealanders dont seem fond of switchbacks preferring instead to 
challenge their legs and lungs with more direct routes up and down 
the rough terrain 
one particularly tough track rises to a ridge 3569 feet above 
the valley in a series of steps carved from the hillside through a 
boulder field and over an anklewrenching stretch of loose rock 
called scree 
whatever the difficulties theres nothing like the isolation of 
hiking down a mountain as the early morning fog rises blanketing 
everything in a shroud of white only the sound of your footsteps 
and the trickle of distant glacierfed waterfalls break the 
silence 
it is like visiting an alien planet to trek across the desolate 
crater of an inactive volcano where lakes of startling green 
contrast with gray volcanic dust 
new zealand offers numerous coves and rushing rivers that are 
ideal for canoeing or whitewater rafting there are streems and 
lakes rich in trout black sand beaches for those who want a rest 
wildlife includes albatrosses with 10foot wingspans colonies 
of seals and penguins mischievous mountain parrots called keas and 
the reticent flightless kiwi bird that has become the national 
symbol 
the weather often consists of surprises and good rain gear is a 
must forecasting seems more guesswork than science particularly 
on the south islands west coast where rainfall may reach 300 
inches a year 
sunshine turns quickly to brooding clouds which spew downpours 
and give way to sun again trails can change to small streams dirt 
to mud solid footholds to slick rock and roots 
sandflies are probably the worst curse of hiking in new zealand 
the tiny insects swarm and bite sometimes drawing blood 
they move slowly however which means a good walking pace can 
leave them behind repellants generally drive them off and they 
disappear at night 
keas found in higher elevations are covered with thick green 
feathers that often reveal an undercovering of red while in flight 
sometimes they take hikers by surprise with low passes and loud 
screeches 
if humans give them food they dont have to spend all day 
hunting it which leaves time for mischief that sometimes borders 
on the malicious 
they have been known to tear up boots backpacks and bicycle 
seats with their sharp powerful beaks a traveler told of two keas 
that cooperated in an attempt to fly off with his bicycle helmet

video game junkies now have an alternative to 
the zapping blasting and pulverizing of the shootemup 
adventures popular on the fantasy screen 
tetris an addictive braintwisting game has no combat no 
karate chops no chases and no characters not even a story line 
like the super mario brothers 
this video cerebral challenge features building blocks soviet 
blocks that is created by a soviet scientist tetris is the first 
communist bloc video game to hit it big in the free market 
its a moving puzzle said richard epstein 43 of 
parsippany nj when i cant sleep instead of reading a book i 
play tetris 
i like the action games but this is the first real strategy 
game said david rodriguez 16 of new york city you just 
cant stop 
since its introduction to the world two years ago tetris sales 
have sizzled 
about 4 million copies are in use in homes offices and arcades 
mostly in the united states and japan the us software publishers 
association gave it four awards last year including best original 
game and best entertainment program 
its creator is chainsmoking alexey pazhitnov 35 a researcher 
at the academy of sciences in moscow who developed it in his spare 
time on his home computer which is as rare as wellstocked food 
shelves in his homeland 
when people started to play they couldnt stop pazhitnov 
told an interviewer on a tour of the united states earlier this 
year the game was like a fire 
tetris is somewhat of an electronic rubiks cube and its 
creator prefers wizardry to war 
i dont like the violent games i hate shooting games 
pazhitnov said my idea is to make constructive games not one 
where you destroy things 
tetris features seven geometric figures rods squares 
zigzags lshapes and a squat t each made up of four blocks the 
name is derived from the greek word tetra which means four 
a shape selected at random falls on the screen and the player 
can turn it on its side steer where it goes and control how fast 
it falls the object is to arrange the falling blocks in solid rows 
across the width of the screen something that appeals to 
obsessivecompulsives and problemsolvers 
filling in all the blanks does two things it scores points and 
also makes the line disappear to allow room for more shapes 
if the blanks arent filled in the blocks pile up like bricks 
in a wall the game goes on until the screen fills up which can 
take minutes or hours depending on skill levels 
the game was adapted to personal computer software by a comrade 
a teenage khaker or russian for hacker it spread to eastern 
europe and then to england where an enterprising london capitalist 
scooped up the rights and peddled it to spectrum holobyte of 
alameda calif which marketed the game for personal computers 
since 1988 spectrum has sold 150000 copies at 3995 each 
but the real action came last fall when tetris became available 
on the nintendo entertainment system which controls 80 percent of 
the us home video market and has been the hottest selling 
christmas toy three years in a row 
about 15 million tetris games at 3495 each were sold in the 
past six months the company said 
nintendo also put the puzzle on its game boy an 89 handheld 
unit about the size of a paperback book two million copies of 
tetris now belong to game boy owners 
another video power sega adapted tetris for video arcades 
but compulsion hasnt meant riches for pazhitnov the game is 
marketed through elorg the soviet foreign trade association and 
all profits go to the academy of sciences 
pazhitnov already has made a sequel called welltris a 
threedimensional version honored this year by the software 
publishers and has other games due out soon 
after years of plotting to export ideology and weaponry the 
soviets have found a smash with technology but if the united 
states can send bon jovi mcdonalds and estee lauder to moscow 
why not a soviet video game enthralling american kids 
although american parents and educators cringe at the time kids 
spend playing video games one teacher believes tetris can blast 
classroom boredom while it fosters spatial learning the stuff of 
which iq tests are made 
and it comes without the violence found in games such as blaster 
master or mega man 2 
theres a whole lot of highorder thinking going on in its 
own way it reveals a bit of the beauty of geometry said david 
thornburg director of the thornburg center for professional 
development in mountain view calif 
these video games have got these kids thinking theyre not 
killing time thornburg said we could do a whole lot to 
benefit our students if we could find out what makes them play 
video games and capture that enthusiasm for history mathematics 
and language arts 
tetris junkies rarely think about geometric equations and 
classroom motivation when consumed by a game however 
theyre too preoccupied with the shapes dribbling down their 
screens 
ive seen those shapes in my sleep said cindy quinn 29 
who uses a computer in her job with a new york credit card company 
ive played it in the morning a couple of times and it made me 
late for work you cant stop playing she said its such a 
disorderly world theres something about making things fit

it began 10 years ago today with 300 employees 
400 million in startup costs and 12 bureaus but critics who 
laughingly called it chicken noodle news then are eating crow 
now 
ted turners cable news network originally seen in only 17 
million us homes now is in 54 million it has nearly 1800 
staffers and 27 bureaus worldwide and is seen in 90 countries 
including the soviet union and it became profitable in 1985 
that the 24hour network is a global presence as well as a 
bigleague rival of the news divisions of abc cbs and nbc was 
neatly noted during the us invasion of panama in december 
nbcs tom brokaw interviewing a panama city resident by phone 
for today asked if a tv station there was describing what was 
going on 
well the man replied theyre actually relaying the cnn 
broadcast 
such recognition by either a man in panama or world leaders 
was an uncertain dream when ed turner no relation to ted 
reported for duty at cnns temporary offices in atlanta six months 
before operations began 
battle stations were in an ancient building resembling well an 
ideal fixerupper turner now cnns executive vice president 
recalls that it looked like something off of tobacco road only 
not that nice 
turner is a veteran of more than 20 years in news including a 
stop at cbs where he produced the cbs morning news 
he was running an oklahoma city station when cnn beckoned 
they said come on down and try says turner a native 
oklahoman with a deadpan sense of humor and who could say no to 
something that everybody said was going to be a sure failure 
ted turner himself became a recruiter according to a new book 
cnn the inside story it says he tried to hire walter 
cronkite the famous respected thencbs anchorman politely and 
indirectly said no 
lesser news stars who nonetheless also were respected said yes 
they included two who became the bestknown of cnns original 
anchors mary alice williams from new yorks wnbctv she returned 
to nbc last april and bernard shaw a nononsense former marine 
from abc who still is at cnn in washington 
when he joined cnn had he any feelings he might be joining the 
crew of televisions titanic no shaw says im a good 
swimmer 
network news still was riding high and considered the place to 
work when ed turner joined cnn but he found few cries of you 
must be mad when recruiting cnns grunts reporters producers 
writers bureau chiefs 
generally they were interested he says it was trying to 
sell the wife or the husband as the case may be but the desire 
to gamble was considerable among the journalists a lot of them 
said why not 
the arguments against were considerable low pay long hours no 
unions where possible and the distinct chance that at any minute 
the whole shebang might go poof indeed cnn lost 16 million its 
first year 
but local tv news had burgeoned in the 1970s turner notes and 
many younger local newsies were ready for the majors but the 
networks were full up 
we came along at the right time he says 
the new arrivals he says hadnt been tainted by exposure to 
the other networks where in those days they had so much help and 
logistical support and so many nice limousines itd ruin you from 
remembering to go out and get a story 
the hardest part he says was getting recognition from 
advertisers newsmakers and viewers that long since has been 
solved particularly among washingtons movers and shakers 
it wasnt always so in that hamlet one of the last major cities 
to get cable thats why cnn in its early days gave away satellite 
dishes to the white house the pentagon and the house and senate 
says turner 
but he thinks the real turning point came at the 1984 democratic 
convention in san francisco when cnn got a booth just like the 
big three overlooking the convention floor 
that to me he says was a symbol of theres a new 
bigtime player around folks 
that player now isnt seen only on cable or what it says are 
950000 hotel rooms 700000 in the us and canada and the 
balance abroad 
some of its reports also are seen on the news programs of 250 
us stations that are cnn affiliates turner says significantly 
the majority 160 also are network affiliates 
but turner while he enjoys needling the networks doesnt 
believe the nightly network newscasts that once ruled the national 
news roost are going the way of the pterodactyl at least not all 
three 
i think that they will survive in some form perhaps not as 
formal halfhours but as update services or feeds to their 
affiliate stations one or two may continue in their present 
form but they have to find a new editorial presentation 
that he says is because it is a different game now with cnn 
going strong and many local news operations airing national and 
international reports before tom brokaw peter jennings and dan 
rather start their newscasts 
as turner sees things a big problem for the big three is that 
the surprise factor the hey martha come here and look is 
gone

it is the headquarters for her underground network through which 
she says thousands of volunteers in all 50 states hide hundreds of 
children 
police came to the house in april with a search warrant looking 
for files or videotapes to back up a florida womans claim that mrs 
yager tried to browbeat the womans children into accusing their 
father of satanism and abuse 
since mrs yagers arrest april 14 on related charges cobb 
county police have received calls from throughout the country many 
on behalf of fathers who hope the network will be dismantled and 
their missing children returned said police lt robert pittman 
its very frustrating to a father whos been cleared of any 
wrongdoing whatsoever to know theres a nationwide organization 
whose avowed purpose is to remove children from the jurisdiction of 
our courts said thomas a massey an evansville ind attorney 
massey represents john rademacher whose exwife and 8yearold 
daughter sara have been missing since last november presumably 
hidden in mrs yagers network 
authorities seized about 40 files and tapes from mrs yagers 
home but she said the network is safe 
im not stupid i dont keep anything thats going to lead to 
any kids but they dont know that she said 
a former interior designer mrs yager 40 started children of 
the underground three years ago to shelter abuse victims she 
believes have been abandoned by the court system she estimates she 
has helped at least 500 families with one to six children each 
the case against mrs yager which is expected to go before a 
grand jury this summer involves a florida woman who said she asked 
the organization for protection because her husband physically 
abused her their 8yearold daughter and 10yearold son 
mrs yager is charged with kidnapping the boy and subjecting him 
to cruel verbal treatment a kidnapping charge involving the girl 
later was reduced to interfering with the custody of a child 
police contend mrs yager threatened to send the children back to 
their father who she said would beat them if they refused to make 
accusations against him 
cobb county district attorney tom charron described mrs yager as 
a woman with good intentions who has become obsessed 
mrs yager denies the criminal charges but she does not entirely 
disagree with charrons assessment 
i am obsessed she conceded during an interview at her home 
in an affluent sandy springs neighborhood in suburban atlanta im 
obsessed with a legal system a system designed to protect that 
destroys im obsessed with this cult business that is allowed to 
operate these people are ozzie and harriet by day and get away with 
it 
she claims many prominent lawyers and judges are generational 
satanists brought up to believe in satan 
in the basement file cabinet where she files records by state 
cult cases are earmarked with bright orange tabs 
seated on a settee in a room surrounded by antiques she strings 
together story after story of children who say they were abused 
many by fathers or relatives involved in the occult in a voice 
often just above a whisper she talks of girls used as satanic 
breeders to carry fetuses that their tormentors later sacrifice 
at times she stops to introduce a grandmother who works with the 
network or to chat with an abused teenager the youth is one of 
the changing number of house guests that vary with her caseload she 
said 
the case against her mrs yager vowed never will go to trial 
she contends the police and fbi agents assisting in the 
investigation are harassing her family and trying to destroy her 
credibility especially among law enforcement officials who trusted 
her 
my credibility has been tarnished tarred and feathered ive 
been slandered she said 
her history with cobb county authorities dates back to 1973 when 
the courts awarded custody of her own daughter michelle to the 
childs father roger lee jones even though mrs yager claimed he 
had sexually abused the girl 
she launched her underground crusade in 1987 the year after 
jones was indicted on nine counts of child molestation involving 
three minors in venice fla he still awaits trial on the charges 
memories of what happened to her daughter who now lives with 
mrs yager and her third husband keep her bent on helping other 
children she said 
fbi agent jeff holmes accompanied police on the search of mrs 
yagers house a few days after her arrest but wont say whether the 
fbi has undertaken a broad investigation of the network 
charron said that until the missing children or the locations 
where they are being hidden are found authorities can do nothing 
until you have the children or proof of where they are you 
dont have the elements of a crime he said 
any broad action involving the network would be up to the fbi 
because cobb county has limited jurisdiction charron said 
mrs yagers critics call her a media princess carried away with 
publicity 
denise gooch one of the founders of a national group called the 
mothers alliance for the rights of children which mrs yager also 
helped start described her as a reporters dream and a parents 
nightmare 
she was asked to leave because of philosophical differences 
shortly after the group started and began her own network the same 
year said another founder sarah king 
mrs yager admits she doesnt shun attention 
she traveled to a preliminary hearing in cobb county in her 
husbands rolls royce driven by her gardener wearing a hat a 
flowered dress and a corsage she listened as her attorney argued 
she should not bear court costs because she is indigent 
howard yager doesnt have to pay for attorneys for his wife i 
have no income she said adding that she transferred her property 
and money into her husbands name before starting the underground 
authorities have criticized mrs yagers interview techniques 
with children contending she intimidates them and often introduces 
the subject of satanism 
shes not objective said pittman the cobb county police 
lieutenant we feel she intimidates the child into saying things 
that arent true 
some videotapes pittman said show mrs yager screaming and 
hollering at kids threatening to send them back into an abusive 
situation 
mrs yager who has the children sit in a highbacked 
renaissancestyle chair in her library while she videotapes them 
denied she is abusive 
im very blunt about things she said i tell them youre 
at the end of the road if i cant help you not many people out 
there are going to 
she also denied bringing up satanism saying i dont want to 
believe things like that are going on im being forced to believe 
it 
helen russell a friend who has watched some of the interviews 
defended mrs yagers style and her findings about cults 
isnt it easier to think one woman is crazy mrs russell 
asked than to think our society has gotten so perverted

a bitter primary campaign for governor of california is winding 
down in a flurry of television commercials while north carolina 
democrats are choosing a challenger to republican sen jesse helms 
all told candidates in nine states are vying for support tuesday 
1990s busiest primary election day so far 
democrats dianne feinstein and john van de kamp have spent months 
attacking each others positions on abortion the death penalty and 
how to deal with californias 36 billion budget deficit 
polls suggested their race was a dead heat as they entered the 
last weekend of the primary campaign 
on the republican side sen pete wilson faced only token primary 
opposition and sat on a huge campaign war chest as he waited to 
learn which democrat would be his opponent in the race to succeed 
retiring gov george deukmejian a republican 
in north carolina harvey gantt and mike easley were in a runoff 
for the democratic senate nomination gantt the former mayor of 
charlotte finished first in a sixway primary may 8 but failed to 
get the 40 percent necessary to avoid a runoff with the secondplace 
finisher 
meanwhile helms has started running television ads accusing the 
democrats of throwing mud at him 
voters also will go to the polls tuesday in alabama iowa 
mississippi montana new jersey new mexico and south dakota 
in alabama five democrats were battling for the right to 
challenge gov guy hunt the first republican elected governor of 
the state since reconstruction the contenders were state attorney 
general don siegelman former gov fob james us rep ronnie 
flippo state sen charles bishop and paul hubbert executive 
director of the alabama education association 
sen howell heflin dala and republican state sen bill 
cabannis were assured of their party nominations setting up a 
faceoff in november 
abortion was the big issue in iowa where three democrats were 
vying to take on gop gov terry branstad an opponent of legalized 
abortion the iowa chapter of the national abortion rights action 
league endorsed don avenson speaker of the iowa house a move that 
provoked an angry response from banker john chrystal who like 
avenson supports legal abortion 
narals decision to weigh in on the race was believed aimed at 
the third democrat attorney general tom miller an opponent of 
abortion miller was an early favorite in the race and naral leaders 
were concerned the fall election would be between two opponents of 
abortion 
in the senate primary in iowa incumbent democrat tom harkin and 
his gop challenger rep tom tauke were assured of their party 
nominations 
another crowded field was battling in democratic and republican 
gubernatorial primaries in new mexico where incumbent garrey 
carruthers a republican was ineligible to seek a second term 
for the first time in the states history the governor elected 
in 1990 will be allowed to serve two consecutive fouryear terms 
the leading contenders on the democratic side were albuquerque 
lawyer paul bardacke and rancher bruce king who already has served 
eight years as governor elected first in 1970 and again in 1978 
regarded as the top gop contenders were frank bond a former 
legislator and education commissioner and les houston the 
republican leader of the state senate 
four republicans were competing in montana to challenge 
democratic sen max baucus two years ago underdog gop challenger 
conrad burns toppled democratic sen john melcher and the 
republicans are hoping to repeat that success this year vying to 
take on baucus were lt gov allen kolstad state sen bill farrell 
and businessmen john domenech and bruce vorhauer 
abortion was an issue in a threeway congressional primary in new 
jersey state assemblyman rodney frelinghuysen and state sen 
richard a zimmer supporters of the prochoice position were 
competing with professional football player phil mcconkey an 
abortion opponent for the gop nomination the winner will face 
democrat marguerite chandler in november for the house seat held by 
james courter the defeated gop candidate for governor in 1989 
the leading candidates in the democratic primary to fill the 
house seat formerly held by democrat james florio the winner of 
last years campaign for governor of new jersey were linda bowker 
president of the state chapter of the national organization for 
women and camden county official robert e andrews gloucester 
county official daniel mangini had no opposition in the republican 
primary 
the november lineups were virtually assured for senate races in 
new jersey and new mexico where democrat bill bradley and 
republican pete domenici were heavily favored for reelection in 
south dakota republican larry pressler will be challenged in 
november by democrat ted muenster in mississippi no democrat filed 
to oppose republican sen thad cochran 
abortion was just one of the issues raised in the heated 
california gubernatorial primary 
the california governors office was the biggest prize in the 
1990 elections the democrats control the legislature and if they 
can recapture the governors office the party will have the 
political advantage next year when lines are redrawn for the states 
congressional districts with 45 seats california already has the 
largest house delegation and the state is expected to gain six more 
as a result of the 1990 census 
the republicans recruited wilson reelected to the senate in 
1988 to run for governor van de kamp the state attorney general 
was the early favorite for the democratic nomination but feinstein 
the former mayor of san francisco surprised many observers with the 
strength of her campaign 
a supporter of the death penalty feinstein contrasted her 
position with van de kamps opposition to capital punishment she 
also suggested that as a woman her prochoice credentials were 
stronger than van de kamps 
van de kamp said he personally opposes capital punishment but 
would uphold californias death penalty and countered with a 
commercial saying he had put or kept 277 murderers on death row his 
most recent ad features an endorsement from consumer advocate ralph 
nader who labels feinstein a republican in democratic clothing 
while the democratic contenders were spending millions on 
commercials in the primary wilson has raised close to 10 million 
while facing only token primary opposition 
also on the ballot in california were two republicanbacked 
propositions designed to dilute the legislatures power of 
redistricting one would require any plan to pass by a twothirds 
vote of both chambers the other would remove it entirely and place 
it in the hands of a nonpartisan commission democrats oppose both 
proposals 
in north carolina gantt bidding to become the first black 
democrat ever elected to the senate and easley have spent more time 
attacking helms than each other 
and now the republican senator has responded with an animated 
television ad that shows a wooded scene with flowers blooming and 
birds chirping it then shifts to a bulletriddled photo of helms 
nailed to a tree and closes with a blob of mud hitting the picture 
a voice then says isnt it nice that mike easley and harvey gantt 
arent running negative campaigns

xiong rucheng remembers the day he and his 
colleagues at the yunnan public health bureau learned that drug 
addicts near the border with burma had contracted aids 
no one could believe it said xiong chairman of the bureaus 
foreign affairs office how could china have aids 
in septembr they sent the report to officials at the ministry of 
public health in beijing who didnt believe it either 
they said well help you clear this up xiong said but 
after testing the 50 samples three times they finally believed 
us 
he said 146 drug addicts out of nearly 6000 tested had been 
found to carry the hiv virus 
previously only seven chinese were known to have contracted 
acquired immune deficiency syndrome the deadly disease that weakens 
the bodys immune system making it susceptible to infections 
they either were hemophiliacs infected by contaminated blood 
products or had contracted aids overseas or through homosexual 
relations with a foreigner according to official reports 
aids victims in yunnan are drug addicts who used contaminated 
needles 
chinese health authorities had targeted coastal cities where 
contact with foreigners is most common in their efforts to prevent 
aids from entering china 
how did they know it would be found in faroff yunnan a 
minority area where the people are honest and unsophisticated 
xiong said how could such a place have contracted the most 
frightening disease of the modern age 
yunnan is a poor remote mountainous province in southwestern 
china that is home to nearly half the countrys minorities 
nearly all the aids victims were found in ruili an area on the 
burmese frontier that is closed to foreigners chinese visitors 
describe it as a wild dangerous place full of traders and smugglers 
from nepal pakistan laos and burma 
in ruili drug users prefer injecting heroin to smoking opium 
xiong said 
he said 80 percent of the aids carriers were of the dai minority 
only one was a woman and none had begun showing symptoms of aids 
all continue to lead normal lives and have not been told they 
have aids xiong said

many moslem and christian families are 
reaching out to help each other survive finding common ground in 
the suffering wrought by 15 years of civil war 
mazen a sunni moslem who lives in moslem west beirut ran the 
gantlet of snipers to drive into east beirut to rescue joseph and 
his family christian friends trapped by fighting between christian 
factions 
i knew i could get killed but these are my friends mazen 
said i couldnt bear the idea of them under that murderous 
shelling without food or water i knew that if i didnt bring them 
theyd never think of coming here 
mazen joseph and several christians interviewed after fleeing 
east beirut asked not to be identified further the christians fear 
being harassed or killed by the warring factions if they return to 
christian east beirut 
the 15yearold civil war has created religious and psychological 
barriers for many lebanese deepening the sectarian divisions that 
always have festered 
now some of those barriers are eroding because of the suffering 
inflicted on christians by the monthslong battle between the forces 
of rebel gen michel aoun and samir geagea leader of the lebanese 
forces militia 
police say more than 200000 people have fled the 310squaremile 
christian enclave north and east of beirut where 1 million lived 
before the battle began jan 30 
tens of thousands like joseph and his family have found 
sanctuary in moslem areas some returned to villages they fled years 
ago 
it is impossible to predict whether the new christianmoslem 
coexistence will expand or help end the war in which about 150000 
people have been killed 
more than 1000 people have been killed and nearly 3000 wounded 
most of them civilians in the fight for control of the christian 
enclave it is the worst fighting between christians since the civil 
war began in april 1975 
many christians fled lebanon through the port of jounieh north 
of beirut where ferries from cyprus regularly run through shellfire 
to pick them up 
street fighting in the enclave eventually blocked roads to 
jounieh however and thousands of people like joseph found 
themselves with no choice but moslem areas as a refuge 
they also found an unexpected welcome 
the moslems didnt kill us and eat our flesh as wed been told 
by the lebanese forces joseph said relaxing in mazens house 
with his wife ferial their 6yearold son tony and baby daughter 
rana 
weve made a lot of moslem friends here we have breakfast with 
one family at their home and were invited to lunch at another we 
meet these people every day now 
our moslem friends shower the children with toys and clothes 
although my financial situation is far better than theirs said 
the 36yearold real estate agent 
lebanon has at least 17 christian and moslem sects that lived 
sidebyside for decades usually in clearly defined areas but 
often in mixed communities it was a fragile unity but it worked 
the region north of beirut was the heartland of maronite 
catholics the dominant christian sect maronites controlled the 
government parliament judiciary and army after lebanons 
independence from france in 1943 which fostered jealousy and 
animosity among moslems 
after the war began christians were driven from moslem areas in 
the chouf mountains west beirut and the coastal plain south of the 
capital 
many christians have remained in west beirut expecially leftist 
greek orthodox but tens of thousands of refugees mostly maronites 
packed into east beirut and the shrinking christian enclave 
joseph and mazen were introduced eight years ago by a mutual 
friend an army officer now fighting for aoun they kept in touch 
and mazen regularly slipped into east beirut to visit 
mazen said he decided to try rescuing josephs family because i 
knew they would never think of seeking refuge in west beirut 
he set out in his small car during an afternoon lull in shelling 
and entered east beirut through the museum crossing the only 
gateway between the two sectors 
there was a lot of sniper fire he said i had to take a 
long way around to josephs house the trip normally takes 15 
minutes that day it took me two hours joseph had mixed 
feelings about coming with me to west beirut but i insisted 
finally i asked him do you think you and your kids can take 
much more of this he said no and we started packing 
joseph said i realized that if we stayed in east beirut wed 
be committing suicide our house had already been hit it was either 
die or take our chances in west beirut 
christians who sought refuge at the sunni moslem ibbad elrahman 
mosque in west beirut also were overwhelmed by moslem hospitality 
they gave us mattresses pillows and blankets said a woman 
who gave her name as hala they give us everything we ask for 
meat rice bread and water 
hala fled to the moslem sector a few weeks ago with her 
11yearold daughter her sister niece and mother 
abu george a farmer is among about 70000 christians who have 
sought sanctuary in the syriancontrolled bekaa valley of eastern 
lebanon 
we were living on the edge of death he said after several 
days in the underground shelter we ran out of water flour and 
food 
he took his seven children for his old village of deir alahmar 
where they were given a welcome he was not sure they would receive 
it was like going from hell to heaven he said 
another 80000 christians have gone to south lebanon including 
many families who were driven out of the region years ago 
some found moslem squatters themselves refugees living in their 
old homes many of the moslems agreed to share the houses 
most villages around the hill town of majdelyoun were occupied by 
moslem families who abandoned their own ancestral homes in the 
israelioccupied zone just north of the border 
theyve been displaced like us said fadwa a housewife with 
two children who returned to majdelyoun from east beirut 
weve been living together for the past few weeks and were 
having a great time the kids play together and the women prepare 
lunch

summit time has been prime time for the senior 
administration official 
senior official is the identity assigned to the government 
experts who provide background detail and the administrations 
viewpoint on events like the current summit conference 
theres been more than one of him and her in the summit buildup 
but they spoke with a single authoritative voice under briefing 
rules that do not permit further identification 
the official is no newcomer to washington the briefing system 
has been around for years used by successive administrations to 
tell their stories on such events as a presidential mission abroad 
or a major policy statement at home that is done under what are 
called background rules in which a source of information provides 
it only on condition of anonymity 
it doesnt always work out white house chief of staff john 
sununu has had trouble with the system complaining earlier this 
year about the use of anonymous sources by reporters then appearing 
in the briefing room prepared to speak under senior official 
anonymity rules reporters protested the contradiction but he 
refused to put his briefing on the record 
more recently sununu said under background rules that president 
bushs noconditions terms for budget negotiations did not mean he 
would tolerate a tax increase only that democrats were free to 
propose one he made the comments as a senior official aboard an 
airplane on which he was the only senior official so the cover 
didnt hold that put the budget talks in jeopardy until the white 
house promised again that bush would set no conditions 
sometimes officials say they can speak more candidly on 
background without attribution than on the record with names 
attached but it is not unusual for an official to hold an 
unattributed background session one day and show up on network 
television the next morning saying much the same things 
sometimes the background rule is set by an official who says he 
doesnt want to be identified because he isnt supposed to be 
talking for publication thats not the case when the senior 
administration official appears at formal white house briefings on 
an event like the summit conference 
the rule of anonymity is said to apply there because the briefers 
often are technicians or negotiators little known to the world 
outside their specialties and are not public figures or spokesmen 
for the administration 
it leaves a margin for error since any slip is anonymous it has 
been described in past administrations as a system that permits 
diplomats to speak without nailing them to positions that could be a 
problem at a negotiating table 
and it reserves the public stage to the people elected or 
appointed to be there president bush and secretary of state james 
a baker iii both conducted ontherecord briefings and answered 
summit questions at the same lectern the senior official uses 
with and without attribution the message from the white house 
became a selffulfilling prophecy of summit success to be validated 
sunday morning as bush and soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
hold a joint news conference on their meetings in washington and at 
camp david md 
one way thats been done is by trying to lower expectations much 
as a presidential candidate sometimes plays down his prospects in a 
primary election in order to claim victory in almost any outcome 
so with the united states and the soviet union in contradictory 
and so far unyielding positions on the nato status of a reunified 
germany senior officialdom said nobody should expect that to be 
resolved at the summit baker then made the same point in a thursday 
television interview saying that involves a whole host of other 
countries not only the superpowers 
another positioning tactic is to make the most of what is 
available as we move from conflict to cooperation white house 
press secretary marlin fitzwater said on wednesday agreements 
reached on thursday and friday will provide for a realistic 
foundation for the growing and changing ussoviet relationship 
agreements are reached at summit meetings only in the sense that 
they get a final endorsement there with the signing of deals 
negotiated in advance when the most ambitious of those treaties 
cant be nailed down in time for summit signatures the skillful 
senior administration official puts the emphasis elsewhere on deals 
that can be reached and on progress that is not measured by a stack 
of documents anyhow 
not that agreements arent important the senior official said 
but the real work of the summit was honest frank dialogue trying 
to move two superpowers just a few steps closer together 
welcoming gorbachev bush said that the most meaningful measure 
of success is in the groundwork for overcoming decades of division 
and discord 
and on that scorecards that count points won and lost or 
agreements signed and shelved really wont measure results 
that will have to show in what happens in the months ahead no 
matter what is said now

the eroded soil swirling in the smoky hill 
river after a hard rain is the legacy of sodbusting pioneers and 
more than a century of poor farming practices 
the smoky hill and other rivers look like a spilled cup of 
heavily creamed coffee because they carry a muddy mix of water 
rich top soil and farm chemical residues 
ecologist wes jackson blames exploitative agriculture 
farming that relies on working the ground with heavy equipment and 
tons of chemicals to fertilize crops and protect them from weeds 
and pests 
mining the soil he said describing modern agriculture as a 
carryover from the days when people farmed a patch of ground until 
it was unproductive and then moved on 
and agricultural chemicals he said are substances with which 
our tissues have had no experience 
at 53 jackson founder of the land institute has held to his 
ideas long enough that admiration has replaced ridicule he has 
gone from the target of mocking barbs to a respected leader in the 
sustainable agriculture movement which seeks to reduce or 
eliminate the use of chemicals and and change other consumptive 
farming practices 
the message from jackson has been much the same as it has been 
for 20 years but the world around him has evolved and he now sits 
on a us department of agriculture panel evaluating proposals for 
low input sustainable agriculture or lisa research projects 
he addressed an earth day crowd of 100000 people at lincoln 
park in chicago 
george ham a kansas state university associate dean of 
agriculture and former head of ksus agronomy department has a 
cordial relationship with jackson they disagree on the definition 
of sustainable agriculture and other points 
i certainly recognize his professional background and 
expertise and certainly recognize where hes coming from ham 
said in terms of our approaches to sustainability ours is short 
term while his is more long term 
for instance kansas state is helping farmers gradually decrease 
the amount they plow and the quantities of chemicals they use 
jackson however looks to the day when the plowing and chemical 
use would be for the most part eliminated 
ham agreed that agriculture has evolved and environmental 
concerns now are more important kansas state is placing new 
emphasis on looking at water quality and how chemicals move through 
the soil he said 
an increasing number of people are finally recognizing that 
agriculture itself is an ecological problem outranking industrial 
pollution jackson said 
a lot of the resistance to my ideas came from my wellknown 
stands on the vietnam war civil rights and the environment 
jackson said people thought i was some kind of nut 
even his wife dana concedes he is outlandish she says thats 
why he is a soughtafter speaker 
and how receptive could farmers and agricultural academicians be 
when a speaker refers to farming as the barbaric plunder of 
nature and compares chemical treatment of soils and crops as 
fossilfuel chemotherapy 
jackson has chided farmers for wearing caps with seed and 
chemical company logos advertising the corporate agribusiness 
lords for whom they work 
and he said helping farmers cope daytoday is like caring for a 
cancer patient this is noble work but it is more for the 
purpose of helping someone cope than it is to change the patients 
fate he said 
jackson who has a bachelors degree in biology a masters 
degree in botany and a doctorate in genetics has been a teacher 
and lecturer for nearly three decades 
he doesnt pretend to have answers for all the questions he 
asks he doesnt suggest farmers immediately abandon all chemicals 
and tilling he believes a radical political agenda and an as yet 
undiscovered economy are needed to reform agriculture 
the land institute which jackson and his wife founded in 1976 
uses the prairie as its standard for a new agriculture 
supported by foundations and a corps of individual donors the 
nonprofit institute employs 13 people and has 10 interns each year 
for a 43week term of study the interns receive 125 a month 
preference is given to people who plan to earn graduate degrees and 
work in the field of sustainable agriculture 
most of the work is targeted at developing a domestic prairie 
in technical terms jackson calls it a herbaceous perennial 
seedproducing polyculture that wouldnt require fertilizer 
pesticides or herbicides the legumes and seedbearing grasses 
grown for human and animal food wouldnt need annual plowing 
several plants show promise they are eastern gamma grass a 
highprotein warm season grass related to corn leymus a cool 
season wild rye and illinois bundle flower a native prairie 
legume 
researchers also are working with a grain sorghumjohnson grass 
crossbreed they hope to wed the domestic milo plants grain 
production with the noxious weeds perennial and winter hardiness 
traits 
of the institutes 278 acres 90 are native prairie and 50 are 
replanted prairie there are also a herbery where more than 300 
wild plants were transplanted for study a 140foot greenhouse and 
various test plots 
a brick 1960sera splitlevel rural home serves as 
administrative and research offices the jacksons live in the small 
home they built nearby in 1971 
as the institute has grown its budget has climbed from 16000 
a year to nearly 500000 
the time frame for results from work at the land as its backers 
call it is 25 50 or 100 years even then the effort might not 
reach its goals 
but he is resolute about his calling 
lets find out from the ecology what it is about natures 
community that sees to it all the ecological bills get paid he 
said what other choice do we have

were so hopelessly behind nelson said with these winds 
weve had it sucked almost all the moisture out 
north dakota entering its third straight year of drought leads 
the nation in acres of land lost to wind erosion 
figures from the federal soil conservation service show a record 
16 million acres in north dakota were damaged by wind erosion from 
nov 1 1989 through february that compares with 474200 acres 
for the same four months of 198889 
farmers like nelson are the underdogs in the fight to save the 
soil 
nelson 53 leads a double life he does research and consults 
with doctors as a pathologist at a bismarck clinic then dons a 
plaid shirt blue jeans and hat lights up a cigar and heads for 
his wheat and barley fields east of bismarck 
farming is a life he has known since childhood in beresford 
sd near sioux falls but two years of drought have sapped the 
moisture from his 3000 acres and nelson has been fighting to keep 
the soil from blowing away 
this year im going to do less tilling and use more 
chemicals nelson vowed last week as he maneuvered a huge 
planting drill into a shed 
i dont know what the answer is im beginning to think more 
about continuous cropping but we may not ever solve the problem 
the main problem comes on land left to rest before its next crop 
is planted nelson said the drought has reduced cover crops like 
grasses and small grains that would keep the soil in place 
tilling leaves the soil more vulnerable to erosion and 
herbicides could seep into water supplies nelson however said 
chemicals may be the lesser evil because they are not used as 
intensely in north dakota as in other states 
myron senechal a conservationist with the north dakota soil 
conservation service said farmers gradually are changing their 
style of farming to cut down on erosion mainly by tilling less 
producers are aware of the erosion out there he said 
its a learning process we have to promote on a daytoday 
basis 
part of the problem is the winter adds doug gasseling 
state scs agronomist weve had 60degree temperatures in 
february and it just broke the soil structure down a lot of our 
farmers didnt have moisture to start with 
the persistent drought also has taken an emotional toll rain 
and snow that fell last week were the talk of the state bringing 
smiles to farmers faces and a touch of green to the grass but 
much more is needed 
i dont see signs yet that the pattern has changed nelson 
said as you get close to planting time you think the drought 
can end with a rainstorm i was waiting the last two years for that 
rainstorm and it never came 
nelson who is unmarried said his double life keeps him on the 
go but he likes it that way he relaxes by going to medical 
meetings 
its like dealing with nature in different levels i probably 
diagnosed 15 different cancers this morning and i dont know 
whether i can control them i know i cant control the drought 
it gives you a pretty good vision of the magnitude of the 
struggle nelson added but i know eventually this drought is 
going to end and were going to have good crops again i think 
thats what keeps anybody going in this business

most people still choose their doctors by relying 
mainly on advice from friends or family rather than fee 
considerations despite growing worry over medical costs a poll 
has found 
but one watcher of the healthcare market suggested the figures 
mask the large number of patients who automatically put fee 
considerations first by belonging to managed healthcare plans that 
limit physician choices 
and the head of a healthconsumer group said more people might 
make decisions based on fees if fee information were easier to get 
a gallup poll of 1500 randomly selected us adults found that 
the factor they most often cited as their main reason for choosing 
a doctor was the recommendation of friends or family that reason 
was offered by 19 percent 
referrals by professionals were close behind at 17 percent 
followed by specific medical reasons at 13 percent and convenience 
at 9 percent according to the survey commissioned by the american 
medical association 
only 1 percent of those surveyed cited fees as the main factor 
in their most recent selection of a physician said an article in 
the may 25 issue of the amas weekly american medical news 
but 20 percent of respondents said cost was at least part of the 
picture when they chose a doctor that compares with 60 percent who 
said they believe cost is the main problem facing us health care 
and medicine today 
the results show that although the public is concerned with 
the bigpicture concept of medical costs patients care far more 
about how a physician treated their neighbor or their cousin than 
which physician has the cheapest fees said dr james s todd 
acting ama executive vice president 
but other specialists offered different interpretations 
including roger holstein president of consumer health services 
inc which operates a physicianreferral service called prologue 
in eight cities 
he said 32 percent of people choosing physicians already belong 
to costsaving managedcare plans such as health maintenance 
organizations or preferred provider organizations that restrict 
their choice of physicians so the process of choosing a doctor 
has much more to do with convenience 
an additional 27 percent of people looking for doctors are 
limited to physicians who can offer payment plans or will accept 
their insurance holstein said from boulder colo 
there is evidence that 59 percent are choosing a doctor 
largely on the basis of payment plans said holstein quoting 
figures from a study his company did this year 
arthur levin director of the center for medical consumers a 
nonprofit medical information service with 15000 subscribers 
said he believes few doctors will release fee schedules over the 
telephone 
theres no way to compare unless you go around to 10 doctors 
and make appointments and ask for prices of varying services 
during the course of an examination he said from new york 
thats kind of an inefficient and expensive way to find out 
what the price is he said 
the gallup poll conducted in january and february found that 
concern about doctors fees is growing the proportion of 
respondents who agreed to the statement doctors fees are usually 
reasonable fell from 33 percent in 1988 to 25 percent in 1990 
said the poll which had an error margin of 25 percentage points

early research at the argonne national 
laboratory helped create nuclear power but now scientists there 
are turning crop waste into plastic unlocking the secrets of 
photosynthesis and preparing to study soil with a powerful new 
xray 
the laboratorys basic mission of energy research has produced 
spinoffs that could help farmers produce food and find new markets 
advances in agriculture are most likely to occur as a result 
of the application of modern science and thats precisely what 
were attempting to do lab director alan schriesheim said 
argonne which opened in 1946 with a mission of finding peaceful 
uses for atomic energy has 1700 acres 25 miles southwest of 
chicago rare white deer roam the grounds 
part of the us department of energy it is operated under 
contract by the university of chicago the staff of 3000 includes 
more than 1000 scientists engineers and technicians 
argonne spokesman david baurac said much of the research focuses 
on energy sources 
for example polymer chemist patrick bonsignore has been 
converting potato scraps and cheese whey into degradable plastics 
we want useful products from waste and we are optimistic 
about their use in agriculture said bonsignore but the 
current technology needs to be upgraded significantly so we can 
lower the costs 
he said the degradable plastic material could be used to mulch 
farm fields and coat pesticides to give them a timedrelease effect 
argonne also is preparing to build a 700 million advanced 
photon source billed as the worlds brightest xray to begin 
working in 1995 or 1996 
agronomist darrell schulze of purdue university said it will 
give researchers a powerful tool to examine soils how they shrink 
and swell how minerals are arranged within them and how plant 
roots behave 
we should be able to see things in their natural state without 
cutting them or digging them out said schulze one thing this 
might be useful for is understanding drought tolerance in plants 
biochemist deborah hanson is using photosynthetic bacteria to 
study photosynthesis and believes her work could make crops more 
efficient and increase their yields and lead to the design of 
herbicideresistant plants

the man who made a living on chewy cookies that 
were almost as much chocolate chip as dough now is preaching weight 
loss for him the conversion was essential his life depended on 
it 
in a witty and honest book david liederman offers practical 
advice to people who share his addiction compulsive eating 
davids delicious weightloss program st martins press 
1895 is not a medical book nor is it a magic bullet but it is 
inspiring 
the cookie man at 5foot11 weighed more than 300 pounds 
and had dangerously high cholesterol and blood sugar levels when 
his doctor let him know i wouldnt live to see my children grow 
up 
that did it liederman changed his life 
he calls himself a compulsive eater in remission and happily 
so my sense of humor had disappeared when my eating was out of 
control i was angry at myself and it spilled over onto the people 
around me i was sneaky too as all compulsive eaters are when 
they try to keep their binges a secret now im neither 
liederman opened davids cookies shops that sell fresh warm 
cookies and owns two new york city restaurants this is his third 
book written with joan schwartz it includes exactly how to keep a 
food journal sample menus a guide to eating in restaurants and 
recipes for such dishes as wild mushroom soup roasted chicken 
salad white clam pizza potato pie and oat bran cookies 
liederman who says he was overweight since childhood had more 
going against him than most dieters surrounded every day by the 
the worlds finest chocolate butter pastries ice cream and 
cookies 
but while he once tasted everything he now depends on the 
aroma or on tastings by his wife susan and two daughters 
sure i would prefer the old way but a compulsive person 
cant afford preferences if you are a compulsive eater you are 
eating yourself to death death by overweight or death by 
cholesterol or a combination of both 
his effort included avoiding foods that would increase his 
cholesterol eating good wellprepared food learning what foods 
triggered his binges and avoiding them keeping a food journal and 
exercising like many specialists liederman says a diet is not 
the answer and his own litany of diet failures is plenty of 
evidence they didnt work for him 
you have to take responsibility for your own eating habits and 
change your own behavior he writes you need a program that 
makes sense for you as an addictive personality 
trained as a french chef liederman said his diet recipes meet 
standards he demanded at the threestar restaurant troisgros in 
roanne france 
liedermans stories or versions of them will sound familiar to 
compulsive eaters one night at the dinner table liederman his 
brother and his stepfather forks first surged toward the one 
remaining pork chop the stepfather speared the brother and in the 
chaos liederman got the meat 
we ate fast and we talked fast at the dinner table we went 
for speed and volume we were so eager to get to the next portion 
that we barely tasted what we were eating and whatever hit the 
table was devoured as if hit by a buzz saw 
he also tells of eating frozen pastries standing at the open 
freezer door later vacations revolved around getting to the most 
threestar restaurants in france in the shortest amount of time 
the name of the game was overkill i would start lunch at 12 
and finished somewhere between 4 and 5 pm having polished off 
seven courses of food two bottles of wine 10 desserts and cognac 
or armagnac 
despite the humor in his stories liederman takes overeating 
seriously recognizing the excuses denial and selfpity and 
fighting over and over against his addiction 
not all compulsive eaters are overweight he notes and many 
hide their bouts of overeating if not from everyone from some 
people 
a compulsive eater doesnt eat fast and overeat because he or 
she enjoys food he said the idea is to control the food to 
make it all belong to him or her

the tragedy of alzheimers disease 
comes early to some victims who find their reason and memories 
slipping away in middle age 
of the 45 million alzheimers patients in the united states 5 
percent to 10 percent are younger than 65 said the national 
alzheimers association 
were not talking about a public health problem as these 
cases are extremely uncommon but it is always very distressing to 
see a dementing disorder occur in the prime of life said ranjan 
duara medical director of the wien center for alzheimers disease 
at mount sinai medical center in miami beach 
in broward county a 38yearold woman was recently diagnosed 
with alzheimers one of the youngest cases in the country she had 
to quit her job as a school teacher last year and lives with her 
mother disability checks have been slow in arriving and the 
family recently applied for food stamps 
these young alzheimers patients often find themselves shut out 
of day care programs and experimental drug trials that will admit 
only those 60 and older 
were recognizing that these people have special needs because 
they dont fit into the age categories typically associated with 
alzheimers patients said mollie charters president of the 
broward county chapter of the alzheimers association 
about onethird of people age 85 or older will develop 
alzheimers said creighton phelps of the chicagobased alzheimers 
association by comparison less than 1 percent of the population 
younger than 55 is at risk 
nearly all earlyonset patients have a family history of the 
disease they also can exhibit defects in the chromosone that 
causes downs syndrome specialists say many downs patients also 
develop alzheimers disease in their 40s 
steven sevush a neurologist and psychiatrist at the university 
of miami medical school said that because a definite diagnosis of 
alzheimers only can be made by cutting into the brain 
aggressive attempts should be made to find other causes rather 
than making a clinical guess 
some other diseases that occur in middle age have symptoms 
similar to alzheimers and some of them are treatable

patients with high blood pressure who 
skip their medication are pushing up health care costs each year in 
the united states a university researcher says 
the research quantified the relationship between hospital 
admissions for high blood pressure and failure to take medications 
the study was published recently in the journal medical care 
researchers studied medicaid patients in los angeles county 
comparing those who were hospitalized for high blood pressure 
during the year of the study and those who were not 
on average those who were rehospitalized did not take their 
medicine 46 days over the year those not rehospitalized skipped 
their medication 25 days 
studies of other chronic diseases such as epilepsy and 
glaucoma show similar trends said lee strandberg of oregon state 
university one author of the study 
nationally the cost to the health care system of patients who 
fail to follow directions for taking medicine is 7 billion to 10 
billion strandberg said 
studies such as ours will help target the cause of the 
problem then we can develop strategies to manage the situation 
he said 
the issue is of particular importance in oregon where a panel 
is developing a priority list for rationing health care for the 
poor strandberg said 
the study was done with researchers at the university of 
southern california school of medicine university of 
californiaberkeley school of public health los angeles county and

the us steel industrys recovery from a severe 
downturn in the early 1980s could be harmed by cleanair controls 
under consideration by congress executives of major steel 
companies said at their annual convention 
reining in proposed pollution regulation has become a major 
policy issue for the industry said thomas c graham president of 
uss the steelmaking division of usx corp 
other issues of concern include the high cost of capital in the 
united states and foreign competition executives said wednesday at 
the american iron and steel institute gathering 
clearly the environment is again the major public policy 
issue facing steel producers after a decade in which trade was at 
center stage said graham who called some cleanair proposals 
being considered by congress draconian 
he said the steel industry is willing to spend more to install 
pollutioncontrol equipment but only if the results justify the 
costs 
we oppose requirements which would drain our available capital 
and which would cause plant closings and substantial job losses 
without verifiable scientific indication of real benefit to the 
environment or improvement to public health he told industry 
executives and reporters 
graham who heads the nations largest steelmaker said steel 
producers spent 7 billion over the last three decades to eliminate 
90 percent to 95 percent of the pollutants they put into the air 
and water 
the industrys main concern in the current debate is provisions 
of the senate cleanair bill that would force automatic shutdowns 
of plants that produce coke a key ingredient in steelmaking 
unless they meet certain pollution standards graham said 
he called a provision that would give steel companies up to 30 
years to comply with the coke oven standards misleading 
the fact is that the mere passage of the shutdown provisions 
would have an immediate chilling impact he said how could we 
justify making the major investments needed in the next five to 10 
years to rebuild aging coke batteries if they face mandatory 
shutdown in the future 
foreign steelmakers who are not facing the kind of 
environmental cost burdens we are would love to see passage of 
the senate shutdown provisions graham said 
the executives said research continues into direct steelmaking 
in which iron ore would be melted directly eliminating the need 
for coke but that the technology was at least 10 years away 
the chairman of the trade association frank w luerssen called 
the cost of capital the domestic steel industrys top concern 
without access to lowercost borrowing us steel companies 
cannot compete with foreign makers in modernizing plants said 
luerssen who is chairman and chief executive officer of inland 
steel industries inc 
he said companies in western europe and japan can borrow money 
at lower interest rates a major factor in the decision by many 
us steel companies to enter joint ventures with foreign companies 
and in foreign purchases of us steel plants 
the profitability of steel companies is occasionally too low 
to attract lowcost capital said joseph f toot jr president 
of steel products maker timken co on the other hand 
profitability can be substantially improved through investment in 
worldleading technology 
commenting on japanese investment in us steelmaking in recent 
years he said it is intriguing to observe that the japanese 
investor can apparently see through this catch22 and see that in 
the long haul the american steel industry will become more 
profitable 
on another topic industry leaders said they support the bush 
administrations efforts to eliminate dumping of foreign steel in 
the united states and subsidies from foreign governments to their 
steelmakers 
the current limits on steel imports are scheduled to expire in 
march 1992 by then the administration hopes to have eliminated 
subsidies and dumping or selling foreign steel in the united 
states at below the cost of production 
graham said the industry would seek no further protection or 
extension of the import limits if dumping and subsidies were 
eliminated 
he also said the industry believes the main reason it wasnt 
competitive globally several years ago was a grossly overvalued 
dollar rather than just unfair foreign competition a stronger 
dollar makes us exports more costly in terms of foreign 
currencies 
he said the federal reserves move to ease inflation in the 
early 1980s by raising interest rates thus increasing the value of 
the dollar helped almost destroy american manufacturing 
competitiveness

a new delaware law that allows banks with 
operations in the state to sell and underwrite insurance nationwide 
was only hours old when the insurance industry challenged it 
gov michael n castle signed the legislation into law wednesday 
and it took effect immediately 
two hours later a petition was filed with the federal reserve 
board to block citicorp the nations largest banking company from 
taking advantage of the law citicorp plans to locate an insurance 
headquarters in dover and sell insurance nationwide through a 
subsidiary of its delaware bank 
the petition filed by five national insurance agent 
associations and three local groups alleges citicorp is attempting 
to evade the federal bank holding company act which prohibits bank 
holding companies and their subsidiaries from selling insurance 
said william r anderson associate general counsel of the national 
association of life underwriters in washington 
citicorp officials who had not seen the petition were expected 
to respond today said david swayze a wilmington attorney and 
citicorp lobbyist 
the law is a continuation of delawares effort to stay in the 
forefront of an everchanging financial services industry 
in 1981 the state enacted the financial center development act 
which offered tax incentives and eliminated interest rate ceilings 
to lure outofstate banks to move their credit card operations to 
delaware delaware was the first to relax its banking laws and 
other states soon followed suit 
since 1981 the state enacted about eight laws aimed at making 
it more attractive for financial service companies to locate in 
delaware and castle said the trend would continue 
we cannot rest on our laurels its not just banking but all 
financial services that interest us here in delaware and were 
always looking at ways to improve our business environment to be 
ahead of the curve to be ahead of our competitors to be ahead of 
everybody else in the country castle said 
secretary of state michael harkins said there is a possibility 
that with the new law a major european bank could open a 
subsidiary in delaware he would not identify the bank he said 
however that delaware wants to bring in foreign banks 
in addition to banking reforms delaware is known worldwide for 
its favorable incorporation laws more than half of the nations 
fortune 500 companies are incorporated in the state 
as he signed the bill wednesday castle said it was possible the 
new law would be challenged by insurance companies or other states 
but he predicted such challenges would fail 
the law allows banks chartered in delaware after 1934 to sell 
and underwrite insurance nationwide most banks chartered before 
1934 already have such powers those chartered earlier that do not 
have such powers must obtain permission from the state legislature 
a companion bill also signed into law restricts the types of 
insurance banks can sell within the state but allows them to sell 
a full range of products outside delaware 
the banks must locate their insurance headquarters in delaware 
to take advantage of the laws 
chase manhattan corp the nations no 2 bank also has said it 
plans to sell insurance through its office in the state 
more than half of the states allow banks to engage in some form 
of insurance sales but they limit the sales to within state 
boundaries said maryliz meany spokeswoman for the american 
bankers association in washington the banking industry considers 
the new law a boon for consumers because it expands the market 
theres been a sense that if the insurance industry allowed 
more players in the market the price will come down meany said 
she said the law gives insurance powers to about 40 financial 
institutions nationwide that have affiliates in delaware

a state court has denied bell of 
pennsylvania the right to install telephone devices that flash the 
numbers of incoming callers saying the feature invades privacy and 
violates wiretap laws 
the 41 ruling wednesday by commonwealth court reversed a 
november order by the public utility commission allowing bell to 
offer the service 
caller id lets people know who is calling before they pick up 
the receiver the callers number flashes on a small device 
attached to the telephone 
the american civil liberties union the pennsylvania coalition 
against domestic violence and others sued to block the service 
some argued it would threaten battered spouses and children by 
revealing their location 
bell offered blocking devices to domesticviolence shelters and 
law enforcement agencies to prevent their numbers from being 
revealed to users of caller id and attorney general ernie preate 
jr contended in court papers that the service did not violate 
pennsylvanias wiretap law 
but the court disagreed and said caller id is unacceptable even 
if offered with a blocking device 
in the framework of a democratic society the privacy rights 
concept is much too fundamental to be compromised or abridged by 
permitting caller id the court said 
bill harral bell vice president of external affairs said the 
company mahy appeal 
because of this decision pennsylvanians are being denied a 
service they eagerly want and badly need a weapon against 
unwanted harassing threatening or obscene calls he said 
the service could be vital to emergency dispatchers allowing 
them to locate people who call for help even if the caller hangs 
up rabe said 
bell spokesman eric rabe said about 1000 people had registered 
for the service the company had proposed charging 650 per month 
caller identification is offered in parts of new jersey 
maryland virginia and west virginia according to bell atlantic 
the corporate parent of bell of pennsylvania they are under review 
in delaware and the district of columbia

a tape deck that has aroused the ire of record 
companies because it can make nearperfect recordings of compact 
discs has been approved for sale by the government and will soon be 
introduced to the us market 
despite its expense about 1200 the digital audio tape 
recorders ability to make direct digital copies of cds is expected 
to boost sales for the muchdebated recording medium industry 
officials said 
the ministry of international trade and industrys approval 
wednesday was timed to allow japanese manufacturers to introduce 
dat recorders at the consumer electronics show which opens 
saturday in chicago the officials said 
opposition to dat technology has persisted in the united states 
in the music industry over concern about copyright protection and 
congress has not yet passed legislation setting a new standard for 
the machines 
japanese electronics companies which make virtually all dat 
equipment have refrained from actively selling dat decks in the 
united states because of opposition from record companies and 
songwriters 
but matsushita electric industrial co spokesman akira nagano 
said his company which makes panasonic equipment might begin 
marketing in the united states before legislation is approved if 
congressional action is delayed current laws do not prohibit dats 
one version of the dat recorder has been sold in japan and some 
parts of europe since 1987 and are available through the gray 
market in the united states but in a concession to record 
companies the equipment currently on the market cannot make direct 
digital recordings of cds 
instead they convert the highquality digital signals on cds to 
analog signals and reconvert them to digital form before recording 
them resulting in a slight loss in sound quality 
that combined with the high price of blank dat tapes that cost 
almost as much as cds has held dat sales far below initial 
expectations 
last summer however us european and japanese record and 
electronics industry groups agreed on an international standard 
that would allow sales of dat equipment that can make direct 
digital copies of cds 
but they also agreed the machines would include a sequential 
copy management system that adds a flag signal to the tape 
when cds are recorded to prevent the dat copy from being copied 
further 
that version of the dat recorder was approved by the japanese 
government on wednesday 
after studying the situation carefully the japanese 
government has decided that the standard agreed upon represents the 
best balance between the interests of equipment makers and record 
producers hisato nagao a ministry official told the associated 
press 
unlike analog recordings digital tape recordings deteriorate 
very little from generation to generation record manufacturers had 
feared that dat machines would result in a flood of highquality 
copies of cds that would cut into their sales 
company officials said they were unsure until wednesdays 
decision whether they would be able to announce prices and 
marketing plans for their dat recorders at the chicago show the 
main trade exhibition for the lucrative us consumer electronics 
industry 
if the ministry hadnt decided now it would have meant a 
manymonth delay in marketing the new dat equipment said an 
official at a major electronics company who spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
us electronics companies which have virtually abandoned 
production of consumer electronic goods are unlikely to oppose dat 
marketing officials say

car rental companies are coercing consumers 
into buying damage coverage they dont need a consumer group 
claims 
its just a way for rental companies to make a lot of 
profit the product itself is inherently a fraud on consumers 
lucinda sikes a staff attorney for the us public interest 
research group said at a news conference wednesday 
but jan armstrong executive director of the national car rental 
association said only about one in five auto renters opts for the 
socalled collision damage waiver which pays for a vandalized 
wrecked or stolen car 
sikes said the collision damage waivers can run as high as 13 a 
day in addition to the actual rental price 
a lot of people dont need it at all but are buying it out of 
fear sikes said adding that the cost of the coverage is too 
high sometime boosting the rental price by as much as 48 percent 
it really should be only a few dollars a day she added 
the us pirg report said collision damage waivers often are 
sold under coercive circumstances at excessive prices and with 
deceptive statements about coverage the report did not describe 
the type of coercion it said was used 
the report was compiled from a survey of 10 companies operating 
in the washington area 
consumers often are left in the dark about exceptions to the 
waivers which may be voided for reasons ranging from travel on a 
gravel road to driving after only one drink sikes said 
its written in the fine print she said 
about 60 percent of personal auto policies cover rental cars 
sikes said and some credit card companies provide collision damage 
waivers when rentals are charged to the card 
armstrong contended sikes was unfair in suggesting that the 
industry was cheating consumers when were in business to provide 
a service 
armstrong said customers are not being coerced into accepting 
the coverage most of those who do pay for the waiver she added 
either dont own cars are from other countries or do not have 
credit cards or personal auto insurance that provide the coverage 
its a safety net she said 
armstrong said industry leader hertz favors doing away with the 
waiver but the alternative generally has been higher prices for 
all rental cars 
the price is built in and everybody pays she said 
both sikes and armstrong said people planning to rent cars 
should find out first if their personal auto policies or credit 
cards would pay for a damaged rental car

american agricultural exports for the fiscal 
year ending in september will total 40 billion an increase of 
15 billion from the february estimate the agriculture department 
forecasts 
usda on wednesday issued a statement revising the estimated 
volume of agricultural exports to 150 million metric tons a 
increase of 15 million from the february forecast 
the department said however that much of the increase would 
result from a change in the system under which shipments between 
the united states and canada are reported the department said in 
its situation and outlook summary 
the change was designed to eliminate underreporting of exports 
by both countries usda said 
in addition though usda said that since february the prospects 
for exports of us corn soybeans and cotton have improved in 
terms of both volume and price 
usda also raised the forecast for us agricultural imports from 
215 billion to 22 billion 
it said the main reason was an upswing in fruit and vegetable 
imports from latin america in the wake of decembers freeze in 
florida and texas 
the department forecast the us agricultural surplus for the 
year at 18 billion only a shade below that for fiscal 1989 
the surplus had been rising steadily since fiscal 1986 when it 
skidded to an anemic 54 billion in terms of volume the estimate 
of 150 million tons is up from last years total of 1464 million 
the forecast puts exports of grains and feeds at 163 billion 
wheat and flour at 51 billion rice at 800 million coarse 
grains overall at 79 billion and corn at 69 billion 
it estimates total exports of oilseeds and their products at 
59 billion with soybeans at 37 billion soybean cake and meal 
900 million and soybean oil at 400 million 
the forecast was for livestock products of 55 billion poultry 
and products 800 million dairy products 400 million 
horticultural products 5 billion tobacco 13 billion cotton and 
linters 29 billion seeds 600 million and sugar and tropical 
products 14 billion

usdas agricultural marketing service is 
proposing to lower from 25 percent to 22 percent the limit on fat 
in ground beef under its institutional meat purchase specifications 
used by schools hospitals and the armed services 
the change would be part of a broader revision of the 
institutional meat specifications the department announced it 
said the move was designed to reflect increased consumer interest 
in lowerfat beef 
its a step in the right direction said bonnie liebman 
director of nutrition for the washingtonbased center for science 
in the public interest they could do more 
currently usda defines lean beef as having no more than 10 
percent fat by weight but makes an exception for ground beef and 
puts its level at 225 percent thats why i like to speak of 
socalled lean ground beef liebman said regular ground beef can 
range up to 30 percent fat by weight 
under the institutional purchase specifications the limit 
applies only if the buyer does not negotiate to obtain the beef at 
a different level of fat

a fouryear effort to revamp the world trading 
system remained in doubt after us and european negotiators failed 
to budge from their positions on government payments to farmers 
no headway in resolving the stubborn dispute was reported 
wednesday after lengthy discussions by key trade officials of the 
united states and the european community 
we have hit a snag said us trade representative carla 
hills 
mrs hills and other american officials tried to use a meeting 
of the 24nation organization for economic cooperation and 
development to advance the uruguay round of trade talks but their 
efforts were blunted by the community made up of a dozen west 
european nations 
this is not a negotiating forum said frans andriessen the 
communitys trading chief 
the americans want the europeans to agree to do more to slash 
their costly subsidies to farmers but the europeans so far have 
refused 
the dispute has stalled the uruguay round negotiations an 
ambitious effort to overhaul the world trading system by reducing 
trade barriers in 15 areas including agriculture and textiles 
the bargaining among nearly 100 nations began in uruguay in 1986 
and is scheduled to end with a final round of talks in december 
but the latest failure to find common ground on farm subsidies 
does not bode well the talks are held under the auspices of the 
general agreement on tariffs and trade a forum and an agreement 
for promoting freer trade 
canadas international trade minister john crosbie was glum 
when he came out of wednesdays discussions 
it was discouraging he said both sides he said seemed 
to be so adamant of their own positions 
andriessen acknowledged that the inability of the community to 
change its position might be viewed negatively but he predicted 
the trading partners would be able to come to a satisfactory 
agreement 
mrs hills said the negotiators would be in grave difficulty 
if they were unable to settle the farm subsidy dispute by december 
the united states has linked agreement on the agriculture issue to 
success in other areas as well but andriessen noted that 
agriculture is not the only issue since the talks cover 14 
other areas 
american officials wanted thursdays final statement at the oecd 
meeting to show that both sides were willing to lower trade 
barriers so that farm exports would have better access to other 
countries local markets 
they also wanted the community to promise to reduce farm 
payments that encourage overproduction of crops and to slash 
subsidies that help farmers sell their goods on foreign markets 
the united states complains that export subsidies have helped the 
community increase its share of the world market 
the community refused to pledge to widen its markets to foreign 
food products or to curb export subsidies according to us 
officials 
the community has argued that it has adopted a plan limiting the 
maximum annual amount of expenditure on price guarantees but it 
says it cannot wipe out its subsidy programs entirely 
oecd members are australia austria belgium britain canada

a tentative deal reached by northwest 
airlines honeywell inc and the soviet union could relieve 
overseas air routes and make groundbased navigation equipment 
obsolete officials from the two companies say 
it will allow us to put more airplanes in the sky more 
safely bob buley manager of flight standards and product 
development for northwest said wednesday 
we think it could be the sole source of navigation by 1995 
said jim koch vice president of minneapolis operations for 
honeywell 
the joint venture allows for the simultaneous testing of soviet 
and us satellites as a navigation guide for commercial jets it 
was announced at a news conference by honeywell chairman and chief 
executive officer james renier and northwest chairman alfred 
checchi 
the executives said the agreement signed by honeywell northwest 
and the soviet union is subject to government approval in both 
countries 
under the agreement the soviets would deliver equipment to 
honeywell and northwest late this year the exchange would enable 
honeywell to build units capable of reading commercial aviation 
signals from the soviet glosnass satellite system military 
aviation signals would not be accessible koch said 
the equipment would be mounted on a northwest 747 cargo plane 
for test flying through september 1991 the same plane in april 
began testing honeywell equipment that reads commercial navigation 
signals from the us global positioning system of satellites 
the 21 active satellites planned for each system could enable 
pilots to doublecheck the positions of their planes to guard 
against inaccurate readings buley said the system also could 
enable planes to land at airports that lack sophisticated 
groundbased navigation equipment he said 
it will literally open up the globe to commercial aviation 
buley said 
koch said northwest and honeywell will strive to have the dual 
satellite navigation system certified for use in all commercial 
jetliners by 1993 they will seek certification for the system as a 
planes sole source of navigation by 1995 
transoceanic air travel would benefit the most by the advance 
buley said the absence of groundbased navigation during overseas 
flights requires pilots to approximate their whereabouts and keep 
about a 60mile buffer between planes he said 
satellite navigation would allow pilots to nearly pinpoint their 
whereabouts and fly within five or even three miles of other 
planes he said todays reference systems for flying overseas can 
result in position errors of about 10 nautical miles for every five 
hours of flying honeywell said in a news release 
were running into gridlock over there now buley said of 
routes from the united states to the pacific rim where northwest 
is dominant were having to take delays getting off the ground 
because we have to wait for the planes ahead of us to get well into 
the system 
the agreement would not give honeywell exclusive rights to 
develop equipment capable of reading soviet satellite signals but 
it would give the controls maker a head start on a potentially huge 
market koch said 
koch said the soviets alone have up to 4000 commercial 
airplanes excluding the soviet union the worldwide fleet of 
commercial aircraft is estimated at about 9100 said tom cole a 
spokesman for the aircraft maker boeing co of seattle 
buley said it could cost between 25000 and 50000 to equip 
each plane with equipment needed to receive satellite signals the 
sales would be made by honeywells space and aviation division 
which accounted for about 2 billion of the companys 61 billion 
in sales last year 
checchi said northwest would eventually like to extend its 
routes to eastern europe and the soviet union but he said such an 
expansion is not our highest priority

it may not happen right away but two polish 
officials say their country is ready for that hallmark of 
capitalism a stock market even after more than 40 years of 
communist rule 
if all will be well we will be able to do it i think in the 
late fall say october november 1990 grzegorz jedrzejczak told 
reporters wednesdasy 
he and leslaw a paga both advisers to polands finance 
ministry are drafting that countrys first securities regulations 
since the 1930s they met with reporters in the offices of sec 
chairman richard c breeden 
we expect that in early fall well be ready with drafts of 
securities law which we will present to our parliament and of 
course nobody knows how long it will take in parliament because 
thats an advantage of democracy jedrzejczak chuckled 
the visitors said securities trading could resume in poland 
quickly if legislation creating a polish securities and exchange 
commission is passed 
but the pair conceded it wont be easy to win foreign investment 
we cannot declare that we just now are a trustworthy 
country said paga but they said there would be no problem 
finding capitalists in poland 
noting the thriving black market in foreign currency in 
communistdominated poland jedrzejczak said people are quite 
smart it wont be a problem there are hundreds of people trading 
commodities on the streets now 
meanwhile breeden announced the appointment of top officials 
from the new york stock exchange the chicago mercantile exchange 
and other industry professionals to an advisory panel on emerging 
markets in eastern europe 
in addition to outgoing chicago merc chairman leo melamed and 
nyse chairman john phelan who will be stepping down at the end of 
the year the panel includes 
joseph hardiman president of the national association of 
securities dealers a selfregulating organization that oversees 
the overthecounter stock market and matthew p fink senior vice 
president and general counsel of the investment company institute 
a mutal fund and investment company trade oranization 
also shaun f omalley chairman of the accounting firm price 
waterhouse and merrill lynch amp co chairman william a schreyer 
the panel which expects to hold its first meeting in midjune 
will recommend what action the sec and the financial industry can 
take to help create and organize securities markets in eastern 
europe and the soviet union 
it was the third visit to the sec for paga and jedrzejczak who 
said they hoped to create a securities regulating agency in the 
polish tradition and not just a carbon copy of the sec 
they have been studying not only us markets but those in 
canada spain italy france and other countries because we need 
to follow the international standard said paga 
he said the prewar warsaw stock exchange was comparable to 
other stock markets in the 1930s but necessary regulatory 
legislation was all but demolished during the stalinist period 
jedrzejczak said new growth in polish securities trading would 
rely on the speed of privatization which in turn would depend 
on political decisions at least partly but we expect within two 
years from now there will be about 100 companies which will be 
traded on the stock exchange

feuding family owners of two designer blue 
jeans companies settled a multimilliondollar dispute but hours 
later a row developed among the lawyers 
a lawyer for guess inc which settled a legal battle with 
jordache as jurors were deliberating wednesday jeopardized the 
deal by seeking a 177 million lien on the settlement another 
guess lawyer contended 
marshall grossman who represented guess during the trial filed 
the notice for a lien to make sure he would get his salary bonus 
said pierce odonnell who represented guess in the settlement 
negotiations 
its a very treacherous act to have a lawyer turn on his 
client said odonnell who described the guess clients as 
outraged 
a lien is a claim on another persons property as security for 
the payment of a debt 
grossman would not comment on whether a lien notice had been 
filed citing attorneyclient confidentiality but he asserted 
the settlement is in no jeopardy whatsoever 
the family feud involved four frenchborn marciano brothers 
maurice armand paul and georges who founded guess in 1981 and 
three israeliborn nakash brothers joe ralph and avi who own 
jordache and purchased a halfinterest in guess in 1983 
the partnership disintegrated in allegations of fraud and 
doubledealing which led to two separate trials to resolve the 
claims 
the marcianos contended the nakashes intended to steal for 
jordache the guess designs that were making a splash in the fashion 
world 
in ensuing years guess soared to the top of the lucrative 
designer jean market over the past four years guess profits have 
averaged 45 million a year 
the settlement filed in los angeles superior court rescinds the 
sale of guess stock by the marcianos to the nakashes the nakashes 
agreed to return the halfinterest in guess which they bought for 
just under 5 million 
the marcianos won an earlier court fight in which a jury 
determined the nakashes had defrauded the marcianos when they 
purchased the interest in the thenfledgling company 
the terms for division of some 106 million held in an escrow 
account were not revealed 
the agreement also included restraining orders forbidding either 
guess or jordache to spy on the other company through electronic 
surveillance telephone wiretaps or other means 
odonnell said the nakashes attorney howard weitzman was 
shocked and very concerned about the lien notice a call to 
weitzmans office after business hours wednesday was not answered 
before the lien was filed weitzman said he had been trying to 
settle the case for nearly a year along with about a dozen other 
related cases pending in civil and federal courts in los angeles

france today rejected a european community demand 
to lift a ban on imports of british beef and cattle saying it 
would await a report from veterinarians sent to assess the 
socalled mad cow disease 
british officials were infuriated when france imposed the 
temporary ban wednesday on the ground that the beef may be tainted 
by bovine spongiform encephalitis a nervous disorder 
britain accused france of using the disease as an excuse to 
protect its domestic market france is britains biggest market for 
beef and cattle 
they ought to lift that ban straightaway said francis maud 
british minister of state in the foreign and commonwealth office 
british beef is perfectly safe all the scientific evidence 
points in that direction this french ban is unjustified and 
clearly in breach of community law and as good europeans we find 
that intolerable 
the disease which so far has killed 13648 cows in britain 
eats holes in the brains of infected cattle leaving tissue spongy 
the british government says there is no indication the disease can 
be transmitted to humans nevertheless beef sales have declined 
sharply in britain 
the european community commission in a statement today said it 
regrets the action of the french authorities taken without 
prior consultation 
in the absence of convincing arguments for this action the 
commission calls upon france to revoke the ban immediately the 
statement said it said the ec has taken all necessary health 
precautions regarding the disease 
ec agricultural commissioner ray mcsharry in paris for the 
annual ministerial meeting of the organization for economic 
cooperation and development said there was absolutely no 
justification for frances action 
aides to french agriculture minister henri nallet said the ban 
would remain in effect pending the return by this weekend of french 
veterinarians sent to britain to investigate the disease 
the concern of the ministry nallets office said is to 
guarantee the health of french consumers and cattle 
the cause of the disease is not known because the symptoms are 
similar to scrapie a sheep disease it is assumed that the disease 
was transmitted through cattle feeds which use sheep offal as a 
protein supplement 
the british government has allocated 19 million this year for 
research into the disease which was identified in britain in 1986 
the outbreak has largely been confined there although a few cases 
have been confirmed in the irish republic

the belzberg family of canada has 
abandoned its bid to acquire armstrong world industries ending a 
feud that prompted the enactment of the nations toughest 
antitakeover law 
first city capital corp a belzberg entity said wednesday it 
had sold its 48 million shares in armstrong a flooringproducts 
and furnishings manufacturer with 25 billion in annual gross 
revenues 
armstrong purchased 37 million of the shares and its board had 
authorized the repurchase of up to 4 million shares said company 
spokesman john scheldrup he said the shares were bought at 3575 
per share 
the move comes about a month after the belzbergs failed to seat 
three of four nominees on the armstrong board and the state enacted 
legislation that requires corporate raiders to surrender shortterm 
profits from thwarted takeover bids 
first city spokeswoman dezanne philips acknowledged the 
stringent takeover law and the largely unsuccessful proxy fight 
played a role in the decision 
the antitakeover legislation was drafted last year after the 
belzbergs first disclosed an interest in acquiring the company its 
introduction triggered a nationwide debate between investor groups 
and state labor and business interests 
the belzbergs mounted an aggressive lobbying effort to defeat 
the bill in the pennsylvania legislature claiming it would protect 
ineffective management and strip stockholders of traditional 
rights but the bill was approved by wide margins 
in addition to garnishing profits in failed takeover bids the 
law also restricts the voting rights of raiders and preserves labor 
contracts when corporations change hands

with the return of bullmarket enthusiasm that 
has carried stock prices to new highs in the past few weeks wall 
street is setting its sights on a lofty target the 3000 level in 
the dow jones industrial average 
should the market keep rising the way it has all through may 
analysts point out that oncedistant objective could be reached in 
very short order 
in less than five weeks from april 27 through the close on 
wednesday the dow the oldest and best known measure of 
trends in stock prices surged up 23351 points or 88 percent 
from wednesdays record reading of 287856 it needed only a 
42 percent advance to reach 3000 and in todays early trading 
the dow edged even closer rising 498 to 288354 by 11 am 
as always when the dow approaches a roundnumber milestone many 
professional traders and money managers in the financial world are 
inclined to downplay its significance 
for all its renown the average comprises only a small sampling 
of 30 bigname stocks that do not necessarily mirror what is 
happening to the shares of hundreds of other substantial companies 
still analysts generally acknowledge that a dow reading of 
3000 could be widely read as a signal that the bull market of the 
1980s had survived a series of scandals the crash of 1987 and a 
recession in the securities business itself to persist into the 
1990s 
i think it is a big psychological target said robert 
stovall president of stovalltwentyfirst advisers inc 
a move to 3000 in the dow any time soon would come less than 3 
years after the average first broke 2000 in january 1987 that 
kind of advancing pace has few parallels in the history of the 
centuryold average 
it first touched 1000 in 1966 during some of the headiest days 
of a gogo era of enthusiasm for stocks that faltered badly in 
the bear markets of 196970 and 197374 
it took more than 16 years until early 1983 for the dow to 
break decisively above 1000 and start moving steadily higher 
but as impressive as its recent exploits may look they have 
left a good many veteran analysts unawed for one thing these 
observers note a tripling of the dow since the 60s still leaves 
it struggling to keep up with inflation over the same span 
there is plenty of skepticism as well about the prospective 
significance of a 3000 dow for the economy as a whole 
the doubts arise partly from the stock markets penchant during 
much of the 1980s and again more recently for staging its 
strongest advances during periods of sluggish economic growth 
whenever business activity has picked up momentum in recent 
years stock prices generally have bogged down amid fears of 
increasing inflationary pressures and higher interest rates 
true to form the latest market gains have come on evidence of 
slackening growth which has been accompanied by a dropoff in 
inflationary expectations and a decline in interest rates 
as long as stock traders think this way some analysts contend 
they are in danger of being caught napping should a recession hit 
s jay levy and david a levy economists in chappaqua ny 
argue that the markets reflect wishful thinking about a 
continuing expansion of the economy 
the weaknesses of the economy that were reported this month 
may be the prelude to or even the beginning of a recession the 
levys contend the chances of avoiding a downturn this year are 
only two in five 
but edward yardeni economist at the brokerage firm of 
prudentialbache securities maintains that overall growth can 
continue while rolling recessions run their course in 
individual sectors of the economy 
stocks also stand to benefit yardeni says from a longterm 
downtrend in interest rates and the profit gains american companies 
can reap in the changing political worlds of europe and asia 
his forecast for the dow jones industrial average 5000 by the 
end of 1993

grain and soybean futures opened mostly higher 
this morning on the chicago board of trade 
the market continues to be weather driven as the latest 
national weather service sixto10day forecast calls for continued 
wet conditions in the midwest said victor lespinasse of dean 
witter reynolds inc 
the strength of soybean futures reflects the continued inability 
of many midwestern farmers to plant their crops because of soggy 
fields 
corn futures opened lower but were staging a comeback largely 
due to the same factors that were helping soybeans 
the weather services outlook calls for abovenormal 
precipitation in illinois and most of the eastern corn producing 
region 
wheat was getting a boost from concerns the harvest of red 
winter wheat could be delayed by wet conditions 
in early trading wheat was 1 cent lower to 1 cent higher with 
the contract for delivery in july at 333 a bushel corn was a 
cent to 1 cents lower with july at 278 a bushel oats were 1 
cent to 1 cents lower with july at 141 a bushel soybeans were 
1 cents to 2 cents higher with july at 607 a bushel 
livestock and pork futures were mixed in early trading on the 
chicago mercantile exchange 
light movement of hogs from the farm to processors was giving a 
boost to hog futures and higher wholesale prices gave a lift to 
frozen pork belly futures 
cattle prices were pushed lower by expectations of an increase 
of fed cattle supplies through the spring and summer 
live cattle were 07 cent lower to 13 cent higher with june at 
74 cents a pound feeder cattle were 05 cent lower to 18 cent 
higher with august at 8375 cents a pound hogs were 30 cent lower

chrysler corp vice chairman gerald greenwalds 
resignation announced at a time when the automaker is scaling back 
and struggling to regain lost market share is troubling to the 
company and investors alike analysts say 
greenwald the apparent successor to chairman lee iacocca said 
wednesday he was resigning to head united air lines employees 
438 billion proposal to buy the carrier he became the third top 
chrysler executive to quit this month 
iacocca 65 whose contract expires at the end of 1991 said 
when greenwald was named vice chairman in november 1988 that the 
chairmanship was his to lose but greenwald 54 flew earlier this 
week to iacoccas villa in central italy to discuss his plans with 
his longtime boss a company spokesman said 
lee made a major effort to try and change his mind an 
unidentified company source told the detroit news but iacocca and 
greenwald returned wednesday to detroit to make the announcement 
it has to disturb investors that the person who has been 
designated as the next chairman of chrysler would leave chrysler 
just a few days after the chrysler treasurer announced his 
resignation said ronald a glantz senior vice president at dean 
witter reynolds inc in san francisco 
not only will investors be disturbed by the management 
succession they will wonder what these managers know about 
chrysler that we dont know glantz said 
greenwalds resignation effective immediately follows those of 
michael hammes who was vice president of international operations 
and chrysler treasurer and vice president fred zuckerman chrysler 
also has seen its market share slide and its earnings dive 
the automaker reported a 80 percent drop in earnings during the 
first quarter of this year it made 71 million during the period 
or 32 cents a share compared with 351 million or 150 a share 
in the first quarter of 1989 
its us market share for cars and light trucks fell from 141 
percent at the end of april 1989 to 124 percent at the end of 
april 1990 and an austerity program launched last october will 
slice 15 billion from chryslers 426 billion annual budget by 
1991 
greenwald vice chairman since november 1988 will become chief 
executive officer of the chicagobased united employees acquisition 
corp an entity formed by the airlines three major unions to 
handle the buyout efforts 
ual stock was up 475 a share to 15562 in midday trading on 
news of greenwalds move 
uniteds pilots union led an illfated 675 billion plan to 
acquire the airline last year the proposal collapsed after the 
union and its partners which included senior management and 
british airways plc were unable to get bank financing for the 
deal sparking a stock market panic 
after the acquisition greenwald 54 will become chairman and 
chief executive officer of ual corp and united airlines its chief 
subsidiary the employee group said in a statement 
glantz added that greenwald is putting himself in position to 
cash in on the buyout 
hes paid about 1 million a year at chrysler but his 
chrysler stock options are worthless glantz said in a 
leveraged buyout that works you can make tens of millions of 
dollars maybe even hundreds of millions of dollars 
chrysler spokesman steve harris said there has been no decison 
on who will replace greenwald but glantz said the logical 
successor is robert s miller jr 49 now chryslers chief 
financial officer 
united auto workers union vice president stan marshall who 
leads the unions chrysler department speculated that robert a 
lutz president of the automakers chrysler motors corp 
subsidiary also will have a shot at filling greenwalds shoes 
hes been the one out there pushing the cars while greenwald 
held back on putting cars on the market marshall said 
harris said the recent resignations were unrelated to each other 
or to the companys belt tightening 
this really shows the depth of chryslers management harris 
said from the companys highland park headquarters there are 
some very talented people here they are sought after 
hammes left may 17 to become an executive vice president for 
black amp decker corp and vice president of black amp deckers power 
tool group harris said zuckerman said he resigned effective this 
summer to look elsewhere for a position in corporate 
restructuring or other senior financial officer activities 
greenwald worked with iacocca at ford motor co and followed him 
to chrysler in 1979 he played major roles in securing federal 
government loans that saved chrysler from bankruptcy in 1979 and 
in negotiating the purchase of american motors corp in 1987 
i can understand jerrys interest in an opportunity like the 
one united air lines presents today iacocca said he is a 
major management talent and hell have a chance to show it 
greenwald said the difficult part about resigning from chrysler 
will be leaving iacocca and other chrysler executives 
looking back the most gratifying period for me were those 
uncertain years he said ive been offered an opportunity to 
lead another great company during a period of major transition and 
its an opportunity i cant turn down

ashland oil inc was ordered to pay 
103 million to four neighbors of its catlettsburg ky refinery 
who said emissions from the plant hurt their health and damaged 
their property 
residents of ceredo and kenova wva and catlettsburg ky 
sued in state court after finding a caustic white substance on 
their cars and homes the substance was not easily removed and 
damaged their property they alleged 
the verdict recognizes the magnitude of the problem that 
people have been living with for a number of years attorney dl 
hamilton said wednesday i hope ashland oil got the message 
the exact nature of the caustic substance was not established at 
the trial 
more than 270 kenovaarea residents have suits pending against 
ashland for a total of more than 840 million wednesdays verdict 
should force ashland oil to reevaluate whether to settle out of 
court hamilton said 
my answer to that is that were going to appeal this case 
said dan lacy an ashland oil spokesman 
the companys appeal to the state supreme court will target 
judge tod kaufmans decision to block former environmental 
protection agency administrator lee thomas from testifying lacy 
said 
thomas was to testify about air quality standards lacy said 
kaufman said thomas testimony would have been confusing to the 
jury and that thomas was not qualified as a technical expert on air 
quality standards 
the court also refused to allow testimony on the companys air 
monitors 
had we been able to bring that information to the jury we 
honestly believe the jurys verdict would be different lacy said 
ashland oil attorneys argued residents had no evidence of 
illness or property damage such as medical expenses or repair 
bills 
ashland oil kentuckys largest corporation had 1989 revenues 
of 846 billion

senior executives from mca inc the us 
entertainment giant conferred thursday with premier michel rocard 
about the proposed construction of a movieoriented theme park and 
studio complex near paris to compete with walt disney cos euro 
disneyland 
the mca delegation headed by president sidney j sheinberg is 
considering both paris and london as possible sites for the 12 
billion project trying to determine which location offers better 
financial opportunities 
rocard according to his office told the visitors he was 
amenable to the proposal provided that mca addressed environmental 
concerns and cooperated fully with the french tv and film industry 
mcas final decision is expected within the next few months and 
the complex is tentatively scheduled to be opened in 1993 
the proposed site in france is melunsenart a new suburb being 
developed about 20 miles southeast of paris 
the complex would include a golf course hotels with 5000 rooms 
a hightech industrial park oriented toward the audiovisual 
industry production studios and an amusement park 
mca which is based in universal city calif has projected 5 
million visitors to the park in its first year and estimates the 
complex would create 12000 jobs 
about 20 miles north of the site foundations are being laid for 
euro disneyland an even bigger project scheduled for opening in 
1992 disney executives anticipate 11 million visitors in the first 
year and have estimated the total cost of the undertaking at 76 
billion 
british officials have been trying to woo mca with a 1600acre 
site on the outskirts of london their hopes are based in part on 
the premise that the company might shy away from direct competition 
with euro disneyland 
there is evidence however that mca wont back away it has 
decided to compete head to head with disney world in orlando fla 
by opening universal studios florida nearby 
the times of london reported recently that several british 
officials travelled to hollywood to lobby on behalf of the london 
site

that called for more favorable planting weather 
heavy rains in recent weeks have delayed the planting of corn 
and a dry spell could allow farmers to catch up said william 
biedermann an analyst with allendale inc in chicago 
soybean futures were higher on conjecture that the amount of corn 
acreage given over to soybeans may not be as large as expected 
biedermann said because soybeans mature more quickly than corn 
farmers usually plant soybeans when corn planting is delayed into 
june 
soybeans also received a boost on speculation that a planned 
brazilian port strike would cause enough shipping delays to shift 
export business to the united states 
wheat futures opened weak then surged late in the trading 
session on news the peoples republic of china had bid for 600000 
metric tons of wheat under the export bonus program 
at the close wheat was 4 cents lower to 1 cents higher with the 
contract for delivery in july at 333 a bushel corn was 2 cents 
lower to a cent higher with july at 277 a bushel oats were 1 
cent lower to cent higher with july at 143 a bushel and 
soybeans were 1 cents to 2 cents higher with july at 606 a 
bushel

american demands that the european community slash 
its export subsidies to farmers would be politically impossible 
to meet a trade bloc official said thursday 
but other officials warned that the communitys refusal to budge 
was threatening the outcome of ambitious plans to overhaul the world 
trading system 
us treasury secretary nicholas brady said the fight over 
subsidies that broke out at the annual meeting of the organization 
for economic cooperation and development was a disagreement that 
was waiting to happen 
but brady told a breakfast meeting of reporters it is best 
that we face the differences in the free world openly and with some 
energy now rather than wait until the last minute 
at issue is an american demand that the 12nation european 
community do much more to slash its costly subsidies to farmers 
which the united states claims hinder trade the europeans so far 
have refused 
ray macsharry the communitys agriculture chief said the 
trading bloc could not eliminate its export subsidy program 
that is politically impossible and will not happen he said 
were best to get involved in serious negotiations about making 
progress for greater liberalization of trade 
he said eliminating the subsidies would mean higher farm prices 
in europe and unemployment for millions of farmers the community 
gives exporters help so more expensive european farm products can 
compete with lower prices on the world market 
the deadlock has stalled the uruguay round negotiations a 
fouryear effort to overhaul the world trading system 
australian foreign affairs minister gareth evans said the 
european position was simply not a tenable longterm position 
they will be putting at risk not just agriculture but the whole 
round of trade negotiations if they stick to a position as tight 
as that he said 
the talks involving some 100 nations are designed to reduce 
barriers to trade in 15 areas including agriculture and textiles 
the bargaining opened in 1986 and is due to end in december it 
is being held under the auspices of the general agreement on tariffs 
and trade a forum and agreement for promoting freer trade 
trade and finance officials of 24 industrialized nations ended 
the oecd meeting by agreeing to take urgent steps to reform 
agricultural policy as regards support and protection so as to 
permit greater liberalization of trade 
but their final statement reflected the differences between the 
united states and the community over how to do that 
the statement said some nations wanted the others to pledge to 
make changes in the areas of internal support barriers to market 
access and export subsidies us officials had pressed for that 
wording 
in addition to resisting elimination of export subsidies the 
common market has refused the us demands that it open its markets 
wider to foreign farm products and cut farm payments that encourage 
crop surpluses 
the ec has urged a more general approach such as finding a way 
to measure a countrys trade performance in agriculture and then 
work to reduce that level 
the united states and other countries have insisted the farm 
issue is crucial to a successful outcome of the overall trade talks 
in their final statement the ministers promised to make every 
effort to overcome the differences by a july 23 negotiating 
session in geneva by then the united states wants preliminary 
agreements or negotiating texts in all 15 areas under discussion 
oecd members are australia austria belgium britain canada 
denmark finland france greece iceland ireland italy japan 
luxembourg the netherlands new zealand norway portugal spain 
sweden switzerland turkey the united states and west germany

cable news network is reviving the movie theater 
newsreel but some film experts doubt the cinema cnn will be a hit 
among audiences who already have expressed disdain for advertising 
on the silver screen 
cnn is hoping that reviving the newsreel a relic from cinemas 
pretelevision golden age will help promote the roundtheclock 
cable tv network that is available to 544 million subscribers 
the twominute film segments called cnn reel news make 
their debut friday in a new york theater chain if successful during 
a 90day trial period cnn officials say they will expand the 
program nationwide 
this is a way to inform and to most importantly entertain 
and its another way of getting cnns image out said rick 
salcedo vice president of news promotion at turner broadcasting 
system inc which owns cnn 
ironically television hastened the demise of movie theater 
newsreels the most famous of them foxmovietone news ended 
production in 1963 when tvs comprehensive news coverage made the 
novelty of seeing faraway events on the big screen obsolete 
television was probably the major factor in the demise of 
newsreels said glenn smith who maintains the foxmovietone 
archives at the university of south carolina 
smith said he is skeptical about whether todays audiences want 
or need to see news stories at the movies my personal opinion is 
you better have a very novel approach to it he said 
cnns newsreels which will be shown before feature films and 
rotated biweekly will tend to the lighter side of the news salcedo 
said he figures audiences have plenty of opportunity to see the big 
stories before they get to the theater 
its got to be something that doesnt have such a short shelf 
life salcedo said its more of the lighter stuff more of the 
entertaining informative type of information as opposed to the hard 
news 
the newsreels include items plucked from cnns regular 
programming as well as stories that never made it to tv a sample 
newsreel shown to a reporter included 30second segments on elephant 
seals frozen smoke experiments an electronic movie ticket seller 
and oatmeal wrestling 
the opening and closing credits include vintage black and white 
images which turn into a color picture of a space shuttle those 
segments which were still in production thursday will prominently 
feature the cnn logo according to salcedo 
it borders on advertising and that could mean trouble saying 
moviegoers dont like commercials walt disney studios and warner 
bros have banned onscreen ads at theaters showing their films 
salcedo said the newsreels would not be shown before disney 
films but he was unsure about warner bros 
jack boozer an assistant professor of communications at georgia 
state university who specializes in movies said its difficult to 
predict how audiences will react to the cnn newsreels 
i dont think it will be resented as much as the advertising 
which is just blatant boozer said i dont think its a viable 
idea unless it is large picture type of stories straight news 
talking heads wont work 
tbs has sunk about 100000 into producing reel news but is 
not paying the 11theater city cinemas chain in new york to show it 
during the trial period salcedo said 
he said tbs will seek a corporate sponsor before going national 
with the project 
although turner owns a sixscreen movie theater in atlanta 
salcedo said it was thought that a more objective appraisal of the 
newsreels could be obtained in new york 
you get a much more critical audience up there he said if 
they start throwing things at the screen it might tell us 
something

the agriculture department has no immediate 
plans to expand a southern california quarantine ordered to combat a 
medfly outbreak a usda spokesman said thursday 
the mediterranean fruit fly attacks more than 200 varieties of 
fruits and vegetables and citrus is especially vulnerable with 
losses of 25 percent to 50 percent of production likely in cases of 
severe infestation 
we feel our quarantine procedure and the area that is 
quarantined are adequate at this point to prevent the spread of 
medflies said spokesman larry mark 
he said the decision was made wednesday after the national plant 
board advisory council meeting here recommended no change for at 
least 30 days 
florida agriculture commissioner doyle conner last week urged the 
department to order the entire state of california under quarantine 
to fight the medfly one of the worlds most destructive pests 
the worst outbreak was a decade ago in the area south of san 
francisco 
usda enlarged the quarantine area may 8 to include parts of los 
angeles orange san bernardino and riverside counties a medfly 
quarantine also is in effect for part of the miami springshialeah 
area of south florida

to entice buyers for their onebedroom boston condo kenneth and 
cheryl bell are prepared to offer just about anything from lowcost 
financing to the newly renovated kitchen sink 
in culver city calif bruce preston is a bit more relaxed he 
expects to sell his threebedroom stucco colonial about 20000 
below the asking price within a month but he laments if this was 
a year and a half ago it would have taken a week 
the bells and preston live on opposite coasts but are coping with 
a housing malaise thats sweeping much of the country a reflection 
of higher interest rates tougher mortgage lenders and troubled 
regional economies 
experts say its difficult to generalize about something as 
varied and vast as the american real estate market where one home 
sits unsold for months while another might get snapped up quickly 
nonetheless a random sampling of sellers nationwide suggests more 
sob stories and fewer successes 
there are a great many markets doing well and a significant 
number that are pretty flat unfortunately the flat markets are 
where most people live said john tuccillo chief economist for 
the national association of realtors a professional trade group of 
property brokers that tracks housing trends 
real estate hot spots this year include the pacific northwest and 
portions of the midwest and the south experts say the cooler 
spots which represent some good buying opportunites are largely in 
the northeast and southwest 
i call it democratization said robert van order chief 
economist for the federal home loan mortgage co a federally 
chartered company that buys mortgages the northeast had it good 
for several years now its slowing down the midwest and southwest 
are coming back i think the west will always be good 
even so the good markets like california arent immune to 
sluggishness preston a 30yearold social worker selling his 
threebedroom culver city house said he recently lowered the asking 
price about 2 percent to 299000 that would have been unheard of a 
year and a half ago he expects it to sell for around 290000 
the biggest losers though have been those who bought when 
prices were at their peak and are now trying to sell into softened 
demand some sellers particularly in the northeast have resorted 
to desperate gimmicks ranging from higher broker commissions to free 
trips to disney world 
others have turned to the auction block once a forum for 
bankrupt farmers and professional business liquidators jim gall 
president of auction co of america in miami said he expects 
auctions in singlefamily homes to quadruple this year to around 
100 million 
the bells of boston are good examples of eager sellers their 
first step was to make the price attractive 78000 for the condo 
they bought three years ago for 80000 even though they renovated 
the kitchen and bathroom 
while ads for the condo highlight those improvements they also 
promise owner will help a rarity just three years ago when 
prices were higher 
bell a 27yearold laborer said he and his wife were willing to 
aid potential buyers in obtaining financing or even loan the closing 
costs the bells need more space for a growing family 
feeling more pressured is andres deleon a 26yearold 
businessman relocating to venezuela deleon is hoping buyers will be 
attracted to the cutrate price on his twobedroom condo a few 
neighborhoods away from the bells hes asking 79000 about 20 
percent below what he paid four years ago 
underlying the real estate problem has been high mortgage rates 
they crept toward 11 percent in march after falling into the single 
digits earlier this year rates on conventional 30year mortgages 
now average between 1025 percent and 105 percent but some 
economists say they could edge up again soon 
the rates are whats killing me said george mojica a 
64yearold retired maintenance supervisor who wants to sell his 
baldwin ny house and move to florida once interest rates go 
down there will probably be more activity 
the runup in rates has caused singlefamily home sales and 
housing starts to fall to the lowest levels since the 1982 recession 
in april the last month for which data is available new home 
sales fell 16 percent the fifth straight monthly drop to a nearly 
7year low government data show the national association of 
realtors said april sales of existing homes fell 21 percent 
starts for houses and apartments fell 58 percent that month the 
third consecutive monthly decline to the lowest rate since october 
1982 for singlefamily homes alone the decline was 7 percent 
mortgage volume a barometer of housing industry health totaled 
390 billion in 1989 16 percent lower than four years earlier the 
mortgage bankers association of america estimates it will fall to 
380 billion this year 
a more informative picture of lending emerges in regional looks 
at mortgage activity which reflect the health of the local 
economies 
for instance stephen ashley president of silbey corp of 
rochester ny a mortgage lender in the troubled northeast said 
applications were off between 10 percent and 15 percent in the first 
four months of this year 
by contrast ronnie j wynn president of colonial mortgage co 
in montgomery ala said business is booming with volume during 
the same period up to 85 million from 25 million wynn said the 
gain reflects the companys decision to move into healthier regions 
such as atlanta and houston and out of depressed areas 
many lenders stress that even in areas where the housing market 
is sluggish slightly higher interest rates dont mean they arent 
willing to loan mortgage money 
the residential homebuyer still has plenty of credit 
availble ashley said its still within the realm of what we 
could determine to be affordable 
nonetheless homebuyers still face more restrictions than they 
did a few years ago 
for example most banks are asking for higher downpayments 
generally at least 10 percent of the price of a home theyre also 
abandoning some gimmicks once used to lure borrowers such as 
nodoc or lowdoc loans in which they approved some loans 
without verifying an applicants income or employment 
i think were basically back to basics a little bit more 
said ashley 
in addition lenders have been monitoring business conditions 
more closely wary of plunging into areas where job layoffs or 
cyclical industries such as automaking or defense work could affect 
a homeowners financial health 
now i think lenders are trying to be more predicting in terms 
of where the local economies are going and how the housing markets 
are doing said fred koons chairman of chase home mortgage corp 
in tampa fla they adjust credit to reflect those forecasts 
chase for instance is looking at home appraisals more 
carefully koons said youre reliance on appraisal is high 
particularly if markets are not inflationary he said

energy futures prices plunged thursday on the new york mercantile 
exchange following the release of figures showing a buildup in crude 
oil and gasoline stocks 
on other markets grains and soybeans were mostly higher 
precious metals futures were mixed and livestock and pork futures 
were mostly lower 
the release of the american petroleum institutes inventory 
figures wednesday showed an increase rather than the expected 
decrease in gasoline and crude oil stocks 
the api reported that gasoline inventories as of last friday 
increased 11 million barrels from the preceeding week to 2142 
million barrels 
the nations inventory of crude oil increased by 21 million 
barrels and distillates which includes heating oil by 737000 
barrels 
the build in crude is particularly ominous said nauman 
barakat an analyst with shearson lehman hutton inc in new york 
crude stocks are at eightyear record highs so youve got to 
give the benefit of a doubt on prices to the down side 
adding pressure to energy prices were api figures showing an 
increase of 492000 barrels a day in refinery runs and as 
refineries return to operation after seasonal maintenance work 
output is expected to continue climbing 
barakat said the consensus in the industry is that demand will be 
flat in coming weeks which will mean prices will continue to fall 
he also noted that there are rumblings that the saudi arabian 
government is growing irate with continued overproduction by members 
of opec barakat said the saudis may eventually overproduce 
themselves in retaliation 
west texas intermediate crude oil settled 2 cents to 68 cents 
lower with the contract for delivery in july at 1740 a barrel 
heating oil was 45 cent to 108 cents lower with june at 5007 
cents a gallon unleaded gasoline was 60 cent to 298 cents lower 
with june at 6389 cents a gallon 
grain and soybean futures closed mostly higher on the chicago 
board of trade as weather concerns continued to dominate trading 
activity 
corn futures were pushed lower as a result of selling by 
professional traders and funds and a national weather service 
sixto10day forecast of more favorable planting weather 
heavy rains in recent weeks have delayed the planting of corn 
and a dry spell could allow farmers to catch up said william 
biedermann an analyst with allendale inc in chicago 
soybean futures were higher on conjecture that the amount of corn 
acreage given over to soybeans may not be as large as expected 
biedermann said because soybeans mature more quickly than corn 
farmers usually plant soybeans when corn planting is delayed into 
june 
soybeans also received a boost on speculation that a planned 
brazilian port strike would cause enough shipping delays to shift 
export business to the united states 
wheat futures opened weak then surged late in the trading 
session on news the peoples republic of china had bid for 600000 
metric tons of wheat under the export bonus program 
wheat was 4 cents lower to 1 cents higher with july at 333 a 
bushel corn was 1 cents to 2 cents lower with july at 278 a 
bushel oats were 1 cent to 2 cents higher with july at 144 a 
bushel and soybeans were 1 cents to 3 cents higher with july at 
607 a bushel 
livestock and pork futures were mostly lower on the chicago 
mercantile exchange 
hog futures were pressured by lower cash prices while pork 
bellies were the limit down due to technical trading 
the weakness in pork futures spilled over into cattle which 
gained some support from active boxed beef sales 
live cattle were 30 cent lower to 18 cent higher with june at 
74 cents a pound feeder cattle were 15 cent lower to 08 cent 
higher with august at 8365 cents a pound live hogs were 55 cent 
lower to 130 cents higher with june at 6550 cents a pound frozen 
pork bellies were 45 cent to 2 cents lower with july at 6405 cents 
a pound 
precious metals futures were mixed in sluggish trading on the new 
york commodity exchange 
gold was 20 cents to 70 cents lower with june at 36430 a troy 
ounce silver was 18 cents to 27 cents higher with july at 5110 
a troy ounce

chrysler corp scrambled to realign 
its top management thursday and fill gaps created at a critical time 
by the resignation of vice chairman gerald greenwald and other 
executives 
responding to wednesdays surprise resignation of greenwald heir 
apparent to chairman lee a iacocca chrysler named robert s 
miller its executive vice president and chief financial officer as 
vice chairman 
greenwald 54 quit the nations no 3 automaker to lead a 454 
billion employee buyout of ual corp parent of united airlines 
miller 48 and chrysler motors president robert lutz had been 
considered likely successors to greenwald lutz 58 was given 
slightly expanded responsibilities 
greenwalds resignation was the latest in a series of toplevel 
depatures at chrysler which is struggling to halt the erosion of 
its market share and earnings in the face of a weak us auto market 
and stiff competition from foreign automakers 
michael hammes the companys international operations vice 
president quit to head black amp deckers tool division chrysler 
treasurer frederick zuckerman said he would leave the automaker this 
summer to pursue other interests 
also 62yearold bennett bidwell chairman of chrysler motors 
has cut his work load 
iacocca had said he would leave more of the daytoday operation 
to other executives but his recent remarks that he may remain as 
chairman beyond 1991 combined with the rash of toplevel 
departures have increased speculation that he might increase his 
role in the companys operations 
the talent drain on chryslers upper level management began after 
a similar depletion started late last year when chrysler adopted a 
15 billion costcutting program to trim whitecollar work force by 
about 2500 people 
the stock market probably views this as a further indication 
that the operating problems at chrysler are really severe and 
probably increases the potential for chrysler losing its 
independence in the future auto analyst john kirnan of kidder 
peabody amp co said thursday 
chrysler finished up 25 cents at 1562 on thursday 
chryslers us market share for cars and light trucks fell to 
124 percent at the end of april from 141 percent a year earlier 
the automakers profit dropped by nearly 80 percent in the first 
quarter of this year although analysts said the results would have 
been worse if not for a company austerity program 
chrysler is not in financial trouble said joe phillippi 
an auto industry analyst with shearson lehman hutton in new york 
theyve got plenty of cash clearly theyre struggling with 
sales volume even with modest profitability were looking at 
cash flows that are still excellent 
greenwald meeting with reporters thursday dismissed suggestions 
that chrysler was a likely takeover target 
i dont put much stock in a major partnership or a major 
merger greenwald said 
chrysler has close working relationships with the japanese 
automaker mitsubishi motors corp and the french automaker renault 
italys fiat spa and chrysler reportedly have been talking about a 
sizeable deal 
greenwald said thursday he began thinking seriously about leaving 
chrysler 10 days ago and finally decided to do so wednesday morning 
after spending a day and a half with iacocca 
greenwald who has been roundly supported by the united auto 
workers union repeatedly declined thursday to say whether he felt 
iacocca would step down then or seek a new contract with the 
automaker speculation that iacocca would be active after 1991 
whether he officially retires or not apparently didnt sit well 
with greenwald although he denied being frustrated 
i think he greenwald recognizes that lee is probably going to 
be around for an extended period of time phillippi said 
even if lee were to become chairman only and jerry were to 
become ceo hes still going to have the old boss looking over his 
shoulder phillippi said and that may have bothered him 
greenwald said the challenges of financing the ual buyout which 
would be the largest employee buyout of a us company if it 
succeeds were too good to ignore 
here i am having a second chance to go through a major 
industrial event in american history greenwald said 
greenwald was a major player in chryslers winning of loans and 
federal loan guarantees to pull the company from the brink of 
bankruptcy in the late 1970s and early 1980s

a pennsylvania state court ruling barring a phone 
company from installing devices that alert customers to the numbers 
of incoming calls could provide ammunition to those trying to block 
the service elsewhere 
the caller id service has been criticized as an invasion of 
privacy by foes but praised by supporters as a way to detect 
unwanted calls and speed the jobs of emergency workers 
pennsylvanias commonwealth court ruled wednesday that bell of 
pennsylvania may not offer the service on the grounds that it is an 
invasion of privacy and violates state laws on wiretapping and 
phonenumber tracing 
bell of pennsylvania said it might appeal to the state supreme 
court 
janlori goldman an attorney with the american civil liberties 
union said the decision changes the nature of the debate over 
caller id 
most groups with concerns about the service such as the aclu 
have said they will not oppose it if the phone companies provide a 
way for customers to block their numbers from appearing on caller id 
screens when they place calls 
but the pennsylvania court went beyond such concerns in finding 
that caller id as a concept violates state laws with or without the 
numberblocking devices 
ms goldman said the ruling by implication could mean caller id 
services are illegal in other states that have similar wiretap and 
numbertracing laws 
she said the aclu is pressing for congress to enact federal 
legislation regulating caller id services bills to do so are 
pending in the house and senate 
bell of pennsylvania does not plan to provide blocking devices 
for most customers including those with unlisted numbers such 
devices only would be provided to domestic violence shelters and law 
enforcement agencies 
the phone company argues that blocking devices would negate the 
usefulness of the service by allowing those who abuse the phone 
system such as obscene callers to elude detection 
rochelle dreyfuss a law professor at new york university and an 
expert on privacy law said the pennsylvania decision could be used 
to bolster lawsuits in other states seeking to block or modify 
caller id services 
its common for lawyers to argue that this is what other 
states have done with this issue she said 
edward martone executive director of the aclus new jersey 
chapter said the pennsylvania decision helps us with our 
arguments here 
the new jersey aclu opposed the caller id service that has been 
offered by new jersey bell since late 1988 both the new jersey and 
pennsylvania phone companies are part of philadelphiabased bell 
atlantic corp 
the aclu has no active case against the state or the phone 
company seeking to block the service but martone said it was 
considering several options to return the issue to public discussion 
the office of the new jersey public advocate which represents 
consumer interests before state bodies also opposed caller id in 
hearings before state regulatory agencies 
the office said it believed the service was a privacy invasion 
and that it could harm hotlines and similar services that offer 
anonymous advice said robin portnoi the assistant deputy public 
advocate 
new jersey bell which offers no blocking devices to any 
customer has addressed the concerns of law enforcement agencies 
and social service groups such as shelters by offering them outgoing 
phone lines only ms portnoi said 
shelters fear battered women would be afraid to call their 
spouses if it would lead to alerting the husbands to their location 
when a person called by a shelter or law enforcement agency tries 
to return the call by using the number that flashed on his caller id 
screen he either gets a recording saying the number does not accept 
incoming calls or is transferred to an answering service under 
several options provided by new jersey bell said spokesman peter 
ventimiglia 
however ms portnoi said the state public advocate has asked 
us in light of the pennsylvania decision to take another look at 
caller id in new jersey 
concern over privacy issues sparked california lawmakers to ban 
the service unless the phone company offers a blocking device new 
york regulators took a similar stance when they approved caller id 
on a trial basis in the rochester area 
caller id is already available or is about to be introduced in 
other states including maryland virginia tennessee and west 
virginia

energy futures prices slumped thursday as 
traders anticipating an oversupply of gasoline and crude oil sold 
down their holdings 
the june contract for wholesale unleaded gasoline plunged 298 
cents to 6389 cents a gallon on the new york mercantile exchange 
the july contract tumbled 200 cents and subsequent months also 
declined 
gasoline prices were slammed by an american petroleum institute 
report late wednesday that refineries had sharply increased their 
output of the fuel analysts said 
meanwhile the july contract for west texas intermediate the 
benchmark grade of us crude oil was down 68 cents to 1740 a 
42gallon barrel later months also settled lower 
peter beutel an analyst with at elders futures inc said 
traders were concerned that saudi arabia would raise its crude 
output 
the publication middle east economic survey reported monday that 
saudi officials were studying oil production by other countries and 
would decide whether to increase their own output 
the saudis are believed to be angry because their fellow members 
of the organization of petroleum exporting countries are not abiding 
by new production limits 
if the saudis raise their output it would worsen the oversupply 
of crude and knock prices lower 
home heating oil declined in sympathy with other futures prices 
thursday the june contract for heating oil fell 108 cents to 5007 
cents a gallon and later contract months also dropped 
meanwhile natural gas moved higher the july contract advanced 
to 1590 per 1000 cubic feet from 1585 late wednesday

employees seeking to buy ual corp for 454 
billion did well in landing chrysler corps gerald greenwald to 
head the effort but still need a top executive with airline 
industry experience analysts said thursday 
wall street quickly signaled its approval of greenwald who was 
instrumental in arranging the federal governments bailout of 
chrysler a decade ago ual stock surged 475 to 15562 a share on 
the new york stock exchange 
but the stock remained well below the 201 a share in cash and 
securities offered by the employeeled buyout group reflecting 
skepticism that the latest in the long line of attempts to acquire 
ual parent of united airlines would succeed 
the employees led by the air line pilots assocation the 
machinists union and the association of flight attendants still 
must arrange financing for the deal that hurdle caused the collapse 
of a 300 a share 675 billion offer made last year by a group led 
by the pilots union 
nevertheless greenwald is a known entity in bank circles 
said a new yorkbased airline analyst who spoke on condition of 
anonymity it will make them the buyout group much more 
credible 
greenwald vice chairman of chrysler since november 1988 and heir 
apparent to chairman lee iacocca said late wednesday he would 
become chief executive officer of united employees acquisition 
corp an entity formed by the airlines pilots flight attendants 
and machinists unions to handle the buyout efforts 
after a successful acquisition greenwald 54 would become 
chairman and chief executive officer of chicagobased ual and united 
airlines replacing stephen wolf 
at a thursday news conference in highland park mich greenwald 
said he began seriously considering joining the buyout effort 10 
days ago about five weeks after the employee group first contacted 
him 
the offer kept getting more tempting he said at one 
point i wasnt at all clear who was going to be running the 
company my mind changed from it being a problem to being an 
opportunity about 10 days ago 
greenwald said he first needed to arrange the takeover financing 
the ual board has given the buyout group until aug 9 to come up 
with the financing for the takeover with completion of the deal due 
about a month later 
at a press conference in new york later thursday greenwald tried 
to reassure potential lenders that the new ual would be run for 
profit and cash flow needed to pay off debt and grow 
the employees are going to be in the position of investor not 
management this company is going to be run like any other 
company he said plans for the company provide money to pay off 
loans as well as buy more planes to help the airline grow he said 
after examining the company greenwald said he became convinced 
financing will be provided based on uals financial health the 
unions he said have just begun visiting potential lenders after 
waiting to hire a chief executive 
greenwald conceded his lack of airline experience is a weakness 
but added that his work putting together the chrysler financing is a 
strength he said he hoped much of uals management would stay if 
the buyout is successful and said any replacements would come from 
the airline industry 
if financing is arranged greenwald will seek as his second in 
command someone from the airline industry 
while he greenwald has a good record on financial matters 
the airline industry is unique said robert joedicke an airline 
specialist for shearson lehman hutton inc in new york 
bankers also need the assurances that would come from a chief 
operating officer with a strong knowledge of the airline business 
joedicke said 
they the banks dont have the luxury to have someone to come 
in and undergo on the job training he said the key 
requirement is that there is someone there that understands how to 
run an airline 
greenwald played major roles in securing federal government loans 
that saved chrysler from bankruptcy in 1979 and in negotiating the 
automakers purchase of american motors corp in 1987 
a big obstacle to success at ual is continuing skepticism about 
the chances that the buyout will be completed 
in 1987 ual stock rose to more than 100 a share on a decision 
by the board of directors to sell assets and distribute the proceeds 
to shareholders the october 1987 stock market crash quickly 
followed and uals stock fell to about 60 a share 
last year a buyout offer from uniteds pilots and management 
sparked wild speculation in the stock which soared to 294 a share 
in september the deal collapsed a month later helping to trigger a 
oneday freefall on the new york stock exchange and sending uals 
stock plunging 
there is so much pain in peoples minds over the losses 
suffered in the past the analyst said many investors are 
staying away

federal securities regulators voted thursday to 
explore rules changes that could allow us investors to participate 
in tender offers by foreign companies 
the securities and exchange commission voted unanimously to seek 
public comment on the appropriateness of permitting selected foreign 
tender offers to proceed in this country under foreign rules and 
regulations 
such an exception to sec rules is still a long way off but the 
commission took the first step toward even considering it 
currently those buying and selling publiclyoffered securities 
in this country must comply with sec regulations which some 
foreign concerns find too expensive or too onerous 
consequently rather than cut in us holders of foreign stocks 
on tender offers for their securities overseas concerns have chosen 
to exclude them 
the sec will issue what they call a concept release seeking 
public opinion on the idea of allowing foreign rules to apply where 
the us securities holdings involved constitute a relatively small 
portion of the securities in the transaction 
among the things that have yet to be decided the definition of a 
relatively small portion
